Senator HANSON

 (
Queensland
) (
09:32
):

I introduced the Lands Acquisition (Public Purpose) Bill 2017 in response to the recent actions of the government in issuing declarations of intent to acquire land from Australian farmers in both the Rockhampton and Charters Towers regions of Queensland. The federal government's statement, as contained in correspondence to landholders, was that the land acquired would be owned by the Department of Defence and allow for expanded training exercises by the Australian Army, as well as facilitating an increase in use by the Singaporean army from 6,000 troops for periods of six weeks to 14,000 troops for up to 18 weeks. The Army had only sent out the correspondence in regard to these acquisitions following an inspection by the Singaporean army. The Singaporean army had stated that it wanted the land for its future training purposes, as indicated in the department's correspondence about the land in question. 


At public meetings held with the landowners by the Army, it was clearly stated that the primary purpose of the land acquisition was that the land was being acquired not for the purposes of the Australian Army but for the use and training of the Singaporean army. The government referred in their correspondence to the Australia-Singapore Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which included a general arrangement pursuant to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The SAFTA refers only to cooperation between the two countries in a number of areas, including the military as well as technology and agriculture cooperation areas of interest. It does not place an obligation on Australia or Singapore. 


The Army has a land area in the Shoalwater Bay training complex of approximately one million acres, yet the Australian Army stated this was not sufficient. There was no consideration of the interests held by the Australian landowners—where exactly was the 'public purpose' required by the legislation? I would just like to expand on this. The Australian Army has quite extensive land in the Shoalwater Bay area, and yet it was wanting to allow the Singaporean army to buy up more land around that area—prime agricultural land—from farmers. What has happened to the Australian land is that over the years they've said, 'We can't use this land.' Why? Because of the overgrowth, because of the number of trees on it. Over that period they have not been able to clear the land because of the environmental laws of the Queensland government. So, here we have the situation of, 'Oh, we can't use this land, so we'll just let it sit there, but we'll go and acquire some great agricultural land that is producing thousands of head of cattle,' which were being sent to market, providing jobs in abattoirs and in the ongoing businesses in the whole area. But they're ready to say, 'No, we just need to acquire some more land,' as if you can pick up prime agricultural land anywhere in Australia. It is not the case. That land is so valuable, and it's so necessary to keep it as that.


So, public purpose—the whole intent of this bill: where was the public purpose as required by the legislation? There was absolutely no public support for this acquisition, nor was there any purpose behind it that benefitted the Australian public. People I spoke to when I went up to Charters Towers—and we're talking about between 50 and 60 farming families looking down the barrel of a gun at losing their properties—they said no-one was listening to them. These are properties that have been handed down through several generations and that people had bought and worked extremely hard to improve. This is where they want to live, and naturally they want to hand their properties down to their children.


And this was all so that Singaporean army personnel could come out here and train for a few weeks a year. We're talking about more land than the size of Singapore itself, land that they are wanting to buy up. The Army had stated that the public would benefit from this acquisition. Well, I beg to differ. No benefit could be demonstrated, but significant detriment could clearly be demonstrated, not only to the landholders who were directly affected but to the entire regions of Rockhampton and Charters Towers. They were saying that the Singaporeans were going to come and increase tourism in the area. But the tourism was actually going to destroy a small country town called Marlborough. It's not a tourist area, but the businesses there would have been affected, because they would no longer have the trade from the farming families living there and going into town to use the post office or go to the local pub. The Singaporeans would be going to Townsville, buying up the accommodation there. They had plans as to where they wanted to go during their time off. The loss to Australia was approximately 800 acres of prime grazing country and over 90,000 head of cattle that would have been going to local abattoirs, with the inevitable closure and the loss of employment in both regions—as I said, the loss of over $90 million in cattle sales, and twice that figure after the processing of the cattle from sales by the abattoirs.


We have seen our state of Queensland go through dire straits with droughts, and farmers can't even keep the cattle on their property. Yet here we are taking another 90,000 to 100,000 head of cattle out of the marketplace, I heard. So, on top of the drought we're putting ourselves in the dire situation in which we won't even have enough cattle in Australia for our own needs, let alone for export. Yet the government—or anyone—had no concerns about the impact this would have on Australia. At the briefings to the affected landholders, the Army representative stated that the local community would be providing food, hospitality and transport, to name a few. However, it was then found that the Singapore government had already sought expressions of interest from offshore companies for the transportation of food and ordnances into the area, supplied directly from Singapore—not from one Australian company. We were told that the Singaporeans were going to bring $2.5 billion into the country, and we were going to make so much money out of this and it was going to be great for the country. No, it wasn't. It was the worst deal that was going to happen. And, as I said, they had lined up Australian shipping companies to bring in their food and ordnance from overseas. This was not a good deal for us.


The government stated it was supporting rural communities, but here it was destroying two communities, offering no compensation to businesses other than the landowners, who didn't want to sell. Only a couple of people sold, because they were issued enormous amounts of money for their properties—the hope being that if one fell over then the others would. But the majority of farmers that I spoke to didn't want to sell their properties. They were being forced into it. Additionally, in the Charters Towers region, Infrastructure Australia and the Prime Minister of Australia had listed the Hells Gate Dam project as a high-priority project, which the Prime Minister did—it was in his election promises, and in the first meeting I had with him I spoke about going ahead with Hells Gate Dam. But the very land that could benefit from the dam was the very land the army had stated it was interested in acquiring. So what is going to happen? Are we going to build the Hells Gate Dam and then just hand the property over to the Singaporean army? It doesn't make sense to me.


When I raised the issue at a briefing, the army representative stated he was unaware of this priority infrastructure, as did the department's representative. So, was the right hand talking to the left hand, or does no-one know what the hell is going on? Yet the farmers up there were so distraught because they didn't know what was happening with them. It was a clear case of a compulsory acquisition not having a direct public purpose, as required by the act, but instead appearing to benefit a third party. So I ask the question: where was the public purpose?


The Australian Army only sent out correspondence in regard to this acquisition following an inspection by the Singapore Army. Its statement specified that it wanted the land, as indicated in the correspondence, as 'land of interest'. So it's up to the Singapore Army. They went out and said, 'Mate, this is what we want.' The term 'public purpose' is more than the vague legal definition of the act referring, as it does, to those legislative areas for which the parliament has power to make laws.


The key element in the land acquisition proposal by the Australian Defence Force was the definition of 'public purpose'. An information guide published by the Department of Finance and Deregulation in May 2011, titled The Commonwealth and You: Compulsory Acquisition of Land, states:


The Minister issues a document to affected landowners, which states that the Minister is considering the acquisition by the Commonwealth land for a public purpose. This document is a pre-acquisition declaration.


It tells you which Commonwealth authority wants to acquire the land;


It describes the land fully;


It states that the Minister thinks the land appears to be suitable for a public purpose;


It states the public purpose the land has been chosen for; and


It explains why the Minister considers the land suitable for the intended use.


But there is no clarity on the meaning of the term 'public purpose'.


In general Australians understand that, because the country has grown, we need infrastructure. They may not like it, but they understand if their land has to be acquired for maybe putting in a dam or maybe for roadworks, a motorway, a hospital or for some other reason that is of a general benefit to the public. They don't like it, but they will actually accept it if they're paid the right compensation for it. But I understand, and this is why the farming families have my total support, that when it came to this they were going to lose their properties—for what? So that Singaporeans can come out here for six weeks or 18 weeks a year and train, when we have so much land in Australia and when there are other training areas? They should have been going to Western Australia or even up to the Northern Territory, but, no, they wanted prime agricultural land in Australia and their hands were tied. They were having meetings with the Defence Force. They were having meetings with other people. No-one was listening to them. It was well attended by people in the area at public meetings.


The second reading speech on the introduction of the Land Acquisition Act 1989 adds little to the meaning of the words other than referring to section 31 of the act. However, the following sentence is relevant as it gives the tenor of the purpose of the words within the meaning of the act:


This Government is concerned by the need to strike a balance between the rights of private property on the one hand and the legitimate needs of society for land for public purposes on the other.


This sentence within the second reading speech clearly delineates that the acquisition is for the benefit of society. There was no substantive debate on what the phrase 'public purpose' meant. The reason why one has to revert to external explanations is due to the vagueness of the definition within section 6 of the act, which states as follows:


… public purpose means a purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws and includes, in relation to land in a Territory, any purpose in relation to the Territory.


In judgements on which the issue has been raised, the acquisition must be for the primary benefit of the community and Australia generally. Well, that certainly wasn't the case when it came to destroying our prime agricultural farming land, displacing Australians for the Singaporean army to train out here. I ask the question: What deals were done?


We cannot allow this to happen. I feel for the Australian people. I know what it's like to work hard to own your own land, to love the land that you're on and then to have someone come and say, 'Oh, no, you've got to give it up because we want Singaporeans to train here with no benefit to this country whatsoever.' This is especially so when, as I stated, there is other land they could train on in this country. It's about time that members in this place and the other place started listening to the Australian people and their pain and what they're going through, not listening to the bureaucrats and those others that have no idea. It is the grassroots Australians that are being forgotten.


There has been very little case law on the meaning of the words 'public purpose', particularly in the context of like cases of acquisition for the primary purpose of land for the training of a foreign army. Irrespective of the wide ambit of the definition of the words 'public purpose' within the Land Acquisitions Act of 1989, it is evident from case law that such an acquisition must be shown to actually be for the benefit of the public. The bill, which I seek the support of all parties for, clarifies the meaning of those important words 'public purpose'. It is important for all Australians that they know their land and their heritage will never be compulsorily acquired for the benefit of an unrelated third party and, as far as I'm concerned, especially for a foreign third party.


Before any declaration is made by any department to acquire an interest in land, the bill will require that department to demonstrate the purpose of using that interest or for its need for that interest to provide services. The acquiring authority must show that the need will be for the direct benefit of the Australian public or for the provision to the Australian public of necessary services.


The bill does not alter the intent of the original act. It clarifies the meaning and intent of the act so that the Australian public will never again be subject to months of upset and costs in trying to protect their interest for the ongoing benefit of their families. I hope both sides of this chamber and the minor political parties clearly look at what I'm putting forward here if they truly want to represent the people of Australia. If they saw the faces of these farming families and what's going to happen to them, they would understand. They could be our sons, our daughters, our brothers, our aunts, our cousins—our families. These people are clearly looking to us to stand up and fight and represent them. It is not up to the bureaucrats to make these decisions. It is not up to these foreign interests who say, 'We want this,' or 'We want that.' It's up to us to make the right decisions on behalf of the people who are relying on us to fight for them and stand up for their rights.


As I said to you earlier, I've got no problems with acquiring land for the right reasons, because this country is growing rapidly. But when we are asking people to give up the land that they love, people who have seen their families fight in the past for their land and for freedom for their way of life in this country, and we are prepared to allow it to be sold to a foreign power—to the Singaporean army, so that they can do their training—that's not good enough, as far as I'm concerned.


All I'm asking for in this bill is that if anyone's going to acquire land then we should make sure it is in the best interests of the Australian people, not of a foreign power. Give the Australian people some stability so they know that the decisions being made are right for them and for future generations. 


This bill overcomes the vagueness of the existing definition but gives clarity to the meaning of the term 'public purpose' without the need for future litigation. The bill does not apply to acquisitions by consent. As I've said and will say again, because One Nation has been fighting for this matter—and I know there were some on the government side who disagreed with the compulsory acquisition of the land for the Singaporean army, and I do appreciate their support on this— (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Lands Acquisition Amendment (Public Purpose) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-09-14,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (09:52):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Lands Acquisition Amendment (Public Purpose) Bill 2017 presented by Senator Hanson. I must say, I have empathy around the arguments made by Senator Hanson with respect to the processes for the compulsory acquisition of land, particularly where those acquisitions affect not just the land of an individual but, in many cases, our constituents in provincial, rural, remote Australia—describe it as you will—for whom this land also happen to be the foundation asset of their businesses, their livelihood.


We've all known of circumstances in which a compulsory acquisition of land has occurred in metropolitan areas for the building of highways, for the development of public utilities generally, for rail lines and for port expansions. An equal degree of anxiety exists amongst the owners of that land, as may be the case particularly with the cited example of the acquisition of land in Central and north Central Queensland. But there is a distinct difference, which I think Senator Hanson has touched on, and that is that these acquisitions can impact on land that is also the primary source of the livelihood of the people who operate that land. In this case it was almost exclusively in areas that were involved in beef production. Being a beef producer myself, I understand the conflict that would confront many of the landowners in this particular case. Unlike with other businesses, the business plans that are developed for many properties have a long intention. It can be a plan to develop your property that might take you 10 to 20 years. In the course of that, there are various stages where you are developing your asset for the purposes of your livelihood, where in effect you are partially through developing the land. At that stage, that may impact negatively on the value of the property as opposed to positively, and Senator Williams would be well aware of the things I'm referring to. You may have purchased a property because it appealed to you, in that it may have had rundown assets and facilities, so you've set about to develop it. In many cases this is the life's work of people. When they come onto a property they may have a 10-year plan to fence it and, in the case of cattle, to replace cattle yards and cattle handling facilities; to improve the waters; and to improve the pasture, which could involve land clearing and pasture production. If you're at the wrong stage in the development phases of your asset, it can have less appeal, might I say, in the marketplace, for others who might not have the same strong will to develop the property. 


But it is about connection to the land. Many of the people who are in the grazing and pastoral communities are multigenerational. Many of these properties have been in the hands of their parents or in some other form of family partnership. And so there is an enormous attachment. Their life's work is there, on that land. They may well be in an age bracket or in circumstances that prevent them from starting again. This might not be something that is understood by many in this place, but I can tell you from personal experience that, when you're on the land, if you've undertaken a significant campaign to improve pasture, fence it, put in proper water facilities, reticulating water through a particular area—these are big expansive properties; the greater Canberra city would be the horse paddock. People have put decades into these properties. 


I was recently with one of these graziers in Casino, not more than a month ago, and I reminded this pastoralist that we had known each other 35 years ago, when he was a miner in a mining community in Central Queensland and when I was the local detective. He informed me—and I knew it at that time—that he had bought a property in the Marlborough district and was affected by this. He was one of the main protagonists against these acquisitions. He filled me in on the fact that he had been 35 years developing this property, and it was not yet where he wanted it to be. People don't quite understand that, for example, when your cattle become acclimatised to a particular area, if there is massive disruption in their lives—if they're taken to other pasture types, if they're moved, particularly in the coastal areas, to more marginal country—the value of those cattle can be significantly impacted upon.




Senator Williams:
  They will lose weight. 




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  They will lose weight, as they precondition them. Sometimes it's actually only their progeny that become acclimatised to the country and perform better. So I do understand this nexus between the people and the land, particularly in rural areas. The genesis of this for Senator Hanson was obviously the issues around Central Queensland and North Queensland. I've got to say—and I'll probably get a call from the headmaster after this—that this was not well managed. Despite the pleas that there had been public consultation and engagement with the communities that were impacted by this, that wasn't 100 per cent correct in all of the cases. 


I made the point at the time that, had our government engaged with some of us representatives of government who have an affinity with the people in these regions, we might have made more progress or been able to establish exactly where we were with these communities before this all fell to pieces. Senator Hanson, I understand completely the spirit of the proposal being made here with the amendments in this legislation, but I'm inclined to think—using this as a case study—that we can make all the rules we like around this but, unless culturally the people in the bureaucracy, and in this case the Department of Defence, approach this in a more compassionate manner, we're going to end up with the same set of circumstances again and again, notwithstanding what rules, regulations or framework of operation we put in place.


I think that this was, in large part, a poor effort at the front end of engagement with these communities in these particular cases. I know that Senator Hanson played a very active role, as did a number of us. Fortunately on this occasion the Deputy Prime Minister took an interest in it. Had he been commissioned to take an interest in it at a date sooner than was the case, we might have had some resolution at an earlier time. But the Deputy Prime Minister did visit the area, on 3 February, and had meetings with local people who were affected and, indeed, other stakeholders in the community, not just those who might have been the subject of the acquisition. It is a matter of record that, the following day, the government made the commitment that no-one would be forced to sell their land against their will.


There was a division of thought in the area. There were some landowners who were willing to part with their land, on just terms—if I can make reference to my favourite movie, The Castle. In fact, there were landowners who engaged contractually with the government and did sell their land. So we had the willing sellers. But then equally we had—and I suspect there were more of them—the people that I have mentioned here in this contribution today, the people who had put a lifetime of blood, sweat and tears into their land, who were at some stage within a development program for their property and for whom an acquisition at that time would not have realised the great potential that their property might have had. They might have been wanting to upgrade their circumstances, perhaps because of retirement, and, given some more time, they might have had their land more adequately valued.


A great example of that—I touched on this earlier—is that you might purchase a large area of land that requires 200 kilometres of fencing to be done. No matter how energetic you are, that will take you a long period of time. It will have a serious investment impact from a money quantum point of view. If you haven't started that program or you're early into that program but it is not completed, and your property is valued, it won't matter what value is put on it; only one in 100 buyers will show interest in it. If the program has been finished and all the facilities are upgraded and in a functioning form, you will find that 90 per cent of potential buyers capable of buying that property will be engaged. These are serious challenges. I say to Senator Hanson, we talked about this and explored where there may have been other communities where these facilities could have gone, but I suspect, not knowing, that if the process were not managed properly we would get resistance in those other areas as well. 


Central Queensland, and particularly the Shoalwater area, has been devoted to defence activities, but I want to make a point, Senator Hanson: the intent of these acquisitions was to try and get some land where particular operations could occur. This was to do with visibility and engagement. Right next-door to the areas to be acquired, through the barbed wire fence, there were massive tracts of land owned by the defence department—hundreds and hundreds of thousands of acres. But they couldn't clear the land, to make it look like the land through the fence, because of impacts on the environment. It was a most ridiculous situation. We wouldn't even have had to confront these challenges with this community. It will be a long time before society realises just what impact the Greens and their policies, with the support of their coalition partners, Labor, have had in our rural communities. But one day, when people are sitting naked and hungry—




Senator Siewert:
  You're right! It will take you a long time—a long time to fix your impacts on the environment.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I can hardly hear myself think, Chair—please provide me with some protection from that shrill noise!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Interjections are disorderly. Please continue, Senator O'Sullivan.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Here sit our colleagues in their cotton and their wool, with their leather shoes, sitting on a leather chair, with a timber desk, yet they would resist at every opportunity the ability of people in rural Australia to produce those commodities. As I have said before, Senator Hanson, my friends over here in this little corner have something you and I haven't got.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, you are directing your comments to the chair, of course? 




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
   Yes, I am. They have these fairies, Mr Acting Deputy President, with magic knitting needles and as soon as these knitting needles touch they generate all the energy you need for your house and out the end of them, just as we see with spiders and beautiful silk, come cotton and leather and wool—




Senator Dastyari:
  That sounds awesome!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  It is. If Senator Dastyari were to join the Greens—and I believe membership, depending on which cult part of the Greens you go to, is not very expensive; if you're a bit short, Sam, I'll throw a couple of bob your way.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, will you please refer to senators by their correct title.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  My apologies—it was a lapse and I apologise for it, Mr Acting Deputy President. In any event, that was one of the other challenges that occurred up in the Shoalwater Bay area. We had the land. When you can't confront those challenges, when there are other commonsense, practical solutions to these things, the government of the day—it won't matter who is on the leather, it won't matter who's in government, whether it is colleagues on the other side in coalition with the Greens—has to acquire land to broaden highways and byways and to run railways. We are about to embark on that massive generational signature project, Inland Rail—brought on, might I say, very proudly by members of the National Party in coalition with their colleagues; a transformational project that of course has been on the books for so many years but is now being delivered by this government. We will confront these same challenges again on land acquisition. 


In closing, my contribution would be that I don't see any problem with calling for a review, and I do not mean some inquiry—I just mean the government of the day has to be involved in these matters. Our government should look carefully at how we go about it. Public engagement, as pointed out by Senator Hanson, is absolutely essential, and, if done properly—these are clever people—they will understand. These are dedicated Australians who understand that, from time to time, there is a need to acquire land as we expand the facilities and infrastructure of our nation, as with Defence's relations with another country. By sitting with them, speaking rationally and hearing what they have to say, we can, on occasion, dismantle some of the concerns that they have and some of the pressures that these things bring into their lives. If they are willing to transition from their land to some other point and if the transactions happen on just terms, as we have heard both in The Castle and in the reading of the Constitution, I don't think we'll be confronted as frequently with the circumstances we found ourselves in around Shoalwater Bay in Central Queensland.


I do support the development of the defence training industry on any terms up in that part of the world. It is a big industry. It employs a lot of people, and billions of dollars are invested in Central Queensland. So there are stakeholders in decisions like this beyond the landowners in Shoalwater Bay, even though, in my view, they are the most important in the consultation process. There are businesses in Townsville, Charters Towers and Rockhampton that rely significantly on the activities around defence training in particular in that part of the world. Given that the Greens and the opposition are determined to shut down the black coal industry in that region of my home state, we need to continue to look at development and investment that will offset and mitigate the impacts of their poor public policy. I agree with the spirit of the amendment. I don't think it's necessary. I think a review of how we approach these things culturally is more important. (Time expired)

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:12):  I rise to speak on the Lands Acquisition Amendment (Public Purpose) Bill 2017, which has been presented to the Senate by Pauline Hanson's One Nation. As Senator O'Sullivan just said, we understand why this bill has been put forward for consideration by the party. It's a reaction to the events that occurred earlier this year surrounding the Department of Defence's flawed process to acquire land to enable the expansion of two training areas in North Queensland—the Townsville Field Training Area and the Shoalwater Bay Training Area.


The department wrote letters to property owners outlining Defence's needs for land and how acquisition of their property, properly compensated, would assist in meeting these needs. The community was of course outraged, as you would understand, Acting Deputy President Williams. Prime agricultural land was being eyed off for military training use, forcing families to leave their land, which, in some cases, had been held by them for generations. After enough pressure from Labor, the Minister for Defence finally stepped in. I think it would be worthwhile commenting on the role of shadow minister Fitzgibbon in this area, because he did some terrific work on behalf of property owners in Queensland to bring the issue into the public arena and put that pressure on the Minister for Defence.


Finally, a statement was made that there would be no compulsory acquisition of properties surrounding the existing training areas. When asked about Defence's processes for land acquisition at estimates in February, the minister's response to a question on notice was:


Compulsory land acquisition was considered as one option during initial planning. It was always the preference to purchase land from willing sellers off the open market, and as announced in February 2017 land will only be purchased from willing sellers.


That was question No. 60 from April 2017. The minister eventually made a decision in this case regarding land acquisition to only acquire land from willing sellers. That avoids the need to consider compulsory acquisition and the public purpose test. It is not clear how the proposed changes to the definition of 'public purpose' would assist in these types of considerations where ministers are required to consider the overall public benefit and purpose in every decision they make.


Senator Hanson, while the defence minister certainly made a mess of the acquisition of land, we do not believe at this stage that the implications of this bill have been thought through. It was introduced yesterday afternoon, and we understand there has not been consultation at this stage with the Australian Government Solicitor and, of course, with a broad range of stakeholders and a broad section of landholders across this country. We are of the belief at this point that those are the sorts of things that ought to occur before a full consideration of this legislation.


There are significant judicial precedents regarding land acquisition. The act that Senator Hanson is seeking to amend is almost 30 years old, and there are a number of precedents of Commonwealth over-reach that have been successfully challenged in the courts. Labor believe we need to be conscious of those precedents which allow the Commonwealth to acquire land where it is necessary and to provide appropriate compensation. This bill would complicate all of those former precedents and, for that reason, at this stage, the Labor Party cannot support this legislation.


Question negatived.

Senator HANSON

 (
Queensland
) (
09:32
):

I introduced the Lands Acquisition (Public Purpose) Bill 2017 in response to the recent actions of the government in issuing declarations of intent to acquire land from Australian farmers in both the Rockhampton and Charters Towers regions of Queensland. The federal government's statement, as contained in correspondence to landholders, was that the land acquired would be owned by the Department of Defence and allow for expanded training exercises by the Australian Army, as well as facilitating an increase in use by the Singaporean army from 6,000 troops for periods of six weeks to 14,000 troops for up to 18 weeks. The Army had only sent out the correspondence in regard to these acquisitions following an inspection by the Singaporean army. The Singaporean army had stated that it wanted the land for its future training purposes, as indicated in the department's correspondence about the land in question. 


At public meetings held with the landowners by the Army, it was clearly stated that the primary purpose of the land acquisition was that the land was being acquired not for the purposes of the Australian Army but for the use and training of the Singaporean army. The government referred in their correspondence to the Australia-Singapore Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which included a general arrangement pursuant to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The SAFTA refers only to cooperation between the two countries in a number of areas, including the military as well as technology and agriculture cooperation areas of interest. It does not place an obligation on Australia or Singapore. 


The Army has a land area in the Shoalwater Bay training complex of approximately one million acres, yet the Australian Army stated this was not sufficient. There was no consideration of the interests held by the Australian landowners—where exactly was the 'public purpose' required by the legislation? I would just like to expand on this. The Australian Army has quite extensive land in the Shoalwater Bay area, and yet it was wanting to allow the Singaporean army to buy up more land around that area—prime agricultural land—from farmers. What has happened to the Australian land is that over the years they've said, 'We can't use this land.' Why? Because of the overgrowth, because of the number of trees on it. Over that period they have not been able to clear the land because of the environmental laws of the Queensland government. So, here we have the situation of, 'Oh, we can't use this land, so we'll just let it sit there, but we'll go and acquire some great agricultural land that is producing thousands of head of cattle,' which were being sent to market, providing jobs in abattoirs and in the ongoing businesses in the whole area. But they're ready to say, 'No, we just need to acquire some more land,' as if you can pick up prime agricultural land anywhere in Australia. It is not the case. That land is so valuable, and it's so necessary to keep it as that.


So, public purpose—the whole intent of this bill: where was the public purpose as required by the legislation? There was absolutely no public support for this acquisition, nor was there any purpose behind it that benefitted the Australian public. People I spoke to when I went up to Charters Towers—and we're talking about between 50 and 60 farming families looking down the barrel of a gun at losing their properties—they said no-one was listening to them. These are properties that have been handed down through several generations and that people had bought and worked extremely hard to improve. This is where they want to live, and naturally they want to hand their properties down to their children.


And this was all so that Singaporean army personnel could come out here and train for a few weeks a year. We're talking about more land than the size of Singapore itself, land that they are wanting to buy up. The Army had stated that the public would benefit from this acquisition. Well, I beg to differ. No benefit could be demonstrated, but significant detriment could clearly be demonstrated, not only to the landholders who were directly affected but to the entire regions of Rockhampton and Charters Towers. They were saying that the Singaporeans were going to come and increase tourism in the area. But the tourism was actually going to destroy a small country town called Marlborough. It's not a tourist area, but the businesses there would have been affected, because they would no longer have the trade from the farming families living there and going into town to use the post office or go to the local pub. The Singaporeans would be going to Townsville, buying up the accommodation there. They had plans as to where they wanted to go during their time off. The loss to Australia was approximately 800 acres of prime grazing country and over 90,000 head of cattle that would have been going to local abattoirs, with the inevitable closure and the loss of employment in both regions—as I said, the loss of over $90 million in cattle sales, and twice that figure after the processing of the cattle from sales by the abattoirs.


We have seen our state of Queensland go through dire straits with droughts, and farmers can't even keep the cattle on their property. Yet here we are taking another 90,000 to 100,000 head of cattle out of the marketplace, I heard. So, on top of the drought we're putting ourselves in the dire situation in which we won't even have enough cattle in Australia for our own needs, let alone for export. Yet the government—or anyone—had no concerns about the impact this would have on Australia. At the briefings to the affected landholders, the Army representative stated that the local community would be providing food, hospitality and transport, to name a few. However, it was then found that the Singapore government had already sought expressions of interest from offshore companies for the transportation of food and ordnances into the area, supplied directly from Singapore—not from one Australian company. We were told that the Singaporeans were going to bring $2.5 billion into the country, and we were going to make so much money out of this and it was going to be great for the country. No, it wasn't. It was the worst deal that was going to happen. And, as I said, they had lined up Australian shipping companies to bring in their food and ordnance from overseas. This was not a good deal for us.


The government stated it was supporting rural communities, but here it was destroying two communities, offering no compensation to businesses other than the landowners, who didn't want to sell. Only a couple of people sold, because they were issued enormous amounts of money for their properties—the hope being that if one fell over then the others would. But the majority of farmers that I spoke to didn't want to sell their properties. They were being forced into it. Additionally, in the Charters Towers region, Infrastructure Australia and the Prime Minister of Australia had listed the Hells Gate Dam project as a high-priority project, which the Prime Minister did—it was in his election promises, and in the first meeting I had with him I spoke about going ahead with Hells Gate Dam. But the very land that could benefit from the dam was the very land the army had stated it was interested in acquiring. So what is going to happen? Are we going to build the Hells Gate Dam and then just hand the property over to the Singaporean army? It doesn't make sense to me.


When I raised the issue at a briefing, the army representative stated he was unaware of this priority infrastructure, as did the department's representative. So, was the right hand talking to the left hand, or does no-one know what the hell is going on? Yet the farmers up there were so distraught because they didn't know what was happening with them. It was a clear case of a compulsory acquisition not having a direct public purpose, as required by the act, but instead appearing to benefit a third party. So I ask the question: where was the public purpose?


The Australian Army only sent out correspondence in regard to this acquisition following an inspection by the Singapore Army. Its statement specified that it wanted the land, as indicated in the correspondence, as 'land of interest'. So it's up to the Singapore Army. They went out and said, 'Mate, this is what we want.' The term 'public purpose' is more than the vague legal definition of the act referring, as it does, to those legislative areas for which the parliament has power to make laws.


The key element in the land acquisition proposal by the Australian Defence Force was the definition of 'public purpose'. An information guide published by the Department of Finance and Deregulation in May 2011, titled The Commonwealth and You: Compulsory Acquisition of Land, states:


The Minister issues a document to affected landowners, which states that the Minister is considering the acquisition by the Commonwealth land for a public purpose. This document is a pre-acquisition declaration.


It tells you which Commonwealth authority wants to acquire the land;


It describes the land fully;


It states that the Minister thinks the land appears to be suitable for a public purpose;


It states the public purpose the land has been chosen for; and


It explains why the Minister considers the land suitable for the intended use.


But there is no clarity on the meaning of the term 'public purpose'.


In general Australians understand that, because the country has grown, we need infrastructure. They may not like it, but they understand if their land has to be acquired for maybe putting in a dam or maybe for roadworks, a motorway, a hospital or for some other reason that is of a general benefit to the public. They don't like it, but they will actually accept it if they're paid the right compensation for it. But I understand, and this is why the farming families have my total support, that when it came to this they were going to lose their properties—for what? So that Singaporeans can come out here for six weeks or 18 weeks a year and train, when we have so much land in Australia and when there are other training areas? They should have been going to Western Australia or even up to the Northern Territory, but, no, they wanted prime agricultural land in Australia and their hands were tied. They were having meetings with the Defence Force. They were having meetings with other people. No-one was listening to them. It was well attended by people in the area at public meetings.


The second reading speech on the introduction of the Land Acquisition Act 1989 adds little to the meaning of the words other than referring to section 31 of the act. However, the following sentence is relevant as it gives the tenor of the purpose of the words within the meaning of the act:


This Government is concerned by the need to strike a balance between the rights of private property on the one hand and the legitimate needs of society for land for public purposes on the other.


This sentence within the second reading speech clearly delineates that the acquisition is for the benefit of society. There was no substantive debate on what the phrase 'public purpose' meant. The reason why one has to revert to external explanations is due to the vagueness of the definition within section 6 of the act, which states as follows:


… public purpose means a purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws and includes, in relation to land in a Territory, any purpose in relation to the Territory.


In judgements on which the issue has been raised, the acquisition must be for the primary benefit of the community and Australia generally. Well, that certainly wasn't the case when it came to destroying our prime agricultural farming land, displacing Australians for the Singaporean army to train out here. I ask the question: What deals were done?


We cannot allow this to happen. I feel for the Australian people. I know what it's like to work hard to own your own land, to love the land that you're on and then to have someone come and say, 'Oh, no, you've got to give it up because we want Singaporeans to train here with no benefit to this country whatsoever.' This is especially so when, as I stated, there is other land they could train on in this country. It's about time that members in this place and the other place started listening to the Australian people and their pain and what they're going through, not listening to the bureaucrats and those others that have no idea. It is the grassroots Australians that are being forgotten.


There has been very little case law on the meaning of the words 'public purpose', particularly in the context of like cases of acquisition for the primary purpose of land for the training of a foreign army. Irrespective of the wide ambit of the definition of the words 'public purpose' within the Land Acquisitions Act of 1989, it is evident from case law that such an acquisition must be shown to actually be for the benefit of the public. The bill, which I seek the support of all parties for, clarifies the meaning of those important words 'public purpose'. It is important for all Australians that they know their land and their heritage will never be compulsorily acquired for the benefit of an unrelated third party and, as far as I'm concerned, especially for a foreign third party.


Before any declaration is made by any department to acquire an interest in land, the bill will require that department to demonstrate the purpose of using that interest or for its need for that interest to provide services. The acquiring authority must show that the need will be for the direct benefit of the Australian public or for the provision to the Australian public of necessary services.


The bill does not alter the intent of the original act. It clarifies the meaning and intent of the act so that the Australian public will never again be subject to months of upset and costs in trying to protect their interest for the ongoing benefit of their families. I hope both sides of this chamber and the minor political parties clearly look at what I'm putting forward here if they truly want to represent the people of Australia. If they saw the faces of these farming families and what's going to happen to them, they would understand. They could be our sons, our daughters, our brothers, our aunts, our cousins—our families. These people are clearly looking to us to stand up and fight and represent them. It is not up to the bureaucrats to make these decisions. It is not up to these foreign interests who say, 'We want this,' or 'We want that.' It's up to us to make the right decisions on behalf of the people who are relying on us to fight for them and stand up for their rights.


As I said to you earlier, I've got no problems with acquiring land for the right reasons, because this country is growing rapidly. But when we are asking people to give up the land that they love, people who have seen their families fight in the past for their land and for freedom for their way of life in this country, and we are prepared to allow it to be sold to a foreign power—to the Singaporean army, so that they can do their training—that's not good enough, as far as I'm concerned.


All I'm asking for in this bill is that if anyone's going to acquire land then we should make sure it is in the best interests of the Australian people, not of a foreign power. Give the Australian people some stability so they know that the decisions being made are right for them and for future generations. 


This bill overcomes the vagueness of the existing definition but gives clarity to the meaning of the term 'public purpose' without the need for future litigation. The bill does not apply to acquisitions by consent. As I've said and will say again, because One Nation has been fighting for this matter—and I know there were some on the government side who disagreed with the compulsory acquisition of the land for the Singaporean army, and I do appreciate their support on this— (Time expired)

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-09-14,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (09:52):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Lands Acquisition Amendment (Public Purpose) Bill 2017 presented by Senator Hanson. I must say, I have empathy around the arguments made by Senator Hanson with respect to the processes for the compulsory acquisition of land, particularly where those acquisitions affect not just the land of an individual but, in many cases, our constituents in provincial, rural, remote Australia—describe it as you will—for whom this land also happen to be the foundation asset of their businesses, their livelihood.


We've all known of circumstances in which a compulsory acquisition of land has occurred in metropolitan areas for the building of highways, for the development of public utilities generally, for rail lines and for port expansions. An equal degree of anxiety exists amongst the owners of that land, as may be the case particularly with the cited example of the acquisition of land in Central and north Central Queensland. But there is a distinct difference, which I think Senator Hanson has touched on, and that is that these acquisitions can impact on land that is also the primary source of the livelihood of the people who operate that land. In this case it was almost exclusively in areas that were involved in beef production. Being a beef producer myself, I understand the conflict that would confront many of the landowners in this particular case. Unlike with other businesses, the business plans that are developed for many properties have a long intention. It can be a plan to develop your property that might take you 10 to 20 years. In the course of that, there are various stages where you are developing your asset for the purposes of your livelihood, where in effect you are partially through developing the land. At that stage, that may impact negatively on the value of the property as opposed to positively, and Senator Williams would be well aware of the things I'm referring to. You may have purchased a property because it appealed to you, in that it may have had rundown assets and facilities, so you've set about to develop it. In many cases this is the life's work of people. When they come onto a property they may have a 10-year plan to fence it and, in the case of cattle, to replace cattle yards and cattle handling facilities; to improve the waters; and to improve the pasture, which could involve land clearing and pasture production. If you're at the wrong stage in the development phases of your asset, it can have less appeal, might I say, in the marketplace, for others who might not have the same strong will to develop the property. 


But it is about connection to the land. Many of the people who are in the grazing and pastoral communities are multigenerational. Many of these properties have been in the hands of their parents or in some other form of family partnership. And so there is an enormous attachment. Their life's work is there, on that land. They may well be in an age bracket or in circumstances that prevent them from starting again. This might not be something that is understood by many in this place, but I can tell you from personal experience that, when you're on the land, if you've undertaken a significant campaign to improve pasture, fence it, put in proper water facilities, reticulating water through a particular area—these are big expansive properties; the greater Canberra city would be the horse paddock. People have put decades into these properties. 


I was recently with one of these graziers in Casino, not more than a month ago, and I reminded this pastoralist that we had known each other 35 years ago, when he was a miner in a mining community in Central Queensland and when I was the local detective. He informed me—and I knew it at that time—that he had bought a property in the Marlborough district and was affected by this. He was one of the main protagonists against these acquisitions. He filled me in on the fact that he had been 35 years developing this property, and it was not yet where he wanted it to be. People don't quite understand that, for example, when your cattle become acclimatised to a particular area, if there is massive disruption in their lives—if they're taken to other pasture types, if they're moved, particularly in the coastal areas, to more marginal country—the value of those cattle can be significantly impacted upon.




Senator Williams:
  They will lose weight. 




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  They will lose weight, as they precondition them. Sometimes it's actually only their progeny that become acclimatised to the country and perform better. So I do understand this nexus between the people and the land, particularly in rural areas. The genesis of this for Senator Hanson was obviously the issues around Central Queensland and North Queensland. I've got to say—and I'll probably get a call from the headmaster after this—that this was not well managed. Despite the pleas that there had been public consultation and engagement with the communities that were impacted by this, that wasn't 100 per cent correct in all of the cases. 


I made the point at the time that, had our government engaged with some of us representatives of government who have an affinity with the people in these regions, we might have made more progress or been able to establish exactly where we were with these communities before this all fell to pieces. Senator Hanson, I understand completely the spirit of the proposal being made here with the amendments in this legislation, but I'm inclined to think—using this as a case study—that we can make all the rules we like around this but, unless culturally the people in the bureaucracy, and in this case the Department of Defence, approach this in a more compassionate manner, we're going to end up with the same set of circumstances again and again, notwithstanding what rules, regulations or framework of operation we put in place.


I think that this was, in large part, a poor effort at the front end of engagement with these communities in these particular cases. I know that Senator Hanson played a very active role, as did a number of us. Fortunately on this occasion the Deputy Prime Minister took an interest in it. Had he been commissioned to take an interest in it at a date sooner than was the case, we might have had some resolution at an earlier time. But the Deputy Prime Minister did visit the area, on 3 February, and had meetings with local people who were affected and, indeed, other stakeholders in the community, not just those who might have been the subject of the acquisition. It is a matter of record that, the following day, the government made the commitment that no-one would be forced to sell their land against their will.


There was a division of thought in the area. There were some landowners who were willing to part with their land, on just terms—if I can make reference to my favourite movie, The Castle. In fact, there were landowners who engaged contractually with the government and did sell their land. So we had the willing sellers. But then equally we had—and I suspect there were more of them—the people that I have mentioned here in this contribution today, the people who had put a lifetime of blood, sweat and tears into their land, who were at some stage within a development program for their property and for whom an acquisition at that time would not have realised the great potential that their property might have had. They might have been wanting to upgrade their circumstances, perhaps because of retirement, and, given some more time, they might have had their land more adequately valued.


A great example of that—I touched on this earlier—is that you might purchase a large area of land that requires 200 kilometres of fencing to be done. No matter how energetic you are, that will take you a long period of time. It will have a serious investment impact from a money quantum point of view. If you haven't started that program or you're early into that program but it is not completed, and your property is valued, it won't matter what value is put on it; only one in 100 buyers will show interest in it. If the program has been finished and all the facilities are upgraded and in a functioning form, you will find that 90 per cent of potential buyers capable of buying that property will be engaged. These are serious challenges. I say to Senator Hanson, we talked about this and explored where there may have been other communities where these facilities could have gone, but I suspect, not knowing, that if the process were not managed properly we would get resistance in those other areas as well. 


Central Queensland, and particularly the Shoalwater area, has been devoted to defence activities, but I want to make a point, Senator Hanson: the intent of these acquisitions was to try and get some land where particular operations could occur. This was to do with visibility and engagement. Right next-door to the areas to be acquired, through the barbed wire fence, there were massive tracts of land owned by the defence department—hundreds and hundreds of thousands of acres. But they couldn't clear the land, to make it look like the land through the fence, because of impacts on the environment. It was a most ridiculous situation. We wouldn't even have had to confront these challenges with this community. It will be a long time before society realises just what impact the Greens and their policies, with the support of their coalition partners, Labor, have had in our rural communities. But one day, when people are sitting naked and hungry—




Senator Siewert:
  You're right! It will take you a long time—a long time to fix your impacts on the environment.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I can hardly hear myself think, Chair—please provide me with some protection from that shrill noise!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Interjections are disorderly. Please continue, Senator O'Sullivan.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Here sit our colleagues in their cotton and their wool, with their leather shoes, sitting on a leather chair, with a timber desk, yet they would resist at every opportunity the ability of people in rural Australia to produce those commodities. As I have said before, Senator Hanson, my friends over here in this little corner have something you and I haven't got.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, you are directing your comments to the chair, of course? 




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
   Yes, I am. They have these fairies, Mr Acting Deputy President, with magic knitting needles and as soon as these knitting needles touch they generate all the energy you need for your house and out the end of them, just as we see with spiders and beautiful silk, come cotton and leather and wool—




Senator Dastyari:
  That sounds awesome!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  It is. If Senator Dastyari were to join the Greens—and I believe membership, depending on which cult part of the Greens you go to, is not very expensive; if you're a bit short, Sam, I'll throw a couple of bob your way.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, will you please refer to senators by their correct title.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  My apologies—it was a lapse and I apologise for it, Mr Acting Deputy President. In any event, that was one of the other challenges that occurred up in the Shoalwater Bay area. We had the land. When you can't confront those challenges, when there are other commonsense, practical solutions to these things, the government of the day—it won't matter who is on the leather, it won't matter who's in government, whether it is colleagues on the other side in coalition with the Greens—has to acquire land to broaden highways and byways and to run railways. We are about to embark on that massive generational signature project, Inland Rail—brought on, might I say, very proudly by members of the National Party in coalition with their colleagues; a transformational project that of course has been on the books for so many years but is now being delivered by this government. We will confront these same challenges again on land acquisition. 


In closing, my contribution would be that I don't see any problem with calling for a review, and I do not mean some inquiry—I just mean the government of the day has to be involved in these matters. Our government should look carefully at how we go about it. Public engagement, as pointed out by Senator Hanson, is absolutely essential, and, if done properly—these are clever people—they will understand. These are dedicated Australians who understand that, from time to time, there is a need to acquire land as we expand the facilities and infrastructure of our nation, as with Defence's relations with another country. By sitting with them, speaking rationally and hearing what they have to say, we can, on occasion, dismantle some of the concerns that they have and some of the pressures that these things bring into their lives. If they are willing to transition from their land to some other point and if the transactions happen on just terms, as we have heard both in The Castle and in the reading of the Constitution, I don't think we'll be confronted as frequently with the circumstances we found ourselves in around Shoalwater Bay in Central Queensland.


I do support the development of the defence training industry on any terms up in that part of the world. It is a big industry. It employs a lot of people, and billions of dollars are invested in Central Queensland. So there are stakeholders in decisions like this beyond the landowners in Shoalwater Bay, even though, in my view, they are the most important in the consultation process. There are businesses in Townsville, Charters Towers and Rockhampton that rely significantly on the activities around defence training in particular in that part of the world. Given that the Greens and the opposition are determined to shut down the black coal industry in that region of my home state, we need to continue to look at development and investment that will offset and mitigate the impacts of their poor public policy. I agree with the spirit of the amendment. I don't think it's necessary. I think a review of how we approach these things culturally is more important. (Time expired)

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:12):  I rise to speak on the Lands Acquisition Amendment (Public Purpose) Bill 2017, which has been presented to the Senate by Pauline Hanson's One Nation. As Senator O'Sullivan just said, we understand why this bill has been put forward for consideration by the party. It's a reaction to the events that occurred earlier this year surrounding the Department of Defence's flawed process to acquire land to enable the expansion of two training areas in North Queensland—the Townsville Field Training Area and the Shoalwater Bay Training Area.


The department wrote letters to property owners outlining Defence's needs for land and how acquisition of their property, properly compensated, would assist in meeting these needs. The community was of course outraged, as you would understand, Acting Deputy President Williams. Prime agricultural land was being eyed off for military training use, forcing families to leave their land, which, in some cases, had been held by them for generations. After enough pressure from Labor, the Minister for Defence finally stepped in. I think it would be worthwhile commenting on the role of shadow minister Fitzgibbon in this area, because he did some terrific work on behalf of property owners in Queensland to bring the issue into the public arena and put that pressure on the Minister for Defence.


Finally, a statement was made that there would be no compulsory acquisition of properties surrounding the existing training areas. When asked about Defence's processes for land acquisition at estimates in February, the minister's response to a question on notice was:


Compulsory land acquisition was considered as one option during initial planning. It was always the preference to purchase land from willing sellers off the open market, and as announced in February 2017 land will only be purchased from willing sellers.


That was question No. 60 from April 2017. The minister eventually made a decision in this case regarding land acquisition to only acquire land from willing sellers. That avoids the need to consider compulsory acquisition and the public purpose test. It is not clear how the proposed changes to the definition of 'public purpose' would assist in these types of considerations where ministers are required to consider the overall public benefit and purpose in every decision they make.


Senator Hanson, while the defence minister certainly made a mess of the acquisition of land, we do not believe at this stage that the implications of this bill have been thought through. It was introduced yesterday afternoon, and we understand there has not been consultation at this stage with the Australian Government Solicitor and, of course, with a broad range of stakeholders and a broad section of landholders across this country. We are of the belief at this point that those are the sorts of things that ought to occur before a full consideration of this legislation.


There are significant judicial precedents regarding land acquisition. The act that Senator Hanson is seeking to amend is almost 30 years old, and there are a number of precedents of Commonwealth over-reach that have been successfully challenged in the courts. Labor believe we need to be conscious of those precedents which allow the Commonwealth to acquire land where it is necessary and to provide appropriate compensation. This bill would complicate all of those former precedents and, for that reason, at this stage, the Labor Party cannot support this legislation.


Question negatived.

At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of: 


(a) the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017; and

Senator GALLAGHER:
  I move an amendment to Senator Fifield's amendment:


   Omit ""23 October 2017"", substitute ""27 November 2017"".


This amendment would simply extend the reporting date from 23 October 2017 to 27 November 2017.

The simple argument on this is that this is a significant package of bills. The Economics Legislation Committee is a busy committee. These are contested changes; we already know that. There will be the need for hearings and submissions for these bills. We believe that a November reporting date is a much more realistic timetable for inquiry into these superannuation bills and report back to the Senate. I hope the Senate can support my amendment.

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (11:15): I table the explanatory memoranda and I move:

The speeches read as follows—



TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY AND MEMBER OUTCOMES IN SUPERANNUATION MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2017


This bill amends the Corporations Act 2001, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, and the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001 to give every day Australians more power over their superannuation providers and a stronger prudential framework to deliver a more transparent and accountable compulsory retirement savings system.


The measures in this bill are part of a broader package of Government reforms that are squarely focused on protecting members' money and members' interests. 


It is a comprehensive package that will help deliver all Australians a strong and modern superannuation system with a stronger prudential regulator that is solely focused on delivering outcomes for all Australians who rely on these funds to secure their retirement. 


2017 marks 25 years since the introduction of compulsory superannuation in Australia. In that time, the system has grown from around $136 billion in 1992 to over $2.3 trillion today. APRA regulated superannuation funds manage around $1.4 trillion of the hard earned deferred wages on behalf of Australian workers.


The Turnbull Government believes that given the compulsory nature of superannuation, Australians rightly expect the industry to be held to the highest standards of transparency and accountability. 


The reforms in this bill and the broader package of member-focused reforms will ensure the superannuation system has a strong foundation today and into the future.


Australia's compulsory superannuation system must at all times prioritise the financial interests of members above vested interests in the industry whether government, bank executives, shareholders, directors, employers or trade unions. And, the legislative and regulatory framework underpinning the system must facilitate this in practice.


Many of the measures in this bill have been recommended by past reviews into superannuation, commissioned by both Coalition and Labor governments. These are sensible reforms that are already being embedded in the practices of high performing funds.


The package has been broadly welcomed by industry and consumers groups alike. CHOICE Head of Campaigns and Policy, Erin Turner said, ""the superannuation system needs a shake-up and it's why we welcome the Federal Government's announcement that it's taking a consumer-first approach to reform.""


Outcomes test


Under the law, MySuper is defined as a simple, standardised 'no frills' superannuation product with regulated fees. Individuals who do not actively choose their own fund or investment option must be defaulted into a MySuper product. 


This means that typically, MySuper members are younger and not proactively engaging with their superannuation. For this reason trustees of MySuper products are subject to additional obligations, including the need to ensure that they promote the financial interests of members. 


The current law includes a 'scale test' under which MySuper trustees must consider whether a fund has sufficient size to operate efficiently. This bill will replace the 'scale test' with a broader 'outcomes test'.


It will strengthen all default MySuper products offered by superannuation funds across the industry as at June 2016 including: 


46 MySuper products offered by retail funds; 


43 MySuper products offered by industry funds;


15 MySuper products offered by corporate funds; and 


11 MySuper products offered by public sector funds. 


It will achieve this by introducing a requirement for trustees to undertake a stronger, broader annual assessment of their MySuper product outcomes to ensure they are promoting the financial interests of MySuper members with almost 15 million accounts across the system.


Under the new outcomes test, trustees will have to consider all aspects of their MySuper offering for example consideration will need to be given to ensuring returns, fees, investment and insurance strategies – including whether insurance premiums are inappropriately eroding retirement savings – as well as the scale of the fund promote the financial interests of members.


They will also have to compare the performance of their MySuper offering with other comparable MySuper products. Trustees will have to do this annually. 


Importantly, to ensure the new outcomes test delivers greater transparency, trustees will also be required to publicly release their determination of whether or not they are promoting the financial interests of members and a summary of the assessment and comparisons that lead to the determination.


These changes will ensure that trustees, who have a fiduciary obligation to regularly assess the quality of their MySuper offering; the findings are transparent and address any weaknesses that they identify. 


To be clear, the 'outcomes test' will not weaken or lessen a trustee's primary obligation to promote the financial interests of their MySuper members, including through net returns -it will strengthen it.


The new outcomes test will also enhance APRA's ability to assess how trustees are working to improve the quality of MySuper products and meeting their stated strategic objectives. It will also give APRA stronger grounds for engagement with trustees where it has concerns. 


Outside of MySuper, there are a diversity of products that are not subject to standardisation under the law. A member who has made an active choice about their superannuation product typically chooses their investment strategy on the advice of their financial adviser. These are referred to as 'choice members'.


During consultation, some stakeholders said that the outcomes test should be extended to all superannuation choice products, not just default MySuper products. There are fundamental legal differences between the default MySuper sector and the 'choice' sector. 


On 11 August this year, APRA wrote to all RSE licensees to advise that it intends to consult on a proposal to apply an outcomes test to all products, not just default MySuper products. As with the MySuper outcomes test, this would include consideration of net investment returns, expenses and costs, insurance, and other benefits and services provided to choice members.


The Government believes this is an efficient means through which the choice sector can be strengthened for the benefit of members and agrees with APRA's proposal and expects it to be implemented.


This will ensure that quality outcomes are being delivered and the financial interests of all members are promoted across all superannuation products. 


MySuper Authorisation


There are currently 115 MySuper products on the market today. These MySuper products offer a wide range of returns and charge a wide range of fees. As a result, there are concerns that the current MySuper authorisation process is not ensuring that all MySuper products are of sufficient quality.


This bill will amend the law to give APRA more discretion over the authorisation and cancellation of authority to offer a MySuper product. 


Given the additional obligations that apply to MySuper trustees, we want to ensure that APRA will only authorise a trustee if it has confidence they are likely to comply with these obligations. 


We also want to ensure that APRA has the power to cancel a trustee's authorisation if it has reason to believe that the trustee will no longer comply with their obligations. 


These changes to the MySuper authorisation process will give APRA the power to protect the interests of the millions of disengaged members, or members who have not made an active choice about how their savings are invested. 


Direction Powers


In a compulsory system of the size and significance of our superannuation system, it is critical that the prudential regulator has a strong regulatory toolkit to protect the interests of fund members. 


To date, APRA has largely had to rely on powers of 'moral-suasion' to protect the interests of superannuation fund members. 


The Government believes that in order to ensure confidence in the system, APRA should have the capacity to take quick and decisive action to safeguard members' interests where it has significant concerns about a fund's operation.


It also needs appropriate powers to step in and ensure that trustees are meeting their fiduciary obligations. 


A strong regulator is crucial for ensuring confidence in the $2.3 trillion superannuation system. 


This bill will give APRA the ability to take preventative or corrective action where it has prudential concerns about a superannuation fund or if it is concerned that a fund is not acting in the best interests of members. 


For example, if APRA were to have serious concerns with the operations of a subsidiary company wholly owned by a superannuation fund that provides services to members, APRA can direct the subsidiary entity to undertake a particular course of action to protect members' interests. 


Similarly, if APRA were to have serious concerns about the actions of a particular trustee director which could impact member outcomes, these directions powers will enable APRA to intervene and direct the board to remove a trustee director. 


This is clearly in the best interests of fund members.


Ownership and Control


This bill will also give APRA the power to reject a change in the ownership of a corporate trustee. 


Sadly, we can still remember the collapse of Trio Capital in 2009 and the significant impact it had on the lives of many Australians, including thousands of members of APRA-regulated superannuation funds. The collapse of Trio Capital, described as the largest superannuation fraud in Australian history, highlighted the consequences of not having appropriate people in control of superannuation savings. 


That is why, given the potential detrimental outcomes that may arise through the mismanagement of funds, we believe that no one should be able to own or control a trustee without APRA's approval. 


Director Penalties 


This bill will also strengthen the accountability of trustee directors by making them subject to civil and criminal penalties for breaches of their fiduciary duties. 


This was a recommendation of the Financial System Inquiry which the Government accepted in 2015. 


It is anomalous that trustees do not currently face civil or criminal penalties for breaching their duties. 


These penalties include a maximum five years' jail for serious criminal conduct, for example, fraud; and up to $420,000 in civil penalties per director.


Annual Member Meetings 


The law today imposes no legal requirement upon funds, who are the custodians of members' compulsory retirement savings to be subject to questioning from members about how their money is invested, the performance of the fund, how their money is spent on marketing or sponsorships. 


We believe that it is time for this to change. And we are not alone. Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, Eva Scheerlinck has said, ""Providing a means for members to engage with the people managing their hard earned superannuation is a good way to identify those issues which are of most interest to members.""


As such, this bill will require trustees to hold annual member meetings where members have the opportunity to ask questions and get answers, not just of trustees but also of fund executives, auditors and actuaries. 


To provide flexibility and minimise compliance costs, trustees will have the option to hold annual members' meetings electronically. 


Annual General Meetings are a longstanding feature of Australia's publically listed companies in which superannuation funds invest their members' money. 


Reporting Standards


A compulsory superannuation system must be transparent and accountable for the way in which it spends members' money.


APRA currently has the power to make reporting standards to capture fund expenses relating to investments more granular and transparent. However, it is unable to require funds to report the same detailed information about other expenses including for example, detailed information about financial arrangements with related parties, sponsorships, marketing and other expenditure. 


All fund expenses ultimately impact their members' eventual retirement income and all expenses should be required to be transparently disclosed.


As such, the measures in this bill will enable APRA to make reporting standards that require funds to provide detailed expense information in relation to their operations and management.


This will introduce much needed transparency and give members and the regulator much fuller understanding of how funds are spending members' money and whether this is consistent with their fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of members. 


Sally Loane, the CEO of the Financial Services Council, welcomed the package of reforms and in particular, noted that, ""The FSC strongly supports all proposals which give consumers more power and greater transparency over one of their most important assets – their superannuation savings.""


Portfolio Holdings Disclosure 


Finally, this bill will also boost transparency by giving members more information about fund investments. These changes will also improve confidence in the system by ensuring members can see where their funds are being invested and that they are being invested in their best interests. 


It will do this by introducing a workable arrangement for portfolio holdings disclosure. 


Under the changes in this bill, funds will be required to disclose portfolio holdings in respect to assets held directly and through associated entities, including initial investments made into non-associated entities. 


This approach will significantly reduce the complexity of the current law – which was introduced by the former Labor Government in 2012 but has never commenced operation. 


Australia's superannuation system is often regarded as one of the world's leading retirement savings systems. However, out of 25 markets surveyed by international market financial analysts Morningstar, Australia is the only one that has not implemented some form of portfolio holdings disclosure. 


The portfolio holdings disclosure measure in this bill will ensure Australia's superannuation system remains consistent with international best practice.


Conclusion


Once again I want to make it clear that Government is focused on ensuring Australia's superannuation system delivers outcomes for members first and foremost rather than protecting the vested interests of the industry.


That is, a system that encourages people to participate actively, that ensures transparency to facilitate informed decisions, and one that gives people the confidence that their retirement savings are invested wisely. 


And, most importantly, we must have a superannuation system with a strong regulatory framework that protects members' money and members' interests.


I'm confident the measures in this bill will achieve these outcomes.


Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum. 


SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING TRUSTEE ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2017


This bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act1993 to modernise and strengthen the foundations of Australia's compulsory superannuation system. 


It achieves this by introducing a strong and consistent definition of independence and a consistent minimum legal requirement for at least one third independent directors with an independent chair, across all superannuation funds regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). 


This bill is part of a broader package of Government reforms that are squarely focused on protecting members' money and members' interests. These are important changes that will ensure all Australians, regardless of the fund they are in, can have confidence that the people entrusted to manage their hard-earned wages have the appropriate mix of skills and expertise to protect and grow their retirement savings solely in the interests of members. 


This bill also amends the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011 to ensure that the Australian Government's main civilian and military superannuation schemes are also subject to the same high standards through complying with the new independence requirements.


It has been a quarter of a century since the introduction of compulsory superannuation in Australia. In that time, the size and significance of the system has changed enormously – both for individuals and the economy more broadly. 


For individuals, superannuation is now most Australians' second largest asset after the family home. The total size of funds under management has grown from around $136 billion in 1992 to over $2.3 trillion today – in excess of a 1,500% percent increase over that time. Incredibly, that figure is projected to double to $4 trillion in just over a decade. 


Make no mistake about it, Australia's superannuation system has grown into what it is today largely by virtue of successive government policy to compel individuals to defer a portion of their wages – today, 9.5% - for their future retirement income. 


It is always important to remind ourselves that this money is the property of each and every hard working Australian superannuation fund member. Not the government; not the industry; not the bank executives; not the shareholders; not the employers; and not the trade unions. 


During the past 25 years the nature of the superannuation industry and the funds themselves has changed markedly. 


Superannuation funds regulated by APRA now hold around $1.4 trillion in assets on behalf of the hard working Australian people.


Significant industry consolidation has occurred and funds have grown much larger and more complex. It is appropriate that the foundations underpinning the system are updated to reflect this change.


The previous Labor Government commissioned a 'Super System Review' that considered the governance arrangements in the superannuation system. This review, led by Jeremy Cooper recommended that, at the very least, equal representation trustee boards should have a minimum one-third 'non‑associated' directors, although a requirement for a majority of independent directors was preferred.



In forming this recommendation, the Panel noted in its Final Report that, ""it had come to the view that changes in the industry over time and certain implementation practices mean that equal representation no longer seems to achieve its original stated objective.""


The Cooper Review Panel made the case for its recommendation on the basis of a number of key structural changes that have taken place in the system since the equal representation governance structure was established in the SIS Act in 1993. 


These included:


1. The substantial shift away from single-employer defined benefit funds that were dominant in 1993 and the introduction of fund choice and prevalence of defined contribution schemes. This materially changed, and in many cases, severed the once close relationship between an employer and super fund.


2. The fact that most 'employer' and 'employee' representatives are nominated by third party organisations such as employer associations and trade unions. 


It noted the implications of this included the perception of democracy that equal representation appears to embed is not always the reality. 


Further, it creates at least the perception that individual directors are required to answer to, or are dictated to by, the organisation that appointed them.


3. The potential for the large numbers of employer and employee organisations with interests in a fund can lead to larger than necessary board sizes. 


4. Equal representation leaves significant groups 'unrepresented'. In particular, it highlighted pensioners, future post-retirement members and members' who have exercised choice. 


The most recent Intergenerational Report, published in 2015 bears this out showing that by 2055, the number of Australians aged 65 and over is projected to more than double.


There is a further compelling argument for the need to introduce a minimum requirement for independent directors on superannuation fund boards – that is to ensure a board can be comprised of a sufficiently diverse, skilled and experienced set of directors. 


There can be no argument that members of superannuation funds, the hardworking Australian people, deserve the best and brightest minds sitting around the board tables of Australia's superannuation funds. 


A second review, the 2014 Financial System Inquiry led by David Murray, initiated under a Coalition Government, agreed that there should be a change to the governance arrangements that apply to the superannuation industry. 


However, the FSI recommended that all public offer funds should have a majority of independent directors, including an independent chair. 


While the Government agrees with both of these review findings, that a majority of independent directors would be preferable, we recognise that having a consistent minimum standard of one-third independent directors on trustee boards represents an important step forward and is better than continuing with none.


Some for-profit retail funds, that do not follow the equal representation model under the law, comply with a Financial Services Council industry standard requiring its members to have a majority of independent directors and an independent chair. 


The not for profit sector has also developed a governance code. Some might suggest that this means there is no need for this legislation. 


However, there is no guarantee every participant in the system will be covered. Treasury analysis suggests that in 2016, the percentage of funds not covered by any industry body was 44 per cent. 


The Government believes that all superannuation members have a right to expect high standards of governance, enshrined in the law, including independent thinking and judgement that is free from conflict of interest underpinning how their money is managed. 


To ensure the bill delivers on its objective, it empowers APRA to make determinations about whether a person satisfies the new definition of independence. 


A trustee will be able to apply to APRA for a determination that a potential director is able to exercise independent judgement if they may not meet the strict definition in the law. 


This bill provides a three-year transitional period for trustee boards to have at least one-third independent directors. 


It will also ensure that the new requirements are enforceable by APRA.


At its heart, the case for a consistent minimum standard across all types of superannuation fund boards for independent directors is simple. 


Independent directors will strengthen corporate governance in the superannuation sector, especially in relation to conflicts management, and related party transactions including, choice of investments, arrangements with service providers, directors' fees, sponsorships, marketing activities, advertising and payments to nominating bodies. 


The proposed requirements for independent trustee directors are less than what some industry superannuation funds themselves expect of the entities in which they invest members' money. 


For example, the Governance Guidelines of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors highlight the importance of company directors exercising independent judgement, not just in relation to management but also into relation to related parties and other affiliates. 


Under this bill, it will be a matter for trustees to determine how the remaining two‑thirds of the board is comprised.


Boards will be able to choose to have the remaining directors split between sponsoring organisation representatives if they consider it appropriate. 


It will ensure our compulsory superannuation system is well-equipped for the next quarter of a century and beyond.


This bill does not favour one part of the industry over another – it applies equally to industry funds, corporate funds, retail funds and public sector funds. 


It is about lifting governance standards across the entire industry in the interests of members. 


Members of all funds deserve to have their interests placed first. 


This bill will help to ensure that this happens in future. 


There is too much at stake to allow these sensible reforms to be delayed by industry self-interest any longer. 


Full details about the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum. 


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

 (Tasmania) (11:37):  I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 509 standing in my name for today relating to climate science.


Leave granted.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I move the motion as amended:


That the Senate—


(a) notes:


 (i) that accurate climate and meteorological forecasting prior to, and during, the recent Atlantic hurricanes allowed for evacuations and emergency management that saved lives,


 (ii) a recent article in The Economist which stated that while the number of extreme climate and weather-related emergencies have increased due to climate change, the fall in the number of fatalities is partly attributable to improved climate and weather forecasting,


 (iii) that the Trump Administration has proposed cuts to agencies responsible for climate and meteorological forecasting, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and


 (iv) that Australia has a world-class climate science and meteorological community;


(b) nevertheless, notes that the Australian Academy of Science's 2017 Climate Science Capability Review found that climate science and meteorological efforts are under-resourced, poorly coordinated and subject to short-term funding cycles;


(c) further notes that various climate agencies in Australia, including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, have faced ongoing funding pressure;


(d) commends the work of Australia's climate agencies and researchers; and


(e) notes the recommendations of Australian Academy of Science's 2017 Climate Science Capability Review, particularly funding an additional 77 climate science researchers, and ensuring continued capability in the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (11:38):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave of one minute is granted.




Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government is committed to ensuring that our investment in climate science is appropriate and well targeted. We are investing strongly in our institutions and fundamental research infrastructure, including $24 million for the Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub and $49.8 million to provide continued year-round support for priority science and long-term monitoring on Macquarie Island. CSIRO will invest $37 million over 10 years to create a decadal climate forecasting capability within the new CSIRO Climate Science Centre. The government has also established the independent National Climate Science Advisory Committee to inform the future direction of Australia's climate science capability and research priorities.

 (Tasmania) (11:39):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave of one minute is granted.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I cannot believe that you sat there and laughed throughout that statement about climate change and the importance of climate science. This motion before the Australian Senate recognises the importance—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The senator has the right to be heard in silence. Senator Bernardi?




Senator Bernardi:
  Madam Deputy President, I have a point of order. It wasn't Senator McGrath laughing; it was me. I think Senator Whish-Wilson should correct the record.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bernardi. Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  What a ship of fools; seriously! This motion before the Australian Senate today recognises the importance of climate science—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Whish-Wilson, please resume your seat. Senator Macdonald?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The President just recently made it very, very clear that statements given by leave for one minute at this time of day were to state the party or the person's own position but were certainly not to debate it or enter into argument, which this clearly is. He made that ruling just a couple of days ago.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. Senator Whish-Wilson, what are you seeking to do?




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I am seeking to finish my bloody statement, and I would like the clock reversed so I can start again. They've nothing but—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Whish-Wilson, resume your seat. I ask that all senators listen to the debate in respectful silence. I remind senators of the President's ruling in relation to one-minute statements. You have 31 seconds, Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Could I ask, as a point of order, Deputy President, considering I have been continually interrupted, deliberately interrupted—this government will go to any lengths not to talk about climate science—can I have my time again, please?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. You have time to finish your remarks. I believe we started on 31 seconds. I would ask once again for senators to listen in respectful silence.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bernardi.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  What a ship of fools!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Please set the clock at 31 seconds. Yes, Minister?




Senator Cormann:
  I raise a point of order, Madam Deputy President. Senator Whish-Wilson is now abusing the privileges and courtesies extended to him when the Senate gave him leave to make a brief statement. He is not making a brief statement; he is giving a spray.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cormann, I already ruled on that, and I asked Senator Whish-Wilson to be mindful of the President's statement. Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  What a ship of fools! We will not be stranded on the shoals of history by this ship of fools—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Whish-Wilson, please resume your seat. Minister?




Senator Cormann:
  I raise a point of order, Madam Deputy President.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Just a moment, Minister; I can't hear. Please resume your seat. Order on my left!



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator O'Sullivan. I ask that you respect that people have the right to be heard in silence.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, are you dissenting from my request that you listen in respectful silence? Minister.




Senator Cormann:
  Point of order, Madam Deputy President: Senator Whish-Wilson is now defying your ruling. He is acting in breach of the courtesies that have been extended to him by the Senate giving him leave for a brief statement. He is continuing and persisting in his spray, and that is not consistent with the President's ruling. I ask you to draw Senator Whish-Wilson's attention to how he has to conduct himself in making a brief statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  As I said in relation to your previous point of order, Minister, I have drawn Senator Whish-Wilson's attention to the President's statement. Senator Whish-Wilson had just restarted before you rose to object, so I really don't know where he was intending to go. Senator Bernardi?




Senator Bernardi:
  Madam Deputy President, I ask you to ask Senator Whish-Wilson to withdraw the bad language he chose, which is unparliamentary, because we have children in the gallery and it sets a very poor example for them in their own lives.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The President has made statements in relation to being given leave to speak, and that is that they should be statements and not debates. However, the President has not sat people down for making other than a statement, and, further to that, leave was granted to Senator Whish-Wilson to make a statement for one minute. Before Senator Whish-Wilson resumes his one minute, I would ask that people listen in respectful silence. Senator Bernardi?




Senator Bernardi:
  Madam Deputy President, I've asked you to ask Senator Whish-Wilson to withdraw. You haven't responded to that point of order. It is a very legitimate one.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I didn't hear anything, but I am more than happy to review the tape and come back. Senator Bernardi, please resume your seat—



Senator Bernardi interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, I did not hear that.




Senator Bernardi:
  You weren't listening then.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I beg your pardon, Senator Bernardi!




Senator Bernardi:
  You weren't!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You are now disrespecting the chair.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I have a point of order. Senator Bernardi and Senator Cormann are not only disrespecting you; they are challenging your authority here today.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson, but I am well able to take care of myself. Please continue your 22 seconds.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  After eight spurious points of order, what I was going to say is: I am putting this motion here today for these children here in the gallery, for future generations of Australians, and to recognise our climate scientists and the good work they do and the need to keep funding them. They save lives; they are a big part of my Tasmanian community, and it is about time they were recognised.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion as moved and amended by Senator Whish-Wilson be agreed to.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:05):  I move:


That these bills be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2017 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2017


The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 will make some small but significant changes to Defence's practice and operations. Some stem from recommendations to Government and some deliver on election commitments. These are covered in the four schedules to this Bill. 


The first Schedule amends the Defence Act 1903 to apply common sense to Defence prohibited substance testing.


It will enable a policy framework to broaden and expand the conditions under which a prohibited substance positive test result must be disregarded, including in circumstances relating to appropriate usage of over the counter medication or substances administered or dispensed by authorised persons. 


Under the current arrangements, a positive test result may be disallowed with the direction or recommendation of a legally qualified medical practitioner. 


The Bill will allow a positive test to be disregarded under certain circumstances specified in the relevant Defence Instruction issued by the Secretary and Chief of the Defence Force jointly under Section 11 of the Defence Act 1903. 


This broadening of the circumstances is necessary to ensure that over the counter medication and other legitimate circumstances can be considered where a positive test result is returned. For example, it will mean that Defence will be able to ignore instances where a positive test result has been caused by a dose of generic cold and flu medication rather than something more significant.


The Bill will also simplify the termination provisions to align with the new Defence Regulation 2016 which prescribes procedural fairness, notice to show cause and warning provisions in relation to adverse administrative decisions. 


Schedule 2 amends the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001 to put in place greater protections for Reserve members. This is a Coalition election commitment and I am happy to be bringing these measures forward in this Bill.


The Defence Reserve Service Protection Act provides for the protection of Reserve members in their employment and education, to facilitate their return to civilian life after rendering defence service, and for related purposes. It sets out entitlements and prohibitions that apply in relation to people who at any time serve as members of the Reserves. The Act mitigates some of the employment and financial disadvantages Reserve members may face when rendering defence service and facilitates their availability to undertake defence service, and will enhance Defence capability. 


It is the view of the Government that no one should be disadvantaged by choosing to wear a reserve uniform.


A review of the Act in 2008 (the Protection Review) concluded that, overall, the Act was working well and achieving its objectives. However, the Protection Review recommended a number of enhancements to the Act. The amendments in Schedule 2 implement many of these recommendations. 


In particular the Bill will address the application of the employment, partnership and education protections in Parts 5, 6 and 7 of the Act to extend to all types of Reserve service. Previously, voluntary continuous full time service (which is the type of Reserve service that is typically used when a Reserve member deploys on operations) was only protected if the CDF (or delegate) had requested the member to undertake the service on that basis. This requirement resulted in confusion for Reservists and their employers as to whether the protections applied in any given case. This will no longer be an issue, as all defence service will be protected from now on.


The Bill will also extend the application of the financial liability and bankruptcy protections in Parts 8 and 9 of the Act to continuous full time service that is operational service. Previously, the service was only protected if it was continuous full time service following a call-out under the Defence Act 1903. 


A civil penalty regime is also established to supplement the criminal offence provisions throughout the Act, including provisions dealing with discrimination in employment and education.


The provisions in Part 4 of the Act dealing with discrimination are enhanced to improve the clarity and consistency of these provisions, and to deal with harassment of Reserve members because of their defence service.


The employment protections in Part 5 of the Act are clarified, by stating when the protected period begins and ends, and by replacing the concept of suspending an employment contract with an entitlement to be absent from employment while absent on defence service.


The education protections in Part 7 of the Act are amended to provide a general obligation on education institutions to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate a member's defence service. 


Schedule 3 will implement a recommendation of the 2015 First Principles Review of Defence. It will amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001 (ISA), the Navigation Act 2012 and the Telecommunications Act 1997 in order to transfer the hydrographic, meteorological and oceanographic functions from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) to the Australia Geospatial Organisation (AGO). In conjunction, the Australian Hydrographic Office (AHO) will be transferred out of the RAN and into AGO.


This recommendation will be met in order to have all geospatial related information functions consolidated within the AGO. The transfer of these functions is expected to realise synergies in the exploitation of imagery and other data to produce intelligence and non-intelligence geospatial related information in support of Australia's defence interests and other national objectives.


The amendments to the ISA will permit AGO to provide its non-intelligence products and related assistance to an expanded range of entities in accordance with Australia's legal obligations and national interests. Among other things, this will ensure that AGO can, through the AHO, continue to effectively and efficiently deliver high quality hydrographic, meteorological and oceanographic services to the maritime community.


The minor consequential amendments to the Navigation Act 2012 and the Telecommunications Act 1997 are needed to ensure that the terminology used in those Acts aligns with new Defence organisational arrangements following transfer of those functions. 


Schedule 4 will amend the Australian Defence Force (ADF) Cover Act 2015 to align a small number of provisions in this new superannuation Act with other military superannuation schemes and provide clarity in definitions. 


The Bill will ensure that member's who resign from the ADF and later find that they could have been medically discharged will be able to apply to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (CSC) to have their mode of discharge circumstances reassessed. 


The Bill will also create a more contemporary definition to allow a child of a deceased member or invalid to become eligible at a later date, where the child currently is found ineligible at the time of the member's or invalid's death. 


An example of how this could occur would be where a child of the member or invalid is over 18 and ceases full-time study to become the carer or to undertake a gap year prior to the member or invalid's death, subsequently resuming full-time study after the member or invalid's death while still under the age of 25. 


The Bill will also remove the requirement for a child of a deceased member to be ""wholly or substantially dependent"" on the member or an eligible spouse. The amendment ensures that all eligible children of a deceased member are recognised regardless of where they reside and does not unintentionally exclude children who would otherwise be found eligible if there was no eligible spouse.


CSC will determine who to pay a proportion of the total pension where there are multiple spouses and eligible children. 


As mentioned, this Bill moves to make some small but significant changes to Defence legislation. 


They will be significant to the operations of Defence, providing streamlining to practices and common sense to regulation.


They will be significant to the members of the Defence Reserves, who will receive greater protection. 


They will be significant to family members of the ADF who will now benefit from the changes to superannuation.


STATUTE UPDATE (SMALLER GOVERNMENT) BILL 2017


The Statute Update (Smaller Government) Bill 2017 (the Bill) would, if enacted, repeal three Acts, make amendments to ten Acts across the Commonwealth to support the implementation of the Government's smaller government agenda by abolishing seven Commonwealth bodies: 


the Central Trades Committee;


the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council;


the Product Stewardship Advisory Group;


the Advisory Group of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority;


the Plant Breeder's Rights Advisory Committee;


the Development Allowance Authority; and


the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee.


The Government is transforming the way services are delivered and how government operates to create a smaller, smarter and more productive sustainable public sector.


The rationalisation phase of the smaller government agenda is now largely complete following delivery of a comprehensive package of smaller government reforms. This comprehensive package was initiated prior to the 2014-15 Budget with decisions to abolish unnecessary advisory bodies and boards, agencies and statutory bodies. This was followed by a number of successive smaller government initiatives. 


Consistent with the smaller government agenda the Australian Government Governance Policy came into effect on 15 December 2014. This policy was designed with the intent of preventing the creation of unnecessary bureaucratic structures and ensuring existing Government structures are streamlined further over time. This policy also requires sunset or review dates to be set for all new Commonwealth bodies.


By the time of the 2017-18 Budget the smaller government agenda had announced savings of an estimated $1.5 billion through consolidating, merging and abolishing bodies.


The 2017-18 Budget also focused on transforming the way services are delivered and how government operates to create a smaller, smarter and more productive, sustainable public sector, better positioned to respond to the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and the continued need for fiscal discipline.


Since 2013, initiatives such as the smaller government agenda, contestability, Operation Tetris, and the efficiency dividends have generated efficiencies of around $7.6 billion in savings. The size of the General Government Sector (GGS) has also reduced. 


The Bill continues to deliver on the Government's comprehensive package of smaller government reforms, designed to cut waste and duplication, while improving the efficiency and focus of the Commonwealth public service.


The Bill has been prepared in consultation with affected Commonwealth entities and where relevant State consultations have taken place. 


I commend the Bill.


Debate adjourned.

"PRESIDENT, The",,2017-09-14,"



The PRESIDENT
 (15:02):  I wish to make a statement to the Senate about matters raised in points of order by Senator Wong yesterday. Before I do, can I ask senators to really reflect upon the behaviour in the chamber today. I want all senators to go away, reflect over the next few weeks and consider their behaviour. I know that tensions rise and some questions provoke more emotion than others, but please keep a check on the language used, the interjections and the emotion. I just ask all senators to reflect during the break.


In relation to the matters raised yesterday during question time by Senator Wong, I undertook to review two matters. The first involved the quotation by the Minister for Employment of derogatory language in an answer to a question about the building and construction industry.


On 29 February last year I made a statement about the quotation of such language. I indicated, first, that quoting something does not provide a shield for inappropriate language, secondly that I was concerned about the language being used but, thirdly, that I was also concerned about the rights of senators to express what they want to express in their answers.


I draw senators' attention in particular to the following part of that statement, which in my view also applies to the language quoted by the Minister yesterday:


Had the quotes been in relation to a protected person, there is no question that they would have been completely out of order and required to be withdrawn. Had the offensive words been scattered through a debate, it is highly likely that any chair in this place would have queried them as inappropriate … and where the language used is strictly necessary to make the point,—


where there is no protected person—


it makes it very difficult for the chair to prevent a senator from quoting such language or to require its withdrawal. If senators choose to enter this territory, they do so at their own responsibility—


and their own risk—


…   …   …


In exercising their judgement on whether to quote in full from sources containing offensive material, I would encourage senators to be mindful of the wider audience that views or listens to proceedings, including the frequent presence of young students in the public galleries.


I also draw senators' attention to privilege resolution 9, which reminds senators of their responsibilities when they exercise the great privilege of freedom of speech in this place.


On the second matter, Senator Wong asked that I consider whether the primary question asked by Senator Leyonhjelm of the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, yesterday should have been ruled out of order, on the basis that it was directed toward opposition, rather than government, policies. Under standing order 72(1), questions may be directed to ministers relating to public affairs. The standing order is supplemented by numerous rulings, including rulings about 'alternative policies'. Summarising these rulings, Odgers' Australian Senate Practice says:


A question which invites a minister to comment on the policies or actions of non-government parties is out of order unless the question seeks an expression of the government's intentions in some matter of ministerial responsibility.


As Senator Wong pointed out yesterday, you will find that on page 627 to 628 of the current edition of Odgers. The question was directed solely to opposition policies and should have been ruled out of order on that basis. Senator Cormann was correct in saying that:


… questions can be directed to ministers about public statements that they have made.


However, Senator Leyonhjelm's primary question was not directed to such statements.


Senator Wong also mentioned in passing that I have extended further latitude than previous presidents on 'alternative policy'. I would point out that examples of this can be found under my predecessor. However, I do agree with Senator Wong that a type of 'alternative policy creep' has occurred over a number of years. Therefore, I will be cognisant of this and invite all Senators to be mindful of this in their questions. So unless the question seeks an expression of the government's intentions in some matter of ministerial responsibility it will be ruled out of order. Whilst it cannot certainly have any impact upon the question asked yesterday, I will in future rule such questions out of order.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:17):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Cash) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Cameron today relating to the resignation of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner.


Well, wasn't Senator Cash—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, please resume your seat.




Senator Wong:
  A point of order: Senator Macdonald should withdraw. He shouted the word 'grub' across the chamber earlier. Some might say, 'Look in the mirror,' but I'd ask him to withdraw.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I said, 'Apologise, you grub,' and he should.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, we've just heard a lengthy statement from the President about the need to be respectful and the need to treat each other with respect. You were out of order in calling out. I would ask you, without repeating the offence, to withdraw that comment.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Well, I have repeated it. I will withdraw it. But, how about—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  A point of order, Deputy President!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Please resume your seat.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  A point of order!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I've asked you to resume your seat. I want some separation between you withdrawing those remarks and then seeking a point of order. Senator Macdonald?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  A point of order: Senator Wong, in taking the point of order, said, 'He should look in the mirror,' which means she is using this—can you sit down at least until I've finished, Senator Wong!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Can you sit down!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, resume your seat! I really should not have to repeat my statement that you be respectful. I should not have had to repeat that, and yet I did. I will now hear from Senator Wong.




Senator Wong:
  I withdraw.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Deputy President, will you allow me to finish my point of order?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I've heard enough on the point of order. Please resume your seat.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Oh, I see. You just hear as much as you want to.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Please resume your seat. I believe that Senator Wong has the call if she wishes to continue. Otherwise, I will go to Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Macdonald reflected on the Chair. He should withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind all senators of the statements made, not 10 minutes ago, by the President. I appreciate there is a lot of tension in the Senate, and I would ask all senators to be respectful of one another and to be respectful of the chair.




Senator CAMERON:
  I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Cash to questions asked by myself and Senator Wong. Well, wasn't it an uncharacteristically subdued performance from Senator Cash today, when she had to answer questions without prepared bile being flung against the trade union movement? Minister Cash knew about allegations against Mr Hadgkiss, allegations that were sufficiently robust to be vented in the Federal Court and sufficiently robust to be proved correct. They were sufficiently robust that Mr Hadgkiss had to concede that what was put before the court was correct.


Minister Cash either colluded with Mr Hadgkiss to cover up his illegal activity or was completely incompetent. Minister Cash had a responsibility to inquire as to whether there was any validity to the allegations that were being made against a very senior Commonwealth officer. Minister Cash failed to do this. She failed to do it because any cursory examination of the allegations that were being made would have resulted in the conclusion that the allegations were correct. Minister Cash failed to ensure that the law that applied in this country, that was under her portfolio, was applied correctly. Minister Cash just failed in the basics of what her responsibility was to ensure that the law was applied.


Did Minister Cash advise the Prime Minister or the cabinet of the allegations that were being made against Mr Hadgkiss? Because if even a cursory examination of those allegations had been made, it would be clear that the person being put forward for a very senior public service position was, in fact, a law-breaker. That is what would have been seen, yet this minister failed to do any examination of the allegations that were before the Federal Court. She continued to work with Mr Hadgkiss and promoted Mr Hadgkiss to a position that he should not have been entitled to take up, given his unlawful behaviour.


I wonder if the minister did disclose the cloud that was over Mr Hadgkiss to the cabinet? If she did, what was this cabinet doing appointing Mr Hadgkiss to a position in which he was supposed to uphold the law but in fact was breaking the law? He was the regulator who was supposed to uphold the law. When did Minister Cash advise the Prime Minister of the illegal behaviour of Mr Hadgkiss? Why didn't Minister Cash sack Nigel Hadgkiss, instead of allowing a two-week extension and providing him with $16,000 of public money while he had admitted to breaching the law? He was a self-confessed person who had undertaken illegal activity, yet he was rewarded by this minister with $16,000. He is a self-confessed law-breaker, given an extra $16,000 of public money by Minister Cash. If that had been some poor worker in a low-paid job trying to get access to the Fair Work Commission for unfair dismissal proceedings, Senator Cash would have waved that away and said, 'No, we don't want people to have access to unfair dismissal proceedings.' But this is a minister who knew that this person had acted illegally, who did not take steps to do anything proper about it, who should not be a minister in this place and who should resign. (Time expired)

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2017-09-14,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (15:25):  I note that the Labor Party didn't want to take note of the questions in their grubby attack on Senator O'Sullivan. Perhaps they are reflecting on their grubby tactics when it comes to that. But when it comes to these questions before the Senate at the moment, let's be clear about the difference in standards between this government and the coalition and the Labor Party and their union mates. We've got, on the one hand, Mr Hadgkiss, who has been forced to resign as a result of activity. I understand allegations were confirmed of failing to update a website. There is no doubt that we take the law very seriously and, be they minor breaches or more serious breaches, we have shown the kinds of standards that we will hold officials to. But let's be clear about the alternative and the absolute contrast in the way that the Labor Party treat criminals and law-breakers, the very people who put them in this place.


Let's have a look at some of those people who we are talking about who have breached the Fair Work Act and, in fact, all sorts of other legislation. Labor Party senators here owe their spots in the Senate to some of these criminals and some of these organisations which have engaged in criminality, corruption, standover tactics and violence. They will never condemn them, because they own them. The modern Labor Party is but the subsidiary arm of groups, criminal organisations, like the CFMEU, led by people like John Setka. John Setka is supported by Labor senators in this place and of course the Leader of the Opposition. John Setka has twice been jailed for contempt of court. He is currently facing serious charges of blackmail. In 2015, the Federal Court found him guilty of coercion. Recently, in front of cheering crowds at a CFMEU rally, he said there was nothing wrong with breaking the law before saying disgraceful things about the police and threatening ABCC inspectors.


These are the kind of people that those opposite are close to. They are not just close to them; they are funded by them. They are funded by groups like the CFMEU and by Mr Setka and Joe McDonald, the National President of the CFMEU. He has been found by the courts to have breached industrial law 53 times. He has criminal convictions for assault, trespass and contempt of court. Luke Collier is the labour hire and youth organiser for the CFMEU in Western Australia. Luke Collier has been jailed for violent assault. In 2016, Mr Collier was found guilty of attempting to intimidate an FWBC inspector at the Barangaroo site, using disgraceful language. I am not going to repeat that language, Deputy President, because it is too disgraceful to be quoted in here. It is the lowest level of language.


But of course it goes well beyond that with some of those criminals that I have mentioned. We saw during the royal commission some of these standover merchants and some of this extortion. We have seen violence from the Labor Party's mates. They are not just their mates; they are the people who put Labor senators into this place and Labor members into the House. They are the people who support Bill Shorten and keep Bill Shorten in his role.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  A point, Senator Seselja—




Senator SESELJA:
  That is, Mr Shorten. They are the people who keep the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, in his role—the likes of John Setka.


Mr Hadgkiss has paid a heavy price for failing to update a website. There is no doubt about that. He has paid a heavy price and he has lost his job. I compare him to his opponents, for whom there is no accountability from the Labor Party, such as the likes of John Setka. This is what John Setka had to say in a tweet:


Good riddance to the rat that is Nigel Hadgkiss. From the widows and families of construction workers, may you rot in hell.


I am going to table this tweet from Mr Setka. That is disgraceful; it is disgusting. I table the document.




Senator Polley:
  You need to seek leave.




Senator SESELJA:
  No, I don't. John Setka and his likes are the kind of people who are supported by the Labor Party. I would be very, very happy to compare and contrast. (Time expired)

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:30):  Well, what have we seen in here again today? Hypocrisy at the highest level. But what was different about today with Senator Cash was that her performance for her backbench really was less than a D—it really was. We know that when she comes into this place at question time she has her Dorothy Dixers all ready, she has rehearsed in front of the mirror, she is out there and she is stalking, trying to emphasise what she is trying to put over not only us on this side but also the general public. Well, today she wasn't that minister at all. That's because she knows that she has done the wrong thing. She definitely has done the wrong thing, and the appointment of Mr Nigel Hadgkiss is firmly at her feet.


Now, why would a minister, who had known for around 12 months that somebody had broken the law, once that had come to light after two months, then appoint such a person to a job that pays $460,000 a year? At the same time, this government always comes into this place and makes these allegations, like Senator Seselja. Once again, it wasn't a great performance. The unfortunate thing is that when they start attacking people on this side of the chamber and when they are making their assertions that somehow I'm here because of the CFMEU, it is just plainly wrong. The assertions that we are all trying to protect some unionists who have done the wrong thing is wrong. Never once have I ever come into this chamber and defended anything that the CFMEU has done or any individuals have done.


The minister today, in trying to deflect away from the explanation that she should have been giving as to why she should in fact resign from being a minister, was trying to assert that the language that has been used by these males allegedly has been defended by those on this side of the chamber. Well, I would have to say, with the Minister for Women saying that, I'm offended. I'm absolutely offended that the minister would make that sort of allegation in the chamber. But, as always, what we see from this government is them doing whatever it takes. They will throw a bomb over this side and expect that we are just going to sit here and take it.


Well, the table was turned today, because the minister was unable to defend her appointment to a very senior position. Mr Hadgkiss was hand-picked and appointed as the ABCC. They said, 'Oh, well, he lost his job.' The only reason he lost his job was that he got to be too much for the minister. He should have been sacked The hypocrisy in this place from those on that side never ceases to amaze me. I know they think that the community out there are silly. Obviously they do think that, because otherwise they wouldn't come in here and have such double standards that are just so obvious. This government are in such disarray. We have a minister who likes to throw out allegations and tarnish everyone with the same brush and who can't defend her position when Mr Hadgkiss should have been sacked. It is quite funny, really. When Minister Nash got up today, I thought for a moment there she was trying to outperform Senator Cash in her defence today of a question that was directed towards her.


The reality is that this government is seen for what it is. It is a dysfunctional government that has ministers, such as the Deputy Prime Minister, that it is questionable should be here. We have Minister Nash, whose status is questionable, yet she starts lecturing the people on this side, and we have a minister who has clearly demonstrated today that she isn't fit to hold that position. She also has a glass jaw. She can throw it out. She can overdramatise and do her dramatic moves to try to be emphatic. But what she has failed to do today in any shape or form is defend the decision she made to appoint this man. (Time expired)

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-09-14,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:35):  What an extraordinary outburst from Senator Polley. But it shouldn't be surprising after what we saw in question time today. The issue of Nigel Hadgkiss was made perfectly clear by Senator Nash. The claims against Mr Hadgkiss first came to Senator Nash's attention in October 2016 when the CFMEU sought to add the Commonwealth as a respondent to its proceedings. They were only allegations before a court, and they were contested. As you well know, Senator Polley, it would have been entirely inappropriate to prejudge the outcome of such court proceedings.



Senator Polley interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Polley.




Senator HUME:
  It is totally staggering that the Labor Party is suggesting that any individual should be summarily sacked as soon as an untested allegation is made against them and without any form of due process. That is an astounding suggestion coming from a Labor Party and opposition completely beholden to the CFMEU. It was, in fact, only this Tuesday night that Mr Hadgkiss admitted to a contravention of the Fair Work Act, and he summarily submitted his resignation to the government that evening.


We have said time and time again that this is a government that firmly believes in the rule of law. Unlike the Labor Party, this is a government that practises what it preaches. Our commitment to upholding the rule of law stands in stark contrast to that of those opposite, the leaders of Australia's trade union movement and their supporters. When it comes down to it, this is really nothing more than a smokescreen from those opposite to cover up the extraordinary revelations that we heard yesterday when the CFMEU was handed unprecedented penalties for its concerted campaign of industrial lawlessness at the Barangaroo building site in Sydney. The judgements and incredible fines—they were fined $2.4 million—that came out yesterday demonstrated the utter contempt that the corrupt CFMEU has for the law, which is echoed in the words of Sally McManus from the ACTU that there is nothing wrong with breaking the law.


This government will not be lectured by those who hold such contempt. The recidivist, militant CFMEU officials continue to believe that the law doesn't apply to them. Enough is enough. The opposition leader, Mr Shorten, must immediately and unreservedly cut ties with what has become Australia's most notorious union. I want to quote from the judgement yesterday. This extraordinary announcement is from Justice Flick:


It is difficult to perceive how such conduct can be regarded as in the best interests of the bulk of its members and the workers it supposedly represents. Such conduct may promote the CFMEU as a ""militant"" union. But the constraints imposed by the law apply to all including the CFMEU.


What I find most galling is that, in a week when the world sits at a point of military brinkmanship on the Korean peninsula, the likes of which we haven't seen since the Cuban missile crisis, and a week where successive failures of Labor state governments and Labor federal governments have left our nation on the brink of a looming energy crisis that quite clearly only the Turnbull government has any solution for whatsoever, no alternative policies have been presented by those opposite. The Turnbull government is clearly the only government capable of providing a solution. In a week when economic data is finally showing the green shoots of a flourishing economy—more jobs; 250,000 jobs in just over six months, 80 per cent of which are full-time—in this week, when we have this news, this is the subject that the opposition chooses to pursue: Mr Hadgkiss's resignation. The integrity deficit of those opposite is as broad as it is deep. These militant unions not only own your party, but they own your souls and, as demonstrated today, you are an opposition that lacks both substance and civility.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (15:40):  I will get to some of the comments that have been made in response, but I do want to make a comparison between Senator Cash's rather unsophisticated manner, indeed her rant, about unions, and her statement in relation to Mr Hadgkiss. In her answers, she said that no-one on this side of the chamber has ever worried or condemned a union or union officials who break the law. She is wrong. She is so wrong that we on this side of the chamber always laugh at her when she says it. Of course we condemn unlawful behaviour. We know better than anyone on the other side of the chamber the cost to members of unions, and to those who aren't union members but who benefit from the terms and conditions that unions negotiate on work sites, when unions do not act in accordance with the law. Of course we know that that is wrong. I'm going to come to the moral question of having clients, knowing people who act immorally. I'm going to come to that later in relation to Senator Cash and the foreign minister. 


Senator Hume had some factual inaccuracies in her speech taking note. For many months Senator Cash has kept on the head of the ABCC while knowing—she actively had knowledge, so it wasn't constructive knowledge; it was active knowledge—for 11 months, Mr Hadgkiss had breached the very act, the very piece of legislation he was supposed to be upholding and the regulations he was supposed to be enforcing. Senator Hume said, 'We only knew on Tuesday night.' That is factually inaccurate. There was an agreed statement of facts that was tendered to the Federal Court earlier this week. An agreed statement of facts does not just happen in one day. So for some time Senator Cash must have known that the head of her agency had acted improperly and was in fact prepared to admit it in the Federal Court this week. 


This isn't the first part of the time line. In fact, it was in December 2013 that Mr Hadgkiss acted improperly. That's some time ago. Then what happened was that in October 2016 the minister became aware of it. Then this week she gave a statement saying, 'We wish Mr Hadgkiss all the very best for his future.' What kind of minister does something like that? Mr Hadgkiss acted improperly. He was head of an agency. It is really quite unbelievable. What was her response when she learnt about it? This is three years after the improper actions, by the way. After that, even then she doesn't act. Does she ever get briefed by the department? Does she ever meet the agency heads or agency senior staff? Because of course it wasn't just Mr Hadgkiss who was aware of this: she decided to ignore the warnings of the senior staff at the ABCC who also knew that Mr Hadgkiss was acting improperly. 



In her answer she also asserted that Senator Wong was somehow a questionable lawyer because she had union clients. That would be like my saying, for example, about that the member for Curtin—who is also a former lawyer—that she is a former lawyer, albeit one who acted for CSR, a criminal asbestos company who knowingly poisoned workers with their toxic products. When the foreign minister was one of the lawyers for CSR, she decided that the best tactic there was to delay, delay and delay the trial in the Barrow and Heys case, so that those people dying of mesothelioma would not receive full compensation. What a totally immoral way of behaving—tick-tock, tick-tock, waiting for the victims of asbestos poisoning to die so that her client did not have to pay the full compensation. But it seems that Senator Cash and the member for Curtin are perhaps peas in a pod. (Time expired)

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:51):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present Report No. 465:Commonwealth procurement, and I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The tabling statement read as follows—



This report sets out the findings of the Committee's inquiry on Commonwealth procurement, based on three Australian National Audit Office reports concerning this matter.


Chapter 2 of the report discusses the Committee's findings on Audit Report No. 1, concerning Airservices' procurement of the International Centre for Complex Project Management—ICCPM—for the OneSKY program.


Achieving value for money is expected to be a central consideration of Commonwealth procurement activities. However, as the Auditor-General noted at the Committee's public hearing, Airservices' approach to contracting the Centre was 'ineffective in providing value-for-money outcomes'. Airservices made extensive use of ICCPM to assist with the delivery of OneSKY, with 42 engagements of employees and subcontractors through 18 procurement processes, but each of these 42 engagements was sole-sourced. Airservices had also 'routinely failed' to adhere to its procurement policies and procedures. In addition, the Auditor-General raised concerns about Airservices' management of probity risks for this procurement.


The Committee concluded that Airservices' procurement management was problematic on a number of fronts. While Airservices had made progress in implementing the audit recommendations, we recommended that Airservices provide the Committee with a post-implementation progress report for each of these recommendations. The Committee also recommended that Airservices report back on a number of matters to demonstrate its improved management of probity in procurement. The Department of Finance should also consolidate procurement guidance for corporate Commonwealth entities to ensure more strict application of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules.


A companion audit, Audit Report No. 46, Conduct of the OneSKY Tender, was tabled by the ANAO while the Committee was conducting its inquiry. Given the probity findings in Audit Report No. 1, the Committee noted the ANAO's conclusion that the OneSKY tender process was 'appropriate' and that the tender evaluation governance 'guarded against the conflict of interest issues identified in Audit Report No. 1 impacting on the tender evaluation process'.


However, given the ANAO's other findings from this audit—including that it was 'not clearly evident the successful tender offered the best value for money'—we recommended that Airservices report back to the Committee on its progress in implementing the findings of Audit Report No. 46. Further, as criterion 3 of the ANAO's objective in this audit was not able to be examined, the Committee recommended that the ANAO consider conducting a third stage audit into Airservices' conduct of the OneSKY tender and any associated matters, once the contract for the entire acquisition has been executed, to complete its audit objective on this matter.


Chapter 3 of the report discusses the Committee's findings on Audit Report No. 13, concerning the Department of Immigration and Border Protection's management of the contract to provide health services for onshore immigration detention.


The Committee noted the ANAO's conclusion that this contract 'was developed by the department based on a strategic analysis of shortcomings that had arisen under earlier contracts'. However, the ANAO identified areas for improvement in the department's contract management, particularly in relation to performance monitoring. We therefore recommended that the department provide the Committee with a progress report on: the implementation of appropriate performance monitoring of the contractor; implementing its risk-based remediation plan; progress with finalising key performance documents; and outcomes of any targeted audits it undertakes of the contractors' policies and procedures against relevant benchmarks.


Chapter 4 of the report discusses the Committee's findings on Audit Report No. 16 concerning the procurement of garrison support and welfare services in offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. 


The Committee noted the ANAO's finding that there were significant deficiencies in all three phases of audit activity by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The Committee acknowledged that the department was operating in a complex and rapidly evolving environment under exceptional time pressure during the establishment of the contracts. However, the Committee considered that the department ought to have taken steps to improve its procurement activity within a reasonable time, particularly in relation to the subsequent phases of consolidation of the contracts and retendering. The Committee also noted the ANAO's finding concerning ongoing issues with the department's record keeping practices, including in relation to conflicts of interest, assessments and performance management of contracts.


The conduct and outcomes of the tender processes reviewed by the ANAO highlighted procurement skill and capability gaps amongst departmental officers. Procurement is core business for Commonwealth entities and the Committee welcomes the department's acceptance of the recommendations of the ANAO and its stated commitment to improve its procurement processes.


The Committee recommended that the department provide a post-implementation progress report on its implementation of the audit recommendations, and that the ANAO consider conducting a performance audit of the department's next procurement process in this area.


In conclusion, by taking a thematic approach to some of our inquiries, as we have done in this report, the Committee seeks to encourage improvements and shared learning in key areas of public administration. Effective Commonwealth procurement will continue to be a strong focus of the Joint Committee for Public Accounts and Audit in its role in scrutinising the governance, performance and accountability of Commonwealth agencies. Procurement is core business for Commonwealth agencies, and achieving value for money is expected to be a central consideration.


I thank Committee members for their deliberation on these significant matters.


I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (16:27):  I table documents relating to orders for the production of documents concerning alcohol and drug rehabilitation services and the government's response to the report of the Community Affairs References Committee concerning the prostheses list framework, and I seek leave to have the response incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The response read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee report: Pricing regulation associated with the Prostheses List framework





September 2017





Community Affairs References Committee





Pricing regulation associated with the Prostheses List framework





Introduction





The Australian Government recognises the important role that medical devices play in the overall health of Australian patients and the need to maintain a stable, sustainable and innovative medical 
device sector. In 2016-17, 2.7 million medical devices on the Prostheses List were supplied at a cost of $2.1 billion.





The Australian Government further recognises that reform of the prostheses listing arrangements and price regulation is necessary to put downward pressure on private health insurance premiums for consumers.





In early 2016 the Government initiated an Industry Working Group (IWG) on Private Health Insurance Prostheses Reform, chaired by Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom AO, seeking views from stakeholders about the factors that were influencing costs of medical devices and impacting on private health insurance benefits paid for prostheses.





The Government reconstituted the Prostheses List Advisory Committee (PLAC) in October 2016 to address the issues raised in the work of the IWG, to develop detailed reform options for the Government to consider, in collaboration with stakeholders.





The Committee's Inquiry has been invaluable in drawing information and views from stakeholders, and highlighting the challenges faced by the PLAC and Government in developing and implementing reforms to prostheses price regulation. There is a high level of consistency between the Committee's findings and the PLAC's reform work plan.





In addition to reforms through the PLAC, the Australia Government has initiated new pricing reforms to reduce the cost of thousands of medical devices to take pressure off private health insurance premiums for Australians.





In a first tranche of cost reductions passed onto 13.5 million Australians with private health insurance, the government reduced the cost of medical devices as set by the Prostheses List by 10 per cent for cardiac devices and intraocular lenses and 7.5 per cent for hip and knee replacements from 1 February 2017. This reduced costs for private health insurance members by an estimated $86 million in the first year, and a further estimated $500 million over the next six years.





The Government has asked the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority to provide data in relation to average public sector prostheses costs, average public sector private insurance payments for prostheses and average private sector prostheses costs.





The data shows differences in the prices of prostheses related procedures between private and public sectors. Government is consulting with the medical device sector on a second tranche of cost savings to be delivered from 2018 to further improve the cost of private health insurance and deliver pricing stability for the sector.





The Australian Government welcomes the report, has carefully considered the recommendations and provides the following responses.





Recommendation 1





The committee recommends that the Prostheses List Advisory Committee, in consultation with stakeholders, develop and publish a formal work plan with defined agreed targets, activities, timeframes, indicators and outcomes to assist stakeholders to better understand and participate in the reform process; and





Recommendation 5





The committee recommends that the Prostheses List Advisory Committee continue to consult with stakeholders regarding reform of the Prostheses List to ensure transparency of the reform process.





Response:
 The Australian Government agrees that the reform work undertaken by the Prostheses List Advisory Committee (PLAC) should be transparent to all stakeholders.





The PLAC is taking a collaborative approach to prostheses reform, and has published a workplan on its website. The PLAC has committed to keeping stakeholders informed, engaged and consulted 
throughout the reform process through a range of mechanisms, including releasing communiques after each meeting.





The PLAC will develop a communication strategy with input invited from all stakeholders to guide future engagement.





The Department is regularly updating the PLAC website to provide more information about PLAC activities and timeframes as these are developed and agreed, and has established a consultation ""hub"", which enables stakeholders to participate in reforms by accessing consultation papers and providing views.





Recommendation 2





The committee recommends that the department immediately implement better and more robust coordination between the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Prostheses List Advisory Committee, including implementing appropriate coordination of health technology assessment processes to ensure that applications to list on the Prostheses List as a minimum have a concurrent application for listing on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.





Response:
 The Government notes this recommendation. Parallel processing of applications to register new medical devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) and list on the Prostheses List is an important part of the existing health technology assessment processes, and assists with earlier patient access to important new technologies.





The form to apply to list a new device on the Prostheses List for reimbursement includes a checkbox for applicants to confirm that an application has been made to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for registration.





The Government supports better and more efficient coordination of health technology assessment between the PLAC and the TGA.





The PLAC's reform workplan includes ""Minimising duplication and improving the listing process"", and the PLAC has commenced identifying opportunities for aligning and streamlining processes with those of the TGA.





The TGA assesses safety and performance for the device's intended purpose, and the PLAC assesses comparative clinical effectiveness and cost relative to comparators. However, there are features that are common to both assessment processes. Mapping of processes to find opportunities for alignment and to reduce duplication is underway, and the PLAC membership includes an advisor from the TGA.





The PLAC Chair hosted a Health Technology Assessment Roundtable on 9 June 2017. Expert members of the PLAC, Chairs of the Clinical Advisory Groups (CAGs), members of the Panel of





Clinical Experts (the Panel), members of the TGA's Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (ACMD) and the Chair of the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) participated in discussion about the health technology assessment processes of each committee and how the combined clinical expertise and health economics expertise could be used to achieve better outcomes.





The outcomes of the Roundtable were published on the PLAC's website and are being translated into action plans for developing processes and protocols for sharing resources in application assessment and post market surveillance.





The Medical Technology Association of Australia has also agreed to assist in developing Questions and Answers that will help medical device sponsors to better understand the parallel processing pathway.





In addition the Government is consulting with the MTAA and other stakeholders on enhanced reforms that could be introduced to minimise the time taken for approvals to ensure that patients being treated in the private sector are able to access safe, effective and cost effective medical devices available in the public sector.





Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that clinical input through Clinical Advisory Groups remain an integral part of the Prostheses List Advisory Committee and the Prostheses List decision making process to ensure that safety and effectiveness of medical devices remains a primary consideration in decisions about inclusion on the Prostheses List.





Response
: The Government agrees to this recommendation. Clinician input is and will remain an integral part of Prostheses List decision making.





The PLAC has recently updated the Terms of Reference and Operational Guidelines for the Clinical Advisory Groups and Panel of Clinical Experts to reflect their roles in providing expert clinical advice.





The revenue received from Prostheses List cost recovery is primarily used for supporting clinician input into the application and listing processes.





Recommendation 4





The committee recommends that the Government assess the resources needed to develop and implement reforms within an agreed timeframe and provide any further resources to the Prostheses List Advisory Committee and the Department of Health.





Response:
 The Government notes this recommendation.





The Department and the PLAC are currently reviewing the cost recovery arrangements that fund the operations of the Prostheses List, and will consider the resources required to support the implementation of agreed reforms as they are developed.





Recommendation 6





The committee recommends that where the Commonwealth decides that a prostheses registry is needed, the Parliament should ensure that the registry is legislated for and collection of data is made compulsory.





Response:
 The Australian Government notes this recommendation.





There are already a number of Commonwealth government and industry funded devices registries (including the National Joint Replacement Registry). The Commonwealth is working with state and territory health department representatives to develop a national policy and funding framework for clinical quality registries, which will include consideration of other prostheses registries and mandatory collection of data.





Recommendation 7





The committee recommends that the Government legislate for the compulsory provision of private hospital and day surgery data to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority.





Response:
 The Government notes this recommendation.





The National Health Reform Act 2011 specifies that the provision of costing information in relation to the calculation of an efficient price (by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority (IHPA) is only applied to public hospital services in Australia. Cost information from the private sector is provided to the IHPA on a voluntary basis. The IHPA currently reports on this information through the National Hospital Cost Data Collection, Private Sector Cost Report for each year.





The Government will continue to encourage the provision of data by all relevant stakeholders to inform improved policy and planning processes.





Recommendation 8





The committee recommends that action is needed to reduce the prostheses costs and that savings should be delivered as soon as possible and have an evidence base.





Response:
 The Government agrees in principle, and recognises the need to work with medical device sponsors, health providers, private hospitals, day hospitals and private health insurers to identify 
ways to reduce prostheses costs without reducing patient outcomes, or reducing the value of private health insurance to Australian consumers.





Data provided by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority (IHPA) on prostheses pricing in public and private hospitals has identified price differences, which are now the subject of consultation with stakeholders and consideration of a further tranche of price reforms in 2018. Along with data and information from stakeholders, and the PLAC's advice on the outcomes of targeted reviews, this will assist the Government to identify potential changes to prostheses benefits.





Recommendation 9





The committee recommends that guidelines for targeted prostheses reviews be finalised at the earliest opportunity and published with a schedule of proposed targeted reviews to enable stakeholders sufficient time to prepare for the reviews.





Response:
 The Government agrees in principle to this recommendation. The PLAC has commenced targeted reviews of prostheses listings in the hip, knee, cardiac and spinal categories to inform options to improve arrangements and identify potential reductions in private health insurance expenditure. These reviews are being conducted in collaboration with stakeholders, including medical device sponsors, private hospitals, day hospitals and private health insurers, as well as consumers.





The PLAC has published its draft Approach for Targeted Prostheses Reviews on the department's website and invited feedback from stakeholders. The department received eleven responses, and this feedback is assisting in scoping and planning targeted reviews.





The PLAC has committed to publishing the plan for each review so that stakeholders can prepare and provide input. This includes setting out a consultation strategy to seek the views of stakeholders on options, impacts and implementation considerations.





Recommendation 10





The committee recommends that the Department of Health undertake further analysis and consultation, including with consumers, to determine the most appropriate benefit setting model or models, and that this analysis include investigation of the introduction of outcomes based categorisation of items on the Prostheses List, and the option of the government purchasing devices directly.





Response:
 The Government notes this recommendation, and recognises the need for further work on a future benefit-setting framework.





The Department of Health commissioned preliminary research from the Centre for Health Policy at University of Melbourne on possible pricing models for medical devices and how they could be applied to the prostheses listing arrangements. Input from stakeholders was taken into consideration to ensure a broad understanding of potential impacts. The final report on this research is available on the Department of Health website.





Further work to develop an evidence-based benefit-setting framework for prostheses will occur in consultation with stakeholders.





Recommendation 11





The committee recommends that the Prostheses List Advisory Committee be required to review the group prices for prostheses when applications for new comparable devices are received which request listing at a lower price than the existing benefit level for that group of devices.





Response: 
The Government notes this recommendation.





It is intended that the PLAC will develop an approach to reviewing the benefits for prostheses as





part of building the evidence-based benefit-setting framework for prostheses. As part of this work, the PLAC will consider appropriate triggers to initiate reviews and provide advice on options to the Government.





In the interim, the category-based targeted reviews will consider the current benefits for prostheses with reference to available data on pricing.





Recommendation 12





The committee recommends that the Minister for Health release new Independent Hospital Pricing Authority data on the differences between prostheses prices in private and public hospitals and investigate whether this could be used to adjust Prostheses List Advisory Committee prostheses prices as soon as possible.





Response:
 The Government agrees to this recommendation. The Minister for Health has consulted with stakeholders on prostheses cost data as supplied to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority (IHPA) with a view to using this information to assist with developing reforms to





prostheses listing arrangements. The IHPA data shows that prostheses costs in the public sector are, on average, lower than in the private sector for comparable patient types, classified by Diagnosis Related Group. However these data do not fully take into account differences in the type and use of prostheses in the private and public sectors. The Government will seek further advice from the Medical Technologies Association of Australia and other parties on additional data sources.





Recommendation 13





The committee recommends that the Prostheses List Advisory Committee further investigate rationalisation of the Prostheses List to reduce its size as an important element in reviewing and reforming the benefit setting process.





Response: 
The Government agrees to this recommendation. The PLAC has commenced reviewing the criteria for listing devices on the Prostheses List. In addition, the PLAC is reviewing devices that are currently listed on the Prostheses List to consider any opportunities for lower cost and/or high volume devices to be reimbursed more efficiently through other mechanisms.





The targeted reviews of prostheses will also consider the current grouping schemes for prostheses and seek opportunities for reducing their complexity. This work will contribute to streamlining the Prostheses List.





The work to review the listing criteria and streamline the grouping schemes will be undertaken in consultation with stakeholders, to provide advice to Government on options.





Recommendation 14





The committee recommends that the department investigate the impact of the 25 per cent market share requirement and its role in distorting the market.





Response:
 The 25 per cent market share guide is not a requirement for setting benefits on the Prostheses List. It was an historical guide to establish single benefits for groups of devices on the Prostheses List in the absence of pricing data being available.





The PLAC will develop options for an evidence-based benefit-setting framework for the future, in consultation with stakeholders, to inform advice to the Government.





Recommendation 15





The committee recommends that the Prostheses List Advisory Committee investigate a mechanism for the reimbursement of medical devices not currently eligible for inclusion on the Prostheses List, including non-implantable devices and implantable devices not requiring hospital admission.





Response:
 The Government notes this recommendation, and the need to balance the objectives of keeping private health insurance affordable, and ensuring that insurance policies provide cover for appropriate health care to meet the needs of policy holders.





The PLAC has commenced reviewing the criteria for listing devices on the Prostheses List, which will include discussion of devices that do not meet the current listing criteria, such as cardiac pressure wires, drug eluting balloon catheters and cardiac ablation catheters. In this review process, the PLAC will also have regard to other reimbursement options, such as theatre banding and case-based payments. The PLAC will consult with stakeholders in developing options for Government on possible revisions to the listing criteria.





Recommendation 16





The committee recommends that the nature and cost of services associated with a medical device on the Prostheses List be disclosed separately to the cost of the device.





Response:
 The Government agrees to this recommendation. The PLAC is working to develop an evidence-based benefit-setting framework for prostheses for the future.





In this context, the PLAC will consider the costs of medically relevant services and other cost factors in supplying prostheses to patients, and how these costs are identified and reported.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:29):  I would firstly like to clarify that the Greens' amendments on sheet 8171 are being withdrawn. We have circulated amendments on sheets 8266 and 8265. I just wanted to make sure that people are aware of that.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Yes.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I would like to go to our first amendment, which is on sheet 8266. This amendment is about the most controversial aspect of this legislation—the two-out-of-three rule. We've heard much debate already today about this issue and whether it will indeed lead to a further concentration of media. On the other hand, there is the argument that this is perhaps needed in order to save those institutions that already exist from having to shed further staff and to give them more of an ability to underpin their business models.


I am particularly concerned about the scrapping of the two-out-of-three rule—and we know that, with the Nick Xenophon Team and One Nation, the government has support to remove this from the current statute books. The concern that I have is in relation to the newly acquired Channel 10. We know that there is currently a successful bid from CBS to buy Channel 10, but there is also a question mark over whether CBS will be allowed to follow through with that acquisition, because it is a foreign-owned company. We know from the tabling of documents in the New South Wales court over the last couple of days that this bid would do a lot more for securing jobs for journalists and local production staff at Channel 10 than the Murdoch-Gordon bid would ever have been able to achieve. I am concerned that, without some kind of commitment from the government that they will back the CBS acquisition, we are leaving Channel 10 staff in a state of limbo, unaware of what the future holds for them. I want to make sure that scrapping the two-out-of-three rule isn't going to be used as a fast-tracking for the government to override the purchase of Channel 10 by CBS through the Foreign Investment Review Board.


This Greens amendment would effectively say that the two-out-of-three rule cannot be scrapped until the government confirms that CBS can take over Channel 10, through the approval of the Treasurer and the Foreign Investment Review Board—that the removal of the two-out-of-three wouldn't be able to happen until confirmation of acquisition occurred. That is the effect of this amendment. However, I do have some questions for the minister on this. Minister, I'd like to know what the government's intention is in relation to CBS's acquisition of Channel 10. Will you confirm that you will allow it to go ahead?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (16:34):  FIRB matters are ones for the Treasurer. Can I indicate while I'm on my feet that the government will be opposing this amendment. The amendment would be ineffective as there is no approval action undertaken by the Treasurer under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. To require the Treasurer to publish details of a decision taken under the act would result in him breaching the act's confidentiality provisions. As this is the purchase of a media business, it is a significant and notifiable action under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulation. When a foreign person undertakes a significant and notifiable action, the Treasurer has the ability to prohibit the action or to issue a no-objection notification imposing conditions on the acquisition or the Treasurer may decide the Commonwealth has no objection to the acquisition, in which case a no-objection notification is given. There is no approval under the act for a significant and notifiable action.

 (New South Wales) (16:36):  Labor understand the sentiment behind these Greens amendments, but we do not support it or the precedent it may set. We do agree it's a matter for the Treasurer. The situation with the Ten Network is complex and is currently before the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Labor have been on the record as clearly supporting the CBS acquisition of Ten, subject to approval. We think it's a positive thing. In her comments, the shadow minister, Michelle Rowland, the member for Greenway, pointed out, I think very poignantly, that the transaction is a positive result for the staff of Ten and a vote of confidence in the network, which is indeed regarded as a prime broadcaster asset by many Australians and certainly by Leslie Moonves, the chairman and CEO of the CBS Corporation. We think that acquisition in this form is good news for the provision of news and current affairs. We think it actually demonstrates that diversification of news is possible and can be maintained in the current environment, contrary to the alarmist commentary of the government which has underpinned much of the contentious debate in the Senate.

I would like to speak on Labor's amendments to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. I have made some remarks earlier, but in the context of our amendments I want to put on the record that we believe the Turnbull government's response here is deeply flawed and wholly inadequate as an attempt at media reform. Labor's clear and consistent position has been that Labor supports this bill as long as schedule 2, which is the repeal of the two-out-of-three cross media rule, is omitted. If that had happened, we would have passed this legislation, this reform, months and months ago. But the government has been bloody-minded about this and pushed through with the deals that we saw under construction last night.


Labor absolutely acknowledges the commercial pressures the broadcasting sector is under and we understand that the regulatory framework for media and communications is outdated and in need of reform. That is why we supported most of the package, except for the two-out-of-three rule. But all the Liberal-National government has managed to come up in the name of media reform, after four years in office, are some piecemeal deregulatory measures, one of which is the highly controversial and dangerous repeal of the two-out-of-three rule. The bill barely begins to address the true media reform agenda and does precious little to secure public interest considerations in the contemporary media environment.


Labor is committed to supporting the Australian media industry, as well as the jobs and content it produces, as the sector continues to adapt to the new media environment. Labor acknowledges the competitive pressures the broadcasting industry is under, which is why Labor supports the measures the industry needs most—license fee relief, the repeal of the 75 per cent reach rule, and a relaxation of the antisiphoning scheme and list. Lots of it we've agreed with, except for the two-out-of-three rule. At the same time, Labor is committed to safeguarding the public interest in our democracy, and doesn't regard the internet or the existence of Google or Facebook as a justification for the junking of fundamental public interest safeguards.


Labor also acknowledges the facts around media ownership diversity in this country. To get it on the record at this stage of the debate, a couple of those facts are very important to us. Australia's level of media ownership concentration is already one of the highest in the world. This is an undeniable fact, regardless of what might have been said in the course of this debate. The traditional media—newspapers, commercial television and commercial radio—continue to be the main source of news and current affairs for Australians, particularly in regional areas. The majority of the top 10 news websites accessed by Australians are either directly or jointly owned by traditional media platforms. It's just the same voices on different platforms. The digital divide means that access to new media still remains out of reach for many Australians, given substandard levels of broadband connectivity. It is particularly the case for many Australians in rural and regional areas. We've had many debates about the accessibility of Australians right across this nation to what has been described as the multimedia platforms that can be delivered by the internet. The problem is a lot of people out there in the country can't afford to buy into the dodgy internet that's being provided for them by this government.


Our other serious concern is about issues of diversity of ownership and control. They matter to the Australian public. We get a better democracy if we have a range of voices reflecting on what's going on in this country. Fewer voices is not a sign of a strong and healthy democracy. We have such a concentrated media market as it is. An Essential poll last year showed that the majority of Australian voters, 61 per cent, across every single demographic disapproved of changing the media ownership laws to allow a single company to control a newspaper, TV network and radio network in the same area. It would have been good if the government listened to the people instead of listening to the conversations that they've had in the darkness here in the parliament—out of the light and the scrutiny of the Senate. 


Unlike the coalition government, Labor understands that it's the proper role of government to promote media diversity in the public interest. Labor understands that the government does not have the balance between promotion of public interest and support for the industry right in this bill. For these reasons, Labor supports all of the measures in the bill except for the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule, which is ill-conceived, not justified on the evidence, and which risks undermining Australia's democracy.


As I said, the Turnbull government has been trying to get the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule through parliament for up to 18 months now, and they haven't been able to do so on merit. I made comments earlier in the day about the nature of the deals that have gone on here. Senator Dastyari, in the break just before question time, spelt them out in great and dirty detail. The dealings with the Nick Xenophon Team for public interest journalism have been conducted behind closed doors. 


Australia already has one of the most concentrated media markets in the world, but we've got a government hell-bent on making it worse by repealing the two-out-of-three media control rule. The recent move by CBS to acquire Network Ten is very important in the context of this bill and the deals that have been agreed. The two-out-of-three rule is indeed a key safeguard that continues to do the heavy lifting in maintaining media diversity in Australia. The Turnbull government's argument, that the rule is out of date, is simply out of touch with the practical reality that's emerging with the CBS purchase of Channel 10.


What's more, the Turnbull government continues to peddle the furphy that existing competition law is actually adequate for the task performed by the very important two-out-of-three rule—that is despite their claims being debunked in previous reviews. The recent ACCC decision on the proposed Birketu-Illyria joint bid to acquire Network Ten confirms that our competition laws have no safeguard for diversity in this very important part of our democratic tradition. ACCC chair Rod Sims was at pains to clarify that, while the transaction would not substantially lessen competition—which is the test that the ACCC is required to use to assess acquisitions against—it would reduce diversity across the Australian media landscape. If this legislation passes this afternoon to repeal the two-out-of-three rule, the ACCC has shown that what will replace it is inadequate.


Unlike its counterpart across the ditch, the ACCC is not required to apply a public benefit test. It's not the job of the ACCC in Australia, an economic regulator, to consider pluralism or to consider democracy in assessing mergers. The New Zealand Commerce Commission recently did use that test in deciding against the proposed NZME-Fairfax merger. That's something that is not available to us as a safeguard against the removal of the two-out-of-three rule. 


The reason the Turnbull government has so studiously avoided the convergence review recommendation to introduce a public interest test for media mergers is that they want to allow media mergers that aren't in the public interest. Instead, according to reports, they meddle in the fourth estate, behind closed doors, with the assistance of both the NXT political party and Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. The broadcasting reform bill, and the many backdoor deals associated with it, represents a direct assault on media diversity in Australia. Aside from handing unprecedented media power to a privileged few commercial operators, this cynical bundle of trade-offs is also set to undermine our national broadcaster.


Australians are outraged by the grant of $30 million to Fox Sports and the lack of documentation and accountability in relation to the deal. Under Labor questioning at estimates earlier this year, it was apparent that the government had no clear idea about what outcomes it sought to achieve with this proposal. Further, an FOI application by the ABC established there was no documentation around this empty bribe from the government to industry. You have to wonder what sort of a deal was done and where that might have been undertaken between Foxtel and the government. A freedom of information request filed by ABC Radio Melbourne's Mornings program, seeking correspondence between Foxtel and the Department of Communications and the Arts, was declined on the basis that no such documentation exists. In declining access, the legal director for the department stated the access was refused because: 'I am satisfied that documents falling within the scope of your request do not exist.'


So, while the Turnbull government falls over itself to support commercial subscription broadcasters, it looks to inflict cuts on the national broadcaster, rather than craft its media reforms properly and deal with the one sticky bit of the legislation that we needed to sort out, the two-out-of-three rule. I continue to remind those who might be listening to this or reviewing the Hansard, and those who are in the chamber, there was agreement on everything that we are discussing in this bill except for one part. That part was that no media outlet where you live should control the TV, the radio and the papers, because you deserve a wider range of views than that. That's simply it. That's a rule that's been in for decades, and it has provided that safety net to us as citizens of this country.


Rather than deal with that and acknowledge that, the government have been captive to interests that have led them down a path into doing a deal with Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. Australians right across this country are rightly concerned about this attack on the ABC and the SBS. They are right to be concerned that it has been driven by Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, whose deal, when it was delivered in writing here, ironically by Senator Bernardi yesterday evening, was something that they didn't even come in to support here in the chamber. As Senator Bernardi said, there were bits that we could see and there were bits that we couldn't see about the deal that was done.


Last week, Labor was presented with a petition from the Australia Institute and the ABC Friends signed by over 15,000 Australians that asked the coalition and the Senate crossbench to please reject all moves to trade away the ABC and SBS funding, not to tamper with their charters and independence or hobble their ability to engage in the new media environment. Recently, the Turnbull government welcomed what it called constructive engagement with One Nation, only too happy to support a package of measures that are directed at doing the exact opposite of what those people who enjoy the ABC and the SBS have asked for. The deal between the Turnbull government and Pauline Hanson's One Nation party includes something really insidious that probably won't get much media but is going to have a big impact—that is, the competitive neutrality inquiry. This sort of inquiry absolutely threatens to dramatically curb the activities of the ABC and SBS, as well as to re-write the ABC Act and charter to give One Nation some new hooks with which to meddle with ABC independence. These include a requirement that the ABC be fair and balanced, which Senator Burston confirmed was designed to give an equal platform to anti-vaxxers. The question you have to ask is: if we've got an equal platform for anti-vaxxers, what's next? White supremacists? Holocaust deniers? Climate change sceptics? There are some things that we should just not give a platform to. Furthermore, Senator Hanson herself stated recently in no uncertain terms that she would be talking to the Treasurer to 'whack off' quite a bit of money from the ABC's budget next year.


Labor condemns the Turnbull government for using the ABC and SBS as a political football, a trading tool and a bargaining chip in its backdoor deal with the One Nation party. The deal with Senator Xenophon was exercised in some detail earlier in our questions when his amendments came up. By supporting the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule, Senator Xenophon's NXT party for South Australia— (Time expired)

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:54):  The Greens will be supporting this amendment of the opposition. We are extremely concerned that, given the lack of alternative options put forward by the government to ensure media diversity, to ensure that journalist jobs will continue to grow, to protect the jobs that are there, to ensure that there is proper investment and opportunity for public interest journalism—in the absence of anything of substance coming from the government in relation to that—we simply cannot support scrapping the two-out-of-three rule, because we believe that it will result in a concentration of the media, at a time when we need more diversity and we need more scrutiny on our governments, whether they be state, federal or local, more scrutiny on politicians. We need to be able to protect the role of public interest journalism here in Australia. We know that there are, of course, issues in relation to the changing nature of the media landscape. We know the pressures that are on media organisations to sustain themselves, but the government has come up with nothing to really deal with those issues aside from scrapping the two-out-of-three rule, which really helps the big guys but doesn't really help the little guys at all. 


We've already been through some of the details today of what we know of the deal that has been done between Senator Xenophon, One Nation and the government in relation to the $60 million that has been secured to pass this bill. But we have heard that this won't go to jobs for journalists, won't go towards ensuring that independent smaller players across the board will be able to employ journalists so that they can do good public interest journalism. No. We have heard that it's going to go to some computers, iPads and phones, or maybe some junkets. There is no commitment to actually paying journalists to be journalists, no support for media organisations to ensure that they can be sustainable. It doesn't deal with the realities of the changing media landscape and the fact that business models of media organisations are under huge pressure and are going to have to change. It is a pipedream at best and a false hope at worst for media organisations across this country who are looking at what's going on in this place today. There's been a nice big deal handed on a platter to some of the largest media companies in the country, with the scrapping of the two-out-of-three rule, but there is nothing for small and medium players, which will mean less diversity. So, in the absence of proper investment in public interest journalism, in the absence of actual jobs for journalists, the Greens simply cannot support scrapping the two-out-of-three rule, and we support the opposition's amendments.

The abolition of the two-out-of-three rule is an integral part of what is a comprehensive package. It's something that will provide the opportunity for Australian media organisations to reconfigure themselves in ways to best support their viability, and, as I've indicated in my earlier contributions, there remain important diversity protections.

 (South Australia) (17:09):  by leave—In respect of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017, I move Australian Greens amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8265, as revised, together:

(1) If the Minister prepares terms of reference (however described) for a proposed review of the Corporation (the proposed review), the Minister must arrange for a copy of the terms of reference to be tabled in both Houses of Parliament at least 15 sitting days before the commencement of the proposed review.


(2) Sections 42, 47 and 48 of the Legislation Act 2003 apply in relation to the terms of reference as if those terms were a legislative instrument.

These amendments relate to the ability of the government to commission inquiries and reviews into the public broadcasters, whether that is the ABC or the SBS. The reason why this is absolutely important is because this parliament should have the power to decide whether or not reviews are something that the parliament supports.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Chair, perhaps you could call—I don't care if you're listening or not, Senator O'Sullivan, but you could bugger off if you're not interested. 




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Senator Hanson-Young, that's not parliamentary. 



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  If you're not interested in the debate, leave the chamber. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, please address your comments to the chair.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  These amendments put in place the power of the parliament to disallow the government's intended review to inquire into the ABC and SBS. We know that part of the deal that has been done between the government and One Nation is the competitive neutrality review. This is designed to be a Trojan Horse to undermine the ability of our public broadcasters to do their job—to provide services to the Australian people and to provide quality news and entertainment to the Australian public at the times that they want. We know that this is in the firing of this government and One Nation, because we know that there are bigger commercial players out there who don't like the fact that the ABC and SBS offer such a quality service through things like iview and SBS On Demand. 


We know that as part of the dirty deal that has been done between the government and One Nation, the attack on our public broadcaster is held right here in relation to this competitive neutrality review. We know that One Nation doesn't like the ABC. We heard Senator Hanson wax lyrical for minutes upon minutes last night—it felt like hours—about how terribly mean the ABC has been to Senator Hanson and One Nation. Well, boo-hoo. Sometimes journalists write things and say things that you don't like as a politician. Sometimes they cover stories that you don't like as a political party; but that is part of the job. You don't come in here as an elected member of parliament and start using your power on the crossbench to dictate what our public broadcaster should be able to say or not. Of course, what we have is a personal grudge from Pauline Hanson being carried out in this place.




Senator Hanson:
  On a point of order, I need to be referred to by my name in the proper way, as Senator Hanson, please.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, could you please refer to people by their proper titles. 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Senator Hanson has a personal grudge against the ABC and she's using her position in this chamber to grind the axe as hard as she can. Of course, it is absolutely appalling to see that being facilitated and allowed by the government and the Nick Xenophon political party in relation to this. This attack on our public broadcaster is shameful. There has been an attack on our public broadcasters' independence, and the ability for the Australian public to access the content—the quality news and quality entertainment services—is all under a cloud because of this dirty deal that has been done between Senator Hanson, One Nation, Nick Xenophon and, indeed, the government.


We know that the government don't really want to talk about this. They say, 'Oh, well, this is a deal that was done. It doesn't have to come to the parliament, so no-one who feels a bit uncomfortable about it doesn't have to vote for it.' This parliament should have the power to decide what our public broadcaster should and shouldn't be subjected to. All this amendment does is say that this place has the power to disallow or accept or agree to a review commissioned by the government. If those in this chamber decide that's okay, they'll vote for it. If they don't, they won't. It's about giving the power to the Senate to make sure we know that we can protect or inquire into the public broadcasters as the parliament sees fit, not because it's been dictated to by Senator Hanson and One Nation because they don't like the ABC and what the ABC publishes or runs about their political party.


The competitive-neutrality review that is part of the dirty deal between One Nation and the government will, of course, set a path for cutting back the ability of our public broadcasters to deliver services online and on demand. It will set a path for why some in this place and some outside this place want to exert influence on the chamber and on the government. It will set a path for those people to argue that there should be a pay wall on ABC iView and, indeed, SBS On Demand. It would of no surprise to anyone in this place just how dear the ABC and SBS are held in the minds and hearts of Australians right across this country. It is, of course, the most trusted news source in the nation.


The Australian people love the fact that they can watch the shows that they want when they want through such a quality service as iView or SBS On Demand. Parents across the country rejoice that they can turn on the television, use iView and ensure that their kids can watch quality kids' shows at a time that is needed—a saving grace for many Australian households, I must say. Just imagine what the Australian people will think when they hear that Senator Hanson and One Nation have put a pay wall on ABC iView. Just imagine what the Australian public will think when they hear that they cannot use the catch-up service of SBS On Demand or on the ABC to see the news of the day—because, perhaps, they have shiftwork or they work long hours or they're pensioners who have to catch up with the news at a different time. Just imagine what the Australian people will think when their public broadcaster cannot deliver the service that is available now unless they pay for it. It is a double tax on the ABC and SBS.


There are people who are arguing: 'It's not fair that ABC and SBS are able to deliver such good quality services to the Australian people free of charge. How on earth can commercial operators compete?' Well, it's not free of charge. People pay their taxes to get a good, quality, public broadcasting service. The Australian people pay taxes and they are comforted by the fact that their public broadcaster can deliver the service that they rely on and trust. It is no surprise that the ABC has the most trusted news service in the nation. People love their ABC. They love our ABC. And they don't like that Senator Hanson and One Nation have got their grubby little hands on it and are going to demand that the government cut these services through funding cuts and clipping the wings of these services through their online platforms. This chamber and the other place should have the right to decide what type of reviews of our public broadcasters a minister will commission. That is what this amendment is about.


We heard previously that the deal done between the government, One Nation and the Xenophon political party would all be wrapped up in different legislation and we didn't have to vote for it now, except for that one key element—this crucial review. Well, here is the opportunity to make sure that this parliament, at a further point in time, has the right to say yes or no to the demands that have been put forward by One Nation. I don't think that the Australian people deserve to have their public broadcaster held to ransom by One Nation. I don't believe that the Australian public should have to see their public broadcaster used as a pawn in negotiations between One Nation and the government. And I don't believe that our public broadcaster should be held to ransom because Senator Hanson and One Nation have a personal grudge against stories that have been published about them by our public broadcaster.


This amendment means that we rise above that and ensure that this parliament can make an independent decision about what our public broadcasters should be subjected to and that it's not left to the grubby backroom deals that have been done to secure any reform that this government or One Nation desires. It is simply about putting the power back into the hands of the parliament and, therefore, back into the hands of the people that we represent—the Australian public—who fund our public broadcasters, who love our public broadcasters and who don't want to see them used as punching bags just because some politicians don't like what they say.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-09-14,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:22):  I need to respond to this because Senator Hanson-Young has misled this chamber and the members of the public who are listening to this broadcast. What she's saying about the grubby deals is not the case. Senator Hanson-Young is alluding to deals having been done for cuts to the ABC, but that is not the case. Let me put it on the record. In my discussions with the minister's office, at no time did we discuss cuts to the ABC budget, which is in excess of $1 billion a year. Let me repeat that—$1 billion a year! You know what I will do? I will talk to the Treasurer or the finance minister about that. That's not the portfolio of the communications minister. I will go to the person I need to talk to about it, at the right time, prior to next year's budget, and state my case as to why I believe that the ABC budget needs to be cut. So let me put it on the record: no cuts to the ABC budget.


Let's make another thing clear. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young made a comment that I was whinging about the treatment of One Nation on the ABC. No—I was talking about an edition of Australian Story that was about me. It was not fair and it was not balanced. That is what happened. I spoke to the minister about the ABC charter and stories needing to come across as fair and balanced. No-one would expect any less. That's common sense—that you need for something to be fair and balanced from anyone. It's pretty much in the ABC's manifesto now, at the moment, but it needs to be put there. They actually tend to agree with it themselves in their own manifesto.


So it is actually about making sure that everyone is aware of the need to be fair and balanced. I'm sure the Greens would feel that way, too, because they've just had a program done on them. It didn't look too good for them. But, anyway, I've copped it a lot longer than Senator Hanson-Young—for many, many years—so I know what it's like. So there's no problem about that. I have no problems. If you go back to my speech, if you were in the chamber, I actually complimented Steve Austin from ABC Radio Brisbane, who has given me a fair go. That's all I've asked of media. It's not my position here. They have their job to do; I have my job to do. So all I ask, no different to any other Australians, is to get a fair and balanced view. That's all that we ask.


Another point here is that we have called for accountability. It's not unrealistic to call for accountability. Why wouldn't you call for accountability? It is the taxpayers' dollars. Let me say again: $1 billion-plus a year. There is no accountability as far as what they are paying some of their commentators. It was on the record a few years ago that one commentator who is actually on television one night a week for one hour is actually getting paid in excess of $355,000 a year. Why shouldn't the wages of these people who are on $200,000-plus a year be exposed? We are. Everyone in this chamber is. The wages of heads of government agencies are recorded. The taxpayer is paying for it; why hide it? Why shouldn't it actually be out there on the record? 'Oh, no, there's nothing. We're not looking after anyone?' Oh, yes, we are. We've actually asked for an advisory council with a local on it that it is actually going to represent rural and regional areas—and not have someone coming from the cities that have no idea. If Sarah Hanson-Young has any idea, she would understand—



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  I do apologise, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. It is a fact that here we have only 17 per cent of ABC funding going to rural and regional areas, and yet 35 per cent of the population is there. So they are not providing the right comparison, and they need to put the funding there. So what we are saying is: 'Hey, we care about you out in rural and regional Australia. You're not getting a fair deal for your dollars. We're trying to make them accountable to you so that they do their job properly.' 


I notice that Senator Sarah Hanson-Young spoke about the SBS. The SBS is not even in it; never discussed the SBS—not intending to cut back their funding. Nothing at all with the SBS. So, again, misleading the chamber, telling people out there in the general public what One Nation is wanting to do. The Labor have had their go at it today, as well. So what I find is you actually have—



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  Both sides, the Greens and Labor, actually miss a lot. What I find is you don't have integrity. I'm sick of the political politics of this place. You actually have to lie, mislead the parliament and tell people things that aren't true. People want honesty in this place. If you are going to say something, if you are going to attack me or One Nation, do it with true facts. Don't try and win brownie points with the people outside—



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—





Senator HANSON:
  by misleading people about the actual truth in this place. We've seen this many, many times.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Resume your seat, Senator Hanson. Senator Hinch, on a point of order.




Senator Hinch:
  Yes, on a point of order. It may be unusual for me to be defending Senator Hanson, but Senator Hanson-Young had her say. She talked for 15 minutes. It has been a continual banter through the whole of Senator Hanson's speech. It's not fair.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Thank you, Senator Hinch. You are quite right: senators are entitled to be heard in silence. I remind all senators of that.




Senator HANSON:
  I will wind this up. One Nation is very concerned about the media and what we need to do for media diversity in this country. We have looked at it and we have spoken to people from all sides on it. I have spoken to the Labor Party as well. They don't really have a problem with this. It's playing politics here without looking at the benefits to the country. You're saying there won't be media diversity. That is the complete opposite to what the truth is. What will happen is they will be able to buy up other avenues and expand their businesses and create more employment. If you think that keeping the two-out-of-three rule is going to help, it's not. It's going to shut it down. Then what will happen in this country is you're going to end up with foreign investors coming in and buying up the media in this country as they're buying up everything else. So you need to have an open mind and you have to understand. A lot of people in this place have never run a business and have never employed people. They wouldn't have a clue what they are doing, yet they sit here and make these decisions. So know your facts and know what you're doing. 


One last point on grubby deals being done: the Greens actually did the grubby deals when it came to the backpacker tax, and they want their $100 million. So don't talk to me about grubby deals and money being transferred in hands. I know—I'm not stupid. I've only been here for a short period of time, but I'm not stupid. I've seen the antics in this chamber. It disgusts me and it disgusts the people of Australia. Remember, we are here to make the right decisions for the people of this country who are relying on us, so don't play your politics with me. It doesn't work.

  I shouldn't have opened that up! I shouldn't have mentioned the backpacker tax. I apologise. I did like what the Greens did on that. I thought it was quite ingenious and workable. As a matter of general principle, the executive arm of government should be allowed to initiate reviews on any matters within its constitutional power, however ill-conceived that review may be. As a matter of incontrovertible principle, the parliament has the right to reject any legislative attempt to implement any recommendations from such a review. My colleagues and I strongly support a well-funded, fiercely independent public broadcaster in this nation. For instance, ABC iview and SBS On Demand must remain free for all Australians forever more.

This amendment is to amend the BSA to fetter the discretion of a minister to conduct a review of the ABC or SBS, making the terms of reference subject to a disallowance, then requiring the minister to table a report or review 15 days after the completion of the review.


Labor understands the sentiment behind this amendment that's been circulated earlier this afternoon, but in the short time we have had to consider it, we understand there may be some practical implications and issues associated with it. On balance, Labor regards it as a transparency measure which may benefit our national broadcasters, particularly with a government like the Turnbull government, which clearly cannot be trusted with the ABC or the SBS.

 (South Australia) (17:33):  I want to point out that I'm disappointed that the Nick Xenophon Team will not be supporting this amendment, because this is an opportunity to ensure that the grubby deal that's been done between the government and One Nation is put to parliamentary scrutiny. We all know that this review is the one element that isn't required in legislation and this parliament cannot stop it unless we give ourselves the power to do so. You've said, as a political party, several times in the last few days, that you don't want to be linked to the deal with One Nation. This is the opportunity to prove it. This is the opportunity to ensure that you are not backing in the undermining of our public broadcasters and allowing in the Trojan Horse which is going to rip apart the integrity of the online services run by ABC and SBS, along with their ability to deliver quality news and entertainment to the Australian public free of charge, as a public service. This is the opportunity to stand up, and you're squibbing it. Don't come into this place and tell us that you have nothing to do with the grotty deal between the government and One Nation to attack the ABC, when you're given an opportunity and you don't take it. It is clear as day that the deal done in exchange for the government to get their two-out-of-three rule through includes a package which attacks the ABC and SBS—attacks their integrity, their independence and their ability to continue moving forward to deliver quality services, news and entertainment to the public. You squibbed it. I'm extremely disappointed and I think many Australians will be too.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:29):  I would firstly like to clarify that the Greens' amendments on sheet 8171 are being withdrawn. We have circulated amendments on sheets 8266 and 8265. I just wanted to make sure that people are aware of that.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Yes.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I would like to go to our first amendment, which is on sheet 8266. This amendment is about the most controversial aspect of this legislation—the two-out-of-three rule. We've heard much debate already today about this issue and whether it will indeed lead to a further concentration of media. On the other hand, there is the argument that this is perhaps needed in order to save those institutions that already exist from having to shed further staff and to give them more of an ability to underpin their business models.


I am particularly concerned about the scrapping of the two-out-of-three rule—and we know that, with the Nick Xenophon Team and One Nation, the government has support to remove this from the current statute books. The concern that I have is in relation to the newly acquired Channel 10. We know that there is currently a successful bid from CBS to buy Channel 10, but there is also a question mark over whether CBS will be allowed to follow through with that acquisition, because it is a foreign-owned company. We know from the tabling of documents in the New South Wales court over the last couple of days that this bid would do a lot more for securing jobs for journalists and local production staff at Channel 10 than the Murdoch-Gordon bid would ever have been able to achieve. I am concerned that, without some kind of commitment from the government that they will back the CBS acquisition, we are leaving Channel 10 staff in a state of limbo, unaware of what the future holds for them. I want to make sure that scrapping the two-out-of-three rule isn't going to be used as a fast-tracking for the government to override the purchase of Channel 10 by CBS through the Foreign Investment Review Board.


This Greens amendment would effectively say that the two-out-of-three rule cannot be scrapped until the government confirms that CBS can take over Channel 10, through the approval of the Treasurer and the Foreign Investment Review Board—that the removal of the two-out-of-three wouldn't be able to happen until confirmation of acquisition occurred. That is the effect of this amendment. However, I do have some questions for the minister on this. Minister, I'd like to know what the government's intention is in relation to CBS's acquisition of Channel 10. Will you confirm that you will allow it to go ahead?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (16:34):  FIRB matters are ones for the Treasurer. Can I indicate while I'm on my feet that the government will be opposing this amendment. The amendment would be ineffective as there is no approval action undertaken by the Treasurer under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. To require the Treasurer to publish details of a decision taken under the act would result in him breaching the act's confidentiality provisions. As this is the purchase of a media business, it is a significant and notifiable action under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulation. When a foreign person undertakes a significant and notifiable action, the Treasurer has the ability to prohibit the action or to issue a no-objection notification imposing conditions on the acquisition or the Treasurer may decide the Commonwealth has no objection to the acquisition, in which case a no-objection notification is given. There is no approval under the act for a significant and notifiable action.

It's a pretty simple question. Does the government intend on stopping this or not?

 (New South Wales) (16:36):  Labor understand the sentiment behind these Greens amendments, but we do not support it or the precedent it may set. We do agree it's a matter for the Treasurer. The situation with the Ten Network is complex and is currently before the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Labor have been on the record as clearly supporting the CBS acquisition of Ten, subject to approval. We think it's a positive thing. In her comments, the shadow minister, Michelle Rowland, the member for Greenway, pointed out, I think very poignantly, that the transaction is a positive result for the staff of Ten and a vote of confidence in the network, which is indeed regarded as a prime broadcaster asset by many Australians and certainly by Leslie Moonves, the chairman and CEO of the CBS Corporation. We think that acquisition in this form is good news for the provision of news and current affairs. We think it actually demonstrates that diversification of news is possible and can be maintained in the current environment, contrary to the alarmist commentary of the government which has underpinned much of the contentious debate in the Senate.

 (New South Wales) (16:39):  In respect of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017, I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 8174:


   (1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 2, column headed ""Provisions""), omit ""Schedules 1 and 2"", substitute ""Schedule 1"".


We also oppose schedule 2 in the following terms:


   (2) Schedule 2, page 5 (line 1) to page 6 (line 14), to be opposed.


I would like to speak on Labor's amendments to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. I have made some remarks earlier, but in the context of our amendments I want to put on the record that we believe the Turnbull government's response here is deeply flawed and wholly inadequate as an attempt at media reform. Labor's clear and consistent position has been that Labor supports this bill as long as schedule 2, which is the repeal of the two-out-of-three cross media rule, is omitted. If that had happened, we would have passed this legislation, this reform, months and months ago. But the government has been bloody-minded about this and pushed through with the deals that we saw under construction last night.


Labor absolutely acknowledges the commercial pressures the broadcasting sector is under and we understand that the regulatory framework for media and communications is outdated and in need of reform. That is why we supported most of the package, except for the two-out-of-three rule. But all the Liberal-National government has managed to come up in the name of media reform, after four years in office, are some piecemeal deregulatory measures, one of which is the highly controversial and dangerous repeal of the two-out-of-three rule. The bill barely begins to address the true media reform agenda and does precious little to secure public interest considerations in the contemporary media environment.


Labor is committed to supporting the Australian media industry, as well as the jobs and content it produces, as the sector continues to adapt to the new media environment. Labor acknowledges the competitive pressures the broadcasting industry is under, which is why Labor supports the measures the industry needs most—license fee relief, the repeal of the 75 per cent reach rule, and a relaxation of the antisiphoning scheme and list. Lots of it we've agreed with, except for the two-out-of-three rule. At the same time, Labor is committed to safeguarding the public interest in our democracy, and doesn't regard the internet or the existence of Google or Facebook as a justification for the junking of fundamental public interest safeguards.


Labor also acknowledges the facts around media ownership diversity in this country. To get it on the record at this stage of the debate, a couple of those facts are very important to us. Australia's level of media ownership concentration is already one of the highest in the world. This is an undeniable fact, regardless of what might have been said in the course of this debate. The traditional media—newspapers, commercial television and commercial radio—continue to be the main source of news and current affairs for Australians, particularly in regional areas. The majority of the top 10 news websites accessed by Australians are either directly or jointly owned by traditional media platforms. It's just the same voices on different platforms. The digital divide means that access to new media still remains out of reach for many Australians, given substandard levels of broadband connectivity. It is particularly the case for many Australians in rural and regional areas. We've had many debates about the accessibility of Australians right across this nation to what has been described as the multimedia platforms that can be delivered by the internet. The problem is a lot of people out there in the country can't afford to buy into the dodgy internet that's being provided for them by this government.


Our other serious concern is about issues of diversity of ownership and control. They matter to the Australian public. We get a better democracy if we have a range of voices reflecting on what's going on in this country. Fewer voices is not a sign of a strong and healthy democracy. We have such a concentrated media market as it is. An Essential poll last year showed that the majority of Australian voters, 61 per cent, across every single demographic disapproved of changing the media ownership laws to allow a single company to control a newspaper, TV network and radio network in the same area. It would have been good if the government listened to the people instead of listening to the conversations that they've had in the darkness here in the parliament—out of the light and the scrutiny of the Senate. 


Unlike the coalition government, Labor understands that it's the proper role of government to promote media diversity in the public interest. Labor understands that the government does not have the balance between promotion of public interest and support for the industry right in this bill. For these reasons, Labor supports all of the measures in the bill except for the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule, which is ill-conceived, not justified on the evidence, and which risks undermining Australia's democracy.


As I said, the Turnbull government has been trying to get the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule through parliament for up to 18 months now, and they haven't been able to do so on merit. I made comments earlier in the day about the nature of the deals that have gone on here. Senator Dastyari, in the break just before question time, spelt them out in great and dirty detail. The dealings with the Nick Xenophon Team for public interest journalism have been conducted behind closed doors. 


Australia already has one of the most concentrated media markets in the world, but we've got a government hell-bent on making it worse by repealing the two-out-of-three media control rule. The recent move by CBS to acquire Network Ten is very important in the context of this bill and the deals that have been agreed. The two-out-of-three rule is indeed a key safeguard that continues to do the heavy lifting in maintaining media diversity in Australia. The Turnbull government's argument, that the rule is out of date, is simply out of touch with the practical reality that's emerging with the CBS purchase of Channel 10.


What's more, the Turnbull government continues to peddle the furphy that existing competition law is actually adequate for the task performed by the very important two-out-of-three rule—that is despite their claims being debunked in previous reviews. The recent ACCC decision on the proposed Birketu-Illyria joint bid to acquire Network Ten confirms that our competition laws have no safeguard for diversity in this very important part of our democratic tradition. ACCC chair Rod Sims was at pains to clarify that, while the transaction would not substantially lessen competition—which is the test that the ACCC is required to use to assess acquisitions against—it would reduce diversity across the Australian media landscape. If this legislation passes this afternoon to repeal the two-out-of-three rule, the ACCC has shown that what will replace it is inadequate.


Unlike its counterpart across the ditch, the ACCC is not required to apply a public benefit test. It's not the job of the ACCC in Australia, an economic regulator, to consider pluralism or to consider democracy in assessing mergers. The New Zealand Commerce Commission recently did use that test in deciding against the proposed NZME-Fairfax merger. That's something that is not available to us as a safeguard against the removal of the two-out-of-three rule. 


The reason the Turnbull government has so studiously avoided the convergence review recommendation to introduce a public interest test for media mergers is that they want to allow media mergers that aren't in the public interest. Instead, according to reports, they meddle in the fourth estate, behind closed doors, with the assistance of both the NXT political party and Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. The broadcasting reform bill, and the many backdoor deals associated with it, represents a direct assault on media diversity in Australia. Aside from handing unprecedented media power to a privileged few commercial operators, this cynical bundle of trade-offs is also set to undermine our national broadcaster.


Australians are outraged by the grant of $30 million to Fox Sports and the lack of documentation and accountability in relation to the deal. Under Labor questioning at estimates earlier this year, it was apparent that the government had no clear idea about what outcomes it sought to achieve with this proposal. Further, an FOI application by the ABC established there was no documentation around this empty bribe from the government to industry. You have to wonder what sort of a deal was done and where that might have been undertaken between Foxtel and the government. A freedom of information request filed by ABC Radio Melbourne's Mornings program, seeking correspondence between Foxtel and the Department of Communications and the Arts, was declined on the basis that no such documentation exists. In declining access, the legal director for the department stated the access was refused because: 'I am satisfied that documents falling within the scope of your request do not exist.'


So, while the Turnbull government falls over itself to support commercial subscription broadcasters, it looks to inflict cuts on the national broadcaster, rather than craft its media reforms properly and deal with the one sticky bit of the legislation that we needed to sort out, the two-out-of-three rule. I continue to remind those who might be listening to this or reviewing the Hansard, and those who are in the chamber, there was agreement on everything that we are discussing in this bill except for one part. That part was that no media outlet where you live should control the TV, the radio and the papers, because you deserve a wider range of views than that. That's simply it. That's a rule that's been in for decades, and it has provided that safety net to us as citizens of this country.


Rather than deal with that and acknowledge that, the government have been captive to interests that have led them down a path into doing a deal with Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. Australians right across this country are rightly concerned about this attack on the ABC and the SBS. They are right to be concerned that it has been driven by Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, whose deal, when it was delivered in writing here, ironically by Senator Bernardi yesterday evening, was something that they didn't even come in to support here in the chamber. As Senator Bernardi said, there were bits that we could see and there were bits that we couldn't see about the deal that was done.


Last week, Labor was presented with a petition from the Australia Institute and the ABC Friends signed by over 15,000 Australians that asked the coalition and the Senate crossbench to please reject all moves to trade away the ABC and SBS funding, not to tamper with their charters and independence or hobble their ability to engage in the new media environment. Recently, the Turnbull government welcomed what it called constructive engagement with One Nation, only too happy to support a package of measures that are directed at doing the exact opposite of what those people who enjoy the ABC and the SBS have asked for. The deal between the Turnbull government and Pauline Hanson's One Nation party includes something really insidious that probably won't get much media but is going to have a big impact—that is, the competitive neutrality inquiry. This sort of inquiry absolutely threatens to dramatically curb the activities of the ABC and SBS, as well as to re-write the ABC Act and charter to give One Nation some new hooks with which to meddle with ABC independence. These include a requirement that the ABC be fair and balanced, which Senator Burston confirmed was designed to give an equal platform to anti-vaxxers. The question you have to ask is: if we've got an equal platform for anti-vaxxers, what's next? White supremacists? Holocaust deniers? Climate change sceptics? There are some things that we should just not give a platform to. Furthermore, Senator Hanson herself stated recently in no uncertain terms that she would be talking to the Treasurer to 'whack off' quite a bit of money from the ABC's budget next year.


Labor condemns the Turnbull government for using the ABC and SBS as a political football, a trading tool and a bargaining chip in its backdoor deal with the One Nation party. The deal with Senator Xenophon was exercised in some detail earlier in our questions when his amendments came up. By supporting the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule, Senator Xenophon's NXT party for South Australia— (Time expired)

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:54):  The Greens will be supporting this amendment of the opposition. We are extremely concerned that, given the lack of alternative options put forward by the government to ensure media diversity, to ensure that journalist jobs will continue to grow, to protect the jobs that are there, to ensure that there is proper investment and opportunity for public interest journalism—in the absence of anything of substance coming from the government in relation to that—we simply cannot support scrapping the two-out-of-three rule, because we believe that it will result in a concentration of the media, at a time when we need more diversity and we need more scrutiny on our governments, whether they be state, federal or local, more scrutiny on politicians. We need to be able to protect the role of public interest journalism here in Australia. We know that there are, of course, issues in relation to the changing nature of the media landscape. We know the pressures that are on media organisations to sustain themselves, but the government has come up with nothing to really deal with those issues aside from scrapping the two-out-of-three rule, which really helps the big guys but doesn't really help the little guys at all. 


We've already been through some of the details today of what we know of the deal that has been done between Senator Xenophon, One Nation and the government in relation to the $60 million that has been secured to pass this bill. But we have heard that this won't go to jobs for journalists, won't go towards ensuring that independent smaller players across the board will be able to employ journalists so that they can do good public interest journalism. No. We have heard that it's going to go to some computers, iPads and phones, or maybe some junkets. There is no commitment to actually paying journalists to be journalists, no support for media organisations to ensure that they can be sustainable. It doesn't deal with the realities of the changing media landscape and the fact that business models of media organisations are under huge pressure and are going to have to change. It is a pipedream at best and a false hope at worst for media organisations across this country who are looking at what's going on in this place today. There's been a nice big deal handed on a platter to some of the largest media companies in the country, with the scrapping of the two-out-of-three rule, but there is nothing for small and medium players, which will mean less diversity. So, in the absence of proper investment in public interest journalism, in the absence of actual jobs for journalists, the Greens simply cannot support scrapping the two-out-of-three rule, and we support the opposition's amendments.

Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  If you're not interested in the debate, leave the chamber. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, please address your comments to the chair.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  These amendments put in place the power of the parliament to disallow the government's intended review to inquire into the ABC and SBS. We know that part of the deal that has been done between the government and One Nation is the competitive neutrality review. This is designed to be a Trojan Horse to undermine the ability of our public broadcasters to do their job—to provide services to the Australian people and to provide quality news and entertainment to the Australian public at the times that they want. We know that this is in the firing of this government and One Nation, because we know that there are bigger commercial players out there who don't like the fact that the ABC and SBS offer such a quality service through things like iview and SBS On Demand. 


We know that as part of the dirty deal that has been done between the government and One Nation, the attack on our public broadcaster is held right here in relation to this competitive neutrality review. We know that One Nation doesn't like the ABC. We heard Senator Hanson wax lyrical for minutes upon minutes last night—it felt like hours—about how terribly mean the ABC has been to Senator Hanson and One Nation. Well, boo-hoo. Sometimes journalists write things and say things that you don't like as a politician. Sometimes they cover stories that you don't like as a political party; but that is part of the job. You don't come in here as an elected member of parliament and start using your power on the crossbench to dictate what our public broadcaster should be able to say or not. Of course, what we have is a personal grudge from Pauline Hanson being carried out in this place.




Senator Hanson:
  On a point of order, I need to be referred to by my name in the proper way, as Senator Hanson, please.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, could you please refer to people by their proper titles. 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Senator Hanson has a personal grudge against the ABC and she's using her position in this chamber to grind the axe as hard as she can. Of course, it is absolutely appalling to see that being facilitated and allowed by the government and the Nick Xenophon political party in relation to this. This attack on our public broadcaster is shameful. There has been an attack on our public broadcasters' independence, and the ability for the Australian public to access the content—the quality news and quality entertainment services—is all under a cloud because of this dirty deal that has been done between Senator Hanson, One Nation, Nick Xenophon and, indeed, the government.


We know that the government don't really want to talk about this. They say, 'Oh, well, this is a deal that was done. It doesn't have to come to the parliament, so no-one who feels a bit uncomfortable about it doesn't have to vote for it.' This parliament should have the power to decide what our public broadcaster should and shouldn't be subjected to. All this amendment does is say that this place has the power to disallow or accept or agree to a review commissioned by the government. If those in this chamber decide that's okay, they'll vote for it. If they don't, they won't. It's about giving the power to the Senate to make sure we know that we can protect or inquire into the public broadcasters as the parliament sees fit, not because it's been dictated to by Senator Hanson and One Nation because they don't like the ABC and what the ABC publishes or runs about their political party.


The competitive-neutrality review that is part of the dirty deal between One Nation and the government will, of course, set a path for cutting back the ability of our public broadcasters to deliver services online and on demand. It will set a path for why some in this place and some outside this place want to exert influence on the chamber and on the government. It will set a path for those people to argue that there should be a pay wall on ABC iView and, indeed, SBS On Demand. It would of no surprise to anyone in this place just how dear the ABC and SBS are held in the minds and hearts of Australians right across this country. It is, of course, the most trusted news source in the nation.


The Australian people love the fact that they can watch the shows that they want when they want through such a quality service as iView or SBS On Demand. Parents across the country rejoice that they can turn on the television, use iView and ensure that their kids can watch quality kids' shows at a time that is needed—a saving grace for many Australian households, I must say. Just imagine what the Australian people will think when they hear that Senator Hanson and One Nation have put a pay wall on ABC iView. Just imagine what the Australian public will think when they hear that they cannot use the catch-up service of SBS On Demand or on the ABC to see the news of the day—because, perhaps, they have shiftwork or they work long hours or they're pensioners who have to catch up with the news at a different time. Just imagine what the Australian people will think when their public broadcaster cannot deliver the service that is available now unless they pay for it. It is a double tax on the ABC and SBS.


There are people who are arguing: 'It's not fair that ABC and SBS are able to deliver such good quality services to the Australian people free of charge. How on earth can commercial operators compete?' Well, it's not free of charge. People pay their taxes to get a good, quality, public broadcasting service. The Australian people pay taxes and they are comforted by the fact that their public broadcaster can deliver the service that they rely on and trust. It is no surprise that the ABC has the most trusted news service in the nation. People love their ABC. They love our ABC. And they don't like that Senator Hanson and One Nation have got their grubby little hands on it and are going to demand that the government cut these services through funding cuts and clipping the wings of these services through their online platforms. This chamber and the other place should have the right to decide what type of reviews of our public broadcasters a minister will commission. That is what this amendment is about.


We heard previously that the deal done between the government, One Nation and the Xenophon political party would all be wrapped up in different legislation and we didn't have to vote for it now, except for that one key element—this crucial review. Well, here is the opportunity to make sure that this parliament, at a further point in time, has the right to say yes or no to the demands that have been put forward by One Nation. I don't think that the Australian people deserve to have their public broadcaster held to ransom by One Nation. I don't believe that the Australian public should have to see their public broadcaster used as a pawn in negotiations between One Nation and the government. And I don't believe that our public broadcaster should be held to ransom because Senator Hanson and One Nation have a personal grudge against stories that have been published about them by our public broadcaster.


This amendment means that we rise above that and ensure that this parliament can make an independent decision about what our public broadcasters should be subjected to and that it's not left to the grubby backroom deals that have been done to secure any reform that this government or One Nation desires. It is simply about putting the power back into the hands of the parliament and, therefore, back into the hands of the people that we represent—the Australian public—who fund our public broadcasters, who love our public broadcasters and who don't want to see them used as punching bags just because some politicians don't like what they say.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:22):  I need to respond to this because Senator Hanson-Young has misled this chamber and the members of the public who are listening to this broadcast. What she's saying about the grubby deals is not the case. Senator Hanson-Young is alluding to deals having been done for cuts to the ABC, but that is not the case. Let me put it on the record. In my discussions with the minister's office, at no time did we discuss cuts to the ABC budget, which is in excess of $1 billion a year. Let me repeat that—$1 billion a year! You know what I will do? I will talk to the Treasurer or the finance minister about that. That's not the portfolio of the communications minister. I will go to the person I need to talk to about it, at the right time, prior to next year's budget, and state my case as to why I believe that the ABC budget needs to be cut. So let me put it on the record: no cuts to the ABC budget.


Let's make another thing clear. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young made a comment that I was whinging about the treatment of One Nation on the ABC. No—I was talking about an edition of Australian Story that was about me. It was not fair and it was not balanced. That is what happened. I spoke to the minister about the ABC charter and stories needing to come across as fair and balanced. No-one would expect any less. That's common sense—that you need for something to be fair and balanced from anyone. It's pretty much in the ABC's manifesto now, at the moment, but it needs to be put there. They actually tend to agree with it themselves in their own manifesto.


So it is actually about making sure that everyone is aware of the need to be fair and balanced. I'm sure the Greens would feel that way, too, because they've just had a program done on them. It didn't look too good for them. But, anyway, I've copped it a lot longer than Senator Hanson-Young—for many, many years—so I know what it's like. So there's no problem about that. I have no problems. If you go back to my speech, if you were in the chamber, I actually complimented Steve Austin from ABC Radio Brisbane, who has given me a fair go. That's all I've asked of media. It's not my position here. They have their job to do; I have my job to do. So all I ask, no different to any other Australians, is to get a fair and balanced view. That's all that we ask.


Another point here is that we have called for accountability. It's not unrealistic to call for accountability. Why wouldn't you call for accountability? It is the taxpayers' dollars. Let me say again: $1 billion-plus a year. There is no accountability as far as what they are paying some of their commentators. It was on the record a few years ago that one commentator who is actually on television one night a week for one hour is actually getting paid in excess of $355,000 a year. Why shouldn't the wages of these people who are on $200,000-plus a year be exposed? We are. Everyone in this chamber is. The wages of heads of government agencies are recorded. The taxpayer is paying for it; why hide it? Why shouldn't it actually be out there on the record? 'Oh, no, there's nothing. We're not looking after anyone?' Oh, yes, we are. We've actually asked for an advisory council with a local on it that it is actually going to represent rural and regional areas—and not have someone coming from the cities that have no idea. If Sarah Hanson-Young has any idea, she would understand—



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  I do apologise, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. It is a fact that here we have only 17 per cent of ABC funding going to rural and regional areas, and yet 35 per cent of the population is there. So they are not providing the right comparison, and they need to put the funding there. So what we are saying is: 'Hey, we care about you out in rural and regional Australia. You're not getting a fair deal for your dollars. We're trying to make them accountable to you so that they do their job properly.' 


I notice that Senator Sarah Hanson-Young spoke about the SBS. The SBS is not even in it; never discussed the SBS—not intending to cut back their funding. Nothing at all with the SBS. So, again, misleading the chamber, telling people out there in the general public what One Nation is wanting to do. The Labor have had their go at it today, as well. So what I find is you actually have—



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  Both sides, the Greens and Labor, actually miss a lot. What I find is you don't have integrity. I'm sick of the political politics of this place. You actually have to lie, mislead the parliament and tell people things that aren't true. People want honesty in this place. If you are going to say something, if you are going to attack me or One Nation, do it with true facts. Don't try and win brownie points with the people outside—



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—





Senator HANSON:
  by misleading people about the actual truth in this place. We've seen this many, many times.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Resume your seat, Senator Hanson. Senator Hinch, on a point of order.




Senator Hinch:
  Yes, on a point of order. It may be unusual for me to be defending Senator Hanson, but Senator Hanson-Young had her say. She talked for 15 minutes. It has been a continual banter through the whole of Senator Hanson's speech. It's not fair.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Thank you, Senator Hinch. You are quite right: senators are entitled to be heard in silence. I remind all senators of that.




Senator HANSON:
  I will wind this up. One Nation is very concerned about the media and what we need to do for media diversity in this country. We have looked at it and we have spoken to people from all sides on it. I have spoken to the Labor Party as well. They don't really have a problem with this. It's playing politics here without looking at the benefits to the country. You're saying there won't be media diversity. That is the complete opposite to what the truth is. What will happen is they will be able to buy up other avenues and expand their businesses and create more employment. If you think that keeping the two-out-of-three rule is going to help, it's not. It's going to shut it down. Then what will happen in this country is you're going to end up with foreign investors coming in and buying up the media in this country as they're buying up everything else. So you need to have an open mind and you have to understand. A lot of people in this place have never run a business and have never employed people. They wouldn't have a clue what they are doing, yet they sit here and make these decisions. So know your facts and know what you're doing. 


One last point on grubby deals being done: the Greens actually did the grubby deals when it came to the backpacker tax, and they want their $100 million. So don't talk to me about grubby deals and money being transferred in hands. I know—I'm not stupid. I've only been here for a short period of time, but I'm not stupid. I've seen the antics in this chamber. It disgusts me and it disgusts the people of Australia. Remember, we are here to make the right decisions for the people of this country who are relying on us, so don't play your politics with me. It doesn't work.

  I shouldn't have opened that up! I shouldn't have mentioned the backpacker tax. I apologise. I did like what the Greens did on that. I thought it was quite ingenious and workable. As a matter of general principle, the executive arm of government should be allowed to initiate reviews on any matters within its constitutional power, however ill-conceived that review may be. As a matter of incontrovertible principle, the parliament has the right to reject any legislative attempt to implement any recommendations from such a review. My colleagues and I strongly support a well-funded, fiercely independent public broadcaster in this nation. For instance, ABC iview and SBS On Demand must remain free for all Australians forever more.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:32):  With regard to Senator Hanson-Young's amendment that is before the chair, Labor will not oppose this amendment. This amendment is to amend the BSA to fetter the discretion of a minister to conduct a review of the ABC or SBS, making the terms of reference subject to a disallowance, then requiring the minister to table a report or review 15 days after the completion of the review.


Labor understands the sentiment behind this amendment that's been circulated earlier this afternoon, but in the short time we have had to consider it, we understand there may be some practical implications and issues associated with it. On balance, Labor regards it as a transparency measure which may benefit our national broadcasters, particularly with a government like the Turnbull government, which clearly cannot be trusted with the ABC or the SBS.

We all know that this review is the one element that isn't required in legislation and this parliament cannot stop it unless we give ourselves the power to do so. You've said, as a political party, several times in the last few days, that you don't want to be linked to the deal with One Nation. This is the opportunity to prove it. This is the opportunity to ensure that you are not backing in the undermining of our public broadcasters and allowing in the Trojan Horse which is going to rip apart the integrity of the online services run by ABC and SBS, along with their ability to deliver quality news and entertainment to the Australian public free of charge, as a public service. This is the opportunity to stand up, and you're squibbing it. Don't come into this place and tell us that you have nothing to do with the grotty deal between the government and One Nation to attack the ABC, when you're given an opportunity and you don't take it. It is clear as day that the deal done in exchange for the government to get their two-out-of-three rule through includes a package which attacks the ABC and SBS—attacks their integrity, their independence and their ability to continue moving forward to deliver quality services, news and entertainment to the public. You squibbed it. I'm extremely disappointed and I think many Australians will be too.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:52):  I rise to speak on the government response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee's report Out of home care. It has been more than two years since the committee tabled its report. In that time, there is an issue in relation to out-of-home care that has gained considerable attention. While it is not directly referenced in the report and the government's response, I wish to speak briefly about the need for consideration to be given to extending options for continued support for young people and out-of-home care from the age of 18 to 21.


I recently met with Mr Paul McDonald, the CEO of Anglicare Victoria. Through the work of his organisation and many others involved in the Home Stretch project, there is a compelling case to be made to provide options for continued out-of-home care for support to young people who need it, to the age of 21. The Home Stretch is a national campaign formed to seek change to the current leaving arrangements for young people in state care. For too long we have been witnessing poor outcomes for kids being required to leave the care system on or before 18 years of age. Many who are required to leave their care setting at this age become homeless, involved with the criminal justice system, unemployed or a new parent within the first 12 months of being exited from care.


There are many reasons why change is needed. Findings from a 2009 survey conducted by the CREATE Foundation on care leavers demonstrated that 35 per cent were homeless in the first year of leaving care, 46 per cent of boys were involved in the juvenile justice system and 29 per cent were left unemployed. Furthermore, a 2008 study by the Care Leavers Australia Network reported that 41 per cent were pregnant during their adolescence and 43 to 65 per cent of care leavers have poor mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, panic attacks and sleep disorders. I have been advised by some NGOs that young people were being groomed while homeless and on the street.


Extending care would require governments to provide support in the form of ongoing reimbursements to carers, case management to the young person and resources to access education or employment activity. Some models internationally require participation in employment or educational pursuits as a condition for a person to be supported in extended care. Other models provide financial reimbursement in the form of an allowance. Current government policies require the child protection system to begin preparing a young person to leave care as early as 15 years, while most would leave their care placement during their 16th or 17th year. In comparison, children residing at home in the wider community, with one or both parents, are remaining at home longer, with almost 50 per cent of young people aged 18 to 24 having never left the family home. Moreover, international research where care is extended until the age of 21 shows that education participation doubles and homelessness rates are halved.


While there are some available services to assist the transition to leaving care, too many young people are still struggling to cope independently at 18 years after a life in state care. The termination of care by state governments at 18 years is not consistent with parenting that is seeing most young people remain at home well into their 20s. As soon as a young person in out-of-home care reaches 18 years of age, the state, as the effective parent, abruptly ceases to provide ongoing financial, social and emotional support as a caregiver. While parents are increasingly providing support for their children well into their 20s, there are few supports available through governments to assist the young people for whom the state has assumed guardianship to help them into independent adulthood beyond the age of 18.


In light of the belated tabling of the government's response to the Out of home care report, it is timely and topical to have a public discussion about the extension of care to young people up to the age of 21. A number of jurisdictions outside Australia have implemented policies to extend care beyond the age of 18. In the UK, a program called Staying Put allows eligible young people at age 18 to voluntarily continue with support to age 21. Ontario, Canada, operates a model which provides a thick sum of money to support independent living to age 21. In California, state and federal funding provides for a flexible care model to young people in out-of-home care to the age of 21. Comparable programs are in place in other states across the US.


These programs have been evaluated, and there are important and long-term benefits. Extended care supports higher levels of engagement with education and improved employment prospects; improved housing stability and lower long-term reliance on homelessness services and public housing programs; improved physical and mental health outcomes, driven by improved access to care and early intervention; reduced incidence of alcohol and drug dependency; reduced involvement with the justice system, including reduced likelihood of being incarcerated; and improved social integration and civic engagement. These outcomes demonstrate the value of supporting young people and stand in sharp contrast to the approach taken by this government in the policies that have been promoted. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:59):  As we know, this week the government handed down its response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee's Outofhome care report. Shamefully, it has been two years since this report was handed down and we are only just now getting a response to the very substantial issues that were raised in it. This is far too long, particularly considering there are recommendations in this report that need to be progressed through government. The report made 39 recommendations, particularly focused on a nationally consistent approach to the out-of-home-care system, noting how important that is. It asked for accountability recommendations for the Commonwealth and states and territories to ensure compliance with the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children 2009-2020, support and training for foster and kinship care, better care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, nationally consistent support services and training for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce, and for many other important recommendations.


This chamber and, most importantly, the many families and children who are impacted by the out-of-home care system deserve better. They deserve an explanation about why the government took so long to respond. They also deserve an explanation as to why the government has made so few commitments in that time to act on these recommendations. The response only notes most of the recommendations. It only outlines things the government is already required to do under the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, and, in the main, it uses nothing from this report to say that, yes, there is more of an agenda that needs to be pushed here.


As my good colleague Senator Doug Cameron highlighted, we know that children coming out of the out-of-home care system are suffering from serious disadvantage—homelessness, contact with the justice system, poverty and more. What I find perhaps most galling about the government's response is that there was no acknowledgement of the personal experiences of young people and children in the out-of-home care system in terms of the impact the system has on their lives. It was an absolutely bureaucratic response that talked about recommendations, frameworks, state and Commonwealth government relations and so on, which are of course important, but there was absolutely no moral acknowledgement of the profound situation of young people in the out-of-home care system and what a significant thing it is to sever the relationship between a child and their parent and take that child into care because the child is deemed to be in an unsafe situation. It is a profound thing to do, and there is absolutely no acknowledgement of the experiences of young people in our out-of-home care system, particularly in terms of how they can at times be shoved from pillar to post by the foster care system in our states.


The Commonwealth government must play a role in making sure we give children and young people in care and those leaving care the support they need. Our approach to child protection at the community level, the state level and the Commonwealth level covers the whole range of needs. We have to accept that these children are no longer in the care of their families; they are effectively in the care of the state. There was really no acknowledgement in the government's response of how profound and significant a thing that is. Before their children even enter into care, we need to help families more with early intervention, prevention and family support services. Then, if the children do enter care, we need to make sure that they are safe, secure and protected in that care. When they are leaving care to live independently or to go back to their families of origin, we need to make sure that children and their families are given the support they need to thrive for the rest of their lives. Senator Cameron highlighted some of the particular issues that young people leaving care have.


I'd be the first to acknowledge that child protection is a complicated issue and that we won't change things overnight. We also know that responsibility for the tertiary end of child protection lies with the states. But the Commonwealth must be involved in national leadership on these issues. True leadership is needed if we are to see real change in these areas. There are things that the Commonwealth can do.


We in the Labor Party understand the need for a nationally consistent approach to child protection in order to best protect children. That's why, under Labor, we developed the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children 2009-2020. The framework commits state and territory governments to an ambitious long-term plan to promote and enhance the safety and wellbeing of Australia's children. Part of this plan is the National Standards for Out-of-Home Care. Labor members of parliament have continued to hold the government to account for the lack of progress under this framework. The government's response, which references the framework, gives little comfort that, under this government, we are making any real progress on these issues.


We are very concerned about the lack of progress made on developing a national approach, especially with things like working with children checks and a National Statement of Principles for Child Safe Organisations. I note, for example, that national working with children checks are something that the royal commission into sex abuse in institutions also called for some two years ago. They gave this government 12 months to implement the recommendations, and there has been no evidence forthcoming that anything has been done about nationally consistent working with children checks. It is a disgrace. The government have not demonstrated in any way that they are serious about taking action in support of protecting children in our nation. They've been too slow to respond to these recommendations, let alone act on them.


In this country child protection notifications are increasing and we need to work out how to do more. We hear more and more about the challenges and, sadly, the trauma that children experience in out-of-home care. I again return to the fact that what is most missing from the government's response, not only in the practical detail, is any recognition of the lived experience of these children—what they confront in their lives. We need to listen to the sector about what they think needs to be done to protect our children, but, more than that, we need to listen to the children and young people themselves.


Last month, Jenny Macklin and I held a meeting, as part of Labor's community sector partnership, with children and family service delivery organisations. We talked with peak bodies and leading researchers about how the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children can be improved. We remain committed to facilitating a national approach to child protection, acknowledging that this work must be done through COAG and in partnership with state governments. But it is not simply enough to talk about how we can take a national approach to protect the wellbeing of children. The government must show real leadership and action if we are serious about protecting our nation's children. As the shadow minister for families and communities, I certainly am dedicating myself to ensure that we do everything we can to keep our children in this nation safe.

The government must show real leadership and action if we are serious about protecting our nation's children. As the shadow minister for families and communities, I certainly am dedicating myself to ensure that we do everything we can to keep our children in this nation safe.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (18:24):  It's a pleasure to rise tonight to confirm that the tide is finally turning for the Australian economy. The better days for our economy have emerged. The green shoots in the economic landscape are poking through. In recent months we have seen more jobs, more investment, more wages and more exports. I am delighted to stand here tonight to confirm that the Turnbull coalition government has delivered on its promise for jobs and growth. It's more than a catchcry; it is an outcome. 


The national accounts for the June quarter reveal solid and more balanced growth for our prosperous and unique economy. This is a clear demonstration that only the coalition has the skills to implement the policies that deliver economic growth for all Australians. The facts are clear. The policies of the Turnbull coalition have secured economic stability and prosperity for Australia. Our economy has expanded 1.9 per cent during 2016-17. We've exceeded even our own expectations. Economic growth was above our 1¾ per cent forecast in the 2017-18 budget, and I'm very proud that we've managed to achieve this growth despite the volatility that continues in our commodity prices.


Only a coalition government can deliver the diligent and informed economic management that Australia requires. As evidenced by our national accounts for the June quarter, the forecasts that this government has made on areas such as growth, jobs and unemployment, have proved to be extremely accurate and even highly conservative. We've been able to maintain the confidence of the ratings agencies through these conservative assumptions, particularly those relating to commodity prices. This is no mean feat, and I doubt that those sitting opposite us tonight could achieve those same results.


The Treasurer, Scott Morrison, is 100 per cent right: the better days are, in fact, within reach. We've seen over 240,000 new jobs created just in the last fiscal year alone, and there is strong evidence to suggest that the labour market is tightening. Everything seems to be lining up with more jobs and more investment. The Turnbull coalition government is adamant this will flow through to the household sector, and Australians will finally soon see the real wage growth that has been so elusive in recent years—not just in Australia, but around the world.


We have a plan to jump-start wage growth. Incomes may be flat—they have been flat for a long time—but that is why growing the economy is so very important. The Turnbull government will not just dole out random cash payments in an untargeted manner, in a scatter-gun approach, nor will it implement higher taxes. That is a doomed policy of those opposite. Increased taxes on the Australian economy act like a wet blanket on not just growth but wages, investments and jobs.


To secure the sustained economic growth we rely on individual Australians. We rely on their aspirations and we rely on their accomplishments. Those accomplishments are realised by their initiative, by their enterprise and by their hard work. Accordingly, the Turnbull government's national economic plan has been carefully devised to increase private investment. And new private investment, very excitingly, has expanded in this last quarter by 1.1 per cent. Things are looking good. New private investment has expanded, and, at 1.5 per cent higher throughout the year, this is the first really positive growth sign since March 2013, which signalled the end of the mining investment boom. This is a sign that our economy is, indeed, transitioning from the mining days. Australian businesses have benefitted from the government's increased investment.


I rise in the chamber tonight buoyed by the economic data that we've seen in the June quarter accounts and buoyed by the knowledge that the coalition has the right economic plan to secure those better days ahead. Australians have long rejected the socialist agenda and the erroneous premise of high spending and high taxes idealised by the opposition leader. Our economy simply cannot afford to indulge in the cynical politics of envy, upheld by the opposition leader, Mr Bill Shorten.


The tide is now beginning to turn. It's very exciting that economic growth is just there. It's there. It's right before us. The time is now, and I thank the chamber for its time.
