"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-02-11,"—Once again, the Greens do not endorse the notion that question time should be set aside because of the bushfire crisis. In fact, it is our belief that, when there are times of great national tragedy or other matters of great national moment, question time is all the more relevant. I think there is a concern that there could be some untoward behaviour during question time which would reflect on the chamber at this time of national tragedy. That is a matter for senators to properly address themselves on. We believe question time should proceed, but we are not going to stand in the way of the motion by opposing it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-02-11,"—Once again, I acknowledge Senator Brown’s proper interest in the chamber engaging daily in question time, but the events that have struck Australia this week are completely unprecedented. I think the parliament should act in accordance with and in acknowledgement of the unprecedented nature of the events surrounding us. For reasons that do not need to be particularly articulated, it is appropriate—as the government has suggested—that in recognition of these circumstances question time itself should be suspended this week. We should proceed with other business. We have plenty of other business before us and we can usefully exploit the time made available by the suspension of question time. I think it is more than appropriate that for this week—that is, for today and tomorrow—there be no question time, so we are in support of the government’s motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-02-11,"—As I said yesterday, I am very reluctant to let question time go. But, as a Victorian and knowing exactly what has happened in Victoria, I would find it offensive to hold question time and I find what Senator Brown said very offensive, frankly. I think we should hold off question time this week. These are exceptional circumstances, and I think it is more than appropriate that we suspend question time for this week.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I seek leave to make a statement in addition to my statement of 5 February 2009 in relation to the production of documents in order of the Senate No. 27 of 4 February 2009.
Leave granted.
—The government believes that the provision of documents related to the modelling conducted for Australia’s low pollution future: the economics of climate change mitigation would cause substantial commercial harm to organisations that were contracted to assist Treasury. In the case of the Monash Multi-Regional Forecasting model, the MMRF model, provision of the model codes and database would cause substantial commercial harm to Monash University—in particular, to the Centre of Policy Studies at that university. The model codes and databases for this model are the private, confidential information of that organisation. They are sold as a commercial product by Monash University. Disclosure of these model codes and databases would have the result that other organisations would have had access to this information without entering into a commercial arrangement with Monash University. In effect, Monash University would be deprived of the value of the model codes and databases, resulting in commercial harm through the loss of the market to which they had previously sold their products.
In the case of the Global Trade and Environment Model, the GTEM, provision of the database would cause substantial commercial harm to the Centre for Global Trade Analysis at Purdue University. The Centre for Global Trade Analysis provides the global trade analysis project database from which the database for the GTEM has been derived. Disclosure of this GTEM database would have the effect of disclosing a substantial portion of the private, confidential information of the Centre for Global Trade Analysis. Disclosure of this database would have the result that other organisations would have access to this information, again without entering into a commercial arrangement with the Centre for Global Trade Analysis. This would prejudice the ability of the Centre for Global Trade Analysis to sell access to the database in Australian and world markets, resulting in commercial harm through the loss of the market to which they have previously sold their products.",SENATE,<title>CLIMATE CHANGE</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1,speech

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2009-02-11,"—Before I commence the substance of my remarks, I want to briefly reflect on the terrible and tragic events that occurred over the weekend in Victoria. I imagine that all of us have, in one way or another, been touched by those events. I want to briefly share with the chamber how, through a few degrees of separation, I have been affected. A good friend of mine, John Allan, is the publican at a pub in Panton Hill in Victoria, in the seat of McEwen. John was formerly in the RAAF and a former Federal Secretary of the Transport Workers Union, while I was the federal president. I spoke to John on Sunday afternoon when I came to realise the magnitude of the events that had occurred and were occurring in Victoria. I asked how he, his wife and their families were and whether they had been affected. John told me that the man who delivered his beer had been killed in the fires. When I spoke to John he said that the local community, which had been surrounded by fires, was in the beer garden of his hotel in a kind of wake because all the people in that community knew someone who had perished in the inferno, just as John and his wife, Kerrie, knew someone. My heart and best wishes go out to all the people in Victoria, as has also been so eloquently expressed by the Prime Minister, the Premier of Victoria, the Leader of the Opposition and others.
I want to speak about water today. I do not do that in relation to the events in Victoria, but I want to talk about a trip I made to Narrabri and Boggabri, in New South Wales, last Friday—
—And Baan Baa.
—And Baan Baa, as Senator Williams reminds me. I think we all now realise that we have a finite amount of water and that we need to know how to manage it. I am not sure that it seriously dawned on us until the last decade how important it is to manage that finite resource. I do not want to attribute actions or lack of actions by some state governments over many periods—or indeed users, particularly along the Murray—for the predicament that they face. I think we should always adopt the slogan: fix the problem; do not affix the blame. Indeed, as we are well aware, and I am sure my coalition colleagues will correct me if I am wrong, the Rudd government is the first government to have a ministry of water.
My contribution today is to speak about my opportunity to meet a variety of community and farming groups in the region of the Namoi River. I was accompanied by John Clements, a councillor of Narrabri Shire Council and executive officer of the Namoi Catchment Management Authority, who will be appearing before the current Murray-Darling inquiry. Councillor Clements gratefully showed me a number of the programs that have been funded and undertaken by the Commonwealth government. I also met residents who were seeking assistance from the Commonwealth government.
The residents that I met in all the towns and villages overwhelmingly supported the Rudd government’s stimulus package. The people of the Namoi Valley region were wholeheartedly behind the government’s intention to spend a significant amount of money on infrastructure. In fact, I was given a shopping list of projects that had been neglected by the previous government. There are areas of serious need, whether it is lights at football grounds, railway crossings, halls, sporting fields or super clinics. Communities were appropriately arm-twisting me as a member of the government for Commonwealth funds to improve the quality of life in their particular villages or regions. I told one of the National Party senators who is familiar with the area that, whilst I was looking at a rail-road crossing, the soles of my boots melted on the tarmac. It was quite hot and the soles of my boots melted. I have questioned a few people since then and was told it does not happen all that regularly.
I also had the opportunity to meet with a number of farmers in the cotton industry. Two who stood out to me were retired cotton farmers John and Robyn Watson at their property, Kilmarnock, on the banks of the Namoi River near Boggabri. John and Robyn have been there since 1968. They have been growing cotton there since 1980.
When I had lunch in their office I noticed a significant number of awards that had been awarded to John and Robyn and to their son Andrew. I would like to outline briefly some of the awards that John has received. In 1998 John was given the Upper Namoi Cotton Growers Association 2nd Crop Competition award, in 2002 he was UNCGA Cotton Grower of the Year and also Australian Cotton Grower of the Year and in 2008 he was awarded the Certificate of Appreciation for 15 Years Service by the Australian Cotton Growers Research Association. Andrew was awarded Young Farmer of the Year by the New South Wales Farmers Association in 2004; in 2007 he was given the UNCGA 1st Crop Competition award, was the UNCGA Cotton Grower of the Year and received the UNCGA Water Use Efficiency Award; and, in 2008, he was Australian Cotton Grower of the Year.
Today I want to speak about the contribution of Robyn to the land and river care of the Liverpool Plains. When I spoke to Robyn last Friday, she spoke quite crossly about the neglect of the Namoi River, which had been occurring for some time—that is, until Robyn decided to do something about it. Robyn has been the recipient of many awards for her outstanding efforts, particularly on her part of the Namoi River, which led to significant restoration of at least 22 kilometres of the river.
When the Watsons arrived in the area there was little understanding of the destructive impact of not preventing cattle from having free access to water. Before cotton, cattle was the business of choice and had been for a very long time. The riverbanks were eroded and the big river gums were falling into the river. The other major problem or pest was the willow tree, which is an introduced species that likes water. So the two threats to her part of the river were erosion and willow trees. What needed to be done was to save the gum trees and get rid of the willow trees. Once she did this, by a variety of means, she began a major revegetation program to establish 8,500 trees on the farm. She spent hours tending to them through years of drought.
Robyn noticed a species of grass that had withstood constant floods better than others. It is called vetiver grass. It is a native grass that used to grow all throughout the Namoi but was now only found on her property, Kilmarnock. As a result of Robyn’s observation, the grass is now grown and distributed all over the Namoi. It is extremely successful in arresting soil erosion.
I will quote Mr Peter Capp, a former chairperson of the Liverpool Plains Land Management Committee:
Robyn has led the charge by Boggabri Landcare Group to rid the waterway of willows, manage stock by fencing the riparian zone and improve groundcover by replanting native trees, shrubs and grasses. On other areas of the farm there are numerous tree corridors and a magnificent natural wetland that has a conservation agreement in place to protect it. Other areas are also fenced and managed for conservation.
What has this meant for water use at Kilmarnock? Later I will seek leave to table a document which will highlight that. Looking at this document you will see that, as a result of water use efficiency programs like those of Robyn and her group, the use of water to get the same yield of cotton bales per hectare has been reduced. That has been done by smart management of the cotton farms and also by a progressive and intelligent approach to the management of the water. I commend Robyn Watson and others for the lead they have taken in the restoration of the environment and, in particular, the water use efficiency that has been introduced as a result of it.
As I said at the commencement of my remarks, I do not want to affix blame. We have to fix the problem in relation to the efficient use of water. People like Robyn and John Watson, who since 1980 have been successfully growing cotton in that region despite droughts and floods, are pioneers in a district that is overwhelmingly involved in the cotton industry. Their work has led to a lot of social and economic benefits.
Robyn and John are the sorts of Australians who do not necessarily get the awards or, indeed, want them. When I had the opportunity last Friday to go to their farm and have lunch with them, I found them to be very shy but very determined people. In fact, when Robyn was talking about gum trees, I mentioned that I had been in Argentina last year and saw gum trees all over the country. She got a bit cross because they are an introduced species that does not have a natural predator to keep them under control. So it appears—and I am clearly not off the land—that they are pests in Argentina, whereas, because we have a natural means of control in our country, they are clearly not a pest but are in fact a blessing for our land and river systems.
It is always good on occasions like this to highlight to the Senate the activities of well-meaning, dedicated, intelligent Australians who are committed to improving their environment without, I understand, any significant government support. They have done it because it was required. They knew that there was a problem, and they fixed it. They did not run off and seek a government solution to their problems. They knew that this needed to be done. By their actions, they have been a beacon for all the men and women, particularly those from the farming community, in that region. It is in that light that I wish that they, and particularly Robyn, be commended today.
As I foreshadowed earlier, I seek leave to table a document about water use at Kilmarnock.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-02-11,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, I shall move:
That Accounting Standard AASB 2008-10, made under section 334 of the Corporations Act 2001, be disallowed.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matter raised by the committee.
Leave granted.

The statement read as follows—


Accounting Standard AASB 2008-10: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards—Reclassification of Financial Standards [AASB 139 and AASB 7]

Amongst other things, this instrument adds a new paragraph 50B to Accounting Standard AASB 139. That paragraph states that a financial asset (as defined) may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category in rare circumstances. The phrase ‘in rare circumstances’ is not precise. The Minister advised that the term had been adopted following its introduction in October 2008 into the international standards. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking further advice on manner in which this term is applied.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,7,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-11,"—I ask the minister: is it the intention of the government to move any amendments to any of the bills that we are currently considering, or is the government willing to support any amendments from the crossbenchers—the Independents or the Greens—in relation to this package and, if so, when might we get to see a copy of these amendments?

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-11,"—Can I suggest to the minister that, in those circumstances, he might like to reconsider that which he said earlier on in the chamber today about the Labor Party not being engaged in a filibuster. Here we are as a coalition, ready, willing and able to assist the consideration of this matter, and the Labor Party are deliberately stretching it out to see if they can cobble together a deal, the details of which they are still unable to tell this chamber about. It really does expose as a complete farce, and indeed mischief, the assertion made by the leader of the government in this place, Senator Evans, when last week he told the Senate that this package of legislation had to be passed by Friday last week or else there would be all sorts of problems.
We have heard from officials that that was wrong, that consideration of the bills throughout this week would not delay the package in any way, shape or form. So one wonders why the Senate was being bullied and hectored by the leader of the government in this place, who was saying the legislation had to be passed, when departmental advice flew in the face of Senator Evans’s assertions. Clearly his assertions were not based on departmental advice, and so I think we have a very serious situation developing where the Senate was given information which was clearly incorrect. Now we have a circumstance where we as a coalition are saying we are ready to proceed and vote on these bills and the Labor Party are unwilling to either adjourn this debate or deal with it in another manner. They are deliberately filibustering this debate so that they can try to stitch something together. I am sure that as soon as I sit down they will get a backbencher to stand up and give a 15-minute talk to try to buy the government more time, and if that happens it will be proof positive of exactly what I was saying.
—Senator Arbib.
—And there we go: Senator Arbib.
—Order! No, you know it is the way in the chamber that I must call someone from this side of the chamber.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I rise to make a contribution to this very important committee stage of the debate. I do apologise beforehand—I picked up a cough from my daughter, so I may need to take regular breaks just to clear my throat. Yesterday in the United States anyone who was watching CNN or some of the business channels would have noted that President Obama gave a major interview about the state of the United States economy and the scale of the crisis that he has inherited as president. President Obama put it like this:
And if there’s anyone out there who still doesn’t believe this constitutes a full-blown crisis, I suggest speaking to one of the millions of Americans whose lives have been turned upside down because they don’t know where their next paycheck is coming from.
He went further:
We have inherited an economic crisis as deep and as dire as any since the Great Depression. Economists from across the spectrum have warned that if we don’t act immediately, millions more jobs will be lost …
—Point of order, Mr Chairman. My point of order goes to relevance—whether this dissertation on President Obama in the United States has anything to do with the legislation that is currently before the committee or any amendments that are currently before the committee.
—Mr Chairman, on the point of order. I think, frankly, that is a rather frivolous point of order. The senator is talking about an economic crisis that impacts on not just Australia but the world and the response of another head of state to the crisis. Given that this package is a response to the crisis and Australia’s economic circumstances arising from it, I would suggest that nothing could be more relevant to the committee stage of this debate, which is in its general phase at this stage, than the contribution being made by Senator Arbib.
—Mr Chairman, on the point of order, Senator Joyce is correct: this is not relevant. It is, as Senator Abetz said, a filibuster. I have some serious questions to ask in the committee stage and I am being prevented from doing that by someone delivering what is effectively a 15-minute second reading debate speech in the committee stage of the bill. I know the government are not ready and that they do have to make time, but I think it would be appropriate to deal with some of the questions of the minister relating to the package whilst the government try to work out what they are doing next.
—In general terms, we allowed very wide ranging speeches at the second reading stage of the legislation. It is also true to say that we are dealing with this bill and five other bills cognately. We are at a stage of general discussion, so at this point I will rule Senator Arbib in order.
—Thank you, Mr Chairman. I also thank senators on the opposite side of the chamber. They actually illustrated the point that I was trying to put forward. To return to the quote from President Obama:
We have inherited an economic crisis as deep and as dire as any since the Great Depression. Economists from across the spectrum have warned that if we don’t act immediately, millions more jobs will disappear … More people will lose their homes and their health care. And our nation will sink into a crisis that, at some point, will be much tougher to reverse.
That was what President Obama said, and I am happy to announce that today the United States Senate approved an $838 billion stimulus package. Three Republicans crossed the floor to vote with the President to try to stimulate the economy.
This is not just happening in the United States. Countries across the globe are taking action to stimulate their economies using monetary policy and fiscal policy to try to protect and support jobs and maintain economic growth. The IMF recently put out a report which I found most helpful in understanding the scale of the economic crisis and also a way forward for governments. The IMF report notes that the global recession has dramatically intensified: ‘The global economy is in the midst of a deep downturn, with the financial crisis driving an abrupt slump in the real economy. All major advanced economies are in recession.’ The report notes, ‘Merchandise exports have fallen globally by 30 to 40 per cent.’ Commodity prices, so important to our country, have collapsed over the last three months. Metal prices are 50 per cent below their peaks of March last year and global growth is forecast to fall to just 0.5 per cent in 2009. That is how deep this global recession is and how big an issue it is for this chamber. Both the IMF and the OECD have urged governments of all persuasions to do everything they can to stimulate their economies.
On Thursday last week I was lucky enough sit in on the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into the stimulus package and to hear from the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr Ken Henry. Anyone who has ever listened to Ken Henry has had a real economics lesson. I learnt a great deal from it. I would like to put on record a couple of things he said, because they go to the importance of what the government is doing with this package. Dr Henry told senators:
… the global circumstances confronting Australia are simply unprecedented.
…            …            …
The forecast growth for our major trading partners is as weak as we have seen quite possibly since the 1930s.
…            …            …
… there is a clear case for a very substantial fiscal stimulus and for that to be delivered to the Australian economy before unemployment starts to increase. From our history and also from the experience of other countries, the evidence is that the earlier a macroeconomic policy response is taken, the better the prospects for the macroeconomy going forward.
That is what Dr Henry put forward to senators during the inquiry.
Our position is to take action now. What is the position of senators on the other side of the chamber? The best way to understand their position is to look at the words of their shadow Treasurer, Julie Bishop. The shadow Treasurer has put forward her plan for government policy to deal with the global recession: let’s wait and see. Let’s wait and see how bad it gets before we take action to stimulate the economy. Almost every developed country is now in recession. The Liberals say: let’s wait and see. Six of our top 10 trading partners, including China, the United States, Britain, Singapore and Germany, are all in recession. What is the Liberals’ plan? Let’s wait and see. Yesterday the National Australia Bank released some awful figures showing the depth to which business confidence has fallen in our economy. The Liberals’ response? Let’s wait and see how bad it gets.
The government are not waiting to see how bad it gets; we are taking action now. This global crisis, this global recession, is like a cyclone. It started in the United States, wreaking havoc on the domestic economy, wreaking havoc on financial markets, on financial institutions, on the banks. It then moved to Europe, wreaking havoc on their economy, with most of the EU now in recession. The hope was that it would not spread to the developing world, that they would be able to withstand the drop in the United States and Europe and continue to create growth. Unfortunately, the cyclone was too strong, and now we are seeing growth in the developing world slowing dramatically. Growth in China has slowed dramatically, from 13 per cent down to six per cent. In Korea there has been a huge drop in their economic growth. In Japan they are talking about a serious recession that it will take them years to recover from. The cyclone has been too strong. It is on its way to our shores. This is not a time to wait and see how bad it gets. This is the time to take action.
—We’re waiting.
—I note that Senator Joyce has been doing a fair bit of media recently. He has been playing a great deal of politics with the stimulus package and has been carrying out a scare campaign on deficits.
I will talk about the first stimulus package that the government put in place and the way the Liberals have approached that stimulus package. It goes to how they are approaching economic management at the moment. In the chamber this morning coalition senators, time and time again, talked about the first stimulus package, in December last year, as ‘the cash splash’. That is what the coalition call it. That is what Malcolm Turnbull, the member for Wentworth, calls it. I have raised this previously, but I am happy to raise it again for Senator Joyce. Take the time to look at the Liberal Party website. I am a bit of a boring person, so I was happy to go to the Liberal Party website. The Leader of the Opposition now says that the first stimulus package is a cash splash and it has not worked. What did he say on Tuesday, 14 October, when we introduced the first stimulus package?
—Shut the door. I can hear the cows coming home!
—Senator Joyce, if you quieten down I will let you know. He said:
We welcome the Government’s announcement today, especially for Australia’s age pensioners who have been denied justice for too long.
He welcomed it, Senator Joyce. Then he went on to say:
But nonetheless we are not going to argue about the composition of the package or quibble about it. It has our support. It will provide a stimulus to the economy, that’s for certain.
That was the Leader of the Opposition. Today you are calling it a cash splash. This was him giving it his full support. Let me just read it again to you.
—It was out of the surplus, in October.
—I know, Senator Abetz, that you want to hear it again. He said:
It has our support. It will provide a stimulus to the economy, that’s for certain.
—What date?
—I am happy to take that interjection. It was Tuesday, 14 October 2008, on the Liberal Party website.
—That was the first stimulus package, paid for out of the surplus—not going into debt.
—That is right, Senator Abetz. I am talking about the first stimulus package. That was the Leader of the Opposition’s position. Let us talk about what the first stimulus package has achieved. Quite frankly, it has achieved a great deal. Let us talk about sales in the retail sector. Official figures were released showing a 3.8 per cent increase for the month of November—the biggest percentage rise in retail since the introduction of the GST in August 2000. Let us talk about first home ownership and the housing industry. Housing finance data from the ABS for November showed that the number of first home buyers increased by 17.8 per cent. The Real Estate Institute of Australia said:
Yes, we are starting to see a lot of activity in the first home buyers market and I think we’ll see a lot more of that as we go forward.
Today, Senators, I would like to raise new ABS figures released today which go to the extent of the first stimulus. The ABS figures show a surge in new housing finance for the month of December. First home buyer grants have absolutely stimulated the housing market. First home buyers are the real winners out of this. The first home buyer share of housing finance hit a six-year high in December as the stimulus kicked in. They are fantastic results. So the cash splash that the Leader of the Opposition and senators on the other side of the chamber talk about is doing its job.
This $42 billion package has a strategy behind it. If senators on the other side of the chamber had been listening to the Treasury officials during the Senate inquiry they would understand it. In the short term, the cash bonus payments are about getting money into the economy straightaway, to bolster aggregate demand, helping confidence in the marketplace. This injection takes place now, then the second part of the strategy comes to the fore—infrastructure. That is when you will start seeing projects taking off. These projects have been put together with this in mind. These are not huge projects that are going to cost billions and billions of dollars and take years to put together. These are projects that can be put out into the system quickly, punched out by tradesmen, by builders, by suppliers. This is the strategy behind it, to get our tradesmen and tradeswomen working, to get our suppliers providing, to get our transport workers using their vehicles to provide for housing. This is what it is about: a stimulus for the economy. This is what we stand for. On the other side the attitude is: ‘Wait and see. Let’s wait and see how bad it gets.’ In the end, that will mean a loss of jobs and a loss of production.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-02-11,"—I feel inclined to ask the minister at the table, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, how many of the promised 75,000 jobs that Mr Rudd guaranteed would eventuate from the first ‘cash splash’ have actually been achieved, but I will not do that because that is contrary to standing orders and it is not relevant to the bills before the chamber. It is quite clear, as Senator Abetz said earlier, that the previous speaker has just spent 15 minutes delaying the Senate because the government are quite incapable of managing this vaunted $42 billion package—the package they have been working on for ages and wanted us to pass, rightly or wrongly, by last Friday. Here we are today and the government are in disarray. They have absolutely no idea of what they are doing and are therefore getting backbencher after backbencher up to speak for 15 minutes on irrelevant matters, as in the last speech, simply to delay the Senate in order to try to hide their abject mismanagement of this bill. When they cannot even manage a bill through the chamber, what chance have we got of them managing $42 billion in an economic package? It really shows that Labor cannot be trusted with money or even with managing the business of this chamber.
I rose to seek a response from the minister on a question relating to the spending package that is before the chamber and I am sure his response will engender some follow-up questions, so I would ask other senators to give me 10 minutes or so to pursue the particular piece of information I am seeking. I mentioned both the issues I want to pursue in my second reading debate speech. Fortuitously, the minister at the table, Senator Sherry, will be well aware of the financial disaster caused by the collapse of Storm Financial, a company that was headquartered in Townsville, where I have my office. The collapse impacted upon investors that I know of on the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast and in other parts of Queensland, and I know there were many people in Melbourne who were also caught up in that financial crisis. I want to raise this with Senator Sherry while he is in the chamber because he may be able to assist those people today in the response he gives to this question.
My question relates broadly to how this package might impact on the big four Australian banks. We do know that the Rudd government—using taxpayers’ money, of course: governments do not have money of their own; they use taxpayers’ money—has guaranteed the deposits of the four big banks in Australia to the extent of $600 billion to $700 billion. Because he is the relevant minister in this area, apart from being the minister in charge of this debate at the present time, I would like the minister at the table to confirm that there is a potential liability of $600 billion to $700 billion in the guarantee given by the Rudd government to the big four banks. That was the preliminary, and I do not want to go into the question of what that guarantee has done to other financial institutions. The second part of my question to the minister is: in this spending package, are there other advantages given to the big four Australian banks? For example, in what we loosely refer to as the Ruddbank proposal, will there be funds somewhere in the $42 billion package to achieve that?
I want to go on to ask the minister if he might use today to issue, if not a warning, a reminder to those big four Australian banks that they have benefited quite substantially by the largesse of the Australian taxpayer through the Australian government—to the extent of a potential support of $600 billion to $700 billion. One would argue that perhaps that is appropriate. It is important that our banks continue. But I think we need to emphasise—and perhaps Senator Sherry could do this today—that the banks and their managements and their shareholders are being supported by the Australian taxpayer through the Australian government. That is perhaps appropriate, but it would seem to me that, as the banks are the beneficiaries of that largesse and assistance from the federal government and taxpayers, it behoves the banks then to treat all taxpayers and Australians in a similar way. And that similar way, particularly in the case of Storm Financial clients but also in relation to anyone else doing it tough with bank loans at the present time, is for the banks to act in a responsible and mature manner, recognising that it is the Australian taxpayer supporting the banks in their ‘hour of need’.
We have heard some of the stories of Storm Financial clients. These are people who have worked, scrimped and saved all their lives to put aside a nest egg so they would not be a burden on the government or the taxpayer but would be self-funded in their retirement. They have got involved with financial advisers—and I will not make any comment upon that until investigations are completed. But these people, very often retired people, were receiving margin loans from banks for hundreds of thousands of dollars when it was quite clear—and any cursory examination by the banks of their situation would have shown this—that they had little prospect of paying back the banks from their incomes unless they were able to get it by other means—that is, the share market continuing to boom ahead.
There are suggestions, which need to be investigated, that the banks acted fraudulently in lending money to people who they knew had no prospect of paying it back—shades of the subprime mortgage arrangements. I want to ask the minister at the table a question, and I would hope that he would instruct his backbenchers, who have been regimented to give their 15-minute delaying speeches, to back off a little bit so that the minister could reply to this. Will the minister, on behalf of the government, say to those banks: ‘Don’t foreclose immediately; don’t sell all the shares that people had mortgaged; but, more importantly, don’t sell people’s houses that they have collaterally mortgaged to support their margin loans’?
I think it would be helpful if someone of Senator Sherry’s standing could say to those banks that the government and, indeed, we the parliament of Australia expect the banks to deal sympathetically and understandingly with those margin borrowers so that they do not lose their houses because of capricious immediate action by banks in foreclosing and selling people up without giving them the opportunity to get out of the mess by other means. In many cases it might mean an indulgence of three, six or nine months but, because of the largesse the banks are getting from this package before us and from other packages from the government, it should not be too much to ask.
I am sure all senators have had experience of constituents who are traumatised by the collapse in the financial market, particularly those who have been involved with Storm Financial. Senator Williams and I are looking at some form of inquiry into that, and that will come later. But I think it would be useful if the minister, who is the relevant minister, could use this debate—and it is relevant to this package and other economic packages of the government—to make a statement to the banks and give those ordinary Australians who scrimped and saved to make sure they looked after themselves in their own retirement rather than falling back on the government are given some hope that they will have an opportunity, at least, of some time to rearrange their affairs before they lose their matrimonial home. Minister, I invite you to respond to that in this committee stage of this debate on the financial package.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I do have a number of responses for Senator Macdonald and also for Senator Joyce. I go to the issues relating to Senator Joyce first. Senator Joyce, in a question to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration which was taken on notice, asked for some comparative data about stimulus packages around the world juxtaposed against the stimulus package we are considering here. So, at least to that extent, Senator Joyce recognises the relevance by requesting details of stimulus packages in other parts of the world.
I will not go through all the material that will be provided but I do want to indicate that the size of the stimulus package in Australia has been a matter that has been raised throughout the debate, including this morning. To run through this briefly, the stimulus package in the USA, which apparently has only just been passed, is in total US$168 billion or 1.2 per cent of GDP; Spain, $24 billion, or 1.7 per cent of GDP, with a second stimulus of $14.8 billion, which is one per cent of GDP; and Japan, $19.9 billion, or 0.3 per cent, followed by three other stimulus packages of $66.4 billion, or 1.2 per cent of GDP, $44.3 billion, or 0.8 per cent of GDP, and $16.6 billion, or 0.3 per cent of GDP.
I move to Korea—and this is South Korea, not North Korea. I noticed there was some discussion in the committee about North Korea. Frankly, the North Korean economy is a flat earth. It is hard to stimulate an economy like the North Korean economy, but the South Korean stimulus is $8.7 billion, or 1.3 per cent of GDP, then a second stimulus of $10.4 billion, or 1.6 per cent of GDP, a third stimulus of $10.4 billion, or 1.6 per cent of GDP, and then a fourth stimulus of $37.3 billion, or 5.5 per cent of GDP. In Taiwan it is US$12.6 billion, or 3.3 per cent of GDP, and then there are three more: $2.4 billion, or 0.6 per cent of GDP, $2.5 billion, or 0.7 per cent of GDP, and then $9.6 billion, or 2.5 per cent of GDP. Now the fiscal stimulus in Australia is $7 billion, or one per cent of GDP, $10.3 billion, or 1.4 per cent of GDP, $3.2 billion, or 0.4 per cent of GDP, then $28 billion, or 3.8 per cent of GDP. I do have significant further material. In Canada, it is $32.7 billion, or 2.6 per cent.
—Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. First of all, this goes to a question on notice I asked Treasury, not the minister. The minister is reading an answer to a question that was not directed to him, yet the inference at the start was that it was directed to him. So the point of order goes to relevance. The next point is that the minister is now verging on breaching standing order 196 on tedious repetition for the purpose of filibustering. We are going through every economy in the world. If he wants to add to something, he might want to tell us how much the American stock market fell the day after the American stimulus package. I think it was about 380 points. He might want to tell us the result of that, which goes to the efficacy of the whole purpose of this charade.
—On the point of order, Senator Joyce, any minister can answer any question on behalf of the government so Senator Sherry is in order.
—I am just trying to be helpful to Senator Joyce. I understand he has not got the detailed response. I am not going to go through all of the countries. There is a lot of detail there; you asked for the detail. It has been an issue of debate. It has been an issue of discussion this morning, and I am giving you some of that detail now. Senator Joyce has claimed that I should look at the US stock market and at what has happened as a result of their stimulus package going through the US Congress. Senator Joyce, with respect, I think you are confusing the stimulus package with the bailout package. I do look at Bloomberg and CNN; I do look at the commentary. I have done that not just today but over the last year, in this financial and economic crisis. The observations made with respect to the current market response reflect the disappointment and the lack of detail in the bailout package, not the stimulus package. The bailout package, for people who are not aware, is hundreds of billions of US dollars being passed over and paid to a range of American financial institutions. That should not be confused with the stimulus package. I want to make the point that I am trying to provide detailed information, as asked for at the Senate committee hearing—and which was not available at the time—in response to Senator Joyce’s question.
Distinguishing between a bailout package and a stimulus package leads me to a couple of issues on the guarantee that Senator Macdonald raised. I firstly would make the point, Senator Macdonald, that it is not a guarantee simply for the four big banks. It is a guarantee for all APRA regulated deposit-taking institutions. That includes all banks, credit unions and building societies.
—Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I hope we are not misleading the Senate. I know that is not the intention of the minister. Luckily, we are on line now and I have just had a look. A headline says ‘Wall Street tumbles as U.S. stimulus package passes’. The article is by Sheldon Alberts, the Washington correspondent for a number of papers.
—Order! Senator Joyce, that is a debating point. You will have a chance later in the committee stage to raise that if you wish. That is a debating point, not a point of order.
—This morning I was watching the commentary on the reaction of the markets. As I said, the commentary that I observed related to the response of the markets to the claimed lack of detail in the bailout package.
—It’s a stimulus package, not a bailout package!
—I have made my point. I am not going to waste time by adding to that. You have your view. I have expressed my view and observations and what they are based on. I will come back to the position of ADIs. As I was saying, Senator Macdonald raised the issue of the guarantee to the four big banks. It is a guarantee to all ADIs, Australian deposit-taking institutions, regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA—that is, all banks, all credit unions and all building societies. I am pleased to say that that was supported by the Liberal-National Party opposition. It was not an issue of enormous contention. It was recognised last year that there had to be a guarantee provided to ADIs.
—That’s not the question.
—You made a claim about four big banks. It is not accurate. You have your view; you have stated your position. I am stating what I believe is a broader and more accurate reflection of what happened in respect of the guarantee.
—Look, my point’s the same, though, Nick.
—I will get to Storm issues in a moment, because I do have concerns. I will get to the details in a second, because you have asked about the issue. We have given a guarantee. Unlike the US and the UK and a number of other European countries, we have not given a bailout to any Australian financial institution, thank goodness. We have not had to pass over hundreds of billions of dollars from our budget to any financial institution in Australia, thank goodness. Earlier a senator—and I forget who—accused the government of reflecting a socialist approach in its bailout package. If you want to look at socialism in action, go to the United States, where a conservative government—the Bush administration—ended up nationalising, forceably merging and taking over a number of banks. That occurred in the UK, in Iceland and in some other countries. It was an understandable response to the collapsing world financial system. I think it is important to put these things on the record.
The other point I would make about the guarantee is that it has its origins in Australia, as distinct from the legislative action the government took coming from the HIH royal commission when it was observed that Australia, unlike most other countries, did not have a guarantee for its ADIs. These are important points to make.
To come to the issue which Senator Macdonald raised about the approach of the banks in respect of clients of Storm Financial, I would express it this way. The words are not the same as those made by the Treasurer, Mr Swan, in the Four Corners interview, but the sentiment and the message I would convey are. He rightly observed that, yes, Australian ADIs, including our four big banks, have received benefits as a result of the guarantee and they should deal—these are not his precise words but I share the sentiment and would make the same commentary—with great consideration, sympathy and concern with anyone, including the victims of the Storm Financial crisis, who faces foreclosure of their home, for example, an asset in many cases that was used to underline margin arrangements, and they should not be precipitous in respect of any foreclosure against persons in those circumstances. I would indicate the same message.
As to Storm Financial, the financial planning institution that provided the margin loans, Senator Macdonald quite appropriately has indicated that he did not want to go to specific questions about the ASIC investigation. I would point out that there is a formal investigation in respect of issues involving Storm Financial, the entity. I cannot provide information about what is an operational matter—it is an investigation. What I can say is that there is one area of ASIC action which is on the public record because it took place in the courts last week. ASIC secured a court order barring the owners of Storm Financial, the Cassimatis, from dealing with a $2 million dividend payment which they effectively gave themselves in late 2008. I understand that, as a consequence of the ASIC action, that $2 million dividend payment is effectively frozen. I can inform Senator Macdonald that I have spoken to ASIC about issues relating to Storm Financial. I cannot go to operational matters but they have indicated to me that they will be providing as much detail as they can, without going to operational investigations, at the Senate estimates. I have indicated that this is a matter of considerable and obvious interest to many thousands of investors. Also, it is an important matter of public interest. ASIC will be giving an update at the estimates without going to the details of operational matters because that may go to legal actions at some future date and we would not want to jeopardise that. There is a whole range of issues in relation to the Storm investment strategy.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-02-11,"—My questions are related to those asked by Senator Macdonald—they are in a similar vein. In relation to the minister saying that the government is not bailing out any bank at this point, I want to be certain that the $6.6 billion to be spent on social and defence housing is not going to be used to bail out developers and ultimately the banks from the consequences of their imprudent activities during the housing boom. The reason is that I have had an email from a constituent saying that the first tranche of the National Rental Affordability Scheme, while it was hyped as a stimulus to construction, in fact was used to soak up a developing overhang of already built housing inventory on developers’ books. With the tripling of the first home owners grant for new housing, again it was about a stimulus to construction but, because there was no requirement that the construction occur after the date of the policy announcement, in fact it too was about bailing out developers and banks, effectively by stimulating the economy to the extent that young first home buyers would buy some of the stock which developers had built, much of it not energy efficient, as part of that development boom. The issue is then how much of the $6.6 billion is going to buy up stock which the developers have not been able to sell.
So what I am asking is: is there any requirement that the $6.6 billion for new housing be post the announcement so that you cannot just go back and bail out the developers with stock on their hands and therefore, ultimately, the banks? The government has said in its own materials that this will allow the purchase of some already existing housing and some greenfield sites. I would like from the minister some answer as to whether there are any associated regulations around the $6.6 billion to make sure that this is not effectively a bailout of developers and the banks but the stimulus—
—Order! There is far too much audible noise in the chamber.
—that it is meant to be—to the building industry, builders’ labourers and so on. I want to know whether or not the stimulus package is, effectively, a bailout under another name.
The other matter I would like an answer from the minister on is in relation to energy efficiency. It pertains to a report by RMIT, International comparison of building energy performance standards, published in 2005. That says that the current five-star standard in Australia for energy efficiency is actually 1.8 to 2.5 stars below comparable average international levels of performance. In fact, it says that the Building Code of Australia’s five-star energy efficiency provision is not even close to the lowest energy efficiency standards currently mandated in the United States for similar climatic conditions. In that circumstance, I would like the minister to confirm that the five-star rating that Australia currently has is almost two stars below the lowest performance in the energy efficiency standards for new buildings in the United States and that that has been the case for some time.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-02-11,"—by leave—I wanted to take the opportunity to report to the Senate on some developments in the Victorian bushfire tragedy and some of the Commonwealth responses to that. People are obviously following these events on the news and it is a developing situation, but I thought it important that we update the Senate on where we are at in terms of the Commonwealth response. The Prime Minister is doing a similar thing in the House of Representatives.
Can I firstly thank the Senate for giving me leave and for its cooperation with the government over the last few days in allowing us to respond to the bushfires and apply all government resources to those. The agreement to cancel question time was a good decision and I appreciate the cooperation we have had in relation to that. Certainly the country’s attention is properly focused on the bushfires, as is the attention of all members of parliament. I think we are all a bit uneasy about parliament proceeding in the middle of all this. It is obviously important that we show appropriate leadership, but I think all our minds are more focused on those developments than perhaps the day-to-day activities of the parliament.
Each day, as we have seen in the news on the fires, the tragedy has got worse. It is fair to say that there may still be more bad news to come. There are certainly people still at risk and many people yet to be located. The response of the nation has been nothing short of fantastic. As we have seen on the news, ordinary Australians have been doing whatever they can to support the victims, be it by donating clothes, driving up with supplies or donating. It has been an amazing response. There has also been a very strong response by corporate and sporting organisations in terms of cash or other generous donations and activity. We should all applaud the response of the organisations and the community more generally.
Might I also say that the leadership of parliamentarians from all sides has done them great credit. This is not something that will probably be said outside this chamber but I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that all the local members I have seen, across the parties, have been supporting and representing their constituents in a magnificent way. They have shown great energy and empathy and they have been a great assistance and support to their communities. I would like to acknowledge that. I think Senator Ronaldson made the very good point yesterday that those people know their communities, they know their needs, capacities and strengths. I think the response and leadership of the local members, from all sides of parliament, has shown that they are really in touch with their constituencies. As I say, they probably do not get many plaudits from others on such occasions but I do support and acknowledge them.
The crisis has moved to a new stage. There are now two immediate challenges confronting us. First of all, we must continue to fight the fires in the face of a situation that has unfortunately deteriorated in the last 24 hours—and great risks remain. We also must continue the enormous and difficult work of the recovery. In addition to the twin immediate challenges, the Commonwealth and Victorian governments are moving ahead with the long-term reconstruction efforts.
The fire threat in north-eastern Victoria has increased overnight because of strong southerly winds. This morning the Country Fire Authority issued urgent alerts for the communities of Acheron, Cathedral Lane, Rubicon, Thornton-Taggerty Road and Bulls Lane, with an increase in fire activity in the Murrindindi-Yea area. The fires burning to the west side of the Black Range have picked up in the southerly winds and early this morning they were estimated to cover an area of approximately 100,000 hectares.
The most recent report on the Bunyip Ridge fire indicates some improvement in the outlook for the communities of Gembrook. Nevertheless, alert levels for these communities remain high. The fire is burning in an area of approximately 25,000 hectares in the Bunyip State Park and the Bunyip State Forest and it has the potential to directly impact communities in that region.
Fire activity also remains high in the Maroondah-Yarra Complex, in particular south-east of Toolangi and east and north of Healesville. The Kinglake Complex continues to burn and is currently estimated to be in excess of 116,000 hectares. Fire crews and Army engineers are working to construct control lines around the fire perimeter on the northern and western flanks. New South Wales fire crews are also assisting in this area and remaining firefighters are actively patrolling and blacking out the perimeter of the fire line. Fires are continuing to burn in many other areas of the state, including Churchill, Jeeralang and Walhalla.
The latest information from the front lines confirms the catastrophic scale of these fires. There are currently 181 confirmed deaths from the fires, with 570 injuries and 78 admissions to hospital. Many are still unaccounted for. This morning the Victoria Premier, Mr Brumby, indicated that in Marysville, for instance, up to 100 of the town’s 500-strong population may have been killed. I know there is a great deal of concern amongst some people to get back into the communities, but people need to understand that there are still real risks and also that there are areas where they have not completed the search for bodies and where they expect to perhaps have more bad news. It is clearly not appropriate to be letting people back in. I know some people are finding it hard to understand that decision, but it has been made for very good operational reasons.
Up to 20 patients have been admitted to the major burns unit at the Alfred Hospital. At the last count, 1,033 houses were reported to have been lost and at least 5,000 people remain homeless, and of course many of them have been left with nothing at all. It is estimated that about 450,000 hectares have been burnt out.
The Commonwealth has obviously got all of its agencies deployed to do what they can. The four main agencies working with the Victorian CGRC on the immediate challenges are the AFP, the ADF, Centrelink and FaHCSIA. Other departments, like my own, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, are providing staff and other resources as required to support them.
Over 460 ADF personnel have now been deployed to assist with the range of firefighting efforts. The Minister for Defence, Mr Fitzgibbon, has been on the ground there for the last day or two. We thank all our professional and reservist personnel for their exceptional efforts. ADF teams are providing direct assistance to those who have lost everything in the fires. They are fighting fires and they are providing relief for firefighters and emergency service personnel, who are doing a fantastic job.
In relation to the immediate search and recovery effort, I can inform the Senate that the ADF has deployed a search task group of approximately 160 ADF Reserve soldiers headquartered at Kilmore. This group comprises four search teams to assist emergency management agencies to search through rough terrain on foot near Traralgon, St Andrews, Flowerdale and Yarra Glen. I am advised that the search teams deployed to Flowerdale have completed their work and are now preparing to deploy to work in the Kinglake area.
On behalf of us all I would like to thank all of the permanent and volunteer firefighters and emergency personnel and the interstate firefighters who have been coming in. Yesterday I issued a regulation change to provide for overseas firefighters to enter the country to assist. We have had offers from around the world. The Indonesian government has offered—and I think it is in process—to provide some of their victim identification teams, who I think we helped train after the Bali tragedy. They are now going to be providing support to us. And New Zealand firefighters are I think coming in on Friday. We have had offers from around the world of such expertise.
Centrelink is providing direct assistance on the ground in fire affected areas through the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child for those affected by the fires. There was a story in the Australian newspaper today from Gary Hughes, who is a victim of the fire, having lost his house and had a very traumatic experience. He described what clearly was most inappropriate treatment when he was asked to produce identification to receive his relief payment after he had registered with the Red Cross at the relief centre at Diamond Creek. All of his personal documents had obviously been destroyed in the house fire. What happened to Mr Hughes should not have happened. We apologise for the distress it caused him. The government accepts the criticism.
We are doing everything that we can to remove the obstacles for people in claiming emergency relief. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, has been on the ground there all week listening to people’s concerns, comforting people and trying to make sure that all the Commonwealth agencies are responding to their needs. She has done a fantastic job. I pass on our best wishes to her.
It is also the case that the Minister for Human Services, Senator Joe Ludwig, went down yesterday and spent the day there working with those agencies to try and make sure that we get that right, that all resources are available and that staff understand the requirements of the government. They are all working very hard. There will be problems and hiccups, but there is a tremendous effort going on from all those public servants there.
The government has made it clear that if anyone needs cash immediately or needs money to be put into their account that can be done on the spot. We know that many people have lost everything and have no resources to turn to. The Australian government will do whatever it can to assist them with emergency relief. I know that Senator Ludwig is very much focused on making sure that that happens.
I can also advise that the Commonwealth, alongside the Victorian government, is undertaking work through the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority. The authority will be coordinating the bushfire recovery activity across Victoria. The Commonwealth and state governments will share equally the cost of rebuilding communities affected by the fires. The authority will coordinate activities of all local, state and Commonwealth agencies and community organisations. Senators would be aware that the authority will be headed by the outgoing Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Ms Christine Nixon.
The authority will determine what immediate action is required, such as the provision of temporary government offices so residents can continue to access vital assistance from Centrelink and the Department of Human Services, temporary doctors clinics and pharmacies to ensure that prescriptions are written and are able to be fulfilled, and all of the other essential services. It is a mammoth task, but all government resources will be deployed towards the end. Our priority is to make these towns become functioning centres of community life again. We will need to make sure that power and water are reconnected and running properly so that residents can return to their homes—those lucky ones that remain that were miraculously spared. Where homes have been destroyed, the authority can ensure a smooth path for individuals and insurance companies, helping to quickly process claims. Then we will have to move on to the permanent rebuilding.
Cutting through the bureaucracy and getting the job done is the direct charter of the authority. They will have the capacity to erect buildings and use personnel to get those towns back on their feet. The Prime Minister has committed the Australian government to rebuild these communities brick by brick and school by school. The Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority will coordinate that rebuilding and ensure that we cut through any of the bureaucratic barriers to make sure that the reconstruction begins as soon as possible. All that must be done in a way that takes into account what we have learnt from this terrible tragedy and plans for a safer future.
In terms of insurance, the Assistant Treasurer, Chris Bowen, met this morning with senior insurance industry representatives from the Insurance Council of Australia in order to get a clear assessment of how we can expedite claims and provide assistance to victims of the fires as soon as possible. The Assistant Treasurer advises that he made it clear to the Insurance Council that the government expects insurers to act in a compassionate manner and process claims as quickly as possible.
People who have suffered a loss of property due to the bushfires should contact their insurer directly. They do not need to worry if their insurance documents have been lost or destroyed. The insurer will have the details. Some insurers have put in place special arrangements to assist claims. Insurers are allowing the lodging of home and motor insurance claims over the phone and providing up to $5,000 in emergency funds where required for food and clothing. All insurers are putting claims staff and assessors on the ground as soon as possible as access to affected areas is granted. The Insurance Council and its members have activated an insurance task force to coordinate assistance to those who have concerns or questions about their claims. The Master Builders Association has also joined the task force and will be assisting with a supply of tradespeople and supplies for the rebuilding efforts. The government will keep the lines of communication open to insurers throughout this period.
In the days and weeks ahead, the Commonwealth and Victorian governments will be working systematically through the long-term challenges raised by these tragic bushfires. The enormity of the impact of this event is only just beginning to be understood by the Australian community. I know that government ministers are seeing implications throughout their work. Even in my portfolio of Immigration and Citizenship, we are seeing lots of impacts. We are trying to help people, be it through replacing citizenship certificates or providing other assistance, such as providing visas for overseas firefighters. All of government is focused on responding. Other departments are much more involved than many, particularly that of Senator Ludwig, who is Minister for Human Services. It is putting strain on our activity, but it is very much our focus and it highlights what a broad impact this has had on people. There are thousands of issues that now confront people, as well as the sheer tragedy of their immediate experience for those who have survived.
Obviously, the focus is on rebuilding homes and communities, the redevelopment of the infrastructure and re-engaging and rebuilding local communities, including agriculture and the local small businesses. It is a huge task. We very much acknowledge the way that Australians from all walks of life have come together to offer their assistance and do practical things to support those who have lost everything, particularly those who have suffered the loss of loved ones. The response has been fantastic.
I would like to acknowledge the support of all parliamentarians and the way that they have conducted themselves. We will attempt to keep the parliament informed of developments, but the rebuilding and reconstruction effort will obviously go on for years. Those who experienced the Canberra bushfires realise the huge ramifications of an event like this. And this is on a scale that we have never ever seen before. Assisting those people to rebuild their lives will present enormous challenges.
I do not want to talk about this as if it is somehow in retrospect—the danger remains. There are still real threats to property and life, and that is obviously a huge priority and challenge for us at the moment. It is also true that we continue to discover the full extent of the loss of life and damage done already, and it will be a while before we know the full extent of that. All the indications are that there is still more very distressing news to come as we work through the remains of this most horrific fire.
I thank the chamber for its indulgence and indicate that the government will attempt to keep the Senate, the parliament and the community informed as things develop further.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Victorian Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-02-11,"—by leave—I briefly want to thank Senator Evans very much on behalf of the opposition for keeping the Senate informed on the latest developments of the bushfire tragedy in Victoria. I indicate the opposition’s ongoing full support for all that the government is doing at the Commonwealth level to assist with the recovery. I indicate our strong support for what we know from our years in government is an extremely professional and confident Australian Public Service. As Senator Evans has indicated, they are involved in assistance on very many levels across the breadth of the Public Service. I thank him for his explanation of the circumstances surrounding Centrelink and for dealing with that. I think we all have to understand that these are unprecedented circumstances and that there will be difficulties and mistakes made. We acknowledge that, and we thank the government for its explanation and rectification of that issue.
We join with the government in congratulating all Australians on what has been a typical but nevertheless fantastic response to this tragedy. At the expense of sounding parochial, I was watching the Australia-New Zealand one-day international at Adelaide Oval yesterday and saw the response of my fellow South Australians. I think some $6 million was raised at that cricket match alone as a contribution towards the victims of these fires. Obviously, we join in expressing our heartfelt thanks to all those volunteers still out there fighting these ongoing fires in Victoria.

Obviously, the thoughts and prayers of this chamber are with those people who are trying in any way they can to alleviate the pain and suffering that people are going through in Victoria. I acknowledge the work of people in the hospitals, especially the burns units.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-02-11,"—by leave—This nation is rising magnificently to respond to its citizens who have been through such terror, destruction, loss and now grief. No doubt, with that will come some anger and great distress for quite some time to come. I thank the government for the statement and for keeping us informed. I agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate that all parliamentarians have been doing what they can, both directly and through support of the government, to get help to the victims of this still unfolding and horrible tragedy. For many of us, that includes staying at a distance while the government goes in on the ground and does its work. I say, as a human being as much as a parliamentarian—and I am sure you will agree with me—that our spirit wants to take us to the people in this tragedy, fold them in our arms, share with them what we have, lift their spirits and tell them, as the Prime Minister did yesterday, ‘We’ll be with you, brick by brick, as you build your lives again.’ We hope that that comes swiftly.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Victorian Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-02-11,"—by leave—I thank Senator Evans for updating us on the situation. I will provide a quick update on some people I have mentioned over the past couple of days—the SES volunteers from Marysville that were assisting down there on Saturday. They had less than 20 minutes to evacuate Marysville from when they realised they were under immediate danger to when Marysville went up in a fireball. A man has shared with us today the enormous guilt he feels in relation to the deaths of so many of his friends. So far, he and his wife know, from seeing their pictures in the Herald Sun, of nine of their friends from Marysville who perished in the fires. They both escaped separately to Alexandra and spent hours apart not knowing if each other had survived. They escaped in just their SES overalls. On Saturday night, a nurse from the hospital gave them the name of someone who offered them a room to sleep in. They are currently staying in someone’s bungalow in Coldstream. Unfortunately, they were among the people who went to Centrelink and got a letter saying that they did not ID properly. I appreciate the comments that you have made today and the efforts to rectify that particular situation. As SES volunteers, they felt they should have been able to do more. They were in positions of authority and responsibility. They felt they had failed and were having difficulty living with their guilt and grief. I stand with them today—as, I am sure, the parliament does—to say that they are heroes and that we are grieving with them as well.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Victorian Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1,speech

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-11,"—I would like to ask a quick question of the government. Given that, some 1½ hours after I asked about the amendments, we still do not have any amendments—I assume the government still does not have a timetable for the amendments—will the government be requiring the parliament to sit longer so that there can be due consideration of their amendments both in this chamber and in the other place?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—Obviously everybody listening to the broadcast of this would realise that the Labor Party are filibustering their way through this. It is a little bit ridiculous. I want to go through a couple of things Senator Arbib brought up. I want to note on the record that, the day after the US stimulus package, the American share market fell over. It was nothing to do with the bailout package. The bailout package still has not been finalised—not according to the Washington Post, which I have just looked at. So Senator Sherry’s proposition that the US stock market fell over because of the bailout package completely contradicts what the US newspapers are saying.
I have some serious questions. I do not know whether they are ever going to be answered or whether we are just going to have renditions of this debate. It seems peculiar in the extreme that, with the Labor Party wanting to bring forward the Emissions Trading Scheme and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, they are not part of the forward estimates in this package. For the life of me, I do not know why no reference is given to this—except that it is beyond the time frame of consideration—when the consideration of the ETS is immediate.
In the repayment schedule on page 5 of the updated economic and fiscal outlook booklet of February 2009, you have outlined how you are going to return the budget to surplus. You have put forward to the Australian people how you are going to repay $200 million in approximately two bullet points:
allowing the level of tax receipts to recover naturally as the economy improves, while maintaining the Government’s commitment to keep taxation as a share of GDP below the 2007-08 level on average; and
holding real growth in spending to 2 per cent a year until the budget returns to surplus.
That is $100 million per bullet point. The question everybody listening to this wants to know is: how on earth do we repay this money?
Why are we paying for things which, in the past, the states were supposed to pay for, such as schools and boom gates? These things are very meritorious in their own right, but what is the Labor Party’s belief in the role of the states these days? Do they not believe the states have a role? If they do not, that is fine, but let us have it on the record that they no longer think the states are relevant and capable of actually managing their own affairs. Why have the states fallen so far behind in managing to keep up their own infrastructure that now, ipso facto, your stimulus package has to bail them out? In the housing section of your package, the states will sell the land to the developers, so the states will make money; and then the developers will sell it to the Commonwealth, so the developers will make money. But, when the Commonwealth buys the land from the developers, why on earth are we going to pay back to the states the stamp duty and all the other charges when, at the end of the day, we will be delivering back to the states the houses and the land? Why are we going to pay for the houses twice and give them back to the states?
In your dissertation we have this crazy position whereby you are going to net off the debt. You have come up with this magical number of $2.66 billion, which apparently takes into account $7.5 billion in interest expenses. But you have netted it off against HECS, a commercial property vehicle and the Future Fund. The moneys in the Future Fund are supposed to stay within the fund. They are not supposed to be part of netting off anything. They are part of the growth in the Future Fund to cover other liabilities, such as unpaid Commonwealth superannuation.
The HECS debt is a non-determinant income flow. It is about $17 billion, and last year, even on principal and interest, it only returned six per cent. That was the return on both principal and interest, not just interest. Where are your exact numbers on what you really believe each one of those items to be—HECS, the commercial property vehicle and the Future Fund? Why have you changed the determination of where the Future Fund interest is going? What is your logic in netting off Future Fund interest when you know it is supposed to go back towards the corpus of the fund? How do you possibly believe that you can make a determination of what you are going to get back from the HECS fund when we are heading into the middle of a recession? How can you possibly understand what the return on the Future Fund is going to be when we are going into a recession and the share market is falling over?
What is the logic behind netting this off? How strong is your belief that this is going to give you the capacity to net off the debt at $2.66 billion? Why is your rounding error $40 million on the figures that you have given today? The questions go on and on and on. These are the questions that we want answered, rather than this eternal waffle the Australian people are hearing as you try to work out how you are going to stitch up a deal at the eleventh hour. This whole plan is hardly the Mona Lisa, but it sounds like you are doing your very best to put a moustache on it.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I thought I had been responding to questions as they were raised, Senator Joyce. Sure, some senators—on both sides, I would have to say—have engaged in what, at the suggestion of Senator Abetz, was a general debate and questioning. Senator Macdonald raised in the context of the world financial and economic crisis some perfectly reasonable, consistent and logical questions about Storm Financial and the impact that is having on people.
I can provide you with additional information in respect to the net debt position. I detailed the approach before lunch, and the approach of the government and Treasury is no different from that which occurred when you were in government. The net debt position will be $70 billion in financial year 2011-12. That is made up of debt and assets, and the income stream on the assets is $4.8 billion. The income stream on the debt is $7.5 billion. The net interest payment is $2.6 billion, rounded. There is no error, I might say, Senator Joyce. When you are dealing with billions, rounding to the nearest billion or 10th of a billion is appropriate. There is no error of $40 million—it is a rounding. It is the way that figures in the billions or tens of billions of dollars are rounded.
As I was saying, the income stream on the debt is $7.5 billion. The income stream on assets is $4.8 billion. They are netted out. Net debt and net interest payments were used by the former Treasurer. If you borrow $100 billion and invest $100 billion, that does yield a return. It is entirely appropriate to look at the net cost.
You raised an issue about the role of the states. I think we could have a very lengthy debate about the role of the states in our Federation—what is their responsibility and what is not their responsibility. I would make two points: firstly, it is certainly apparent to me that over the last 100-plus years of Federation—and it was certainly apparent to me over the almost 12 years when the Liberal-National Party was in government—there has been a general trend towards the Commonwealth assuming more and more responsibilities in this country, right across the board. That occurred under your former government in areas like health, education and industrial relations. A general trend has been there for 100 years.
This partly relates to the matters that are relevant to Storm Financial. The Commonwealth and I have had the responsibility of overseeing the COAG agreement to transfer the regulation and supervision of the remaining responsibilities of the states in financial services and the distribution of financial products to the Commonwealth. We reached agreement last year, and one of those areas includes margin lending. There are some others. So the general trend has been there and, as I say, we could have a lengthy debate about why that has occurred.
In the case of the financial services—I have given consumer credit as an example—it seems to me that in the modern world economy, and in the financial economy in particular, there is a compelling argument for nation-states and national governments to regulate and supervise their financial systems. Increasingly, I think it will become international. This is no criticism of any particular state of any political colour—Liberal, National Party or Labor. It is simply very difficult for states and territories in a modern financial services economy to regulate and supervise the financial sector. I just use that as an example, but it could be a very lengthy debate.
Senator Milne raised the issue of a bailout and whether any of the $6.2 billion would be used for that purpose. The answer is no. It will only go to new housing. There is $400 million for maintenance and $6 billion for new construction.
On the issue of the five-star rating for residential buildings and the question of it being two stars below the US standard, the government is working with the states and territories through our COAG process to examine and resolve improvements that can be made to the energy efficiency of commercial and residential buildings, firstly, including ensuring greater consistency in the application of building standards across all states and, secondly, an increase in energy efficiency requirements for new residential buildings to six stars. That is partly another issue that relates to the question that Senator Joyce asked about the roles and responsibilities of the states, and as questions are posed, as I have indicated, I will endeavour to inform the Senate.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-02-11,"—I thought I would contribute to this debate after listening to a fair bit of it this morning. I suppose I would like to put it into terms that we may get behind in some way. The $42 billion stimulus plan is like a battle plan for Australia to fight the war on recession. The question that has to be answered but may be difficult to answer is: will this battle plan win the war on the recession? And guess what? Nobody knows for sure. In fact, you could ask 10 economists and you would still get no consensus. Will the $42 billion plan win the war? That is what we are debating, but I do know one thing for sure: this $42 billion plan will do little to help the casualties of this recession. Even if this $42 billion is spent there will still be 300,000 Australians joining the ranks of the unemployed. If most Australians knew that, they would be concerned.
I have trouble sleeping at night—300,000 Australians added to the unemployment queue even if we spend the $42 billion. It is a battle all right, against recession, but we have forgotten the innocent casualties that will come from the war on recession through no fault of their own. These are innocent Australians—our fellow Australians—in your street and my street. We will all know someone who loses their job. I have trouble sleeping at night knowing that, even after spending $42 billion, there are still going to be 300,000 Australians added to the unemployment queue.
I went to the government, before the tragic fires, and said, ‘If we’re going to spend $42 billion, don’t you think we should dedicate some of that money to those innocent victims of the war?’ I did not come to this chamber to become like others—I say that a bit tongue in cheek. I do not want to be known as the best negotiator around the table, but, sure as all heck, I will go in to bat for my fellow Australians who are going to fall off the cliff. I have asked for some money to be set aside to assist the 300,000 Australians who are going to be added to the unemployment queue. Frankly, the response I am getting is like chess pieces being moved on a chessboard. It is insulting to everybody. You can tap-dance around it all you like, but I will go in to bat for them every day. We have to do more. We have to make this package work harder. With this package you are displaying the same sheer arrogance that brought the previous government down. You walk into this place and you say, ‘We’re not changing any of it.’ It is disgusting. Are you the only people with good ideas?
A bit of economics here—I will go back to day one. What was happening on day one? The Reserve Bank was going to make a significant announcement, but you guys wanted to hog the spotlight. The economy runs on confidence. You did not even allow the Reserve Bank’s downward adjustment of the interest rate to affect confidence in the marketplace. You wanted to hog it. You should have let that run its course and allowed confidence to build into the economy and then maybe come out with a plan. You did not allow the positive cycle of monetary policy to work itself out. No, no, no. You had to hog it. You had to beat your chests and say, ‘Hey, we’re in control of interest rates.’ Frankly, you should have let that run.
Then there was the second thing you did. You came into this place and basically told us, ‘Pass it, no questions asked.’ Don’t kid yourselves. Do not go to the Australian public and say you agreed to an inquiry. You were deadset against it. You have misread the Australian people. We know we need a stimulus package, but are you sure as all heck that your arrogance is 100 per cent right? That is what you said on day one: ‘Don’t worry about it; just pass it.’ That was step 2—another mistake.
Step 3: these negotiations have been lip-service. You are tap-dancing around here this afternoon. You have put it off to some convenient time when there are no news stories. Stop playing politics. This concerns Australian people, their families and their lives. I am deadset serious about this. This is just a joke. I may not be the best negotiator. I am just a kid from Reservoir, but, sure as all heck, I know when someone is stuffing around. Get serious. Do not treat the Australian public like you treat the Senate.
We need a stimulus package. It is just a shame that the government think that they need no other ideas except their own. It is very sad. It is a very sad day. We put forward a program and you will laugh at it. You will background journos and say, ‘This Get Communities Working plan is just a joke.’ Good on you. Beat your chest out there. Talk and background journos. Do what you like—I don’t care. I want to do something for the 300,000 unemployed Australians—not my numbers but Treasury numbers, and other economists have put the numbers even higher. You walk in here and just say, ‘Don’t worry about it.’
Let us look at the cash payments. Many Australians desperately need the $950. Some of them will get multiple payments. They desperately need them. Many Australians do not need the cash but, sure as heck, will take it. There are many Australians who desperately need the cash who actually will not get it. Then you have $75 million of these cash payments going to people overseas. But, no, no, no—you have it 100 per cent right. Wrong! I do not understand it. I do not know. What do you come to Canberra for? What do you sit in this chamber for? Yes, sure as heck, debate—no problem. But, jeepers, we have to look out for our fellow Australians. I am not in anyone’s pocket. I am not in yours and I am not in theirs, and that makes it an awfully lonely place. But I will go in to bat for my fellow Australians every day.
Sure as all heck, you could give it a go, giving even more of that $42 billion to help find more local jobs for people. Why would you not give it a go? What are you worried about? Are you worried about the opposition having a go at you because you changed your package? That is politics. What are you worried about? You got some of it wrong? Okay. We all get it wrong sometimes. We are all fallible. We are all human beings and we get it wrong. But, blimey, Teddy, you started this out in an awfully adversarial way. Did you not learn anything from watching the other side when they were in government? Work Choices—did you not learn from that? Do not think it was just about IR. Think about how they went about it. Think about how they went about playing politics in this place rather than genuinely looking out for all Australians.
I can only ask you to relook at this package. There are a few hours left before I have to vote on this. I do not know how I am going to vote. I did not sleep terribly well last night. I will certainly look at this from the point of view of those forgotten Australians, those Australians who do not have a voice. I will look at it from the point of view of those families—fathers, mothers and kids. We are going into debt to spend $42 billion and we are still going to have 300,000 Australians on the unemployment queue. You may play politics. You may say, ‘We’re saving up to 90,000 jobs.’ That is good, but I believe you can make this package work harder. But do you know how much time we have? Zero time. We have zero time to look at this package and make it really work so that we can not only try to win the battle against recession but also look after those innocent victims who are going to be casualties of it. Think about someone in your street. Think about what it is going to do to them when they lose their job and they have very little prospect of finding another one. Think about it. Think about it more than on one day, just when you wake up. Think about it for more than the 48 hours that you gave the Senate. I do and, I tell you, I am having trouble sleeping.
The way you have gone about this is really appalling. It really is. I am so surprised that you can be so out of touch. You got us into this mess. We have a $42 billion package in front of us and you are not going to change it. You may tinker with it now after someone has shamed you into it. You may tinker at the edges, but you have no genuine desire to change it. We are in the situation now that if we do not pass it we will lose the confidence of Australia, because you have given hope to people. You could have allowed interest rates to start to work and given us more time to work on this. But you have presented this package in such a way that anyone who does not vote for it is ruining the confidence of Australia. You may very well be right, but you have set that up. It is such a shame that you have done it in such an adversarial way rather than in genuine partnership.
I have been out of work, once. Maybe you have too—I don’t know. It is not a pretty place to be when you cannot find a job. It is awful. We have to make this package work harder. I have a few short hours to work out what I am going to do with this. I am torn between two places and a hard rock. I am sure I am going to get criticised on it. Plenty of people can criticise, but I am genuinely trying to work through this issue. From day one, even before the fires, I was talking about the unemployed, the forgotten Australians who do not have a voice. It is going to hit them like a brick on the head and they are not going to be able to get another job.
Get Communities Working is all about grassroots measures, getting the unemployed working again—maybe in some soft areas that you cannot count in GDP. It is about social capital, the glue in the community. Go and talk to your local councils. Honestly go and talk to them and really find out about it. Building social capacity in a community is not something you can count on a calculator. You cannot count it in GDP. That does not mean it is not worth while. There are going to be valuable Australians who are looking for a job, and not a job where someone could say, ‘You’re just digging holes and filling them.’ Crikey! You are going to use that argument.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I have responses to a couple of earlier questions from Senator Joyce and from Senator Macdonald. Before I give those, I would like to say in response to the contribution from Senator Fielding: I do not sit in your place but I do appreciate your passion and your concerns and the difficulty in making decisions of such magnitude. I do understand that. I have not sat in your place but I do have at least some appreciation of the difficulties these issues present.
If I could just relate a personal experience, I did not live through the Great Depression; my father lived through it. He was an orphan. He lived on cabbages, vegemite sandwiches and rabbits when they were cheap, and he would go out and catch them wild. I did get a lot of stories from my father about those times in the 1920s and 1930s and at times when I was a young kid I thought it was a bit of a lecture about these types of issues. I am not suggesting the world faces a Great Depression, but I do understand, at least related to me by my father, the experiences he went through in the Great Depression. They were very, very tough circumstances, tougher than many others.
I think it is fair for me to observe, Senator Joyce, that when we were elected to government I was very proud to be a new minister. Looking back over the last year, I certainly did not believe a year ago that we would have faced the financial systems firestorm that has erupted all around the world and the sheer number and complexity of issues that I have had to deal with in my particular responsibilities—issues I never expected I would have to consider—because of the way the world financial system in many other countries has collapsed, with the obvious impact on Australia. Now we have to deal with the economic consequences of it, and they are serious. Again as a personal reflection, I would not have thought debates around things like short selling, for example, would have become some sort of mainstream general economic debate. Who would have believed it? There is a whole range of issues. Senator Macdonald has referred to the Storm matters. Whilst I strongly believe that financial regulation should be a national issue, I did not anticipate a year ago, in moving to improve the regulatory oversight of margin lending, just how important that issue would become in the context of Storm and other difficulties we have seen for thousands of Australians.
We all bear the weight on our shoulders now, given what is occurring around the world and its impact. I think we all bear it quite sincerely, and I certainly appreciate the sincerity with which you bring your perspective. The government has put together a very significant package, given the weight of global recession and the emerging events just in the last three months—the pace at which countries have been going into much greater recessions than had been believed possible; the continuing reassessment by, for example, the International Monetary Fund; the impact on a country like China and then the impact on Australia. I sincerely believe, Senator Joyce, that the government has put together a strong package that will assist. But you were right to remind us—
—Madam Temporary Chairman, on a point of order: I think Senator Sherry is referring to Senator Fielding.
—I am sorry, yes, Senator Fielding. But I do not question your sincerity and passion, Senator Joyce. We will disagree on some of the issues and solutions. The government strongly believe this is an appropriate package for the times. Australia would face a more severe economic downturn and greater unemployment if this package were not passed. I have great respect for Treasury, not just because we are now in government; I had great respect for Treasury in those long years in opposition, often dealing with them in Senate estimates. As best they are able to do—I believe they have done their very, very best—Treasury have given us an estimate that as a consequence of this package there will be about half a per cent higher growth in 2008-09 and around three-quarters to one per cent higher growth in 2009-10. I do understand, Senator Joyce, that there will be an increase in unemployment—

(Senator Moore)—Minister, you mean Senator Fielding.
—Senator Fielding, I am sorry—I have in my mind some further answers to Senator Joyce. I do accept, Senator Fielding, that increasing unemployment carries with it a significant economic and social impact on those individuals. I accept your bona fides, I accept your passion, I accept your interest. As you are aware, and the Treasurer, Mr Swan, has said this, there are discussions occurring. I am not party to those discussions. I am here to deal with the bills that we have in front of us and answer questions, and I have been doing that as they have been raised.
I do strongly support the package and I believe it is the appropriate way forward at this point in time. I do not believe we can wait and see just how bad things get and there is no absolute guarantee that it will work. As the Prime Minister has indicated, there is no absolute guarantee but it is incumbent upon us as a government to act. And I understand the heavy responsibilities on your shoulder to make a call about the package and whatever other discussions occur in respect to your meeting, or meetings, with the Treasurer. That is a heavy responsibility just as it is, obviously, for the Greens and Senator Xenophon.
To go to a couple of matters, I have some further information for Senator Joyce. The netting of debt: we do net off HECS, commercial property and the Future Fund. Netting off the Future Fund interest is logical. That has been the approach. I understand it is consistent with accounting standards. It is explained in MYEFO that net debt is the sum of the selected financial liabilities less the sum of the selected financial assets. It has been that way consistently for many years, certainly under the former government. Regarding the claim of no reference to the forward estimates, to the CPRS, it is in the estimates for revenue and expenses but it is not in the economic forecast as it is beyond the forecast horizon of 2009-10.
You and I, Senator Joyce, have been having an exchange about the impact of the stimulus package and the bailout package, as I interjected inappropriately; we are both right, Senator Joyce. My observations and the observations of financial commentators in respect to the—
—You are never wrong.
—We are both right. I am explaining why we are both right. I observed, based on the financial commentary after the release of the bailout package, that the markets in the United States dropped between three and four per cent. It is fact. Senator Joyce updated his observations and made his comments about the stimulus package that was passed, as I understand it, a few hours ago. And you are correct; the markets reacted adversely to that. I was not aware of that, Senator Joyce. I made my comments in good faith based on what I had seen on the wires and CNN and BBC World Service this morning as a consequence of the claimed lack of details on the bailout package.
Senator Macdonald may have some more points on Storm Financial but he did indicate he believed there was a $600 billion to $700 billion liability in respect to the bank guarantee. That is not correct. MYEFO stated that the expected liability is remote and unquantifiable. As I said, I have drawn a clear distinction between a guarantee and a bailout package, which has been occurring in many other economies around the world. Will a part of the $42 billion go to the big four banks? No, it will not. This is not a bailout package where we are passing, as has occurred in many other countries, tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over to financial institutions. That is not the purpose of this package; that is not what is occurring. It is a major package to provide a stimulus to the Australian economy to minimise the impact of the spreading financial and economic crisis. We have gone out of our way to direct this package to low- and middle-income earners and a range of short- to medium-term projects that we believe are appropriate to underpin the Australian economy given the serious and very rapidly developing world financial and economic circumstances.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-02-11,"—Senator Sherry, I thank you for your previous answer to my question. I join with you and appreciate the fact that you have indicated to the four major banks and other lending institutions that, having received some support from the Australian government—that is, from the taxpayers through the Australian government—the banks should be very careful about the way they deal with margin loans they have lent. Sure it is their money but there is a way of dealing with them and the early information and evidence from the Storm Financial victims indicates that some banks are not playing the game. I appreciate your urging—dare I call it warning—the banks to be very careful because if the lot of Australians are impacted upon by capricious bank action then they will be named and followed in this chamber.
There are other questions I would like to ask but I know a lot of my colleagues want to ask questions so I will briefly move to the other question I did want to raise with you. As I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate yesterday, nothing that is happening in the north can, in any way, compare with the horrendous situation in Victoria at the moment. Having said that, there is the community up in the Gulf of Carpentaria—not a big community—that has been without road access for more than four weeks now, almost since the beginning of the year. There is another community between Cairns and Normanton and Karumba—a place called Georgetown—that, again, is cut off by the washing away of the Ainslie river bridge. My question that I do seek a response from you is: where in the spending package will there be money that will assist more than just natural disaster management responses, which are normal—money that might go to not just fix roads that are cut but actually improve them so they will not be cut in the future?
The communities that I ask this question on behalf of are only small. They are a long way from the capital city media outlets, so they do not get as much profile as perhaps they would if they were close to a capital city and had been without a means of getting provisions for over four weeks. The closure of the Einasleigh River bridge, east of Georgetown, will cut off that community from supplies, will prevent transportation of people and stop the very wealthy produce of the north-west and the Gulf country—that is, the cattle—from getting out to the coast where it is needed. I do not want to prolong my question. I want to give you, Minister, an opportunity to answer. Will money be made available?
I mentioned again very briefly in my speech on the second reading the case of the people at Karumba. They have been cut off for more than four weeks. They have an airstrip that is not sealed. The Queensland government has agreed to pay one-third of the cost of sealing the airstrip, but just sealing the airstrip is not what is required. They need more. They need the airstrip extended, and this requires some action by the Queensland government to provide the additional land that is needed. Why do they need this extension of the airstrip? There is no way of getting in and out of Karumba at the moment, although if you can get through to Normanton, you can get on the Norman River on a barge and barge down the very winding river—which is in flood at the moment. If the airstrip were operational, you would be able to fly in relief goods—that is, food and emergency medical provisions—and use it in good times, and they will return. As I said somewhere else, the rain we get in the north does cause problems but it is what makes the north so great. It is what gives us the rainforests, the fishing and all the other attributes that make Northern Australia a very desirable place not only in which to live but also for tourists to visit. If this airstrip were extended then planes like Dash 8s could actually land on it. At the moment they cannot. In times when the community is cut off, it could be the only means of support.
Minister, I ask where in the package—and it relates to bill No. 2, I think—is money being made available for those essential forms of infrastructure? I could spend hours suggesting other forms of infrastructure that would be as useful, as important and as economically productive. Batts in ceilings do not qualify in my view as productive expenditure. I want to concentrate in my question on those communities west of Cairns, right out to the border, that simply do not have the normal facility of road access because of the rains and because of poorly designed infrastructure that will require substantial sums of money to fix.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I have a number of responses in respect of some earlier questions Senator Joyce posed. Thank you, Senator Macdonald; I think drawing attention to the impact of the floods is important. I cannot give a specific commitment in respect of the individual communities you have highlighted. I can indicate that the package contains two elements on page 22, in Repairing Regional Roads and the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program—Strategic Projects. I understand that they are to be delivered through local governments. It would be possible for the type of infrastructure issue you have highlighted to be accessed through those two areas. I will also pass on to the minister, Mr Albanese, the specific matters you have raised.
Senator Joyce raised this issue. He asked why, when the Commonwealth buys land, we are refunding stamp duty to the states. The Commonwealth is providing funding to the states to invest further in social housing. The states will purchase houses and units under normal commercial conditions or, where the private sector or the not-for-profit community sector is contracted by state governments, the states and the developers will negotiate these arrangements. Stamp duty may be payable on purchases and construction of these homes. The Commonwealth will not own any housing and is not refunding stamp duty. The Commonwealth and the states have agreed that the states are responsible for identifying social housing projects that are already in their development pipelines and can be brought forward and completed through stage 1 before 30 June 2010. The states will also be responsible for undertaking the process to determine suitable social housing projects through stage 2 for the 2009-10 financial year and onwards.
Senator Joyce also raised a question about the schedule for returning the budget to surplus. In the UEFO it is estimated that the underlying cash balance will be in deficit in 2008-09 and in 2009-10. It is projected to remain in deficit across the forward years from 2010-11 and 2011-12. In saying that I point out that, if you look at the fiscal balance set out from MYEFO to UEFO from 2008-09 through to 2011-12, the fiscal balance is projected at 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2008-09, at 2.8 in 2009-10—which is in fact the maximum—and then it commences a decline in 2010-11 to 2.5 and in 2011-12 to 1.8. As I have indicated, as the economy recovers and grows above trend, the government will take action to return the budget to surplus. When the budget returns to surplus, the government has said it will draw upon surpluses to pay down debt as rapidly as economic conditions permit. The speed at which the budget can be returned to surplus will depend on the severity of the current downturn and the speed of recovery. It is important to note that the fiscal stimulus package has been developed to ensure that it does not lock in increases in baseline government spending. This recognises that the stimulus needs to fall away over time so that it no longer operates when it is not needed.
Senator Joyce, you asked for some components of interest receipts and payments. Again, I do not want to take up too much time with reams of statistics but I will give you some figures. Future Fund breakdown of interest receipts: Future Fund interest 2008-09 is calculated to be $2.3 billion and then $1.9 billion over two remaining fiscal years dropping to $1.8 billion in 2011-12. Interest on cash and deposits: $2 billion in 2008-09, rising slightly to $2.2 billion in 2009-10 and around $2 billion in 2010-11 and 2011-12. There are details of other interest receipts and then a breakdown of interest payments on government borrowings that are projected out to 2011-12. As I have indicated, there is no change in budget of Future Fund earnings. The underlying cash balance is reported, excluding Future Fund earnings, but the Future Fund is included in the Australian government sector general balance sheet.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—The $2.3 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.9 billion and going up to $1.8 billion in 2011-12 would seem to suggest from our own figures that you believe the trajectory of returns for the Future Fund is down. That would seem to contradict in some way your expectation of where you see the economy returning to a position where you can start repaying your debt. So that is an issue. Can you also specify exactly what you believe the amount you are going to get from HECS repayments is in interest? I will look to the Hansard to get specific figures because I want to go through them. I am still unclear about what you mean, if the state government is putting on stamp duties and other charges, why the Commonwealth should be paying them. In essence, at the end of the day we are giving them a house and land. I do not think many of the people listening would like the idea that we have to pay you to give you a house and land, and that is what we are doing with the states.
The concept of how you are going to repay this debt is amorphous, and that is the big thing on most Australians’ minds, if anecdotally my emails are a true indication of it. I want to know in your own words something that any banker or accountant could tell you: what do you believe is too much government debt, a level that Australia could not handle? It is extremely important that you give us a number. If you squib the question, it would seem to indicate that you have every intention that the $200 billion is not going to be the end of the show, that we are going to be stitched up with even more credit card debt than this. What do you think should be the top level of debt? Any other business, any banker or accountant would be able to give you an indication. You might have a grey area but they could definitely say, ‘This level of debt is too high.’ I want to see whether there is the capacity for the government to give an answer to that question.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—There has been no change in the long-term projected rate of return for the Future Fund. It is somewhat like the issue relating to superannuation fund long-term rates of return. In the case of superannuation, Treasury have projected and forecast five per cent over the long term, which is extremely accurate, despite movements up and down from year to year. The Future Fund has not changed its long-term projection on its rate of return. There will be years when it is below and years when it is above.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—If that is the case, this would suggest that, quite obviously, if we have to find $7.5 billion when we net it off it does not mean we have to find an amount less than $7.5 billion; it means that when you net it off, because these moneys are allocated to other provisions and therefore, in fact, cannot be used as a set-off for the $7.5 million, we actually have to find the $7.5 billion to pay the debt. You cannot net it off because the money cannot go from the Future Fund to pay off the bonds; the money from the Future Fund has to go back to the Future Fund. It cannot be set off against the debt. Tell me if that statement is right or wrong or do you believe that the Future Fund money can actually be delivered to set off the debt—that is, sent off to people to pay for the interest on the bonds they buy from the Australian government?
The next issue is that it seems to be apparent, if this is trending down, that even on your net figures your interest payments would have to be trending up. Our debt is going to become more extensive as we fully draw down on the facility. Even by your own figures, you have gone from $2.3 billion down to $1.8 billion. So there is half a billion dollars extra that somebody is going to have to find and pay. I want an answer on that. I really do want to know if the government can give the Australian people a number as to what it believes is excessive debt held by the government.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—There are two points. If we look at the Future Fund interest, I think we have to bear in mind—and I have not gone to the Future Fund and sought a response; I will attempt to do this; it may be the case; I do not want to mislead—that the asset base and the investments of the Future Fund are changing over time. It started off all in cash and then was placed into the markets. That was fortuitous for the Future Fund for the obvious reason that they are predominantly in cash at a time of market downturn, so they are receiving. Their performance is obviously better than if the funds had all been placed in the markets and equities in the last year, given what has happened to the markets. As I understand it, that mix will change over time. It converts from predominantly cash and diversifies into equities because, over the longer term, equities—it is argued, and I think reasonably so—give a higher return than if it were all in cash. It is a diversified portfolio. That may be the explanation. I will check with the Future Fund.
In terms of the netting, we have to agree to disagree. You have a view. I have indicated twice now why the netting occurs and the reason for it and that it occurred under the previous government. It is the way in which the netting is carried out in terms of interest receipts and interest payments.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—We may have a different view but the proposition is completely correct that, if you do not send off a cheque for $7.5 billion to those who hold the bonds, you will not be sending them off enough money. If you send off a cheque for $2.66 billion, you will have a riot on your hands because you will have completely underpaid them.
The reality is—and I think you spelt it out clearly—your income stream from interest is going to become a dividend stream. You quite obviously cannot net off the dividend stream and say, ‘We’re actually collecting money in dividends so we’re going to net that off against our interest expense,’ because they are two unrelated items. That might be how it is stated but it is stated wrongly, because Australia will have to find a cheque for $7.5 billion to send off to pay for the bonds. I believe that is an optimistic view and, I would suggest, undershooting the mark. I do not want to get into a discussion about the Future Fund and the movement of dividend streams and what prospective returns on dividend streams will be like if this recession pans out the way it is, but I am still very interested to know what you believe, as a guide, is excessive debt to be held by the Australian federal government.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,—I believe that I have already covered the domestic economy. I have also referred at reasonable length to the Australian situation vis-a-vis some other countries. I believe that we have covered the issue. The Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook document well outlines the impact of the world financial economic crisis in terms of not just the reasons for the package of $42 billion but also the impact on the revenue side and what has occurred so significantly and rapidly over the last couple of months as this international financial and economic crisis has unfolded.,SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—If you have a commercial premise of a loan, people look for between an eight- and a 15-year run-down of that facility. Do you, as representing the view of the government, have any belief about what is a diligent time over which this should be repaid? Is there any view? If there is a view, can you please tell us over what time frame it should be?
I want to go back to the question of debt. Dr Henry said that he believed a trillion dollars was excessive debt and that Australia could not go to that extent. Do you hold the same view? My third question is: after we have a debt of $200 billion and we then go into the infrastructure package, which seems to be in the vicinity of another $70 billion or so, are we going to be issuing more bonds for that? We will be amortising the interest so we will be up to about $300 billion. We are a third of the way to a trillion dollars, and that is why it is extremely important that the Australian people understand exactly where you are taking our nation and the absolute seriousness of where we are off to with this. What is your path and progression to start removing us from that position? Do you have any assets in mind that you want to sell? Do you have in mind any major restructuring of the Public Service whereby you can make cuts? Is it a belief of having a P&I out of the operating revenue or a taxation proposition of the Australian people? Do you intend to keep the same tax treatment regime that we currently have, or do you envisage a change to it so as to fit your debt requirements? These are the questions that this bush accountant wants to know about.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I understand, and I know that this issue was canvassed by you at the finance and admin committee. I have just been looking at the debate that occurred there. I would agree with Dr Henry’s response on this point. I note that when this matter was raised he indicated that the way most economists think about the deficit question is to think about public debt dynamics. We have had since the mid-1980s in this country a concentration on the level of public sector debt—I would suggest as in no other country on earth. And, as you know, Australia today has negative net debt. He drew your attention and that of other committee members to chart 4.2 on page 46 of the document, which looked at the net debt position of select countries. I added to that in detail earlier in response to a question. Dr Henry observed that the net debt was minus 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 2008. You can see in the document by how much that is projected to grow over the three-year period from 2008 to 2010. It is then, corrected, minus 1.3.
So as much material as Treasury have currently available on this issue, and their analysis—and as I said earlier I have great respect for the analysis of Treasury as I have spent many years in opposition questioning them on these issues—mean that they have provided the very best that they could in the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook and I believe that the response of Dr Henry on this point was correct.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—With the greatest respect, Minister, I do not think you have answered some of the crucial points of my question, so I will repeat them. We are going to have a $200 billion facility that you are going to have to finance. The expected cost of funds, as you believe at this point in time, is going to be around four per cent, but the more you go into the bond market the more you are going to force up the cost of funds for all Australians because of extensive borrowing. For every per cent you force it up, everybody with a $1 million facility pays an extra $10,000 a year and everybody with a $500,000 house loan pays an extra $5,000 a year. That is the reality that comes home to the kitchen table for everybody.
But here is the question. You are soon going to have a $200 billion facility. When you, on top of that, issue more bonds for an infrastructure package, which we envisage will be around $70 billion, are you therefore going to have a $270 billion facility? And if your cost of funds is at four per cent does that mean that there is going to be another amortisation on top of that—unless you envisage repaying the interest straight off the top. If you are going to amortise it out we are quickly going to get ourselves into a position of a bit better than $10 billion per year that is going to sit on top of that debt. So you are going to have $270 billion plus a multiple in excess of $10 billion—$280 billion. Within a year or two we will be up to $300 billion in debt. Dr Henry says that we cannot afford to get to $1 trillion, so we will be a third of the way there and we will have done it in a couple of years.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I think your questions—and debate—are in large part a debate about what occurs beyond 2011-12. I must say that I did attempt to discuss these issues sometimes with Treasury when I was in opposition. But, in relation to the data we have, the projections and estimates, and the speculation about what may or may not occur beyond 2011-12, I am not in a position to engage in a discussion about that today for the government. We have used an outlook over a period that you used in government and we have based analysis and the package on that period through to 2011-12. I do not believe I can add any more or speculate about circumstances that may arise beyond that period.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-02-11,"—Before asking my question I would just like to add that I have had quite a lot of discussions with those involved with Storm Financial, including literally hours with Emmanuel Cassimatis—and I do not wish to even go down the road of Storm. Tomorrow I will be lodging a notice of motion and will leave it to the appropriate inquiries to come out with the details of that, and, as Minister Sherry said, there are already some investigations underway so I prefer not to comment on them.
Last Thursday I spoke in the Senate about batts in the ceiling. There are many people in Australia, especially in New South Wales and Queensland, who live in timber homes. My better half, Nancy, is one who has a small timber two-bedroom home in Bingara near the Tamworth/Inverell area, where it gets extremely hot. Forty degrees is nothing new during summer there. A couple of years ago, she put batts in the ceiling and none in the walls—there is no insulation in the walls. Because of the sun on the walls during the day, the heat comes through the walls and the house gets extremely hot. She has a dual-read thermometer that reads the inside and outside temperatures—it has a little lead going out the window. Of a morning it tells the temperature inside and outside the house.
She will wake up tomorrow morning and I would guess that the temperature will probably be around 24 degrees inside the house and 19 degrees outside the house. What happens is that without insulation in the walls the house is worse. I can assure you that by putting the batts in the ceiling the house is hotter in summer during the day and during the night. Frankly, the place needs air-conditioning the way it is now. To put insulation into the walls, you would have to remove the weatherboards. These are aged houses, and there are thousands of them throughout New South Wales and Queensland. The weatherboards are Cyprus pine. If they were removed, they would simply split and fall to bits. To insulate that house properly, you would have to remove the weatherboards, put the insulation in and then put new weatherboards on and paint them. It would cost thousands of dollars.
Is the minister aware of this? With some 2.7 million homes projected to get ceiling insulation batts, what are you going to do about these wooden homes, especially in northern New South Wales and Queensland? If you put batts in those ceilings, I can tell you that during summer the houses will be worse; they will be hotter inside day and night than if they had no ceiling insulation at all. What is the government’s plan on this? Are you simply going to allow people to spend the $1,600 bonus to put the batts in the ceiling and leave the walls as is? If you are, it is up to you to inform the public of the ramifications: it would be money wasted. Nancy’s home is worse as a result of the batts in the ceiling, which have been there a couple of years. If I had a bit of time, I would certainly remove them.
Are you going to make the people who own those older weatherboard style homes—and there are literally thousands of them in those areas that I mentioned—aware that, if they do not put insulation in the walls, they will be worse off? I can take you to the thermometer and show you the reading tomorrow morning. I am not telling porkies; I am telling the honest truth. This is the situation: the house is worse because of those batts in the ceiling.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—Senator, I am not sure whether you are aware that earlier we had a discussion or exchange with Senator Milne about the insulation issue. She raised a number of questions about the comprehensiveness of the approach and the need for energy audits. She made the fair and reasonable point that ceiling batts are not the only solution and that there are other issues, such as minimising draughts, shades on windows and double glazing. We have had a debate about curtains. You have raised a very legitimate issue about wall insulation.
As I indicated, in this package the government is doing something that is very substantial with the ceiling batt issue. We cannot do everything; we cannot cover off every area of insulation of a home. We think, and we are advised, that ceiling batts is the major area where improvement can be made. It does not mean that other improvements cannot be made in other areas. The package attempts to address the main but not the only issue relating to insulation.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

I have a couple of very specific questions. I could make a 20-minute speech, but I will not. I think it is important that we try to get answers as specific as possible from the minister and his officials. What I want to know, seeing that we have touched again on the insulation issue, is this: will the insulation measure result in a reduction in Australia’s CO2 emissions beyond the unilateral five per cent reduction below 2000 levels by 2020? My second question relating to the insulation measure is: does the energy efficiency measure provide an effective subsidy to high emitters by reducing their permit price?

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2009-02-11,"—Before I contribute to the debate, I seek leave to make a personal explanation under standing order 190.

(Senator Moore)—I am sorry, Senator Humphries, but I have been advised that that is not applicable during the committee process. It would have to be done when we return to standard business.
—Okay. I will ask a question of the minister and come back to that later. I took part yesterday in the deliberations of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on the Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009, which looked at the social housing program of the stimulus package. I must say that I was appalled to see how much reliance was being placed by the Australian government on the good offices and effectiveness of the state and territory public housing authorities as the vehicle for delivering some $6 billion—in fact, more than $6 billion—of funding for social housing across Australia, given the quite deplorable record of these agencies in delivering on existing housing programs, particularly under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.
Senators will not be ignorant of the fact, I am sure, that in previous years some $1 billion was invested in social housing by the Commonwealth under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, and the net outcome of that investment appears to have been that the total quantity of social housing in Australia fell. There were fewer social housing dwellings available through state and territory public housing authorities at the end of the relevant period after the $1 billion investment by the Commonwealth than there were at the beginning. With a record like that, it would be a very fair question to ask whether one ought to then increase that investment and hope you get a better outcome.
I ask the minister whether in all conscience he can tell the chamber that he has confidence in state and territory housing authorities to deliver the sorts of outcomes that the Commonwealth expects in social housing in this country given the clearly very poor record that these agencies have to make improvements in the quantity and quality of social housing across Australia. I also ask him to consider this question. This is an opportunity, with such an enormous investment available to the Commonwealth, to drive systemic and cultural change in state and territory housing sectors—to improve, for example, the level of accountability, the thoroughness of processes used to deliver outcomes and the way in which the public housing authorities involve the community housing organisations across Australia. If one looks at the agreement which has been reached between the Commonwealth and the states entitled National partnership agreement on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan—social housing, which is annexed to the report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs tabled yesterday, one sees a document which demands very little of the states to improve outcomes in this area. Paragraph C18, which is entitled ‘Key requirements for proposals to be funded under element 1—new construction’, sets out the sorts of criteria which have been placed on state and territory housing authorities, and the rigour of these criteria appear to be wanting. It contains phrases such as:
Proposals … will be assessed against the following key requirements:
increase the supply of social housing dwellings within a jurisdiction …
What does that mean—the quantity, the quality, the total number of dwellings? If a state receives funding of half-a-billion dollars and it manages to increase the number of dwellings by a hundred, does that meet the tests that the Commonwealth is outlining? It appears to me that it does. Another criterion is:

 

increase the allocation of housing to people with highest needs on public housing waiting lists …
How many such people? Over what period of time? What are the highest needs on public housing lists? To what extent should the allocation be increased? It is not explained. These are appallingly loose tests being imposed on the states to deliver an extremely expensive program of $6 billion. Another criterion is:

 

constructed dwellings are environmentally sustainable …
To what standard and at what level? There are many tests for environmentally sustainable dwellings in this country. Which one does the government propose to use? It is not clear. If this is meant to be driving reform in state housing authorities courtesy of the enormous investment the Commonwealth is making, it is an abysmal failure. I ask the minister why he has felt it necessary, in the haste with which this package has been brought forward, to throw on the table $6 billion, all of it being shovelled out of the door into the coffers of state housing authorities, when such poor accountability mechanisms are in place to make sure that the Commonwealth taxpayer gets from this investment good value for money and to make sure that that systemic reform and cultural change in these organisations are driven and good outcomes at that level are obtained for those in the Australian community who rely on social housing.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I do not believe that the picture of the various state housing authorities, as they are described, from state to state or from state to territory is quite as bleak as Senator Humphries has outlined. I have some local knowledge in Tasmania. I do not think it is as bleak as he has described. However, the agreements under the former government and going back many, many years have been overly focused on outputs rather than on a range of specific criteria for change and reform. If I look at ‘Key requirements for proposals to be funded under element 1—new construction’, I see there is a shift away from outputs to a range of quality criteria. In C18, it says:
Proposals for funding under Element 1 of the initiative will be assessed against the following key requirements:

increase the supply of social housing dwellings within a jurisdiction;
having regard to agreed reforms listed … in line with the report to COAG on reforms by December 2009;
increase the allocation of housing to people with highest needs on public housing waiting lists;
facilitate or support the transition of persons who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to secure long term accommodation;
adhere to universal design principles that facilitate better access for persons with disability and older persons;
constructed dwellings are environmentally sustainable; and
promote activity in the short term using a variety of procurement arrangements, including spot purchases of house and land packages, purchases ‘off the plan’.
Those are the key requirements. As the Prime Minister has said in no uncertain terms and has made very clear not just in this area but in all areas for implementation of the package where there are state involvements, there will be a rigorous assessment of the key requirements. This is a significant change from the past where there has been a focus on outputs in this area.
So, firstly, I do not accept that the picture is perhaps quite as bleak as you paint it right around the country. Secondly, we do recognise that there is a need for reform and improvement that shifts the focus from outputs in this package or a consequence of this package in element 1, new construction. We do accept that there needs to be a significant change in focus. We intend to ensure that there is very vigorous assessment against the key requirements. As I have said, the Prime Minister has made it very clear—both publicly in announcing the package and in respect of the meeting that took place with the state premiers and territory leaders—that this will be carried out. To their credit, I understand they have accepted the need for these new requirements, the new focus and the very rigorous assessment that will occur.
Senator Humphries, you may not have been present when Senator Milne raised some of these issues and we had a fairly significant question and answer session. Senator Milne raised, for example, the five-star rating in Australia for residential buildings. In summary, I indicated that the Commonwealth does intend to ensure greater consistency in the application of building standards across all states because they vary. The increased energy efficiency requirements for new residential buildings to six stars, or the equivalent nationally, by 2010 and the introduction of mandatory disclosure of residential building energy, greenhouse and water performance at the time of sale or lease by 2010 go to some of the specifics of the key requirements that I referred to earlier. There is no criticism intended—not everyone follows the debate all the time—but there was reasonably extensive debate and discussion with Senator Milne about some of the matters you have been raising.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—I want to go back to the interest expense. Because the rollout of the majority of this debt and this facility will be in the short term and the draw-down facility, as brought to light during the Senate inquiry, will be in the short term, do the government expect that the interest will be paid or is it their intention to capitalise the interest? If the interest is to be repaid, how do they expect that to be repaid from a reduced workforce? Is it their intention to tax the workforce more or to tax corporations more to make up the money? If that is not their intention then ipso facto their intention must be that they are going to capitalise the interest. Is that what they intend to do—capitalise the interest and buy more bonds for it?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I think at least in part the answer to your question, Senator Joyce, is illustrated by why revenue estimates have declined so significantly—the $115 billion. That is because of the world economic downturn, or recession in many cases. As we have indicated, there will be recovery in the Australian economy and there will be recovery in the world economy, which has been so seriously hit by the financial crisis. We have indicated because it is an issue of focus for this government that, as the economy recovers and grows above trend, the government will be taking action to return the budget to surplus. That can mean allowing the level of tax receipts to recover naturally as the economy improves. I have mentioned the significant drop in estimated revenue because of the economic fall-off in this country and the recession in a number of other countries. So revenue will grow when the economy improves, and the economy will improve.
We have maintained our commitment to keep taxation as a share of GDP below the 2007-08 level. Further to that, not just on the income tax receipts, we have given a commitment to holding real growth in spending to two per cent a year until the budget returns to surplus. We have provided over the period through to 2011-12 various estimates and projections, as occurred when the Liberal-National Party were in government—and you were a part of that government. Treasury have provided as accurate estimates as they can make of the various economic indicators—unemployment, employment, economic growth, a range of other domestic economic forecasts on demand and output, and other selected economic measures—through to 2009-10 and, in the case of the budget deficit, through to 2011-12, of both the cash balance and the fiscal balance.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—With all due respect, I listened but I do not think I heard the answer, so I will try and be more precise: are you going to borrow more money to pay for the interest on the money we have borrowed in the short term? From what you say, Minister, it sounds like that is exactly what we are going to do, because you talked about the collapse of income. Can you give me a date as to when the $200 billion for the facility will be fully drawn? These are three distinct questions. The third question is: what effect have you been told the Australian government borrowing money—and, because it has not been denied, it must be sustained that we are going to be $270 billion to $300 billion in debt in the near future—will have on the cost of funds for other Australian individuals and corporations that are in the market? Will everyone else have to pay a one per cent premium, a two per cent premium or a three per cent premium, or don’t you have any advice on that matter?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—On the issue of the date by which the up to $200 billion is to be drawn down, I cannot indicate to you by what precise date that will occur, if it does occur—and note that I say ‘up to $200 billion’. I do not believe anyone, either in Treasury or anywhere else in the private sector as of today, could give you a date. I do not have any advice from Treasury on the impact of government borrowing and the consequent impact on the costs of private borrowing. I suggest it would be an interesting discussion to have at Senate estimates with the Treasury economists as to what the impact, if any, may be. I am not an economist, but it is not simply that the government carries out borrowings and then there is automatically a similar impact on the cost of private borrowing—I suspect that there are a range of different economic factors to take into consideration. I would be interested in listening to that discussion at estimates with Treasury officials, but I am not in a position to have that discussion here and now. I have often heard the saying that there are as many different economic views in the world as there are economists. I suspect there are different answers to the question you pose. I do not have any information from the officials but, as I say, I suspect there would be differing views as to the level of impact of interest rates in the private sector as a consequence of the bond. I cannot provide you with an update or any sort of defined, detailed view, if in fact there is one, in this committee stage.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—Has the minister sought advice as to what the effect on domestic interest rates will be from the government being in the marketplace for up to $300 billion—as we are going to have an infrastructure package coming before us in the very near future, which I suggest will have to sit on top of our current borrowings? Did they get advice as to what the effect will be on domestic interest rates—yes or no? The second question is: what is your prescribed repayment time frame for this facility? Do you intend to repay it over eight years, 10 years or five years? In our experience, it took us about nine years to repay the $96 billion. If that is going to go by the same schedule, are we looking at 20 or 30 years to repay the $300 billion?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—The latter part we have already discussed, Senator Joyce. You want a time frame and projections beyond 2011-12, and we have discussed that matter. I can provide some additional information—
—You’re on the filibuster register, are you, Dougie?
—Interestingly, I do not think any of my colleagues have participated since—

(Senator Troeth)—Minister, we will keep to the matter under discussion.
—Yes, you are on the ball, Chair, about cross-conversations; thank you very much. I have been responding to questions posed by Senator Joyce, Senator Macdonald, Senator Abetz—
—You haven’t talked to me yet.
—Well, give us a few. We have a couple and I hope they are—
—We’ll give you some more.
—Yes, I hope they are coming, as I have indicated. I think I have made my best efforts to answer every question posed; it just takes a little time to get the answers. I am providing a rolling series of answers to questions that were put an hour or two ago in some cases.
I can provide some additional information about this crowding-out issue, Senator Joyce. It is Treasury’s view that there is little risk of Australian government borrowing crowding out private sector investment, because it will remain relatively small when compared with the GDP and the overall size of Australian credit and financial markets. I am just thinking about this issue, Senator Joyce. The argument is that the level of government debt or borrowing will crowd out private sector investment and therefore interest rates will be higher. That argument is not accepted by Treasury. I referred earlier to the levels of government debt in a range of overseas countries. Many of those countries have lower interest rates than Australia at the present time although they have a higher government debt—and they had that higher government debt even before the financial crisis. They had higher debt as a proportion of GDP than Australia and they had lower interest rates, so there are other economic factors. There is little risk of Australian government borrowing crowding out private sector investment, because it will remain relatively small when compared with the GDP and the overall size of Australian credit and financial markets.
The Australian government has a AAA credit rating, and our Treasury bonds are high quality and attractive to investors. That is another factor, Senator Joyce. If a country does not have a AAA credit rating, for a whole range of reasons—not just their budget deficit but other factors—it would stand to reason that that would impact on the borrowing rate. Despite the rise in borrowing, our net debt position will remain strong relative to many other countries that are currently enjoying a AAA credit rating. The borrowing is only a short-term measure which is necessary to finance a temporary deficit and, as I have indicated, once the budget has returned to surplus, additional borrowing will no longer be required and debt can be repaid. I have already alluded in some detail in previous answers to the issues you raised about the repayment of debt, and the parameters I pointed to are the parameters by which that will occur.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,—You mentioned a key word there; this is borrowing in the ‘short term’. Can you please define for us what you mean by short term?,SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I will come back to that question shortly. Shortly!—sorry I was not intending to make a pun. I am now in a position to respond to some questions that Senator Coonan posed a short while ago. I can provide some detail to the committee. The insulation measure will reduce emissions beyond the 2020 CPRS target. The measure will work in conjunction with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The overall target of emission reduction is set by the CPRS. The Energy Efficient Homes package will reduce household energy usage and therefore lower the cost of abatement. The measure will also lower energy use by householders, leading to lower energy bills and an increase in the comfort of the households.
There was some discussion and questions about insulation in wooden homes—from Senator Williams, I think. Evidence from industry and academia, about experience of insulation in a range of household types, upholds the benefit of installing insulation in ceilings. It will result in improvements in thermal efficiency of houses, and heating and cooling energy savings, and is the most cost-effective, energy-efficient measure.
I have some further information for Senator Macdonald in relation to the dollars available for road access to towns like Karumba. He raised the Karumba community specifically. As a supplement to the previous reference I made to moneys in the package, there is an additional $90 million for black spots, which was based on demonstrated safety and need. There is a requirement to demonstrate a case but Karumba may qualify for that. I am just not in a position to indicate specifically but I have said that I will pass the request and the issue on to the infrastructure minister, Mr Albanese.
Senator Joyce raised, a little while ago—I did respond to a number of the questions—the issue of state responsibilities and he highlighted the issue of boom gates and schools. The states have very significant investment programs, including rail safety infrastructure and schools. The issue with respect to the Nation Building and Jobs Plan is that the states’ investment programs should be accelerated to provide a timely economic stimulus aimed at improving nation building and supporting economic growth and jobs. The Commonwealth will use its financial capacity to provide the states with the funding needed to bring this investment forward—I deliberately emphasise ‘bring it forward’. These have been identified as areas where the description is, I think, ‘shovel ready’—where the detail of the projects is known and they can quickly be brought to bear and brought forward. As I indicated earlier, the Prime Minister is going to be very tough on replacement should any of the states attempt to do that. The accelerated installation of boom gates and other active control mechanisms at high-risk crossings, and the new and upgraded facilities in primary and secondary schools, we believe are very responsible investments in the community. The projects are very easy to identify and very quick to implement; they have been quite deliberately selected to be part of the package on that basis.
To respond to the issue of what is the ‘short term’, I think the difficulty, Senator Joyce, is that no-one can predict the length of this financial and economic crisis. The government has been very upfront about that. As I indicated earlier in response to Senator Fielding—who would have believed some of the impacts of the US subprime crisis, say, a year ago? I would not have believed it. So it is very difficult to predict the length of the crisis. The government has articulated how it will return the budget to surplus. We have touched on that on a couple of occasions in this question and answer session. We do not believe you can put an exact time frame on what is the ‘short term’. But what is important is that this government has decisively and quickly articulated a strategy that we believe is appropriate, given the very serious world financial and economic events that have been so quickly unfolding.

(Senator Troeth)—Senator Joyce, I would remind you that Senator Siewert has been waiting for some time.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—I acknowledge that. This is my final question. The answers at best have been nebulous and amorphous, and we are not really drilling down. It is a very specific thing that has a very specific outcome, which is the debt. The interest that the Australian people will have to pay will be absolutely evident. The effects on the budget will be absolutely apparent. The efficacy is the only thing we cannot seem to prove. And now we cannot even get a definition of what ‘short term’ is. We have discovered already that we are not looking at $200 billion; we are looking at up to $300 billion—

Senator Boswell interjecting—

—The $70 billion infrastructure fund that is coming. We have discovered also that we are not intending to repay it; we are just going to borrow more money to pay for the interest. We also know that we are a third of the way to where even Dr Henry says we should not be, which is a trillion dollars in debt. This is pretty startling stuff. We could have got through this had we had a longer inquiry. While sometimes we disagree, I concur with Senator Fielding that these are the sorts of details the Australian people want to know. It is absolutely crucial and fundamental in the way people vote around here. I and my colleagues will at times give people the benefit of the doubt and support you on issues if we think that you are being fair dinkum with us, but I do not think you are this time. I suspected it had hairs all over it at the start. The more we get into it, the hairier it gets—hairy and very dangerous, actually.
I am going to come back later on—I will give someone else a chance; I apologise, Senator Siewert—to really go through the efficacy of the spend. But there is one thing the Australian people can gather from this afternoon: that we are on a very treacherous path to a substantial amount of debt and there is absolutely no comprehension whatsoever of how we are ever going to repay it.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I will respond briefly. I do not accept your claim about ‘nebulous and amorphous’ responses. I am going to give you another response with respect to a specific issue in stamp duty. But, where the questions have sought quite specific answers, I believe I have given specific detail where appropriate—in fact, Senator Joyce, you objected when I went through some very specific detail with respect to government debt levels as a proportion of GDP and the stimulus packages. It was very detailed. That was in response to not just your question here but the question at estimates.
On the issue of states purchasing homes, and their own stamp duty laws, they would apply to the purchase. That is only likely under some ownership arrangements. The net financial impact on the state is zero. For example, if they paid $10K in stamp duty, less they receive $10K, the stamp duty revenue is zero to net cost. Where the states’ housing authorities have an exemption from stamp duty laws, there is also no financial cost. We understand this is the case with state housing authorities. In neither of these cases would the Commonwealth in effect be funding the stamp duties.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-02-11,"—I seek clarification of an answer to a question from Senator Milne, and I also have some questions about those on Newstart.

My question is: does it relate to new homes that will start after this package was announced or will it include homes that were started prior to the announcement of this package?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,—It is to fund new homes.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-02-11,"—That, obviously, would be our concern—that it was, in fact, paying for homes that had already been commenced or already built but which were still classed as new homes. That surely would undermine the object of this exercise, which is to stimulate jobs et cetera. I have some questions now around Newstart. They follow up some questions that I asked during the committee inquiry. Some of the answers did not provide all of the information that we need to analyse this package. I also want to ask further questions following on from some of those answers.
From the information that we have received to date, it is very unclear just how many unemployed people—people on Newstart—will actually receive any form of support under this package. I am seeking more detailed data to ascertain, if we can, exactly how many people currently on Newstart will be receiving some form of payment. Treasury responded to questions I asked about the number of people who would be receiving the education entry supplement. Out of that, they said there would be an additional 184,178 people. Of those on the Newstart allowance, there would be 50,925. There are, at this current time, over 450,000 people on Newstart. There is obviously a significant difference between 50,000 and 450,000. The government maintains that people on Newstart will receive other payments under the package. What I am trying to find out is: how many people on Newstart will receive the tax bonus, how many people will receive the back-to-school bonus and how many people will receive the single-income bonus? This will give us a better idea of the number of people on Newstart who will not receive any bonuses.
I presume that it may take a couple of minutes to find that information, so perhaps I should also ask the other questions that I have. As I understand it—and I am asking the question as I am not exactly positive—under the tax bonus system, you lodge your tax return and you actually have to have paid some tax to receive the tax bonus. Is that a correct understanding of the current situation?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-02-11,"—That does, in fact, clarify the fact that if you earned below the tax threshold, despite the fact that you have put a tax return in, you still will not receive the tax bonus.

The other issue that I would also like to clarify is that, during the committee inquiry, we established that people who become eligible and apply for the education entry payment will still have to go through the normal process that exists under current regulations and rules. That is, if you are on Newstart, you will either come off Newstart and go onto some other income-support process or it will be part of the activity agreement, which, presumably, will in the future then transfer to your employment pathway plan. That will take some time. What start date does the government envisage for this to roll out to people currently on Newstart who are receiving other income support and who are eligible for this supplementary payment? Quite clearly it is going to start and funds will become available much later than the other payments because of that more complicated process.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-02-11,"—I would like to take us back to some of the matters that were raised earlier in the housing portfolio. I am interested in getting some further information, if the minister can provide it, on exactly how the funds for the housing package will be distributed—in particular, the obligations of the coordinators and the people who will be looking after these large transfers of funds to the states. What will be the reporting obligations not only for energy and water efficiency, which we know are in the schedule, but also for the location issues—proximity to public transport, to services, to access to employment and so on? We know that the government has an eye on these issues, but it is very unclear how it will be reporting and benchmarking them, whether these reports will even be made public and on what sort of basis they will be provided to the minister or the parliament.
I would also be interested to know whether the Commonwealth has an intended balance of funding between regional and metropolitan housing for the public housing spend and whether there is any intention, at a Commonwealth departmental level, to target the housing to areas of greatest need or whether this responsibility is being devolved to the states. Does the Commonwealth government have a proportion or target in mind by which the community housing sector, as opposed to state housing commissions or public housing departments, will be managing these properties?
One of the issues that was raised late last year in the debates around the National Rental Affordability Scheme and that was raised again yesterday in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs was the issue of charitable tax status for community housing organisations that are seeking to be part of the management structure of these housing projects. It was put to the committee and was not really satisfactorily dealt with by the answers that we received, albeit at short notice, from the department that a solution was in train and that something would fall out of the Henry review. It was put to the committee by the housing organisations who spoke to us in the committee that that would be too late—that the tax issue, as it remains unresolved to date, is already putting a chill over the community housing organisations that are seeking to be a very important part of the management of these housing projects. My understanding is that the Commonwealth sees them as an important part of the management of these housing projects. We are interested in what measures the government has in place. We will be very disappointed if the answer that comes back is that you are waiting for something to arise out of the Henry review, because we certainly heard evidence that that would be too late. If the minister could provide us with any information on these matters, that would be greatly appreciated. We would be very interested to know how you intend to benchmark the reporting obligations of the states and the various housing providers and whether they are meeting benchmarks on energy, water efficiency and the location issues.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—The target figure that you were seeking for the community sector is around 75 per cent. Could you repeat the first question? The official was in transit into the chamber. I also cannot clarify the charitable tax status issue at the present time. I am not going to attempt to refer you to the Henry tax review, but I cannot clarify it now. I will see if I can get some information when we finish the debate.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-02-11,"—I thank the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law for providing the answer to the second question. The first question goes to the reporting obligations of the people coordinating these large transfers of funds from the Commonwealth to the states. We know that in the schedule to the IGA the government has acknowledged that energy and water efficiency play a huge part in the long-term affordability of housing and so too do access to public transport, services, sources of employment and so on and that these developments will be targeted for the public housing spend. What I am interested to know is how this will be reported. Will it be reported to the minister or, indeed, to the parliament and on what basis? How are you benchmarking such issues as access to public transport? How are you benchmarking energy and water efficiency? How will the parliament be informed of progress and whether you are meeting the targets that you have set?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—The coordination and the reporting is being handled through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which, in turn, will be reporting to the Council of Australian Governments, commonly known as COAG. I am going to clarify whether that will in fact be made public, but I suspect it would be a decision of COAG to make public the reports on the requirements through the coordinator-general in the Prime Minister’s department.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-02-11,"—Does the Commonwealth have in mind a system that is similar to what was adopted for the enforcement of national competition policy benchmarks?

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—You have raised the issue of competition reform and the payments that were made. It is a similar approach but it is not identical. As I have said, we intend to have very clear benchmarks, reporting back and penalties. Competition payments were, I think, withheld or delayed in the case of some states. It was a similar approach, but I think there were legislative requirements underpinning competition policy—I am trying to reflect on the formal process that occurred there.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-02-11,"—This really goes to the question of accountability—in particular, public accountability—because, whatever you might think of the way competition policy evolved in Australia, governments did know where they stood and the public was informed fairly promptly as to whether the benchmarks that had been set were met. I would like to add to some of the factors and matters that I raised before. This housing, particularly for the cohort of people we would be building for, would require adaptable design components and ageing in place and disability access. I would like to know whether these matters have also been formally benchmarked. I would appreciate it if I could add those items to the questions that I raised earlier about accountability, reporting, benchmarking and so on.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

I referred earlier to the universal design principles that facilitate better access for persons with disabilities and older persons. I have referred to that. It does not mean, I have to say, that this applies to 100 per cent of dwellings built. It would be a very high proportion and it obviously depends on the tenant and their circumstances. It may well be that a tenant does not require disability access, but you obviously need to have sufficient housing stock to ensure that you are able to meet the demand from that group of people in society and the special needs of those who are disabled or elderly.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-02-11,"—Finally, Minister, the Insurance Council of Australia has been talking in recent days about resilience in housing, particularly with regard to natural disasters, to which Australia is becoming increasingly prone. They are looking at fire, flood, climate change impacts and so on. While some of these measures for resilient housing would increase the upfront cost of some of the housing that we are building, it will certainly reduce insurance premiums charged and paid, which again is another cost to the Commonwealth or to the community housing sector. I am wondering if you can inform us as to what degree you are considering resilient housing measures and adaptability to these sorts of events and what kinds of benchmarks you would be setting for the developers and the builders.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—It is quite a complex issue you raise about whether or not there would be a reduction in premiums. For the new stock we are talking about, the premiums would be paid by the housing authorities, where they insure. They may self-insure in some jurisdictions, so that government would be carrying the cost of the insurance itself—in other words, it has not gone and taken out insurance. So obviously there is no change for the governments who do that through their housing authorities. The change would be for the state governments that are self-insuring. Presumably there would be a reduction in claims, not through private insurance but through depreciation and damage, repair et cetera to the building, whatever the circumstances are.
I know a number of actuaries through my interest in issues around superannuation. I think this would be a worthwhile issue, because there would be quite a complex set of issues to consider. Yes, you would expect the cost of insurance to come down over time—as to the extent or the time frame, I could not hazard a guess—but there may be other factors that counterbalance the issue of better designed and constructed homes. For example, and I am just speculating here, it may be that, because you have a shift in the demographics of the population, you do not have a reduction in premiums, for other reasons. I do not know. There would be quite a complex set of factors involved in making an actuarial projection about insurance premiums over time. It would also be reflective of historical claims and whether there is confidence that they would start to decline for the reasons that you touched on. It would be a complex set of issues that actuaries would be able to advise us on, so I could not give an indication today whether or not the premiums would come down.
I am just trying to think of the best way. Perhaps I could organise a briefing through the Government Actuary, who falls within my direct responsibility. The Government Actuary may be able to do that. If you want that sort of briefing before tomorrow, it may be possible to organise it. I am hesitating a bit because I did not anticipate in this debate a call on the Government Actuary, but I can certainly arrange for the Government Actuary to sit down with you and whoever else is interested in this issue to go through the issues and factors and give you a briefing on the matters. I am very happy to organise that for you.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-02-11,"—Minister, I will leave this line of questioning there, but I would appreciate, if not a briefing, certainly some indication in the morning of whether the government has considered the issue of resilient housing for people on low incomes and for a very large spend of public housing funds, both in the short term as it relates to the risk for the people living in these houses and also in the long term in terms of the expenses and the costs of insurance and so on.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

—The cost of the package is $42 billion, and you well know that. The bill in the package refers to the loan facility of up to—
—The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2009.
—Yes, I am well aware of it and its provisions. I have been briefed and I have responsibility for it, but the package is not costing $200 billion, as well you know. It is $42 billion. As to movement at the station, as you referred to it, I cannot provide any update about an amendment or amendments at this point in time. You have pointed out, and I am certainly very well aware of, how long the debate has been going. It is now approximately 6 pm. I think we are moving to other business at 6.50 and, of course, we have a full day and night tomorrow—and I am raring to go.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-11,"—It is great to hear that the minister is raring to go. We were told that this package had to be passed by last Friday. I have canvassed the arguments. The hectoring and bullying of the Senate by the leader of the government has now been blown out of the water by the evidence of the bureaucrats before the committee. But, if there are to be amendments to such a substantial package, then clearly the opposition and other senators are entitled to know what they are. To simply have an open-ended situation where we might only get to see the fine print by tomorrow morning, if that early, clearly is inappropriate.
For the benefit of the minister, within the package of bills we are considering is a bill entitled the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2009, which at section 5A(3) tells us that there is to be an increase of $125 billion to the total face value of stock and securities, and that is on the existing $75 billion. I confess I was never good at maths, but I thought $75 billion and $125 billion might add up to $200 billion. That is a part of the package that we are being asked to vote on. Sure, the majority of discussion has been on the $42 billion part, but this is a specific piece of legislation which I understood you wanted passed.
I was not going to ask this, but I may just follow up on Senator Ludlam’s questions. Whilst I understand that there is a coordinator-general to be placed in the Prime Minister’s office, if I am not mistaken the reporting by the states will in fact be by a coordinator-general who is a state public servant paid for by the state government who will then be reporting to the coordinator-general in the Prime Minister’s office. If we want robustness and transparency, I doubt that the state coordinator is necessarily going to dob in his or her state and say, ‘We have been missing all the benchmarks and guidelines.’ So, whilst there is somebody, as I understand it, in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, that person will be reported to by state officials paid for by the state government. I must say that does not give me much confidence that there will be that robustness of reporting. If we look at how the states report on hospitals, education, policing, roads and all their other responsibilities, it does not give one much confidence.
Can I just briefly say that it has been interesting listening to the debate this evening, with people talking about insulation, houses et cetera. The giveaways are all very nice. But, of course, the real thing here is the $200 billion debt—$9,500 per man, woman and child in this country—that will have to be repaid some time in the future.
I made those comments whilst the minister was liaising with his advisers. I have no criticism of that, but I do want his attention for the specific questions that I have. I would like to know whether cabinet approved this package and, if so, when they approved the package. When was the UEFO signed off to go to the printer? By whom was it signed off?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I am just endeavouring to find a document which has at least some of that information. I know we have some information, because I had a document earlier, but you were not here and I did not come back to it. We are trying to find out where it has gone. I will—hopefully—finish on the issue of the coordinator-general. The coordinator-general will oversee the work of the Commonwealth and the states and territories in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. At the Commonwealth level the agencies will nominate by the end of February 2009 a senior national coordinator for each major infrastructure and stimulus measure. The national coordinators will have responsibility for ensuring that the milestones are achieved and that any implementation issues are addressed as a matter of urgency.
The issue you have raised, Senator Abetz, is to do with coordinators being public servants at the state level. I think the advantage would be that they would know the areas which they are coordinating. They would be familiar with them. If anyone got up to any tricks, I would have thought that they would be better placed to identify that. However—
—Like auditors who are the company accountants.

(Senator Crossin)—Senator Abetz, I think you need to seek the call if you want to provide some input.
—I have sufficient confidence in the integrity of all public servants, whether Commonwealth or state, that once they are assigned to a task they will carry it out diligently and ethically. So if you have a state employed public servant carrying out a task set by agreement between the Commonwealth and the states through COAG, I believe that even though they are employed by a state government they will carry it out diligently and in accordance with the agreement. As I have indicated, them having knowledge of the areas that they are coordinating and evaluating would be a particular advantage. I think that, on balance, for those reasons, the appropriate checks and balances in the structure are contained.
The Strategic Priorities and Budget Committee of cabinet agreed to the bulk of the package on Thursday, 29 January, with some fine details settled between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer after that meeting. The Treasurer signed off on the document on Sunday, 1 February. It was sent to the printer at 6 am on Monday, 2 February.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

There may be some relevance to the level of detail we are getting to, but it has not become immediately apparent to me. It reminds me of when I asked the former Treasurer, Mr Costello, about the check-in and checkout times of the GST committee, when I was in opposition, in order to try and determine who was working on the GST package. It was a high-security zone down in Treasury and I wanted to know who was going in and out at what time. The records existed because of the security situation. There was an electronic check-in and checkout. I have to say that the former Treasurer, Mr Costello, was pretty blunt in his refusal to provide that level of information. I really think we are getting to that stage now. But I will put a request in to the Treasurer’s office about the approximate time, within a few minutes, that he signed off on it.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-11,"—I thank the minister for that response, but I remind him that that sort of bluster was exactly his approach when I was asking questions of Treasury, at estimates, about Fuelwatch. I was told that, in its production, people were working normal hours and that there was the normal course of business. When we started asking for the detail, we found that somebody had worked 37 hours straight, around the clock, to rush in the now ill-fated Fuelwatch. Can I say that it is from the experience of seeing this government in operation—and rushing things for a political agenda as opposed to any other agenda—that I ask the question. I remember Fuelwatch was so urgent because it was going to be the saviour of everything. It has now been dumped as bad policy. Similarly, this has been rushed in. We were told we had to deal with it by Friday last week. We now at least have an extra week without impacting on anything. So one has to ask again: why the rush?
Allow me to move to my next question. I may have missed the answer to this. If so, I do apologise. I understand that Senator Joyce asked a question as to the meaning of ‘short term’ in relation to the huge, unprecedented borrowings that this nation might undertake if Mr Rudd gets approval for his $200 billion bank card. I was just wondering whether we now have a definition of what ‘short term’ might mean. If that has already been given, if the answer could be provided to me that would be helpful. I think in the context of Australians being told that this is a temporary measure, only a short-term measure, they are entitled to know when ‘temporary’ or ‘short term’ is going to finish or what is the longest that the government anticipates the term ‘short term’ to mean. I think we are entitled to an answer to that. If an answer is still being obtained, that is fine.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—Again it was in your absence, Senator Abetz, and that is not a criticism. We had a discussion with Senator Joyce about ‘short term’. I do not know whether you were watching that.
—I did not think an actual answer was provided.
—It was certainly provided. No-one can predict the length of the crisis. Government has articulated how it will return the budget to surplus. You cannot put an exact time frame on ‘short term’ but, again, the government has articulated a clear and decisive strategy.
I want to come back to the earlier point you made about public servants working hard. What I do know is that, yes, many public servants at certain times work very, very hard indeed. I wish it was not the case but they do work very hard. I have witnessed firsthand the public servants I have had meetings with on very early mornings, at nights, fortunately not too often at the weekends, I have to say, but working very late nights and long hours. The other point I would make, on the question you went to in terms of times and who signed what et cetera, is that it also goes to show just how extraordinarily hard the Treasurer works. On a Sunday he was going through a very detailed and important package. And I know from my contact with him, which is sometimes at weekends, he is working every day and night of the week in an extraordinarily dedicated and committed way. So, yes, there are times when public servants work extraordinarily hard, and with respect to this package the Treasurer was working hard. I spoke to the Treasurer when we were having some discussion about some other matters, and we were both supposed to be on leave at the time. I am not complaining about it. That is just the way government is, and the times and the circumstances in the Christmas-New Year break. So, yes, public servants work very hard. At times they work extraordinarily long hours, particularly on budget type papers. But the Treasurer works extraordinarily hard and, for that matter, the Prime Minister as well, from our experience.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-11,"—Thank you for that homily on how hard everybody works. That is very nice.
—You work hard too, Eric.
—Thank you, Senator Sherry. Can I say that it will not throw me off the trace of the term ‘short term’, because basically what the minister is now telling the Australian people is that he cannot define what short term means. Nobody knows when this current period is going to end. Given that, to try to sell to the Australian people that this is a short-term measure, as opposed to a mid-term measure or a long-term measure, is in fact to mislead them. I would have thought that the Australian people in general terms would have thought that short term might be a couple of years or three years. Once we start ballooning out beyond three years, I would have thought that the government cannot say short term, but it has been saying temporary, short term et cetera. I note the government is unable to define it—and to a certain extent, given all the circumstances, I accept that. But what I do not accept is the political spin of the usage of the term ‘short term’. As we have always suspected with this package and the language associated with it, it is about spin rather than substance. I would have thought that if you were to level with the Australian people, to coin a phrase, you would say, ‘I am sorry, we can’t tell you whether this is going to be ‘short term’, medium term or long term because nobody knows when it is going to end.’
In an earlier answer Senator Sherry placed great emphasis on the advice of Treasury guiding government. As I understand it, this was the same Treasury that allegedly advised the government only 12 months ago that the economy was overheating, that the genie of inflation had escaped out of the bottle and that $20 billion had to be taken out of the economy to slow it down by way of extra tax revenues, as witnessed by the last budget, only to have the economy a few months later slowed down and cooling off. This was unpredicted, we were told—albeit the former Treasurer, Mr Costello, during the last election did predict the economic tsunami coming our way, which of course was scoffed at by Senator Sherry and his leader as a tactic designed to scare people about voting Liberal. So all I can say is that the reliance on this Treasury advice is not all that robust and the terminology is a matter of concern. But can I ask one question of the minister: will the money ultimately need to be repaid?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—The Treasury officials that you have somewhat criticised are the same Treasury officials that advised you, the Liberal-National Party, in government. These are the same Treasury officials that I have spent many years asking questions of. Going specifically to the change in economic circumstances, economic circumstances and forecasts have changed dramatically—and I stress dramatically—over the last year, given the financial and economic crisis. I can recall, going back over a number of estimates and a number of years, questioning Treasury about, for example, the mining boom and the demand from China and questioning the veracity of the forecasts. Treasury officials had a two-step down, in terms of the value of mining and demand and the revenue impact on the budget, and they kept moving that out because the mining boom went on longer than anyone reasonably expected and they could not identify when it was going to end. They could not identify it was going to come to an end under your government and under our government when we were first elected. But the mining boom has ended, because we have now got a significant change in economic circumstances.
Sure, I criticised Treasury from time to time when I was in opposition. I have criticised them, and I had some strong debates—I would not describe them as personal—and some good discussions when I was in opposition. I did most of the economics and finance estimates committees and had a lot of exchanges with Treasury over the years. They are not infallible, and I do not think they suggest they are infallible. But I do know that, by and large, they all try to get it right. Economics is not a precise science, but I do know that we have got very good officials—
—It is with ETS modelling.
—Senator Abetz, you made a general critique; I am responding in a general way. I accept that. I am not going to take an inordinate amount of time in my response. I would argue, and I came to this conclusion very early on in this place and very early on in opposition, that we have very good officers in Treasury and Finance. Yes, there will be disagreements from time to time but we have got very good officers who do the very best they can. They overwhelmingly get it right. There are some occasions when they do make mistakes and there are some occasions when they do not get it right but, overwhelmingly, they do. So I have every confidence in them. That is a confidence I have developed not just over the year in government in my dealings with them; that is the view I developed over many, many years. So I do want to defend Treasury officials. I confess to once having a sharp exchange, and I think I went one step too far with one official in my almost 12 years but, overwhelmingly, they do an extraordinarily good job.
I reflected earlier on the range of issues that have come on this government. I reflected on the range of issues that I certainly did not expect, when I became a minister, as a consequence of this world financial and economic crisis—issues that I would not have dreamt would become public policy issues of such contention, and I specifically mentioned short selling and there are many other issues, because of the very rapidly evolving and changing world financial and economic crisis. I would not have dreamed, a year ago, that you would have the banking system in the US and the UK collapsing. I would not have dreamed it possible that the US would be nationalising banks. I do not think anyone, certainly not my Labor colleagues, would have dreamed that you would see George Bush, US Republican President, nationalising banks. That is just how extraordinarily circumstances have changed in the last year.
I will conclude there. I think it gives you some indication of the very different nature of the outlook that we face today compared to three months ago, compared to a year ago or compared to 18 months ago. I do not believe I have seen economic circumstances, other than perhaps the oil shock of the early 70s, change so rapidly and, unfortunately, detrimentally before around the world in my lifetime.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-11,"—I am sure the minister overlooked the question as to whether the debt will need to be repaid. That was in fact the question I had asked. Could the minister answer that. And, whilst he is getting an answer together, possibly to be taken on notice so that we can get an answer when we are told with what colour pen the Treasurer signed a certain document—which I did not ask, by the way—can we be advised of when the Treasurer was given a proof copy of the UEFO or previous advice on the revision in revenues shown in the UEFO.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—I can give one time and day, and I will try and get the other answers. I will not be going to the Treasurer’s office personally and asking those questions. But I can inform you that the Treasurer signed off the documents at 1 pm on Sunday, 1 February 2009. That is the answer to the question you asked a little earlier.
When will the government pay down the debt? As we have said time and time again, as soon as the economy recovers and grows above trend the government will take action to return the budget to surplus. These surpluses will be drawn down upon to pay down debt as rapidly as economic conditions permit. I did have an earlier discussion with Senator Joyce, and we went through those matters in fairly considerable detail—not to his satisfaction nor, I suspect, to yours—so we did canvass that set of issues much earlier.
Senator Ludlam raised charities’ tax status. I do have a response. Community housing providers will be able to provide social housing in the package without the risk of losing their charitable status. It does fall within core activities of a public benevolent institution. The Treasury will continue its work with the ATO with the aim of providing certainty on this issue, but the advice I am given is that it is not an issue.
Senator Ludlam asked how the funds will be distributed. The states and territories will receive an allocation on a population basis, provided proposals from the states and territories meet key requirements. The Commonwealth will select the projects in jurisdictions that provide the best outcomes against the requirements. If a jurisdiction does not provide proposals that meet the criteria, or if they do not perform against delivery milestones, funds can be redistributed to jurisdictions that can deliver.
Will houses be located close to transport? Proposals from states and territories for new housing will need to identify their proximity to public transport, and this will be assessed in selecting the best proposals. On the funding split and regional or urban targets, there is not a target on this matter but we do want mixed urban-regional communities so we do not have high concentration. We do want to see a share of properties in areas of real need. To digress, personally I look at the circumstances of the north-west coast of Tasmania and I think—

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Thank you, Senator. I think there is a need on the north-west coast, for example.
—I don’t think he was suggesting that you were responsible for it, Nick!
—I will be paying it some attention. I have to put on the record, Senator Ronaldson, that my wife works for Housing Tasmania on the north-west coast of Tasmania so I do get more than passing information about local circumstances and what will happen. I might become one of the coordinators to make sure the money is being spent properly! I will get the inside information. But we do want to see a funding split between regional and urban areas. From a Tasmanian perspective, whilst the entire state of Tasmania is regional, I would be very keen to ensure the north-west and regions outside the south and Hobart receive an appropriate split of these moneys for targeting. The package is targeted to high-need clients. The states must identify in their proposals which dwellings are targeted at particular groups—such as people with disabilities and Indigenous people—and we had an earlier discussion about that.
Senator Siewert asked when the education entry payment supplement would be paid. Those eligible for the EdEP bonus will receive it when they receive their EdEP. If you have already received your EdEP, you will receive the supplement from 24 March 2009. Other people who commence study over the period up to 30 June 2010 will receive the $950 as they start their course, as well as the $208 education entry payment.
I think we are just about up to date on answers to questions so far. I have a couple of extra answers, and Senator Joyce may want to come back because they might be relevant. I will take just two minutes. When was the government first advised the budget was in deficit? The Treasury on 19 December provided advice to the Treasurer on updated economic forecasts and gave an informal indication of the implications for the budget. Following that there were informal discussions between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer about the government’s fiscal position and further work was requested of Treasury in advance of a briefing for the strategic policy and budget committee. The committee was briefed on the economic forecast and fiscal position on 19 January, at a meeting to discuss the further package of stimulus measures to be announced in February. Further Treasury work followed to ensure the fiscal position forecast was sufficiently robust to be released publicly. The digital proofs were returned to Treasury at 8.45 am on 2 February, Senator Abetz. I do not know whether that indicates the Treasurer was up all night through to 8.45 am. I suspect he was working a fair share of that time.
On the Newstart question from Senator Siewert. There is no available data to provide an estimate of the number of Newstart recipients who will receive the tax bonus. This is because they relate to individual circumstances at two different points in time. The tax bonus relating to net tax liability is for 2007-08 and receipt of Newstart allowance relates to a point now or in the future. For example, it is likely that many people who are on Newstart allowance now were employed during the course of 2007-08 and would therefore receive a tax bonus. For a person on Newstart allowance not to receive a tax bonus, they would need to have had no net tax liability in 2007-08.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-11,"—With the government’s prospective $125 billion shortfall in receipts that they have obviously used in the compilation of their requests for an extension of a $200 billion facility, do they believe at this point in time that the $125 billion shortfall is of a recurring nature and, if so, over what cycle would it be recurring? Also, what do they anticipate their peak debt position to be?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-11,"—Senator Joyce, I just checked the figure you gave of $125 billion. It is actually $115 billion. As the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook has reported and as the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Prime Minister announced last week, we have seen a revision down by a total of around $115 billion across the forward estimates since the 2008-09 budget, with more than $75 billion of this revision occurring since the MYEFO at the end of last year. So we have seen effectively two significant revisions down, with that revision accelerating through to the announcement of the new figures.
The sharp decline in revenue from the 2008-09 budget of $115 billion has been as a consequence of the changed forecast with respect to economic growth, and that obviously impacts revenue. I do not have the figures for comparable countries but I do understand that this is occurring worldwide. I do not have the details to hand, but comparable countries are having to deal with a significant decline in the forecast revenues over their forward estimates periods, so we are not alone in this.
I certainly know that one important factor in the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook has been the weight of the gathering global recession. That weight, regrettably, has been gathering momentum, and not just in countries like Japan, the US, the UK and other major trading partners; it has moved into a country like China, which is a major trading partner of Australia’s. Key emerging economies such as China and India are now expected to slow markedly. Obviously, the global commodities boom has provided significant stimulus to Australian growth and incomes over recent years. There was some discussion earlier between Senator Abetz and me about the step-down approach that Treasury has taken in terms of forecasts of revenue and the mining boom. That certainly was not expected when the 2008-09 budget was handed down. So we have seen a very extraordinarily rapid change in revenue estimates downwards.
As I said earlier, I cannot recall a period in my lifetime, other than the oil crisis back in the early to mid-seventies, when economic circumstances have changed so rapidly across the globe. That clearly has a very significant impact on the fiscal balance. If you look at the estimated fiscal balance, say, in 2008-09 and updated in the UEFO, it is minus $22.4 billion, moving to $33.3 billion in 2009-10 and then dropping back to $21.5 billion and $23.9 billion. This does not account for all of that negative fiscal balance but it certainly accounts for a very substantial proportion of it.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to make a few comments in relation to this document because the document specifically relates to the package that the Senate has just been debating, and in this particular department there are matters of great moment for us as a Senate and indeed for the Australian people to consider.
In relation to the employment aspect it should be remembered that this is the department that is able to advise us about employment and employment matters. When asked if there is a difference in terminology between ‘creating’ about 75,000 additional jobs as opposed to ‘supporting’ up to 90,000 jobs the officials tell us that there is a significant difference.
Why do I raise those two terms? The reason I raise these two terms is this: for the government’s first stimulus package of $10.4 billion, which we supported because it was coming out of the surplus, there was a promise in the second reading speech—and I know these words off by heart—that that stimulus package would ‘create’ about an additional 75,000 jobs. Now, with this additional estimate document, we are being told that a package four times the size—$42 billion—will ‘support’ up to 90,000 jobs.
The officials in Treasury told us that we should understand these two phrases as meaning the same thing. I still remember the official who told me that. So when we had the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations before us I asked them if there was a difference between ‘creating’ a job and ‘supporting’ a job, and there are no surprises here. Like every other Australian, we were told that the meaning was completely different. Creating an additional job means there is something new. ‘Support’ means supporting something that already exists.
So what we have here, according to the experts in the employment department, is an indication that this is a government concerned with spin over substance. When we asked the officials, ‘Are there any jobs that can be pointed to as having been created as additional jobs as a result of the first stimulus package?’—and we were promised about 75,000—they could not point to one.
So for the next stimulus package we get rid of the word ‘create’, we get rid of the word ‘about’, we get rid of the word ‘additional’ and the weasel words that are employed now are ‘to support up to 90,000 jobs’. And of course if you say ‘about 75,000’, as they did with first package, it suggests that there might be a few less or a few more. But ‘up to 90,000’ suggests an absolute cut-off of 90,000, but it could include the number one, and that was not refuted.
So we have here a package being sold to the Australian people that will lumber them with a $200 billion debt overall—$9,500 per man, woman and child in this country. That $9,500 debt per man, woman and child in this country, plus interest, might possibly sustain—according to the advice—up to 90,000 jobs. Chances are it will support more than one, but if there is a range why weren’t we told what the lower range is—that it might be between 50,000 and 90,000? This is all about weasel words and it is all about spin. That is what concerns us.
We as a coalition are concerned as to how the government is going to bankrupt this nation and put it into great debt that will need to be paid by future generations. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,"<title>Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statement</title>",Documents,16,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2009-02-11,"—As you know, this month is National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. It is not a day and it is not a week; this issue is so important that we have actually now got a national ovarian cancer month. The message of this month is to continue to raise awareness in our community—amongst women in particular, but more particularly, I think, with practitioners, with people who work in the medical field and with the wider community—about the horrors of ovarian cancer.
This chamber knows all too well about the issues concerned with ovarian cancer. You would be aware that two years ago we were privileged to have a report from the Community Affairs Committee that looked at the issues of gynaecological cancer in our community. We called that report Silent voices, and now that has become a cry for all of us because we demand that the voices should no longer be silent. In fact, this is the theme of the national awareness month.
We as a community are saying that women need to take ownership of their own bodies. This came out particularly clearly at the launch in Melbourne on Sunday of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month where again, as always, we were privileged to hear from women who are working through their own journey with this condition with strength and courage and who were prepared to share that process with all of us so that we can learn from their knowledge and passion and the theme of stopping the silence can be carried across the wider community in Australia and internationally. Ovarian cancer is not an Australian issue but a global issue.
On Sunday, the awareness month was launched by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, who came along and talked with great care and knowledge about these issues. Some of that is down to the work that women throughout the community have done to make sure that governments of all flavours and at all levels are aware of all these issues and act together to respond to the demand. Minister Roxon launched a new diary, which has been brought out by Ovarian Cancer Australia, called The Ovarian Cancer Symptom Diary. We have talked before in this place about the vagueness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer. I will not go through all of the symptoms. It is most important that people do not listen to me or to individuals taking about these issues but instead seek out the information themselves through the range of material that is available on websites, from the National Breast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer Centre, from Ovarian Cancer Australia and from various other groups. There is information out there from individuals about how they found out what was wrong with them.
We cannot sit back and wait for anybody else, even if they are a practitioner, to take ownership of knowledge about our own bodies. This tool, the first ever symptom diary, gives women that support, that practical aid. When the conditions are listed, a woman can take personal note of whether she has these symptoms. Then, from knowing her own body and by knowing the changes that are taking place in her own body and by asking for advice and support from other people through the websites, through support groups and most particularly through Ovarian Cancer Australia, if she believes that she has ovarian cancer, she can go with absolute confidence to her general practitioner and say: ‘This is what’s happening to my body. I want to know more.’ That is a message that comes out from National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. Another message is for women to take ownership of their own bodies—to explore, to question and to find out what is happening with their own body.
We heard statements at the launch on Sunday in Melbourne from a survivor who only last year thought that she was a fit and healthy woman. She talked about the fact that she was fit and healthy. She took us with her through the journey that she made last year—from the horror of the diagnosis, to the denial of the diagnosis, to the absolute need she had for support from her family, who were there with her all the way, and also the wonderful support, knowledge and professional expertise of the practitioners that we have in this country, of whom we should be most proud. We know how strong the knowledge bank is in this country. It goes through the whole range of practitioners. GPs now have their own information sheet, which was put out only last year by the National Breast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer Centre. That sheet contains tips for general practitioners to make them more aware of this condition. It discusses what they can do with their women patients to raise awareness and how they can work through those vague symptoms to get to the next round of tests so as to be able to make the earliest possible diagnosis.
This cancer, like all cancers, has a greater rate of survival and effective treatment the earlier the initial diagnosis. That came through in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report on this issue. With ovarian cancer and other gynaecological cancers, women, their families and their doctors are tremendously worried that by the time they reach a diagnosis the condition will have moved through to a quite late stage and that at that time their chances of effective treatment and survival are much lower. This has been a major concern in our country in tracing ovarian cancer. It is estimated that around 1,500 Australian women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. More than 850 of those women will not survive a reasonable time after their diagnosis. The key issue is the time of the diagnosis.
That is why we need to have an awareness month and a special day, which this year will be 23 February. All of our offices will be inundated with teal ribbons. I do not know the reason for teal, but it is a colour that stands out. That will be the colour that we will be asking people across the community to wear to raise awareness. We need every woman to get this message so that they make an effort to ask questions about their own bodies, to use tools such as this symptom diary, to go to their GP and work with them and to draw their attention, if necessary, to the kinds of tools that are available now.
We need women to say, as Senator Jeannie Ferris, whom we knew and miss, was able to say, ‘Take the action, because I am important enough to deserve it.’ That is the key message. We need women to say: ‘My body is my responsibility and it’s up to me to seek out the treatment and to ensure that no-one dismisses my symptoms and tells me I should just lie down and rest.’ They need to have the evidence in their hands through things such as the symptom diary and through the information that is available on the websites. We need women to say: ‘I want to have the tests that are available. I want to access the ultrasound services that are available across this country.’ As I have said before in this place, when the diagnosis is made, they need to say, ‘I want to be part of a clinical trial.’ Consistently, the evidence and all the information that we have is that the real value of knowledge comes through clinical trials. I again ask that we ensure that clinical trials across our country are well resourced and funded and that their importance is acknowledged so that women have the best possible chance of an early diagnosis and good treatment. We have that ability through our science and our research.
I really need to put on record again my immense admiration and respect for the practitioners we have in this country. But we need women to demand their own rights. The clinical trial that is being done through the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in association with the Queensland Institute of Medical Research is currently funded—I really enjoy this particular process—by the American Department of Defense. I am not sure why, but I deeply thank them for their funding. On behalf of women across the world, I congratulate them for helping this wide clinical trial develop knowledge that can be used by our researchers to discover an effective cure for this horrible condition.
We will be celebrating National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month here on 23 February. I ask the community to be part of that. I say to them: during this month, get to know more about your own body so that you can be healthy and knowledgeable and can take ownership.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month</title>,Adjournment,17,1,speech
