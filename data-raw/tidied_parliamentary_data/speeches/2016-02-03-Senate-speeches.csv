Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (09:32):  It is a sign of our times that security looms large on the agendas of governments around the world. Increasingly, terrorist activity requires increased vigilance. It demands that we take no chances. That is why, right around the world, governments have focused over the past 15 years on tightening security provisions at parliaments, government offices and places where people congregate and at our ports and airports.



It is a real balancing act. On the one hand, we need to make sure that we protect ourselves from those who would seek to harm us. On the other hand, we need to make sure our security arrangements do not curtail our normal activities or place unnecessary burdens on the commercial activities that drive economic growth.It is that balancing act that sits at the heart of the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015, thepiece of legislation before us today.It seeks to exclude Australian flagged vessels involved in interstate trade from the regulatory regime with regard to security.




Under current circumstances, all Australian vessels of 500 gross tonnes or more, or those carrying 13 or more passengers on international and interstate vessels, must have a ship security plan.That plan must include a security assessment of the vessel's operations that provides information on the security measures that the ship will put in place to prevent unlawful interference.It must also include details of actions that would be taken in the event of a security incident.These provisions do not apply to vessels that move goods within an Australian state—say, on a voyage from Brisbane to Townsville.




The government argues that there is no increased security risk simply because a vessel crosses state borders. It also advises that removing the security obligations from vessels engaged in interstate trade will save the shipping industry up to $1 million a year.




The opposition will support this bill.We agree that, while it is critical that we take all steps we can to keep our nation safe, this provision can be dispensed with without any substantial effect on security.We also agree with the government's intention to continue to require that vessels that carry passengers or vehicles interstate should continue to be subject to the existing security regime. That makes sense.



I note that the minister has said in the other place that the government proposed to amend the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Securities Regulations to this end. This legislation relates, in particular, to Australian flagged vessels, not those from overseas. As much as I am happy to support the changes to exclude Australian flagged vessels from the securities regulations, I note the government still appears intent on removing Australian flagged vessels from our own coastline. While legislation to this effect was defeated in the Senate late last year with the support of the majority of crossbench senators, there has been to date no sign of any changes in that plan by the government. In fact, the minister has granted new temporary licences to foreign registered ships in the full knowledge that Australian seafarers will be sacked and replaced with a ship with foreign crew, paid well below Australian standards. Not only is this unconscionable for any Australian government; it is also contrary to the spirit of the legislation that is the minister's responsibility to properly administer.


I specifically refer to the MV Portland in this respect. The government's legislation would have destroyed Australia's domestic shipping industry. No other G20 nation has this type of arrangement for coastal trade. No other G20 nation! This is why the opposition has characterised that failed legislation as 'unilateral economic disarmament'. For example, the United States, the bastion of the free market, requires that all coastal trade be undertaken by US flagged vessels crewed by Americans. Further, the ships used must have been built in the United States. Yet here in Australia our government, this Turnbull government, wanted to purposely destroy its maritime industry by deliberately putting it at a competitive disadvantage. The intent of the bill was clearly laid out in its supporting documents which explicitly stated that the expectation was that it would cause Australian flagged vessels to reflag overseas. The government's official modelling, for example, said: 


Many of the operators currently operating under the Australian General Register would likely re-flag their vessels in order to compete with the foreign operators who enjoy the benefit of comparatively lower wage rates. Australian seafarer jobs would be adversely affected as Australian operators re-flag from the Australian General Register. 


Ship operators are likely to replace Australian seafarers (paid under EA rates) with foreign seafarers (paid under ITF rates).


The regulatory impact statement explained that:


… Australian reliance on foreign shipping services is likely to grow in the coming years as ships continue to leave the Australian fleet due to retirement or reflagging overseas to pursue more favourable taxation and employment environments.


…    …    …


Should a less regulated coastal shipping regulatory system be implemented, it is likely that some operators of Australian ships will seek to move to the lower cost model and flag their ships overseas.  This would allow operators to pay all workers on the now foreign flagged ships internationally competitive wages and conditions.  


In a section of the regulatory impact statement discussing non-bulk trade across Bass Strait, the advice could not have been clearer:



 … 
we assume 4 vessels will register under a foreign register to reduce operating costs.





The statement also obliterated the government's claim that this shipping reform is about abolishing red tape. It said that while the changes will produce economic benefits for businesses, 88 per cent of these claimed benefits come from savings in labour costs. This was not about eliminating red tape. It was about eliminating people's jobs—Australian people, people rely on those jobs to put food on the table. Strangely, during last year's parliamentary debate, the minister for transport tried to deny that his ideologically driven legislation would destroy Australian jobs. He must not have read his own legislation, the survey or the regulatory impact statement that I just referred to. And it is not what his advisers said. In the course of the Senate committee hearing into the legislation, it emerged that the senior officials of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development gave West Australian businessman, Bill Milby, clear advice about what he should do if he wanted his cruise ship business to remain competitive under the planned changes. Mr Milby was told that he should sack his Australian crew, register his vessel overseas, and hire cheap foreign labour. Despite the minister's attempts to claim this did not happen, the bureaucrats themselves confirmed it had happened, in sworn testimony to the Senate committee. But it is not their fault. They were simply telling the truth about the intent of this now-failed legislation. Why do I raise this failed legislation at this stage? To highlight that it is the aim of those opposite to reduce shipping costs—but to do so, they want thousands of Australians in the shipping industry to lose their jobs. They are quite happy to have that effect.


Labor is also in favour of reducing costs for businesses, but we will always balance that aim against the broader national interest. And I say it is absolutely in our national interest to have a domestic shipping industry. It is in our economic interest, because it provide jobs for Australians and helps meet our security interests. These jobs allow people to raise their families and drive economic activity in their communities as consumers. It is also in our environmental interest, because we know Australian crews are familiar with our coastlines, and that all major shipping accidents off our coast in recent years have involved foreign flagged vessels. And it is in our national security interest to have a strong Australian presence on our coasts to keep an eye out for suspicious activities that might not be recognised by overseas crews.


Labor worked hard with the Senate crossbench to defeat last year's proposed legislation—this failed bill; the most outrageous attack on the livelihoods of average Australians since Work Choices. Alongside other senators, particularly Senators Rice, Madigan, Lambie, Muir, Lazarus and Wang, Labor has worked with the industry to develop sensible adjustments to policy that could give the industry certainty and efficiency. In this context, I would like to acknowledge the work of Teresa Lloyd of Maritime Industry Australia Ltd, and the Maritime Union of Australia, led by its national secretary, Paddy Crumlin.


There have been two workshops in Melbourne attended by a broad cross-section of the industry, including shippers and unions. The most recent was last month, on 21 January. The government has sent no members of parliament, favouring a modest attendance by a departmental official. And in the meantime, the government has granted temporary licences to ships that replace Australian crews, with apparent indifference to the economic, environmental and national security implications of this approach. We would urge the government to improve its engagement with the sector to further our national interests. Efficiency must be part of that discussion. However, the ideological approach of removing domestic shipping must stop.


It is against that background that we contemplate the legislation before us today, which seeks to reduce red tape across Australian flagged vessels. Labor will support this legislation because it makes sense. But if those opposite continue to have their heads in the sand, the whole exercise will be completely academic; there will not be any Australian flagged major trading vessels. With that warning, Labor commends this bill to the Senate.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-02-03,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:43):  I rise today to speak to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015. The Australian Greens are opposed to this bill, because we believe the government is yet to make the case for loosening the regulations on registered Australian vessels engaged in interstate trade. It is significant that there is still confusion and a lack of clarity as to why this measure is required in the context that has just been outlined by Senator Collins. It is a context when the job security of people in our Australian shipping industry is under attack like at few times in our history.


I think back to the Patrick's waterfront dispute of the late nineties, which was just down the road from my home in Footscray, when we had security guards in balaclavas locking out workers in an attempt to increase profits. The Melbourne community, the Australian community, rallied around the seafarers and the people working on the ports then and we managed to get change, and managed to maintain, largely, the conditions and the ability for people working in our maritime industries to be able to be paid a fair day's wage and have fair conditions for their work.


What happened on the docks then was supported by the Liberal government of the time; in fact, they were intimately involved with it. Fast forward to 2016 and you have the disgraceful removal of Australian workers who were on board MV Portland over the summer. In the middle of the night, Alcoa's hired goons boarded the ship, kicked off the Australian crew and replaced them with a foreign crew, who immediately set sail for Singapore. This foreign crew, we have heard, were being paid $6 an hour. We know that foreign crews on flags-of-convenience vessels sailing around Australia have been paid as little as $2 an hour. 


The crew members of the MV Portland, who were kicked off their ship, are actually in Canberra at the moment. I had the privilege of meeting with some of them yesterday and I understand they are out the front of Parliament House today, and they are telling their stories to politicians. Yesterday, I met with three of the MV Portland crew. I met Liam, who had been on the MV Portlandfor 11 years; Zac, a young seafarer, who was hoping to build his career in seafaring over the coming years and who now faces very bleak prospects of being able to find employment in the industry; and Brett, who lives in Portland. When I asked Brett how he saw his chances of regaining a job in the shipping industry, he thought that he did not have many chances at all. 


These are skilled Australian workers. These are people who have spent many years building their skills who are proud of being hardworking Australian seafarers. For someone like Brett, who has spent his life working to build up his skills and who now has very limited prospects of being able to find another job in the shipping industry, it is a very, very sad for him. These are real people. They have real families. They now do not know what their prospects will be and what job opportunities there are for them. There are not many jobs in Portland. 


The government actions in supporting the actions of Alcoa in removing these workers from their ship in the middle of the night are not helping the opportunities of these workers to be able to contribute to Australian society. They have real families. They have real mortgages and real commitments. Basically, the reason they were removed from their ship was that they were sacked for being Australians. They were sacked and all they were doing was doing their job and doing it well, and being part of the Australian transport industry. They were sacked because the government agreed with Alcoa that the ship they were on was no longer required and was going to be replaced by a ship that was operating under a flag of convenience, a foreign owned ship, on a temporary licence.


The issue with these temporary licences is that they clearly undermine the full intent of the coastal shipping legislation that we currently have to hand, where the minister is actually meant to be acting to protect Australian shipping. But every time the request for a temporary licence has been put to him, he has signed it off. In this case, and in the case of the other ship over summer that has now been replaced by a foreign ship sailing on a temporary licence, the minister could have said, no, that there was not a strong enough case to show how replacing these Australian flagged and Australian crewed ships with a foreign ship operating under a flag of convenience was in the interests of Australian shipping.


Basically, because the criteria for whether a temporary licence should be issued is that there is no Australian ship available to do the job that is cost competitive, any request for a temporary licence for a foreign ship is always going to outcompete the Australian owned ship—because with the Australian flagged ship we know that we have to pay our workers a fair rate of pay. We know that they have to have good working conditions, whereas when you are competing with foreign ships you have workers being exploited and paid two dollars an hour under atrocious conditions. Environmental standards are being exploited and are totally lax. We know, with very good evidence, of rubbish being thrown overboard and oil spills not being reported. When you are competing with all this there is no way that a well-managed, Australian-crewed, Australian-flagged ship is going to be able to be cost competitive—so the temporary licence gets issued. You cannot be competitive with that sort of appalling regime.


We know that since the MV Portland was replaced three ships so far have done the journey from Kwinana to Portland. Of those three ships, one is under investigation for corruption and one is facing charges of not having paid their seafarers. These are the sorts of ships that are replacing our Australian crewed and Australian flagged ships. These are the sorts of ships that mean we are looking to replace virtually all the ships in the Australian shipping industry. It is an absolute travesty. Here in Australia we are the fourth-largest users of ships in the world and yet we have this government's approach to shipping. They attempted—and failed—to get legislation through the Senate to deregulate the shipping industry, and now they are working with industry to undermine the intent of the existing legislation.


It really is a sign of things to come. The decline in Australia shipping could be arrested, but the legacy of this government seems to be that it is going to destroy Australian shipping. The decline could be arrested. The way to arrest it, the way to revitalise and rebuild Australian shipping, is to provide some certainty to the industry and to be working together, as the MUA and the maritime industries of Australia have been trying to do over the past months with the shipping summits that have been held in Melbourne—trying to bring all players together to work out what the future is for Australia's shipping and how we can rebuild it; rather than the government's agenda, which is basically to say goodbye to it.


There are really good reasons for maintaining the Australian shipping industry, and yet Australian seafarers and Australian shipping have been kicked in the guts and kicked off their ship. This industrial thuggery has been aided and abetted by the Liberal government, who are wanting to deregulate the Australian shipping industry into oblivion. When the local industry most needs our support, the Liberal government is trying to kick it when it is down.


It is a case that is characteristic of this government. It is not just the shipping industry. Whether it is with the Australian Building and Construction Commission or attempts to cut penalty rates, we are seeing attacks on Australian workers throughout the country. These cases show that it is not just limited to the land; we have it happening on land and at sea. So, when the government is talking about loosening regulations and cutting red tape, the Australian people have very strong grounds for scepticism when it comes to this Liberal government.


With regard to the legislation that is before us, I acknowledge that the minister has stated his intention to continue to regulate passenger and vehicle interstate transport, but we are not convinced. As it stands, the security measures in the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act only apply to registered Australian ships that are used for either interstate or overseas voyages, but there is no regulation for intrastate voyages. So currently a journey from Portland in Victoria to Kwinana in Western Australia is covered, but not a trip from Portland to Melbourne. The original bill to create Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act in 2003 failed to justify why this was the case.


The Australian Greens broadly agree that it is difficult to argue as to why a ship operating between Portland and Fremantle needs to have extra security regulations compared to a ship voyaging between Portland and Melbourne, as there are not radically different security regimes between the states. However, there are real concerns that this is yet another attempt by the government to lead a race to the bottom by gutting regulations and endangering people at work.


When this government was headed by the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, we became familiar with, but always dismayed by, the haphazard approach to policymaking of introducing new regulations or tearing up old ones without recourse to evidence or due process. There were high hopes that Tony Abbott's replacement as Prime Minister would relieve us of this approach, but every day, and on every issue, it becomes clear that it is the same old Liberals under Prime Minister Turnbull.


If we want to ensure that regulations are coherent across the country, ensure the safety of people at work and ensure our security, there is another way to do this: we could broaden the regulations to vessels on intrastate voyages and ensure that all vessels, regardless of country of registration, comply with the same standards. The government's logic has the capacity to be extended in both directions. But, for the bill before us today, the Australian Greens feel that the government has simply failed to make the case that this change balances the competing needs of maritime workers, shippers, Australia's international obligations and the broader Australian community, and that is why the Australian Greens will be opposing this bill.

"Lazarus, Sen Glenn",GLT,2016-02-03,"



Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (09:56):  I stand today very disappointed, having to speak about the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015. It should never have seen the light of day, but here we are. That goes to say that I will not be supporting this bill. My understanding of the bill is that it will water down the current Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003, which was put in place by the Howard government to improve Australia's maritime security. The current act requires seafarers working on all Australian-registered ships which trade between states or overseas to be assessed by ASIO and the Australian Federal Police to determine whether they are a security risk to Australia's ships and maritime infrastructure and, importantly, the safety and security of our country as a whole. Seafarers who pass this assessment are issued with a Maritime Security Identification Card, or MSIC. In effect, this card means that the seafarer is not considered a risk to our country's security or the security of the vessel. The amendment bill will cease this requirement for Australian-registered ships which move between ports around Australia. Strangely, however, it will not remove this requirement for Australian-registered ships which trade overseas.


At a time when terrorism is at an all-time high and security is a critical issue for our country, I cannot understand why the government would be putting forward such a bill and the Labor Party would be supporting this bill. The effect of this bill is that companies will be able to bring in foreign labour to work on Australian-registered vessels and these people will not be required to undertake a security assessment. This will simply make it easier for companies to sack Australian labour and bring in 457 workers. If this bill is successful—and unfortunately it is, because Labor has decided to get in bed with the government once again—foreign workers working on ships will be able to move around Australia from port to port without any Australian maritime security assessment. These people will be able to just get off the ship at any port.


What sickens me in all of this is that the coalition and the Labor Party all prattle on about how important it is to support Aussie jobs and Aussie workers but then go about undermining Aussie jobs and Aussie workers by putting up bills like this one that do nothing more than remove barriers and help big businesses to sack Australian workers and bring in 457 workers. I have consulted with areas of the shipping industry, and they are opposed to this bill. Every person I have spoken to is of the opinion that the bill will help to kill off Australia's maritime and shipping industry, which seems to be the government's ultimate plan.


Unlike the government and Labor, I have listened to the people of Queensland and the rest of Australia, I am voicing my disapproval of this bill and I am voting how the people of this country want me to vote. They want me to vote against this bill, and that is exactly what I am doing. Perhaps, if the government had consulted with the maritime and shipping industry before drafting this bill, we would not be here today wasting taxpayers' money and time considering this bill. I absolutely oppose this bill.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2016-02-03,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Minister for Tourism and International Education and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment) (10:00):  The government is very committed to boosting the productivity of the Australian shipping industry and reducing red tape. Contrary to the presentation we just heard from Senator Lazarus's and Senator Rice, we are committed to boosting the competitiveness of the Australian shipping industry. That has been one of the objectives we have had for a long time, because we know that an undue cost in the supply chain makes the entire supply chain uncompetitive. So Senator Lazarus' sugar farmers who are moving sugar around the Australian coastline under this piece of legislation will have access to more competitive shipping. That is the point. That is the point of this whole process, and I will dispute his assertion that the industry does not support this; because they do. I also dispute his assertion that it is all about replacing Australian labour with foreign labour, because that is not what this bill enables. So can I say, Senator Lazarus, I am going to have to disagree with the arguments you have made in your presentation. 


The government wants the Australian shipping industry to be competitive so it can provide an efficient and competitive service to Australian industry; that is the point. That is what we are striving to do and that is what we have been striving to do through previous pieces of legislation that we have looked at. So exposing the Australian shipping industry to competition will drive innovation, will drive reductions in cost and will make them look more closely at their businesses to provide a more cost competitive and efficient service to Australian shippers. That is what it is about. 


We also remain committed to ensuring that our transport systems, be they road, rail, aviation or maritime, are safe, secure and efficient. In this regard we continue to foster Australia's economic prosperity—as I said—through a safe, secure and efficient maritime transport system. Australia's maritime transport safety settings are regularly reviewed to ensure that they are appropriate to changes in the maritime security environment. And it is a delicate balance between security and regulatory overlay. It is a delicate balance, and it is important that we continue to look at it. 


A recent joint review between industry and the Australian government was undertaken to investigate the need to continue security regulating Australian ships solely on interstate voyages. That review confirmed that there is no ongoing benefit to security regulating Australian ships used solely on interstate voyages except for passenger and vehicle ferries. As such, the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015 will see a reduction in red tape which does not provide any security benefit. In other words, the security regulation of Australian ships engaged solely on interstate voyage except for passenger and vehicle ferries will be ceased. This action will provide a reduction in running costs for operators of Australian flagged ships engaged solely on interstate voyages. Additionally, it establishes a level playing field for ships moving between states and those solely engaged on intrastate voyages, as arguably there is no increase to a ship's security risk that comes from crossing a domestic state border. 


The security risks will not change if the existing regulatory regime is removed, and this bill does not prevent operators from employing their own security measures to protect their business operations and assets. However, should there be a change in the maritime threat environment there are a number of powers available under the act to protect the shipping industry, including a requirement for ships to implement additional security measures while in Australian ports and reregulation of Australian ships on interstate voyages. 


While not a part of this bill, it is proposed that passenger and vehicle ferries on interstate voyages will continue to be regulated as it is in the public interest. This bill has no impact on the security arrangements of foreign flagged ships operating in Australian territorial waters. 






These ships still need to be security regulated by their flagged state and are required to undertake a range of security activities specified in the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, and include these in their ship security plans.


Furthermore, all foreign ships entering Australian ports are required to have and to provide a valid International Ship Security Certificate or equivalent to the Australian Border Force, and this information is made available to ports. Crews of foreign-flagged ships will continue to be required to be escorted or monitored when in a maritime security zone.


These amendments will have a positive outcome for industry by reducing the regulatory burden and associated costs without compromising security. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Labor worked hard with the Senate crossbench to defeat last year's proposed legislation—this failed bill; the most outrageous attack on the livelihoods of average Australians since Work Choices. Alongside other senators, particularly Senators Rice, Madigan, Lambie, Muir, Lazarus and Wang, Labor has worked with the industry to develop sensible adjustments to policy that could give the industry certainty and efficiency. In this context, I would like to acknowledge the work of Teresa Lloyd of Maritime Industry Australia Ltd, and the Maritime Union of Australia, led by its national secretary, Paddy Crumlin.


There have been two workshops in Melbourne attended by a broad cross-section of the industry, including shippers and unions. The most recent was last month, on 21 January. The government has sent no members of parliament, favouring a modest attendance by a departmental official. And in the meantime, the government has granted temporary licences to ships that replace Australian crews, with apparent indifference to the economic, environmental and national security implications of this approach. We would urge the government to improve its engagement with the sector to further our national interests. Efficiency must be part of that discussion. However, the ideological approach of removing domestic shipping must stop.


It is against that background that we contemplate the legislation before us today, which seeks to reduce red tape across Australian flagged vessels. Labor will support this legislation because it makes sense. But if those opposite continue to have their heads in the sand, the whole exercise will be completely academic; there will not be any Australian flagged major trading vessels. With that warning, Labor commends this bill to the Senate.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-02-03,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:43):  I rise today to speak to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015. The Australian Greens are opposed to this bill, because we believe the government is yet to make the case for loosening the regulations on registered Australian vessels engaged in interstate trade. It is significant that there is still confusion and a lack of clarity as to why this measure is required in the context that has just been outlined by Senator Collins. It is a context when the job security of people in our Australian shipping industry is under attack like at few times in our history.


I think back to the Patrick's waterfront dispute of the late nineties, which was just down the road from my home in Footscray, when we had security guards in balaclavas locking out workers in an attempt to increase profits. The Melbourne community, the Australian community, rallied around the seafarers and the people working on the ports then and we managed to get change, and managed to maintain, largely, the conditions and the ability for people working in our maritime industries to be able to be paid a fair day's wage and have fair conditions for their work.


What happened on the docks then was supported by the Liberal government of the time; in fact, they were intimately involved with it. Fast forward to 2016 and you have the disgraceful removal of Australian workers who were on board MV Portland over the summer. In the middle of the night, Alcoa's hired goons boarded the ship, kicked off the Australian crew and replaced them with a foreign crew, who immediately set sail for Singapore. This foreign crew, we have heard, were being paid $6 an hour. We know that foreign crews on flags-of-convenience vessels sailing around Australia have been paid as little as $2 an hour. 


The crew members of the MV Portland, who were kicked off their ship, are actually in Canberra at the moment. I had the privilege of meeting with some of them yesterday and I understand they are out the front of Parliament House today, and they are telling their stories to politicians. Yesterday, I met with three of the MV Portland crew. I met Liam, who had been on the MV Portlandfor 11 years; Zac, a young seafarer, who was hoping to build his career in seafaring over the coming years and who now faces very bleak prospects of being able to find employment in the industry; and Brett, who lives in Portland. When I asked Brett how he saw his chances of regaining a job in the shipping industry, he thought that he did not have many chances at all. 


These are skilled Australian workers. These are people who have spent many years building their skills who are proud of being hardworking Australian seafarers. For someone like Brett, who has spent his life working to build up his skills and who now has very limited prospects of being able to find another job in the shipping industry, it is a very, very sad for him. These are real people. They have real families. They now do not know what their prospects will be and what job opportunities there are for them. There are not many jobs in Portland. 


The government actions in supporting the actions of Alcoa in removing these workers from their ship in the middle of the night are not helping the opportunities of these workers to be able to contribute to Australian society. They have real families. They have real mortgages and real commitments. Basically, the reason they were removed from their ship was that they were sacked for being Australians. They were sacked and all they were doing was doing their job and doing it well, and being part of the Australian transport industry. They were sacked because the government agreed with Alcoa that the ship they were on was no longer required and was going to be replaced by a ship that was operating under a flag of convenience, a foreign owned ship, on a temporary licence.


The issue with these temporary licences is that they clearly undermine the full intent of the coastal shipping legislation that we currently have to hand, where the minister is actually meant to be acting to protect Australian shipping. But every time the request for a temporary licence has been put to him, he has signed it off. In this case, and in the case of the other ship over summer that has now been replaced by a foreign ship sailing on a temporary licence, the minister could have said, no, that there was not a strong enough case to show how replacing these Australian flagged and Australian crewed ships with a foreign ship operating under a flag of convenience was in the interests of Australian shipping.


Basically, because the criteria for whether a temporary licence should be issued is that there is no Australian ship available to do the job that is cost competitive, any request for a temporary licence for a foreign ship is always going to outcompete the Australian owned ship—because with the Australian flagged ship we know that we have to pay our workers a fair rate of pay. We know that they have to have good working conditions, whereas when you are competing with foreign ships you have workers being exploited and paid two dollars an hour under atrocious conditions. Environmental standards are being exploited and are totally lax. We know, with very good evidence, of rubbish being thrown overboard and oil spills not being reported. When you are competing with all this there is no way that a well-managed, Australian-crewed, Australian-flagged ship is going to be able to be cost competitive—so the temporary licence gets issued. You cannot be competitive with that sort of appalling regime.


We know that since the MV Portland was replaced three ships so far have done the journey from Kwinana to Portland. Of those three ships, one is under investigation for corruption and one is facing charges of not having paid their seafarers. These are the sorts of ships that are replacing our Australian crewed and Australian flagged ships. These are the sorts of ships that mean we are looking to replace virtually all the ships in the Australian shipping industry. It is an absolute travesty. Here in Australia we are the fourth-largest users of ships in the world and yet we have this government's approach to shipping. They attempted—and failed—to get legislation through the Senate to deregulate the shipping industry, and now they are working with industry to undermine the intent of the existing legislation.


It really is a sign of things to come. The decline in Australia shipping could be arrested, but the legacy of this government seems to be that it is going to destroy Australian shipping. The decline could be arrested. The way to arrest it, the way to revitalise and rebuild Australian shipping, is to provide some certainty to the industry and to be working together, as the MUA and the maritime industries of Australia have been trying to do over the past months with the shipping summits that have been held in Melbourne—trying to bring all players together to work out what the future is for Australia's shipping and how we can rebuild it; rather than the government's agenda, which is basically to say goodbye to it.


There are really good reasons for maintaining the Australian shipping industry, and yet Australian seafarers and Australian shipping have been kicked in the guts and kicked off their ship. This industrial thuggery has been aided and abetted by the Liberal government, who are wanting to deregulate the Australian shipping industry into oblivion. When the local industry most needs our support, the Liberal government is trying to kick it when it is down.


It is a case that is characteristic of this government. It is not just the shipping industry. Whether it is with the Australian Building and Construction Commission or attempts to cut penalty rates, we are seeing attacks on Australian workers throughout the country. These cases show that it is not just limited to the land; we have it happening on land and at sea. So, when the government is talking about loosening regulations and cutting red tape, the Australian people have very strong grounds for scepticism when it comes to this Liberal government.


With regard to the legislation that is before us, I acknowledge that the minister has stated his intention to continue to regulate passenger and vehicle interstate transport, but we are not convinced. As it stands, the security measures in the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act only apply to registered Australian ships that are used for either interstate or overseas voyages, but there is no regulation for intrastate voyages. So currently a journey from Portland in Victoria to Kwinana in Western Australia is covered, but not a trip from Portland to Melbourne. The original bill to create Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act in 2003 failed to justify why this was the case.


The Australian Greens broadly agree that it is difficult to argue as to why a ship operating between Portland and Fremantle needs to have extra security regulations compared to a ship voyaging between Portland and Melbourne, as there are not radically different security regimes between the states. However, there are real concerns that this is yet another attempt by the government to lead a race to the bottom by gutting regulations and endangering people at work.


When this government was headed by the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, we became familiar with, but always dismayed by, the haphazard approach to policymaking of introducing new regulations or tearing up old ones without recourse to evidence or due process. There were high hopes that Tony Abbott's replacement as Prime Minister would relieve us of this approach, but every day, and on every issue, it becomes clear that it is the same old Liberals under Prime Minister Turnbull.


If we want to ensure that regulations are coherent across the country, ensure the safety of people at work and ensure our security, there is another way to do this: we could broaden the regulations to vessels on intrastate voyages and ensure that all vessels, regardless of country of registration, comply with the same standards. The government's logic has the capacity to be extended in both directions. But, for the bill before us today, the Australian Greens feel that the government has simply failed to make the case that this change balances the competing needs of maritime workers, shippers, Australia's international obligations and the broader Australian community, and that is why the Australian Greens will be opposing this bill.

"Lazarus, Sen Glenn",GLT,2016-02-03,"



Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (09:56):  I stand today very disappointed, having to speak about the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015. It should never have seen the light of day, but here we are. That goes to say that I will not be supporting this bill. My understanding of the bill is that it will water down the current Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003, which was put in place by the Howard government to improve Australia's maritime security. The current act requires seafarers working on all Australian-registered ships which trade between states or overseas to be assessed by ASIO and the Australian Federal Police to determine whether they are a security risk to Australia's ships and maritime infrastructure and, importantly, the safety and security of our country as a whole. Seafarers who pass this assessment are issued with a Maritime Security Identification Card, or MSIC. In effect, this card means that the seafarer is not considered a risk to our country's security or the security of the vessel. The amendment bill will cease this requirement for Australian-registered ships which move between ports around Australia. Strangely, however, it will not remove this requirement for Australian-registered ships which trade overseas.


At a time when terrorism is at an all-time high and security is a critical issue for our country, I cannot understand why the government would be putting forward such a bill and the Labor Party would be supporting this bill. The effect of this bill is that companies will be able to bring in foreign labour to work on Australian-registered vessels and these people will not be required to undertake a security assessment. This will simply make it easier for companies to sack Australian labour and bring in 457 workers. If this bill is successful—and unfortunately it is, because Labor has decided to get in bed with the government once again—foreign workers working on ships will be able to move around Australia from port to port without any Australian maritime security assessment. These people will be able to just get off the ship at any port.


What sickens me in all of this is that the coalition and the Labor Party all prattle on about how important it is to support Aussie jobs and Aussie workers but then go about undermining Aussie jobs and Aussie workers by putting up bills like this one that do nothing more than remove barriers and help big businesses to sack Australian workers and bring in 457 workers. I have consulted with areas of the shipping industry, and they are opposed to this bill. Every person I have spoken to is of the opinion that the bill will help to kill off Australia's maritime and shipping industry, which seems to be the government's ultimate plan.


Unlike the government and Labor, I have listened to the people of Queensland and the rest of Australia, I am voicing my disapproval of this bill and I am voting how the people of this country want me to vote. They want me to vote against this bill, and that is exactly what I am doing. Perhaps, if the government had consulted with the maritime and shipping industry before drafting this bill, we would not be here today wasting taxpayers' money and time considering this bill. I absolutely oppose this bill.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2016-02-03,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Minister for Tourism and International Education and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment) (10:00):  The government is very committed to boosting the productivity of the Australian shipping industry and reducing red tape. Contrary to the presentation we just heard from Senator Lazarus's and Senator Rice, we are committed to boosting the competitiveness of the Australian shipping industry. That has been one of the objectives we have had for a long time, because we know that an undue cost in the supply chain makes the entire supply chain uncompetitive. So Senator Lazarus' sugar farmers who are moving sugar around the Australian coastline under this piece of legislation will have access to more competitive shipping. That is the point. That is the point of this whole process, and I will dispute his assertion that the industry does not support this; because they do. I also dispute his assertion that it is all about replacing Australian labour with foreign labour, because that is not what this bill enables. So can I say, Senator Lazarus, I am going to have to disagree with the arguments you have made in your presentation. 


The government wants the Australian shipping industry to be competitive so it can provide an efficient and competitive service to Australian industry; that is the point. That is what we are striving to do and that is what we have been striving to do through previous pieces of legislation that we have looked at. So exposing the Australian shipping industry to competition will drive innovation, will drive reductions in cost and will make them look more closely at their businesses to provide a more cost competitive and efficient service to Australian shippers. That is what it is about. 


We also remain committed to ensuring that our transport systems, be they road, rail, aviation or maritime, are safe, secure and efficient. In this regard we continue to foster Australia's economic prosperity—as I said—through a safe, secure and efficient maritime transport system. Australia's maritime transport safety settings are regularly reviewed to ensure that they are appropriate to changes in the maritime security environment. And it is a delicate balance between security and regulatory overlay. It is a delicate balance, and it is important that we continue to look at it. 


A recent joint review between industry and the Australian government was undertaken to investigate the need to continue security regulating Australian ships solely on interstate voyages. That review confirmed that there is no ongoing benefit to security regulating Australian ships used solely on interstate voyages except for passenger and vehicle ferries. As such, the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015 will see a reduction in red tape which does not provide any security benefit. In other words, the security regulation of Australian ships engaged solely on interstate voyage except for passenger and vehicle ferries will be ceased. This action will provide a reduction in running costs for operators of Australian flagged ships engaged solely on interstate voyages. Additionally, it establishes a level playing field for ships moving between states and those solely engaged on intrastate voyages, as arguably there is no increase to a ship's security risk that comes from crossing a domestic state border. 


The security risks will not change if the existing regulatory regime is removed, and this bill does not prevent operators from employing their own security measures to protect their business operations and assets. However, should there be a change in the maritime threat environment there are a number of powers available under the act to protect the shipping industry, including a requirement for ships to implement additional security measures while in Australian ports and reregulation of Australian ships on interstate voyages. 


While not a part of this bill, it is proposed that passenger and vehicle ferries on interstate voyages will continue to be regulated as it is in the public interest. This bill has no impact on the security arrangements of foreign flagged ships operating in Australian territorial waters. 






These ships still need to be security regulated by their flagged state and are required to undertake a range of security activities specified in the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, and include these in their ship security plans.


Furthermore, all foreign ships entering Australian ports are required to have and to provide a valid International Ship Security Certificate or equivalent to the Australian Border Force, and this information is made available to ports. Crews of foreign-flagged ships will continue to be required to be escorted or monitored when in a maritime security zone.


These amendments will have a positive outcome for industry by reducing the regulatory burden and associated costs without compromising security. I commend the bill to the Senate.

(

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-02-03,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:48):  I rise today to continue a conversation I commenced in December here in the chamber and have spoken about in the media in recent times, and that is the opportunity for young people from their mid-20s to their mid-30s to be able to, if they want to, opt in to access their superannuation funds to meet their Higher Education Loans Program debt. I will speak about three groups of people: first, those who are graduates now and have a HELP debt which they would like to relieve themselves of; second, people in their mid-20s to mid-30s who did not avail themselves of a university education when they left school but would like to do so; and, third, those Australians overseas who have a HELP debt they want to pay back and want to use their Australian superannuation that is going backwards in their fund in Australia because administrative costs are exceeding the interest levels. They do not have access to their superannuation overseas and they want to use their Australian super for that purpose.


I will make some points. First of all, this is a scheme that people can if they want to opt into but simply, if it does not suit their purposes, they would not. The second point I want to make is that it would not be available to school leavers simply because, firstly, they have alternative options for higher education and, secondly, they would not have accumulated a superannuation dividend or a superannuation sum. So this is a scheme in which a person could use their own funds to improve their position financially and/or, hopefully, to improve their position in terms of higher education. 


I want to speak firstly about graduates in their mid-20s to mid-30s and have a debt they are repaying. They might be on $70,000 or $80,000 a year and paying eight per cent, somewhere around $9,000 possibly per year, off their HELP debt. They could access that level of superannuation and pay down that debt and relieve themselves of the burden they face at that time—and it might be one associated with a young family, a home mortgage or whatever. They would do that in the knowledge—and I wish to make this point strongly—that at a later stage in their lives when the burden of debt is released from them they will repay the funds they have taken out of their superannuation scheme with compound interest so that by the time they retire they will have at least the same sum of money back in their super fund. Even those who have a degree have a requirement these days for retraining, for taking on new skills, for perhaps doing a master's degree to improve their circumstance. So that is the first group who would be assisted by this scheme. They opt in if they want to and if they do not want to they do not need to.


Our colleague the member for Fraser, Dr Leigh, asked in a tweet of Senator Back:


Hoping @senatorback can explain the benefits of using tax-advantaged super, growing at 7%, to pay off HECS debts, growing at 2.5%


The answer is I can. I do not know what Dr Leigh's circumstances were, but I know what mine were in my early to mid-20s—I had a young family and was paying off the debt I had accumulated for my university degree; I was certainly cash poor. The value of those funds to a young person may well exceed the eventual value upon retirement. That is the situation that Dr Leigh addressed to me. In the memory again because he probably did not understand that one of the principles of this scheme is that the person does eventually repay. Over the next 20 or 30 years of their career they pay it back, so they have got at least as much in the scheme.


The other criticism I suffered was from our good Senate colleague Senator Carr who seemed to have the idea that I was attacking low-paid workers—which brings me to the second group and that is those who have now reached their mid-20s to mid-30s. They did not get a university degree. They may now be in an office where others around them are doing better financially and because of their qualifications are going to continue to do so. That person, again, may well have a debt. They may well have a young family. They cannot afford a university education. What a wonderful opportunity for them to be able to say: 'Yes, I can. I've got those $15,000 or $20,000 in my super fund. I am going to use those funds. I am going to now go and study—possibly part-time—in the knowledge that when I graduate I can use those funds out of my super fund. I can pay off that HELP debt.'


If we all genuinely believe, as we say in this place so often, that a person with a degree will earn up to a million dollars more over their career than a person who has not got a university degree, I would say to Senator Carr in relation to his criticism of me: this scheme allows the lower paid worker, the person who is semi-skilled or unskilled, to increase their skill level, to cease being a low-paid worker if they want to be aspirational. Of course, we know that at retirement they have the obligation to pay that sum back. If we believe that a graduate will do better over their career, that person will have far more as a university graduate with a better job over their career than they otherwise would have.


I say again, it is a scheme in which if it does not suit that person to avail themselves of that opportunity, if they want to leave the funds in their super account and either not go on and study further or they want to in some other way find those funds—fine. All I am saying is it is the person's own money. This is an opportunity to improve their educational opportunity, to get a degree, or to get a higher degree. It is an opportunity for them to avail themselves of that chance so that throughout their career they can improve themselves, aspire to a higher position, a higher education and, therefore, a higher salary and a higher circumstance at retirement.


The point was made to me by the gentleman who really is the architect of this program, Mr John Adams. He finds himself in that same position and has allowed me to use him as a case study. He is married and has a young family. At the moment he has a debt of around about $9½ thousand a year that he is paying back. He said to me that, if he had the opportunity to access some of his superannuation to relieve himself of that $9,000, or $770 a month now, he may well in fact—as his wife and he want to do—start a family. She could stop working. They would then have sufficient funds to be able to allow that circumstance, a circumstance in which he says at the moment he wants the value of those funds. To answer Dr Leigh's question—I do not know who is getting seven per cent on their super at the moment but nevertheless—he is happy to forgo the future benefit because he wants the immediate benefit now.


There is a third group who I believe would be assisted by this scheme. In this place, only in early December did we legislate to make it more applicable to Australians working overseas with a HELP debt—for the government of the day to actually recover those unmet costs. When I started speaking about this in the media in the last two to three weeks I had conversations with people in Scandinavia and in Asia who said to me: 'We know we have to pay back our HECS or our HELP debt. We have superannuation willowing away in Australia', because the administrative costs of their super fund exceed the actual interest that they are earning on it. They cannot access their Australian super to move it overseas to where they now reside. At least in the case of the Scandinavians, they said to me, 'I am not likely to come back to Australia. I realise I've got a debt. I want to pay the debt. I've got funds in my Australian superannuation account which are diminishing. Allow me to access the funds that are in my super fund in Australia to repay my debt to the Australian government for the higher education that I gained.'


It is the case that we have a substantial sum of money out there in unpaid HECS or HELP paid for, of course, by the Australian taxpayer. This would be a benefit to our bottom line. We have a circumstance in which people with funds in their super account want to access it to either relieve themselves of the debt or, in the case of someone without a degree, to access it to improve themselves in terms of their higher education, or those who are overseas and want to discharge themselves of that debt. This is worth consideration. It is worth, in my view, the support of all sides. I for one would be very happy to engage further with Senator Carr and with others on what they see as the disadvantages of this scheme.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:02):  I do not propose to detain the chamber for long on these matters. Notice was certainly provided to—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ludlam, you need to move a motion.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's response.


I acknowledge the minister's response, sketchy though it might have been. I recognise that Senator Colbeck is in a representative capacity. I think it is a shame that the department did not see fit to provide him with the brief.


The questions that I have put on notice relate to the documentation provided to the federal government—or not, as the case may be—by the Western Australian government on the Perth Freight Link. I think it is appropriate that this issue is raised in the first sitting week of parliament for 2016 because this is going to be a very big issue. It could be put to bed very rapidly, either at a state level or at a Commonwealth level, or it could explode into a federal and then state election issue in Western Australia.


The fact of the matter is that I have never seen greater incompetence in an infrastructure funding decision at a state level than that which has attended the proposed Perth Freight Link in Western Australia. In case senators from outside Western Australia are not aware of what I am talking about, there is a proposal for four or, by some accounts, six lanes of tarmac through the Beeliar Regional Park and the Beeliar Wetlands that would flatten an area of wetlands that is a very important cultural place for the Aboriginal people of the region and has been for tens of thousands of years. It then proposes to smash through just under 100 hectares of urban bushland—almost pristine and intact banksia woodland.


This is a freeway project that was put in the planning scheme in Western Australia in 1955. Those lines that were marked on a map in the mid-1950s in the Stephenson-Hepburn plan are still being used as an excuse in the early 21st century for why we should be hammering this urban bushland and wetland. It is a proposal that has put neighbourhood amenities at risk in Bibra Lake, North Lake and Palmyra. It is a road to nowhere. I have never seen greater incompetence in a proposal for a publicly funded infrastructure project than what has been pursued by Premier Barnett and transport minister Dean Nalder, who, quite frankly, should have been sacked months ago over this debacle and the stress that it has put people through.


The EPA approval was knocked over late last year in the Western Australian Supreme Court. That was a rare judgement, but it was a strident judgement in condemnation of the EPA's conduct over this issue. The Commonwealth, as I said, has a remedy very easily at hand. The Commonwealth can tell Premier Barnett—it could do it this afternoon with a phone call by Senator Mathias Cormann—that there will not be a dollar of Commonwealth taxpayers' money going to this project. It has been hammered in the state Supreme Court. It is under attack in the Federal Court. It is politically massively unpopular. There is an extraordinarily powerful mobilisation of community groups, environmental campaigners, Aboriginal elders and families. This project will not be going ahead. If the federal government wants to save itself and the hapless Premier Barnett a world of misery through this forthcoming election campaign, it simply needs to turn off the funding tap.


I will turn very briefly to the three pages of questions. I am not going to go through them in any kind of detail. I hope that Senator Colbeck is able to update the chamber either later today or tomorrow. Three different numbers emerged from the cost-benefit analysis that was submitted by the Western Australian government in a rather feeble attempt to justify the project. Nobody outside the bureaucrats who crafted it or the consultants that they had put it together has ever seen the workings or the assumptions that resulted in these imaginary numbers. So we are seeking some information to be put into the public domain as to how the Barnett government came up with some of these imaginary numbers.


Can you imagine a project that proposes a four-fold increase in truck traffic onto local roads out the back of Fremantle; increased carcinogenic air pollution and reduced neighbourhood amenity; the impact on liveability; the loss of 100 hectares of irreplaceable banksia woodland; the hammering of the Beeliar Wetlands; the loss of recreation and amenity? Somehow, these costs end up erased from the balance sheet, and the benefits end up being overinflated. One of the ways in which we believe they did it is that the department gives benefits a weighting of 80 per cent but costs a weighting of 20 per cent. So you have some imaginary numbers for benefits. Apparently the business case is meant to say that there are $70 million in carbon savings. This is a government populated by people who can barely bring themselves to acknowledge that global warming is even real, and yet they model $70 million in carbon savings by smashing a four-lane freeway through wetlands and bushland—and somehow these benefits end up on the benefits side of the equation for a project such as this.


I want to get an understanding, and the public—the people of metropolitan Perth and WA more broadly—want to get an idea of how the department modelled the costs for a project that barely even exists; for a project where the minister cannot decide from one minute to another whether he wants a freeway, once this atrocity hits the Stock Road interchange, or whether he wants a tunnel; how it is proposed to get into Fremantle; and when the Fremantle port might actually be at capacity and, then, leading to the need for overflow container capacity in Cockburn Sound. How do you model the costs for the cost side of the cost-benefit equation, when you do not even know what your project is? Yet the department comes forward with these very confident sounding gestures that the costs will be this, the benefits will be that, and therefore the project is worth building. It is based on imaginary numbers on a project that will not get built.


That is why we have put these very serious questions to the Commonwealth minister, because this is not just a problem for Western Australian taxpayers; this is $2 billion that cannot then be spent helping the people of the Hunter Valley adapt to climate change, or put into schools or put into further work on high-speed rail. The entire taxpaying public of Australia stand to lose billions of dollars through this debacle if Premier Barnett gets his way. Senator Cormann, Minister Truss, Prime Minister Turnbull—who professes, and I see it on the internet a fair bit, to be a fan of public transport—should be looking at genuine public transport options for Western Australia, at freight rail solutions and at a future-proof strategy to take the container pressure off Fremantle port.


The solutions are very well at hand. What we do not have are answers. What we do not have is transparency. This is going to be a very significant problem for the Liberal-National Party if they are seriously proposing to torch more than $2 billion on this road to nowhere in the middle of an election year. So I hope Senator Colbeck, on behalf of the responsible minister, is forthcoming with some answers, because, if he is not, this will not be the last time that this is raised in this place.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2016-02-03,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator McAllister today relating to school funding.


I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Cormann to a question asked by Senator McAllister. Just to remind the Senate, this was a particular question to Senator Cormann in relation to what is becoming a growing discrepancy between what the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education have been saying about the future of education funding and the future of school funding.


What it really represents is the quagmire that this government has found itself in, when it has been trapped between what it said before an election and what it has been trying to do since an election. Let us not forget that, before the election, Minister Pyne said that you can vote Liberal or Labor and you will get exactly the same amount of funding for your school. That has now been patently shown to be untrue. In particular, what we have seen is a discrepancy between what the Minister for Education has said and what the Minister for Finance has said. The documents are very clear and the budget documents are very clear. These are documents that have no need to be tabled in this place, as they are already publicly available, but the documents and the budget documents say:


From the 2018 school year onwards, total recurrent funding will be indexed by the Consumer Price Index, with an allowance for changes in enrolments.


That is what the documents say. Yet you have a discrepancy when the minister is out there floating that there will be some kind of a change and that this is not set in stone. There is a discrepancy between what the Minister for Finance has been saying and what the Minister for Education has been saying. Clearly, there is a division at the moment within the government on what and how they intend to fund the future of our schools and future school investment. I am always a bit careful about necessarily believing everything that is in the media, but there was a story today—




Senator Conroy:
  That is because you usually put it in!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Those pieces are the bits that tend to be true, Senator Conroy! I try to be careful about believing everything that is in the paper, but it appears that the government may even be backflipping, and there is talk of the government backflipping on their $30 billion of cuts in education. Let me be clear. That is something that someone like myself would actually welcome. I hope they do backflip. I hope they do reverse their changes. I hope they do end up finding a way of funding the Gonski school model, because that would be the best outcome for Australia. Unfortunately, however, there seems to be no intention by the government to do this. What there seems to be are a couple of flippant lines, flippant comments and throwaway statements. But in the dead of the night in the lead-up to the Christmas period we saw the government abandon the Gonski proposals.


So, on one hand, we have heard a lot of rhetoric from the government, talking about the importance of school funding and the need to improve schools but, on the other hand we have not seen the government put any actual money or the necessary resources on the table. There has been a straw man argument that has been thrown up by the government that says, 'The answer to everything is not funding.' That is true: the answer to everything is not funding. But you cannot fix the fundamental problems within our education system if you are not funding schools properly. The funding is a start, and the Gonski model demonstrated how you can make the best use of funding to get the best outcome and deliver the best results for our students.


We now have a government in disarray when it comes to its education policies. It is a government where one side is not talking to the other and there is a clear division being drawn between those who are responsible for policy development and those who are responsible for finance. We see a growing clear division between the Minister for Finance, Minister Cormann, and the Minister for Education and Training, Minister Birmingham, around how this needs to be funded.


The reality is that there is a proposal on the table. There is a plan on the table that is supported by teachers, by teachers' representatives, by principals and by students. That plan is out there and needs to be funded. Labor has come to the table with a fully costed plan on how to fund that proposal, but all we have seen from the conservative side of politics is disunity and division.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2016-02-03,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:15):  This is one of those rare occasions when I find myself agreeing with an utterance from Senator Dastyari, and that utterance was: funding isn't everything. But those on the other side of the chamber are prepared to throw any amount of money into any pit that they fancy without determining the efficacy, the effect of that money and the priorities and outcomes that should be delivered. This is typical of the socialist end of the political spectrum: they are happy to spend other people's money until there is none left. It does not matter about the results.


If you want to look at the results in the education system, I am one of those people who lament the decline in literacy standards and student outcomes that have been evident over recent years. I read the other day in the newspaper that the number of children starting school without adequate numeracy skills is rising. The problem is not that we have not got enough money in education—education funding has increased by 100 per cent over the last 20 or 30 years while student enrolment has grown by only about 18 per cent—but that student outcomes have declined. 


Throwing cash at a problem may be the easy way out, but actually structuring a program that is going to deliver results that is much more important. The government have, to their credit, identified this. They have said that teacher quality is absolutely paramount, and it is. It strikes me as incongruous that you can go into teaching with perhaps the lowest ATAR or tertiary education score and yet you are responsible for teaching the next generation. We should be expecting much higher standards for those seeking to teach our children. 


School autonomy is also very, very important, because schools can make determinations that are in the best interests of their students. They do that, and they should do that, by engaging the parents in the education system. Too many parents think that the school can do it all themselves. That is not the case. We have got to make sure that parents are spending time with their children, that they are helping to develop their skills so that they can be built upon in the school and then enhanced in a practical environment. I want to give an example of that. When I was a publican and we employed a school graduate as a part-time person to work in our cafe, that person was unable to calculate the change from a $5 note for a cup of coffee. That was when coffee cost less than $5. They could not do that manually without the benefit of a cash register, and that was a year 12 graduate in the early 1990s. That is simply unacceptable and yet we are now risking going even further down that path if we deny that we have to get absolute outcomes. Throwing money at the issue is simply not going to solve the problem.


The final plank of the government's approach—and I think this is very important—is strengthening the curriculum. It is not good enough to teach shades of grey. There are some absolutes that are important in education. Being able to read is an absolute prerequisite. Being able to write is an absolute prerequisite. Being able to think for yourself is a prerequisite. Research abilities and things of that nature are important, as is the historical basis for things—such as learning the times tables. Students will ask, 'Why do we have to do that? We can just google or get a calculator.' It benefits people in development of their brains and everything else as we go along. We should not be just chasing new methodologies and ditching the things of the past simply because we might think they are anachronistic. They are not. It is about the development of our children and the education system. 


There is a lot we can do that does not involve new money. We need to ensure that teachers are the best they possibly can be. It is about giving schools and parents a real investment in their children's education and making sure that schools can provide the services and the sorts of facilities that are most necessary and, of course, it is about strengthening the curriculum. Strengthening the curriculum means building around the core. It means establishing the basics so that children can learn to the best of their ability, and that is ultimately what we want from our education system. Right now, the statistics show that over successive years the system has not been doing the best it possibly can for our children.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2016-02-03,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:20):  Prime Minister Turnbull's $30 billion cuts to education are a clear broken promise to Australian students, parents, teachers and the broader community. Pathetically, as Senator Dastyari mentioned, he was hoping that by breaking this promise during the Christmas and New Year period, when Australians were enjoying their holidays and time with their families, no-one would notice. Can I tell those opposite: people have noticed. Australian people have noticed and they are not happy. The cuts to our classrooms are the equivalent of ripping out one out of every seven teachers. That is not good enough. I did not actually disagree with what Senator Bernardi said about the curriculum, but what is the point in having any sort of curriculum if you have not got the teachers and the funding there to be able to implement the curriculum? On average the government has ripped $3.2 million out of every school in every state and every territory, and the impact of that is enormous.


Let's look at what that actually means. It will mean fewer subject choices and less support for students with disability, literacy and numeracy programs being cut. We just heard from Senator Bernardi about how important literacy and numeracy are, and I absolutely agree with him. What is the point of cutting them? They have to be there, because to get Australia back working in the way it should be we need to have people who are properly educated and employable. Learning supports will be cut, and we know that there will end up being less support and training for teachers. The deep uncertainty about the future of schools funding is already limiting the ability of school systems and principals to start programs and to plan to improve education. 


It is quite clear that only the Labor Party is really taking the challenge of improving Australian education seriously. I say to senators opposite that your plan to cut education will most certainly result in worse education outcomes. Before the last federal election Minister Pyne trumpeted his unity ticket on Gonski. As we heard yesterday, there were posters and all sorts of claims, such as 'You can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your schools.' Well, that is clearly not true. It was a complete con, because those opposite knew that Gonski was the best outcome, and they wanted to ride on the Labor Party coat-tails of Gonski to make sure that they could get elected. 


It is absolutely typical of this government that the cuts will hurt those who are least well off. The students who have suffered the most are those who are in remote schools, in disadvantaged schools and, of course, Indigenous children. In contrast, every child in every school in every state and territory in Australia will benefit from Labor's plan. The 'Your Child. Our Future' plan will mean better trained teachers, more resources for our schools and support students with special learning needs. We will fund the Gonski school reform in full, because there is nothing more important that a government can do than invest in education and invest in our schools. 


It is a complete farce that Mr Turnbull talks about innovation all the time, but at the same time he is cutting funding to every school across the nation. If you are deadly serious about education policy, then you have to be able to fund that policy and make sure that those on the ground are able to deliver that policy properly. And that is what Labor plans to do. As I said, we hear a lot of talk about innovation from the other side but, without education, all that is is just more talk. 


We need real investment in the programs that make a difference to increasing Australia's educational levels. Labor's policy, 'Your Child. Our Future', is fully costed and it guarantees long-term education for all Australian children. Just this week schools are going back in Tasmania. I strongly believe, as does the Labor Party, that every child should have the same chance of succeeding at school, no matter what their background, no matter where they live and no matter what type of school they go to. It is a Labor government— (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-02-03,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (15:25):  It is really quite interesting that after question time, when you have the opportunity to get up and take notice the questions that are asked by those opposite, there seems to be an underlying theme in the response, and that is: what about responsible fiscal management? Like everybody else in Australia, I would like to be spending more money on things like education, health and a lot of other things that we would like to have as our way of life. I notice that Senator Bilyk in her contribution was chastising the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, about his innovation agenda. 



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  It is economics 101. Senator Bilyk, let's start with this: if we have an agenda in this country and a policy platform by the government that creates jobs and creates growth in the economy, the next thing that flows from that is obviously higher revenues that come back to the government. It is those revenues that allow us to be able to afford the highest levels of education and health and all of the other things that Australians like to think should be part of the basket of activities that they can expect to come from their government. 


What you see instead is the misinformation, scaremongering and carry-on that went on over the last few minutes about education funding. Let's not forget that it was the promise of the government of which I am a member that said it would honour the Gonski funding to 2018. What those on the other side fail to mention in their contribution in this place is the fact there were two states and a territory that did not have any funding under Gonski. Whilst we continue to honour our undertaking for education funding, we have also had to find an additional amount of money to fund the two states and one territory that were not funded under the model that they proposed prior to the election. 


The cynics amongst us might suggest that they never expected to win the election, and so they thought they would go out with all these grandiose, unfunded promises and to hell with it. Unfortunately for them, they did not win government—fortunate for the country they did not as well—but the fact of the matter is that, if you go out with unfunded promises and you want to be a responsible fiscal manager, sometimes you actually have to go back and say to the Australian public, 'We cannot actually afford to honour all of these extreme increases in budget.' We are not talking about cuts in budget, we are talking about extreme increases in budgets. You also need to remember that, when you talk about cutting funding, just because you do not honour some unfunded commitment by an opposition, it does not necessarily mean that you are cutting funding. I think we need to be very careful that we get our nomenclature correct. 


The same issue arises with the scaremongering and false information that we are getting in the debate about GST, which is another of the questions asked by the opposition of the government today. I do not understand why this opposition is so scared about having a mature debate about a tax system. The best thing we can possibly deliver for this country is a fit for purpose taxation regime. We have a tax regime that has been in place for 30 or 40 years, and many things have changed in that time. The marketplace does not look the same as it did when many of the current tax measures were introduced. Who would have imagined 30 years ago, 20 years ago or even 10 years ago the size of the internet economy and online sales? To refuse to have a mature debate and to just go completely hysterical about the GST is once again showing the irresponsible behaviour of those opposite. 


I also say quite clearly: there has been no announcement and there is no policy of the government which is running in the Australian economy at the moment—that is, the Turnbull coalition government—to increase the GST. There is no proposal to increase the GST. So I do not know how any opposition can manage to get itself so totally overexercised in having a discussion around a whole heap of matters that are really important for the ongoing prosperity of this country that it would seek to derail a sensible debate about tax reform, hysterically scoring political points about the GST.


A renewed taxation system that allows for growth and for opportunities which generate jobs is going to be extraordinarily good for the country. We have also promised that there will be no net increase in the amount of tax. So I really do not know what those opposite are going on about.

"Bullock, Sen Joseph",ALP,2016-02-03,"



Senator BULLOCK
 (Western Australia) (15:31):  Like Senators Dastyari and Bilyk before me, I rise to speak on the motion to take note of answers, such as they were, to questions regarding education. Western Australia is a resources state. For years, the resources industry has underpinned our state's prosperity, with high wages, the nation's lowest unemployment rate and, at least under the great Labor Treasurer Eric Ripper, prior to the 2008 election, an economy in which prudent efforts were made by the state government to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom were shared across the population while maintaining the state's AAA credit rating.


The resources industry is, of course, cyclical. The situation in Western Australia is very different today as a result of a combination of the collapse of commodity prices and the profligate spending of the current government, which has seen the state lose its AAA credit rating and which has seen average wages fall, house prices slump and unemployment rise to 6.3 per cent—well above the national average of 5.8 per cent. Each week seems to bring worse news with respect to the state's economy, courtesy of the mismanagement and misdirected priorities of the current state government. The question must be asked: what are the long-term measures which need to be undertaken to broaden the state's economy, to insulate us from the commodity cycle and to underpin the future prosperity of our great state? 


Only Labor can be relied upon to have the long-term vision for a prosperity in which we can all share, and that vision is founded on an education system fit to equip our children with the skills needed to face the challenges of the future. Labor has always been the party of education. Education is the key to opportunity. It provides the tools necessary for individuals to achieve their potential.


Last week Labor leader Bill Shorten ensured his place in the pantheon of great Labor leaders with respect to his vision for education, with the announcement of his detailed 'Your Child. Our Future' plan for education. It is an ambitious plan, with a commitment to the expenditure of an additional $4½ billion over the 2018 and 2019 school years and a total provision of over $37 billion over a decade. It is a plan which has been fully costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. But, notwithstanding the enormous investment which it constitutes in the future of our children, in the future of our economy and in the future of our nation, it is an investment which falls comfortably within the detailed savings measures which have already been announced by Labor in the areas of multinational tax avoidance, inequitable superannuation tax concessions, progressive tobacco taxes and the scrapping of the Emissions Reduction Fund. It is a policy which is therefore not only visionary and not only necessary in terms of securing our future but economically feasible and responsible. It is a policy which people understand only a Labor government can be relied upon to deliver.




Senator Williams:
  Are you serious, Joe?




Senator BULLOCK:
  I am serious. The Shorten Labor plan for improving educational outcomes is comprehensive. It comprises a number of elements: a focus on every child's needs, which will address the particular disadvantage of any student, whether it be disability, remoteness, poverty or limited English, with tailored support; an emphasis on improving literacy and numeracy, with one-on-one support, early intervention and remedial and extension classes, with early intervention available to every child who needs it so that they do not fall behind and stay behind; working with universities and the profession to ensure the best quality teachers with access to the greatest professional support, technological support and professional development, with a particular emphasis on science, technology, engineering and maths so as to best equip our children for the jobs of the future—this is consistent with Labor's already announced commitment to supporting STEM teachers; more and better targeted resources to give schools flexibility to choose programs which will deliver the best results for their students, with the opportunity for more meaningful engagement with parents; and, finally,  more support for students with special learning needs. 


Labor has a long-term vision for Australia's future, a fundamental element of which is a commitment to education, backed up by a funding package that you can believe in, and Labor remains committed to the full implementation of Gonski reforms. The government, by contrast, has broken all of its education commitments, has abandoned Gonski and has, as its only policy, cuts to education at all levels. (Time expired)

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:36):  After discussion between the two sides of the parliament, I wish to seek leave to make a short statement about the passage this morning of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. The Leader of the Government in the Senate agreed that this would be an appropriate time to do it.


Leave granted.




Senator MOORE:
  I wish to make a short statement about the passage of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. As was made clear in the contributions from opposition speakers on the bill, the opposition opposed the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. Labor opposed the bill because it puts the cart well before the horse. It is true that the ACT government has announced its intention to leave Comcare. The ACT is committed to designing a new workers compensation scheme. The design of any new scheme will take a significant period of time, so there was no need to rush this legislation, as the Abbott Turnbull government has done.


Labor's first priority is always to ensure that employees are not worse off as a result of the government's proposed bill, and the decision we took to oppose the bill is firmly on that basis. Labor wanted to be certain that this bill will not enable the federal government to make its own Commonwealth workers worse off. On 9 June 2015, the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, signalled that the Abbott-Turnbull government could give its Public Service heads the freedom to walk away from the Comcare workers compensation fund. It is entirely possible that the passage of that bill could assist in facilitating further exits from Comcare, which the finance minister has foreshadowed. There remain a number of unanswered questions about the application and possible consequences of this legislation. We sought to make clear our position on this bill at that time.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator RICE:
  In supporting this motion we express our sympathies to everyone who has lost lives, homes, property and livestock to fires this summer. We also mourn the damage done to the World Heritage alpine areas of Tasmania and are enormously grateful to the people who put their own lives at risk fighting these fires. But the issue of bushfires is more complex than suggested in this motion. How severe fires are depends not just on fuel, but also, critically, on the dryness of our forests and grasslands and how extreme the temperatures and winds are. Increasingly, severe fires and the longer fire seasons that we are experiencing are consistent with the drier and hotter conditions that are already occurring and are expected to continue to increase in severity because of global warming. This underlines the urgency of reducing our use and mining of coal, gas and oil. Protecting people, homes, property and our precious natural heritage in a hotter, drier climate is a massive challenge. It is not going to be met by relying on simplistic solutions of more planned burns. We welcome the call for greater research, including acknowledging the contribution of climate change in determining how we respond.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:05):  I rise to speak to today's matter of public importance. There was a national sigh of relief when Tony Abbott was replaced by Malcolm Turnbull. Most Australians gave the new Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt. We were pleased to see the end of Tony Abbott's divisive politics. We hoped that it would mark a turning point on so many critical issues—issues like climate change, getting children out of detention and marriage equality—that we would finally be able to transition our economy and set ourselves up for those industries of the future—




Senator Bernardi:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. It is appropriate for the honourable senator to refer to members in the other place by either an appropriate title or with the prefix of 'Mr'.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Thank you, Senator Bernardi. I am sure that Senator Di Natale will take note of that.




Senator DI NATALE:
  We hoped that Prime Minister Turnbull would help transition our economy to set ourselves up for those industries of the future and that we would end the attacks on the poor, the sick and the unemployed—on ordinary working people. But here we are, only months out from an election, and very little has changed.


With each week that passes, it is becoming more and more apparent that this Prime Minister lacks the courage and the vision so desperately needed to stand up against some of the dinosaurs inside his own party, that he fails to act with the courage and conviction that is so desperately needed to ensure that his beliefs and priorities prevail over the dinosaurs of his party.


Let's start with the issue that will define this election: catastrophic global warming. Here we are, in January, the middle of summer, and we have seen extreme weather: bushfires in Victoria, in South Australia, in Western Australia and now in the World Heritage area of the precious wilderness between Cradle Mountain and the Walls of Jerusalem. At Lake Bill we are seeing an ecosystem never before exposed to fires, with species being wiped out. We are seeing pencil pines and cushion plans that will be destroyed by these fires—the loss of some of the most precious biodiversity anywhere in the world. In Queensland the Great Barrier Reef is on track for a catastrophic bleaching event. We are seeing the impacts of climate change right now in this country and we must act.


We are seeing the health impacts of climate change manifest themselves right around the world with the spread of vector borne diseases, and there are alarm bells now with the Zika virus, something that we know will be vulnerable to changing temperature and those vectors that will increase their spread. We already know that in northern Australia the mosquito that carries that virus has the potential to spread with catastrophic climate change.


But this is not just an issue about the impacts of climate change on the environment, health and our social systems; it is also an issue of how we manage to transition our economy from those polluting sources of the past to those industries of the future. The Prime Minister talks a lot about innovation. He talks a lot about being flexible, agile and nimble. But, when it comes to global warming, there is absolutely no commitment to innovation, flexibility or agility.


I was in Paris, where I saw the Prime Minister and indeed the Minister for Foreign Affairs defend Tony Abbott's pathetic emission reduction targets, making us the laughingstock of the world. He is still committed to taking the axe to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, two agencies that are driving innovation in the renewable energy space. Just today we saw the commitment to open up new coalmines: again there was the huge, polluting coalmine in the Galilee Basin, something for which Senator Larissa Waters has been a champion to try to protect that precious community and environment and to prevent the impacts of catastrophic global warming.


Why is Prime Minister Turnbull backing the opening up of that coalmine? Why is he committed to abolishing those agencies that are driving investment in renewable energy? It is because he lacks the courage and vision to take us on a different path. It requires vision to understand the opportunities that are opening up before us if we embrace the renewable energy revolution. It requires courage to stand up to those industries that are fighting for the status quo, that are holding us back, that incidentally are huge donors to both the coalition and the Labor Party—those industries of the past that are holding back the industries of the future.


On the issue of people seeking asylum in this country—innocent people fleeing persecution, seeking our protection and seeking refuge in Australia—just today we learned of the High Court's decision. But this is not a legal question; this is a moral question, and it can never be acceptable, regardless of the problem, to have a solution that locks up young children who are innocent, causing them tremendous grief and suffering, forcing them to self-harm and damaging those people's lives permanently. And here we are, with Malcolm Turnbull facing a decision about whether he will deport children who are born here in Australia to that system of offshore detention camps to continue to inflict that suffering on vulnerable people. So far, the signs on that issue are not good.


On marriage equality, a question of ending prejudice and discrimination, we now see the farce that is the plebiscite that this government is committed to. Even members of that government say they will not stand by the decision of the Australian people. Let's not have a plebiscite. Let's have a vote, let's do it now and let's end prejudice and discrimination in marriage once and for all.


On the question of the republic, a person who says that this is his life's work, who has campaigned on an issue that defined his entry into politics, is now vacating the space, saying that it is up to the Australian people to lead the charge. We have three leaders of our main political parties in this country who are committed to a republic. It is not the fault of the Australian people that we do not have a timetable towards a republic; it is a failure of leadership. And this nonsense that we need to wait until the reign of the Queen is over: that is the point. The point of a republic is that we make our decisions independent of the monarchy.


We have now a debate around tax reform in this nation—a debate that is about what it means to live in a civilised society: investing in health care, investing in education, investing in the social safety net and ensuring that we look after people who are vulnerable. We have the opportunity to do that by ending unfair tax breaks and ensuring that tax reform starts at the top and not at the bottom, and yet here is a government committed to raising the GST because it wants to protect its mates at the big end of town and would rather go after those people on low and middle incomes, further increasing this huge and growing gap between the haves and have-nots in Australian society, between the super-rich and those people who are struggling. The issue of tax reform is not some dry economic debate about whether we can balance the budget; it is about the society we want and whether we are prepared to live with the growing inequality that has become a major problem within Australian society.


It is a debate around getting our investment setting right so that we do not continue to give preferential tax treatment to the property sector and the mining sector and that we drive the innovation that is so desperately necessary in advanced manufacturing, in the renewable economy, in the health sector, in the education sector and in being a service based economy, which is where our future lies.



So it is an election about courage and vision, and the Greens have laid out an optimistic, forward-looking road map for how to transition Australia from an old economy to a modern, prosperous, confident 21st century Australia. Just last year we launched our plan, a detailed blueprint to renew Australia—to have 90 per cent renewable energy by 2030, generating jobs and investment in this country; to end the system of offshore detention and to have a much more humane way to look after innocent people who are seeking our protection; to deliver marriage equality and to deliver it now; and to ensure that, when it comes to raising revenue, tax reform starts at the top rather than the bottom. We want a corruption commission, a corruption watchdog, rather than targeting one sector of society. We have been courageous. We have been visionary. We have provided the leadership in this country that is so desperately lacking from this government, and we will do that right up until the next election. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2016-02-03,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (16:16):  I look forward to this MPI debate put forward by the Greens here: 'The Turnbull government's lack of courage on matters of importance to everyday Australians.' One of the tragedies we have just seen in many states is the fires through the summer in Western Australia and South Australia, where I grew up, from Pinery through to Mallala through to the Freeling area et cetera. Senator Di Natale talks about the fires in Tasmania. I have warned them; I have told them; I have moved motions in this place: when you lock up country and you leave it and you do not manage it, you are going to get savage fires. Look at Tasmania: six million hectares, 52 per cent, locked up. You are not allowed to graze it. No. Just let the fuel levels grow and grow. Once you get more than five to 10 tonnes a hectare, a 40-degree day and a 50-kilometre wind, you are out of control. It will happen in the red gum forests down in Deniliquin. There is nothing surer. They have now prevented grazing. They managed it for 100 years. The truth may affect some over there. They do not like it. If you lock up the country and you leave it and you will not reduce the fuel levels, that is what you are going to get. 'Oh no; we can't allow grazing. The cattle and sheep have got hard hooves on their feet.' It is all right to have the brumbies, the deer, the wild pigs, the goats—you name it. They do not run around in ugg boots, but it is all right for those to graze there. But do not control-graze the national parks.


I would like to put a question to the Greens. How many of you have actually fought a bushfire? How many of you have been out there with a knapsack, with a shovel, on a fire truck? Put your hands up. Have you ever been to a fire? Thank you, Senator Lines; I was referring to the Greens. Mr Acting Deputy President Back, you and I have been to plenty. Good on you, Senator Siewert. But get out there amongst those savage fires and have a look at what they are doing. When fuel levels get up, the fires are that hot they get into the crowns of the trees and kill the trees. They travel so fast the animals have no time to escape. I am very pleased—I often put it on my Facebook—that there are koalas at our farm, in the front garden and down the creek, and they are safe. They will not burn, because we graze the country around and we keep the fuel levels down. They are protected. I have done my share of firefighting, especially when I lived in South Australia for the first 25 years of my life. Until you learn this, you are going to destroy the environment. You are going to lock up country and leave it. The National Parks Association are pursuing their agenda right around the nation: lock up more country and leave it; do not graze it; do not keep the fuel levels down. If there are not enough resources for hazard reduction burning, this is what you are going to get every seven, eight or 10 years: savage fires destroying the environment. One day, when it is all destroyed, you will learn and you will listen. Until you get on board with this, you are doing the wrong thing—100 per cent.


Let us talk about marriage equality. Two men married will never be the same as a man and a woman. There will never be equality. They cannot have children, for a start, so they will never be equal. But what I really endorse is equal respect, equal rights—



Senator Di Natale interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Get another tune. When we have the plebiscite, if it is voted down are you going to drop your agenda? No, you will not drop your agenda if it is voted down. Are you going to do what the people want if it is voted down? Of course you will not. You will pursue your issues.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Through the chair, Senator Williams.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  My sincere apologies, Mr Acting Deputy President. 


Let me turn to the global warming debate. What do we produce—1.3 or 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions? It is quite amazing. China just did some figures. They made a mistake about the coal they burnt last year. They actually burnt 17 per cent more than they calculated for. The 17 per cent more they burnt—now they have done their figures again—put out more CO2 than the whole of Australia does in a year. That is just through their one error of burning more coal. China is actually a net exporter of coal, a lot of it of very poor quality, of course. But is bringing in a carbon tax, as we saw the Labor Party and the Greens do before, going to save our nation? We could shut down all emissions in Australia, but, unless the big emitters act, it is not going to make one ounce of difference. We do not have a tent over our country. We actually are linked to the globe. And yet you expect us to suffer all of the financial pain. That is what those opposite want to do going to the next election. They will bring back the emissions trading scheme, the carbon tax: 'We'll bill you like we did before, and we'll save the planet.' No. The emissions are going up. You need to get those big emitters to actually do their bit.


I commend the Turnbull government for the way they have progressed trade agreements around the world—great for agriculture, great for regional and rural Australia. I put a question to Senator Sinodinos today about the some 180 countries that are now dropping their export subsidies. We have seen America for decades with their Export Enhancement Program. You would be well aware of it, Mr Acting Deputy President Back—how they are taking our wheat market. They are subsidising their product into markets that traditionally we would hold and taking away our markets. They are gone. What is happening with the free trade agreements? Our exports into South Korea are increasing enormously for wine, grapes, almonds and all sorts of nuts. Beef exports to Japan have gone up by 24 per cent in 12 months alone. And now we see record beef prices coming to people out there in the rural areas. I remember 15 years ago cattle hit $2 a kilo live weight. Eighteen months ago they were $1.60. Who else in Australia had a 40 per cent reduction in their wage from 15 years ago? No-one. But now we have got it right. Congratulations to the government, to Minister Barnaby Joyce and especially to Trade Minister Andrew Robb for the great work they have done.


This is a farcical matter of public importance from the Greens. This is leading with their chin. I am sure more will have plenty to say. If we went down the Greens' road, we would just go broke and we would destroy the environment anyway.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2016-02-03,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:22):  I too rise to speak in support of this MPI. If we needed any confirmation that Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull were the same, it came in question time today when Senator Brandis confirmed the Turnbull government was on exactly the same path as the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott. The same wrong, misguided policies which have hurt ordinary Australians under the prime ministership of Mr Abbott and will continue to hurt ordinary Australians under the prime ministership of Mr Turnbull. Whether those Australians are young or old, working or pensioners, almost no-one is spared, except, of course, the big end of town. Wasn't this one of the reasons why Mr Abbott was deposed—that he had lost touch with ordinary Australians and that his first budget was way too harsh? And yet, if we needed that confirmation from Senator Brandis that Mr Turnbull was on exactly the same track, it came unequivocally during question time today.


Let us have a look at what is happening here. There is an attack on workers in Australia and on penalty rates. In fact, Senator Cash confirmed on Monday in the media that penalty rates were a part of the agenda. The Turnbull government has confirmed that they want to take penalty rates away from working Australians. Why would you do that? Why would you reduce the take-home pay of a group of workers who are already low paid? Complete nonsense. Why do they want to do that? Because they are on the side of the employers. Because John Hart from Restaurant and Catering Australia is their good friend. He was on a working committee that Mr Abbott proposed and put up, and I am sure he is still on that committee. He has the ear of Mr Turnbull and has said, 'Penalty rates have got to go.' That affects, by 30 per cent, the take-home pay of those workers. Those opposite have no idea over there because they always mix with the big end of town.


Industry super: one of the first things the government did in a little side deal with the crossbenchers was to let the leading employers—again, their mates—off the hook to freeze superannuation contributions. And how short-sighted was that? Because that affects people's retirement incomes. That affects how much money people have to retire on. And who will have to pick up the shortfall? The government of the day. But it does not bother the government because again they were looking after their employer mates at the big end of town. They said, 'Sure, we will save that money.' It was farcical to say that somehow those savings would end up in workers' pockets. Well, of course it has not. It stayed in the boss's pockets—wining and dining and Liberal Party donors, no doubt.


We see today that this bill is back here, watering down industrial relations laws. Never mind that the government have said, 'Work Choices is dead, buried and cremated.' It is not. It is sneaking into this place under another name. These industrial laws in the bill before the parliament will again make it easier for employers to reduce the working conditions and trade off entitlements. Under the Turnbull government's proposal, you can trade a pizza for a penalty rate. What a disgrace. They want to take weekend penalty rates, reducing income from about 30 per cent, and now they want to be able to do little side deals. Let me tell you, when the employer sits down with a low-paid worker, it is not even playing field and that is why you need strong unions in this country—so that workers have a proper voice and proper representation.


But the attack does not stop on workers. The attack is on pensioners. The Greens have got a responsibility here, because in a dirty deal with the government they have cut part pensions. The Greens said that was knocking off high-paid people. Well, it is not, because in a few years time down the track again—absolutely short-sighted, it shows that the Greens are still on the L plates when it comes to the economy—it will hurt middle Australians. And again, who will have to rescue them? It will be the government of the day having to try and find money to prop up pensions, because the part pension decision that the Greens made with the government will hurt ordinary Australians into the future. The facts are there for all to see.


Yes, we want to increase the pension age to 70. Again it shows how out-of-touch the Turnbull government is; they have never met a builder's labourer or a cleaner. They have probably never seen the people who clean their offices—the invisible workers. Imagine saying to those cleaners that they are going to be carting heavy things, they are going to be vacuuming floors and they are going to be scrubbing and polishing until you are 70—how out of touch is that? It is an absurd suggestion for people who do manual work in this country to work until they are 70. If you choose to work that long, good on you, but to actually make it a condition is a disgrace and it shows once again how out of touch those opposite are.


Let us have a look at the attacks on young people, another group. We have got workers, pensioners, and now we have got young people. The government want to punish young people who cannot get a job. The unemployment rate in Western Australia has gone sky-high, partly due to the absolute mismanagement by Colin Barnett and finally the West Australian is even attacking him. This bloke could not manage his way out of a brown paper bag. We have record-high youth unemployment, and what does the Turnbull government want to do? It want to make those people go without money. First of all they had a suggestion of six months. It is now down to six weeks. They think somehow that mum and dad can just stump up for looking after that young person who, through no fault of their own, cannot get a job. But, of course, they do not believe that. They think young people are lazy. In fact, they have said that young people lie on the sofa playing with their Xbox—again, totally out of touch. It is very difficult in Western Australia to get a job. And remember, if you get a job, the Turnbull government are the people who want to take your penalty rates away. If you get a job, and you are on junior wages, you are not going to be paid very much at all. Thank you to the Turnbull government!


Of course, for those young people who want to go on to universities, the Parliamentary Budget Office confirmed today that the $100,000 degrees are still there. They want to burden young people with $100,000 of debt—imagine that. It is unimaginable if you are a 17 or an 18-year-old entering university that you are going to have to carry that debt. In fact, I think government ministers under Mr Turnbull have said, 'It is just shelved.' Well, they are still there—$100,000 degrees. So, if you are unemployed or you want to go to university and you are a young person, forget about support from the Turnbull government.


Then there are the attacks on families. There are the cuts to family payments that they want to put through. What about their parental leave proposition? Remember the imaginative too expensive scheme that Mr Abbott put forward that would massively advantage people on high incomes—again, their mates—leaving ordinary Australians worse off? Well, that got scrapped. His backbenchers revolted. Under Mr Turnbull we have had people accused of being double dippers: women who get some maternity leave from the workplace and then are topped up by Labor's scheme—Labor introduced the paid parental scheme. We are now seeing that being watered down so women who want to return to the workforce will be forced to go back much sooner because they will be worse off, so they are hit with family payments and they are hit because the Turnbull government has taken away their paid parental leave—and that is their intention.


Almost from day one the Abbott-Turnbull government attacked Medicare. Again today the Parliamentary Budget Office confirmed there will be more hits to Medicare through pharmaceutical benefits. That is where they want to go next. It is bad enough that they are now forcing most people to pay up-front for pathology and radiography services—and they do not come as single items. Women with breast cancer and women who require Pap smears: that is who they are continuing to disadvantage.


Climate change: again today it was confirmed that for the first time in 10 years our greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise. Their failed payoff to the big end of town, their failed direct action policy—there is the proof: greenhouse gas emissions are rising in Australia for the first time in 10 years.


What about employers? We have seen what they want to do on super. Under the Turnbull government they give the big banks access to workers' funds to try to water down boards and then in the latest move we have a five per cent failure rate on contributions. What do we see? We see the minister wanting to reduce penalties to give employers a way out when they do not pay workers' entitlements on super. It is very clear who the Turnbull government stand for: it is the big end of town.

"Wang, Sen Zhenya",PUP,2016-02-03,"



Senator WANG
 (Western Australia) (16:32):  Proposals for a national integrity or anticorruption agency in Australia date back to the 1980s. At first they had been quietly repeatedly rejected by the party political duopoly that runs this country. A decade ago a joint study by Griffith University and Transparency International Australia recommended 'a new independent statutory authority to be tasked as a comprehensive lead agency for investigation and prevention of official corruption, criminal activity and serious misconduct involving Commonwealth officials', including, sadly, members of parliament. Transparency International Australia also called for a national anticorruption body after claims of corruption in Centrelink leases in 2013. The government itself has also spent the past few years talking about the need for a corruption watchdog and I acknowledge members of all political parties who have advocated publicly or privately for such an agency.


Meanwhile, Australia's international reputation for being relatively corruption free is waning—dropping from a global ranking of the seventh least corrupt nation 20 years ago to the 13th, ranking behind countries like Canada, New Zealand and Singapore in the Transparency International Australia 2015 corruption perceptions index. Similarly, Hong Kong was known as one of the most corrupt places on Earth 50 years ago but within five years of the start of its Independent Commission Against Corruption all overt and syndicated corruption was eradicated and Hong Kong is now regarded as one of the most corruption free societies in the world. The Hong Kong ICAC was among the world's first to effectively enforce protection against private sector corruption and is an active partner in promoting international cooperation.


Given the very important work done by our own agencies—ICAC, for example—it is not easy to believe that corruption does not exist in governments and parliaments in this country. Add this to an era in which we are corporatizing all of our government institutions and there is overwhelming evidence at hand to show that now is the time for bipartisan support for a national integrity watchdog. Domestic experience and international best practice models have shown that political leaders must forge broad political coalitions that can endure organised opposition if they hope to prevent systematic corruption. As such I call on the government and the opposition to reflect the will of the wider Australian public— (Time expired)

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:35):  Before I address the grab bag of demands from the Greens and the Labor Party I do want to express my sentiment with Senator Wang in the sense that you would have to be naive to think that elements of corruption and misuse by public officials do not take place in parliaments across Australia. As evidence I ask Senator Wang to have a close look at Mr Clive Palmer. Mr Clive Palmer, who of course is the leader of the Palmer United Party, said in the media just the other day that his companies—and one of them is now in administration—received good value for their millions of dollars in donations to the Palmer United Party because of the Palmer United Party's decision to support the abolition of the carbon tax. That to me is a tantamount admission that that money bought results from a political party. If that is not corruption, it is very close to it, Senator Wang. I understand completely your desire to stamp out corruption and crookedness. I support you in that, but the pot is calling the kettle a little bit black unless you acknowledge the transgressions of Mr Palmer in this space.


Now let me return to the grab bag of demands and grievances. It is like national grievance day in here. We had Senator Di Natale standing up talking about the virus de jure, the Zika virus. Last year it was Ebola and this year it is the Zika virus. Then he talked about catastrophic global warming while North America is suffering under metres of snow. We are finding them talking down the Great Barrier Reef, one of the great assets of Australia's tourism industry. Rather than talking it down, they should be talking it up and getting as many tourists to go there as they possibly can—but on and on we go. It is about more demands for more money, more government control and more intervention in the economy. The Greens know best and they are ably supported by the Labor Party.


We heard Senator Lines with her grab bag of demands as well. One of the things Senator Lines said was not lost on me. She suggested, in some way, shape or form, that the coalition were intent on doing deals with big business to disadvantage workers. I think Senator Lines got a little bit confused. I think Senator Lines was confusing the evidence from the trade union royal commission and the slush funds that were given to Mr Shorten and his union in exchange for trading-off worker benefits. That is the documented evidence, yet Senator Lines dares to come in here and say that this side of the chamber is not working to advantage workers. Nothing could be further from the truth.


If we want to get ourselves out of the problems that were created by those on the opposite side, including their colleagues the Greens—which are that the country is now mired in debt, our growth is stagnating and we have higher unemployment—we need to grow our economy. We need to cut the size of government, we need to lower taxes and we need to grow our economy, because that is the only way we will provide more jobs for more Australians. It is the only way we will be able to export competitively. It is the only way we will be able to sustain a strong and healthy safety net in this country without restricting or deflating our economy under the yolk of heavy burdensome taxes, and the coalition government has a plan for exactly that.


We want to get the government out of people's lives as much as possible. We want to be there to support them when they are desperately in need; give them a hand up and lift them, so that together everyone in this country can avail themselves of the opportunities. But you do not do that by reducing the businesses that are going to provide those jobs. You do not do that by making government bigger. Government is an imposition on our economy. Government only has money to spend that it takes from other people or that it borrows from future generations. That is what is lost. With all these big spending promises—the billions here, the $10 billion there, the unfunded Gonskis and whatever else they want to go with—they are robbing from future generations, because that money has to be paid back.


What a dark day it was when Mr Rudd became Prime Minister of this country. There was no net debt in this country. When Mr Rudd finished as Prime Minister of this country there were hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of debt. It is a trajectory that we have not been able to arrest because of the intransigence of this place and because of the pie-eyed wish list we have heard so much about today.


We have to confront reality in this country, and the reality is that we need more people working. We need more people paying taxes. We need to grow our economy. And the best way to do that is to get government out of the way. Let us encourage our tourism industry by talking up the Great Barrier Reef and its great benefits. Let us talk up our manufacturing industries—what is left of them—by saying we can produce top quality at a competitive price, because people are prepared to pay for quality. Let us talk up our export industry, not by demonising coal but by celebrating the fact that it provides cheap, effective and efficient fuel to billions of people across the globe to lift them out of poverty by providing them with electricity. Let us celebrate our iron ore exporters as people that are generating tens of billions of dollars' worth of revenue for this country and taking huge risks along the way. Let us continue to celebrate success rather than try and make government the centre and the focus of it all—

  I note Senator Cameron talks about people not paying tax. You know what, Senator Cameron—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—yes, we want people to pay a fair share of tax but they are complying right now with our existing tax laws. If you do not like it, do not put the tax rates up, change the laws to prevent the loopholes. That is the simple way to do it. Those on the other side will never do that, because they hate industry.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:42):  What a contribution we had there. It was not a contribution that sought to defend his government. We know he is a bit lacklustre in his support of the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull. He may be right; quite frankly, it is a different salesman but it is absolutely the same policies. Senator Bernardi talked about how this government is all about helping Australians. What this government did when they first got in was demonise Australians by calling them 'leaners'. They came out with the most appalling first budget of 2014 that saw off Prime Minister Abbott and saw poor old Mr Hockey's career down the drain.


That happened because there was no honesty in the Abbott campaign. There was no honesty in the Abbott campaign that saw them come to government. They did say that they were not going to cut health, education and the ABC. They did say there were on a unity ticket with Gonski. But unfortunately, with the change of Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull has shown a lack of courage in the face of ultraconservative elements in the coalition party room. It really should come as no surprise that his government have also failed to show any courage. They have failed to show courage on the issues that matter to Australians, on the matters that shape the lives of individuals, families and communities across this country.


All these Australians ask is some honesty in this government. They never saw it under Mr Abbott. They expected to see it under Mr Turnbull, but that has not come. That has not come. We hear it each and every day from the ministers of this government: 'Nothing has changed. Our policies are the same. Nothing has changed under this government.' So Australians should be disappointed, and they are disappointed. They are disappointed that this new Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, has not come in here and tried to put some honesty back into the election commitments that this government gave.


The Turnbull government has shown that it is no better than the Abbott government, adopting the same cuts and out-of-touch policies. In fact, in many cases, unfortunately, the Turnbull government is now going further. Just before Christmas, the Turnbull government ripped a further $2.1 billion out of health by slashing bulk-billing for diagnostic imaging and pathology.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Nonsense!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  It is not nonsense, Senator O'Sullivan. It is not nonsense. Get out there. Listen. Listen to the people who use pathology. Listen to the sector. It is not nonsense. This is what you did. You have ripped $2.1 billion out of diagnostic imaging and pathology, and you are gutting crucial health workforce training programs. That is what is happening out there. I know you have been away; you might not have caught up. But that is what is happening.


That cut just builds on the $60 billion in health cuts—health cuts they said they would not do—made by the Abbott government, cuts which have been gleefully adopted by the Turnbull government. It is clear that, regardless of who the leader of the coalition is, our health system is at risk under the coalition. Our hospitals are at risk under the coalition. Patients are at risk under the coalition. And, under the coalition, Medicare will always be at risk because the Liberal government believe that your access to quality health care should be determined by your ability to pay.


The Liberal government would also happily see your ability to pay determine your access to education. Before the election, again, it was 'no cuts to education', a 'unity ticket' on Gonski, but what we saw when they came into government was $30 billion ripped from our schools. Different salesman, same policies. (Time expired)

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:47):  I am pleased to contribute to today's debate on the Turnbull government's lack of courage on matters of importance to everyday Australians. Yesterday, with Senator Xenophon, I co-sponsored a motion that called for an inquiry into bullying within the Australian medical profession. This motion was passed by the Senate, and I applaud Senator Xenophon for his work on this important issue.


I was pleased to stand beside him because of the actions of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency against the small number of doctors who are treating patients in Australia presenting with Lyme disease—or, as referred to in this place, a Lyme-like illness. Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Baggoley told the Senate hearing last year that the Department of Health and the Medical Board of Australia did not support a policy of warning off doctors from treating patients with suspected Lyme disease. Professor Baggoley said AHPRA did not have an official position on Lyme disease, and it was not its role to adjudicate treatment of the condition.


But this is not true. Seven doctors treating patients for Lyme disease have been or are currently being bullied and harassed out of their profession. Camberwell doctor Geoffrey Kemp, a GP of more than 40 years experience, has treated more than 350 patients for Lyme symptoms and is now unable to continue because of severe—some would say outrageous—restrictions on his practice. These include being only allowed to work in a group practice approved in advance by the Medical Board of Australia, not using homeopathic medicine, not practising without a workplace supervisor who is approved in advance by the board and submitting to a fortnightly audit of his patients' files. AHPRA's campaign against Dr Kemp commenced mid last year but reached a climax in December with a formal hearing at the disruptive time of just before the Christmas holiday break.


I call on the Minister for Health, Sussan Ley, to rein in her AHPRA attack dog. I call on the government to insist that AHPRA immediately stop targeting doctors treating patients with Lyme disease. This campaign of harassment and bullying is creating medical refugees out of thousands of sick Australians who now cannot obtain treatment or who must go overseas to do so. I put on the record my enthusiasm for the forthcoming Senate inquiries into both the prevalence of Lyme-like illness in Australia and bullying in the medical profession.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2016-02-03,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (16:50):  I do not want to make a practice of this, but I do have to open today, in the interests of transparency, with a confession. My confession is that I do not often get excited by anything that the Greens party says, but today I simply could not believe it when they wanted to invite a debate with my government on the question of courage. Here we have an antijobs, anti-industry, anti-employee, antidevelopment party that wants to have a discussion with the Turnbull government on the question of courage. Well, I can tell you: we are up to it, so sit up, kick your shoes off and have a listen.


It took a lot of courage to implement policies in this nation to increase jobs—last year, under the coalition, over 300,000 new jobs. That is in the face of a party that wants to have a discussion about courage—an antijobs party, a party that publishes on its own website that in the next five years it wants to get rid of the hundreds of thousands of jobs in the coal industry, wiping places like Central Queensland, Mackay, Rockhampton and Gladstone off the face of the map without any regard to the hundreds of thousands of families and the economies of all of those communities. So I am happy to have a discussion with you about courage in relation to that. Sixty per cent of the jobs that were created by us last year were full-time jobs—180,000 jobs. That is 180,000, probably, mums and dads and other forms of family structures around the country who now have a better standard of living because our government has had the courage to implement those decisions and those policies that are job-creating. So I am happy to talk to you about courage there.


I am also happy to have a discussion with you about courage when you are a pro unlawful immigration party. You actually promote unlawful immigration. So if you want to talk about courage, there is the courage of our government to stop the boats, to save the 1,200 deaths on the high seas—a fact you have never mentioned. I have been here two years and not once have the Greens and Labor made reference to the fact of that terrible loss of life. Under our government, under the courage it takes to stop the boats, not one death on the high seas. So if you want to talk about courage, I am happy to talk about courage. 


Let's talk about courage with children in detention—1,992 children were in detention under the Greens and Labor. We have had the courage to reduce that, to put in place policies and measures to reduce that now to fewer than 100. They are the sorts of things that take courage if you want to have a discussion.


We have committed, in somewhat difficult financial times, to a $50 billion infrastructure plan. That is over three times the commitment to the Snowy River scheme, in difficult economic circumstances. We have got the courage to go ahead and do it. We have got the people who are going to manage the economy to make sure that we deliver on it. That is courage if you want to have a talk about courage.


If you want to talk about courage: the development of northern Australia. This is the place where you want work practices to change, where you want things in the agricultural industry to change to make it almost unviable. This is the place where you, with the Labor Party, wiped off hundreds of millions of dollars of value across family farms and enterprises right across northern Australia and brought a billion dollar industry to its knees in less than one hour. You want to talk about courage, I will tell you what courage is: to restore that industry. Courage is to bring it back from death's door, as we have done, as this government have done in our term and restore it to where it is now—an absolutely viable industry, allowing some of those people to have survived.


I am happy to talk to you about courage today and any other day. It was a mistake for you to put the word 'courage' in your motion. If you want to talk about courage, it takes courage for a country under this government to go ahead and finalise three major trade agreements and the TPP when you and the Greens for seven years resisted it. It has increased—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I know you don't like to hear this. It has increased the value of agricultural exports by 29 per cent—over $10 billion. So now we have thousands of families, my heart constituency, who are far better off living in northern Australia and right across agricultural sector. This year alone, we have had a 29 per cent increase in the volume of agricultural exports in certain classes. Barley, canola and chickpeas are all up. Chickpeas are up 39 per cent. It takes courage for a government to fast-track and enter into those relations to make sure that they produce a deal that is in the interests of their country.


It would be unfair if I did not mention the fact that our friends in the Greens party also have courage. It takes courage to mislead the Australian people on the impacts of climate change, to frighten people so it impacts on their business plans. It takes courage to mislead the Australian people on kangaroo populations to a point where it makes it difficult for us to get the kangaroo harvesting industry up and going. It would provide 4,000 jobs in the bush and over a hundred million dollar boost in to economies and communities all across western Queensland, New South Wales and a little bit of Victoria. It takes courage to come out and say you are going to destroy the coalmining industry and all the tens and tens and tens of thousands of jobs and the knock-on jobs for families that that will have. 


It takes courage to go to the Australian people and tell them you are going to advocate the introduction of death duties—if you ever find your way into a position to be able to do it. It takes courage to elevate policy positions that will destroy economies and economic activities in rural communities in your antijobs and antidevelopment approach.


In closing, any time, any place, here or outside, that you want to have a debate with this government about what we have done and what you have not done, make sure you plant the word 'courage' fairly in the sentence and make the job of turning you down as easy as it has been. Thank you for the opportunity.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:57):  Welcome back, Senator O'Farrell. I trust your sojourn in New York was—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Senator O'Sullivan it is.




Senator GALLACHER:
  Yes, Senator O'Sullivan. Anyway, you did well in New York by the sound of it. The courage that I want to talk about is the courage of conviction. I think that that is what the matter of public importance is about today:


The Turnbull government's lack of courage on matters of importance to everyday Australians. 


That is the courage of our convictions. Someone told me, 'The art of politics is achieving what is possible.' I suppose that that is probably correct, but most of us in this place have convictions. Most of us have the courage of our convictions and we will not easily be dissuaded from that conviction. 


However, if you knew nothing about the Prime Minister, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, and you googled him, you would find out that he was the leader of the Australian Republican Movement for seven years. I imagine that in seven years you would have an irrevocable conviction that there should be an Australian republic and that if you ever got in a position where you could actually influence that outcome—that is, being the Prime Minister—you would probably not walk away from that conviction. But it appears as if the current Prime Minister has walked away from his conviction that Australia should be a republic. He has not been at the forefront of that debate. He has not initiated any initiatives that would bring that closer, despite the fact for seven years he was the leader and was publicly out and about seeking an Australian republic.


If you wikipediaed 'the honourable Prime Minister Turnbull' you would probably come up with a whole lot of stuff on climate change. Climate change was in his DNA until it threatened his opportunity to occupy the Lodge. It was there. He was on the front foot. He was leading with conviction, until two things happened. The first thing was that he was done in as opposition leader and the second thing was that he was able to get the Lodge. It would appear that the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull does not have the courage of his convictions in respect to two very important matters that you cannot move around Australia without talking to everyday voters about. Climate change and the Australian republic are well worn paths. People in the street want to know where you stand on those two issues. You could have been mistaken for thinking you knew where the honourable Prime Minister Turnbull stood with conviction on climate change and the republic. However, he has been able to walk away from that conviction.


The other issue which is gaining some publicity is marriage equality. Before he became Prime Minister, he was out there advocating one position, but as soon as he became Prime Minister he adopted the Hon. Tony Abbott's position. So on three quite easily distinguishable, recognisable policies he has not had the courage of his convictions.


I will put on the record a quote from the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull on Meet the Press on 4 October 2009:


I mean, Tony thought he was going to go to an election and he'd be saying ""great big tax"" and Kevin Rudd would be saying ""save the planet"" but instead Rudd just walked away from it and looked like a man who believed in nothing and his support - as Rudd himself confesses and Howard said - his support just fell off a cliff, because people, Kerry, in politics, the public, will forgive you for a certain amount of incompetence. You don't want to stretch their patience on that. But they will never forgive you if you are seen to believe in nothing.


   …   …   …


Because if you believe in nothing why are you there?


So if he has abandoned his convictions on these three basic items, why is it not abundantly apparent to all that he has traded his convictions for the job? If you want to have a look at convictions, start with the alphabet: Abbott, Abetz, Andrews, go on to Bernardi. They never lack the courage of their convictions; their positions are always out there. I do not agree with them, but at least you can hear and understand them. (Time expired)

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:02):  I rise to contribute to today's matter of public importance, whose subject is the Turnbull government's lack of courage on matters of importance to everyday Australians.


I have to agree that up to today the Turnbull government has displayed a lack of courage to many issues of importance to everyday Australians, but I make this point: it can change. I have just had a meeting with the PM and I have taken to him some very important issues, including the plight of SAS soldier Evan Donaldson and former Army officer Marcus Saltmarsh. I thank him for the time he gave to me today. Talking to him is always pleasant. He is a very good listener and talker, but it is actions that I judge him by.


With reference to the harm and damage that have been clearly done to Evan Donaldson and Marcus Saltmarsh, the PM has agreed to support genuine mediation processes for those gentlemen. I can only hope that that happens extremely quickly. That would be the best and easiest way of ensuring they are compensated for the incredible harm they have suffered for 7 years and 16 years, respectively.


I also spoke to the PM about the $650 million of Medicare cuts. He did not promise to lift them but he did promise to speak with Tasmanian medical scientist Richard Hanlon who warned about the $30 pap smears Australian women are faced with if the Liberals' cuts to Medicare go ahead. I hope the PM shows common sense and courage and abandons the cruel Liberal cuts to women's cancer checks and Medicare bulk-billing.


 Other areas where this government can show some courage is to stop their freeze on federal assistance grants, grants the rural and regional local governments of Australia are heavily reliant on. These assistance grants are central to a council's budget and are intended to help build and maintain roads. Why did the coalition freeze these grants? As if rural Australians were not struggling enough, now their rates have increased. With rates at an all-time high, families will be incapable of achieving the Australian dream and own their own home.


That leads me to the Tasmanian municipality of King Island, an island that relies heavily on exporting its produce. Within 12 months their only shipping service will be taken out of the game, and neither the federal or state Liberal governments will contribute the necessary $60 million to upgrade the deepwater port at Grassy to ensure King Island. Without this upgrade, King Island will not be able to continue to export its world renowned products. Every person on King Island is crying out for help, but the Turnbull government and the Hodgman government have ignored their desperate pleas.


Now let us talk about Tasmania's public health system. My state is in the grip of an extreme health crisis, but the state Liberal government has no feasible plan to nurse the system back to health. In fact, the state Liberal government plans on reducing the number of hospital beds and medical staff instead of providing a much needed increase. The hospitals are operating at more than 100 per cent capacity, and Tasmania already lags behind the national average on bed numbers. Tasmania needs a further 150 beds to service its population. Only last week, The Mercury reported that a 95-year-old woman was left vomiting for hours on the floor of the Royal Hobart Hospital because there were no available beds. This woman had nothing but a blanket to lie on. It is not the fault of the healthcare workers. Tasmania's hospital staff are wonderful, highly skilled people. They simply do not have the resources. To make matters worse, Tasmanians are already waiting four times longer for elective surgery than any other Australian and are dying between one and two years earlier, on average, than their mainland counterparts. The only way to save the Tasmanian health system is to start by opening another 150 beds and, in the long term, place a third, fully serviced, hospital on the north-west coast. In the meantime, I ask the Minister for Health, Susan Ley, to stop making the health crisis in Tasmania worse by introducing $650 million worth of cuts to bulk-billing incentives on cancer and diabetes checks, which will mean people will not seek help until it is too late, which can only mean hospitals will be inundated with cases that could have been prevented.

The speech read as follows—



BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL RADIO) BILL 2015


The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2015 will reduce the level of regulatory complexity faced by the radio broadcasting industry by implementing reform in the digital radio regulatory framework, and will facilitate the rollout of digital radio in regional Australia. 


On 8 July 2015, the then Minister for Communications tabled in the Parliament the Digital Radio Report which was prepared by the Department of Communications in response to two statutory reviews on the digital radio framework. 


The report recommended that industry members and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) establish a Digital Radio Planning Committee for Regional Australia to focus on the rollout of digital radio to regional areas where it is commercially feasible to do so. The Planning Committee has now been established and includes key industry stakeholders. It is currently considering the rollout of digital radio in regional areas, and is giving priority to the licensing of permanent digital radio services in Canberra and Darwin.


Another key recommendation in that report was that the Government provide a simpler, more flexible process for the planning and licensing of digital radio in regional Australia. This move is supported by commercial, national and community radio sectors. The Government considers that the commercial radio sector is best placed to determine the areas where digital radio services can be successfully rolled out and the optimal timeframe for doing so. However, the Government can assist by streamlining digital radio planning and licensing processes. 


A licence area's 'digital radio start-up day' is the day on which relevant licensees are authorised to commence providing digital radio services in that licence area. Currently, the ACMA is required to ensure that the digital radio start-up day for a licence area is the day specified in a legislative instrument made by the Minister. It is proposed to remove the requirement for a legislative instrument made by the Minister – effectively removing the role of the Minister and leaving the setting of commencement dates for regional digital radio services to the ACMA. This simpler process is consistent with the Government's regulation reform agenda. In setting the start-up day for a particular licence area, it is expected that the ACMA will take account of industry willingness to invest in the required infrastructure and to provide digital radio services in that area.


The datacasting licence category was intended to encourage the development of new and innovative services which were distinct from traditional broadcasting services. In 2007, the restricted datacasting licence category was introduced to allow service providers to use the digital radio platform to provide information-only or educational programs.


To date, no restricted datacasting licences have been issued by the ACMA. Removing this sub-category of licence will simplify the digital radio regulatory framework across both the Broadcasting Services act and Radiocommunications act, while not preventing the service providers from continuing to offer new and innovative digital radio services to listeners. 


Digital radio has been operating in the five mainland capital cities since 2009. Until 30 June 2015, there was a legislated moratorium on the issuing of any new commercial digital-only radio licences in those markets. This digital radio moratorium period was put in place to provide incumbent commercial radio broadcasters with a level of stability and certainty during the digital radio investment phase.


The six year moratorium period in these metropolitan licence areas has now expired. However, it will commence in regional areas if and when they start digital radio services. The Digital Radio Report found there was not a strong argument for retaining this provision, noting that the protection from competition offered by the six year digital radio moratorium period has not provided sufficient incentive for commercial radio broadcasters to extend digital radio services into regional licence areas. The bill therefore removes the digital radio moratorium period.


Digital radio broadcasters utilise two types of licence: the broadcasting licence which authorises them to provide their broadcasting service, and the 'digital radio multiplex transmitter licence' which licences the shared transmission infrastructure they use. Multiplex licences are allocated in three categories, each authorising a different combination of commercial, national and community digital radio services. Category 3 multiplex licences authorise the transmission of digital national radio broadcasting services and/or national restricted datacasting services and may, essentially, only be held by either or both of the national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS.


These licences currently fall within the definition of 'non-foundation digital radio multiplex transmitter licence' in the Radcomms act. A practical impact of this is that category 3 multiplex licensees (that is, the ABC and SBS) are excluded from applying for renewal of their licence. It is proposed to amend the definition of 'non-foundation digital radio multiplex transmitter licence' in the Radiocommunications act so that it excludes category 3 multiplex licences. This is a technical amendment to address an unintended consequence of the existing drafting.


As digital radio was a developing technology when the digital radio legislative framework was being developed, statutory review provisions were included in both the Broadcasting Services act and the Radiocommunications act. These reviews were aimed at monitoring the regulatory and technological developments of digital radio. As these reviews have been conducted and the report addressing both reviews was tabled in Parliament in July this year, these provisions can be removed from both acts. 


The Government remains committed to streamlining and reforming the digital radio framework in consultation with regulatory and industry players. The Digital Radio Planning Committee may identify further elements of the digital radio regulatory framework that could be simplified to further facilitate the rollout of digital radio in regional Australia in the future. 


I commend this bill to the House. 


Debate adjourned.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (19:20):  Whilst I do not want to take too much of my time in making reference to the contributions by our colleagues across the chamber, I have noticed a trend since I have returned, and that is: every time they speak, it is negativity followed by negativity followed by negativity, with absolutely zero reference to an alternative plan. The reason they cannot put an alternative plan is that, if they did so, it would be held up against the reference point of their performance before the change of government and they would be exposed for being the inadequate economic managers they are. But that was not the reason I secured the opportunity to speak tonight.


I want to talk on a subject that is close to my heart—and, indeed, I know is close to Senator Sterle's heart—and that is the economic wellbeing and security of large parts of our country. It is close to your heart too, Senator Smith, and to the heart of any senator, indeed, who represents a large state, as you do with Western Australia and I do with Queensland. We want to see that we have got viable communities and viable economic programs assisting all of those sectors that work.


A fact of life, a reference point that we need to start from, is that we are a trade-exposed nation. Well over 60 per cent of all the soft commodities that we produce are traded, and therefore our fortunes are intrinsically linked to the performance of our nation in developing trade opportunities and then maintaining them.


Australian farmers and producers are amongst the best in the world for innovation, for the use of technology and for labour practices. This, of course, is borne out of the massive amount of foreign investment that occurs in our nation. Other countries and other interests want to invest in our country because of the fact that we have a very solid and stable sovereign risk environment. We have a very settled nation without any border conflicts and so we are very attractive destination. Nonetheless, at the end of the day, we are a trade exposed nation.


I say—and I want to continue to talk about this over the coming months—as a government and as a parliament as a whole, we need to now start to look thoroughly at what we can do to support those who produce the trade. Obviously, one of the first things we need to do is expand our markets. This government, to date, has a terrific track record with the free-trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China, and hopefully, eventually, when the US makes a decision, the adoption of the TPP.


There are winners and losers in all of this but, by and large, when I say there are losers, there are people whose fortunes in life are sectors—sugar is one—whose fortunes did not really increase. The FTAs have not diminished the existing opportunities for many of the sectors, but there are some who have not grown under it. There are so many, as I mentioned in a speech earlier today, that we have seen an increase about 27 per cent in the value of our exports in this preceding year, where the figures are kept.


The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by eight per cent in 2015-16 to around $57 billion. Now eight per cent, of course, in any economy is a leap. That is higher than what the Chinese economy is growing at—it is about 6½ per cent. Our farm economy is growing very strongly in the face of some very severe difficulties such as drought. We have to do some things in relation to competition policy. My colleague Senator Sterle very competently, I must say, chaired a references committee into some competition issues within the sugar industry in my home state. At the end of the day, he got it right when he signed off on recommendations in relation to what we might do to solve some market problems.


We have to expand the markets of the soft commodities because we are transitioning from a resources market. This same area of our nation—away from the metro centres, away from the high populated eastern seaboard, and away from the south-western seaboard of Western Australia—is feeling the impact of the economy coming off from the resources sector. Many of our areas, large tracts of land in both our states and indeed to various degrees in the other states, are starting to feel the impact of this transition from the resources sector. The only solution is the increase in the agriculture sector, so it is an old economy that has come good. It still faces the challenges I talked about such as droughts. The Panama race 4 is a great example of how we can go to bed one night with an entire industry—the North Queensland banana industry—and wake up with what is possibly a serious crisis in that sector.


Farmers are very resilient. We know that primary producers are very resilient. They have dealt with droughts and they have dealt with these biosecurity challenges before and they will continue to do so. But they deserve our government, my government, with the support of others in this place, to assist them to be able to take advantage of these increases that we are starting to see in the farm sector. We are travelling at about 70 per cent higher than the average $50 billion over the five years 2014 in nominal terms according to the ABARES agriculture commodities report. So we are really on the lift. What we have to look at are the things that are keeping some of these sectors and individual enterprises within the sectors back. It is very important that we never abandon the concept that much of these sectors need to be populated by farm family enterprises, primary production enterprises and generational businesses in many cases. I am not against corporate farming. I think that it has a place. I am not against foreign investment as long as, of course, foreigners do not come in and vertically integrate their operations and take their commodities offshore across our road networks and out through our port networks without making a significant and just contribution to the economy of the nation through the tax receipts.


But there are so many things that we have to do. We have to visit upon the issue of farm finance and we have to get much more flexible farm finance products in place. I have often said that the only thing a poultry farmer living next to a sunflower farmer living next door to a feedlot have in common is gravel from the grid to the house, and perhaps a big hat. But when they go in for farm finance arrangements, someone reaches around and pulls down a gumboot—not a thong, not a pair of slippers, but a gumboot—and simply asks them what size gumboot they want. They try to fit all these things into the one finance product. That has to change.


We have to support some of our larger regional councils and we must certainly continue to keep an eye on those services that we, as the government, have an obligation to provide: communication, rural health, education. We also have to support some of our more remote communities. Our Aboriginal communities continue to need the assistance to be viable to continue to grow their contribution to the country's economy in these remote areas.


The time that I am allowed does not give me the opportunity to put a lot of detail under each of the subjects, but in the coming weeks and months I intend to unpack these issues through this place. My behaviour outside this place will be to start, with the cooperation of others, to try and push to get some solutions, particularly in the farm finance sector. We have all had constituent farmers and primary producers come to us. If you look at their problems, many times it is as a result of the restricted nature of the arrangements that they have with the banks.


Now I am on meeting No. 6 with the major banks in this country. They have entertained me—and I must pay them credit for that—as we have talked about the prudential regulations that they say are inhibiting their ability to provide a more flexible finance product to our primary producers. I hope to come in here and talk about that in the not too distant future when we have a settled position. In effect, I am simply using this opportunity tonight to put on notice that I intend to now carefully pursue resolution to many of these issues over this calendar year and I look forward to the support of this Senate in that journey.
