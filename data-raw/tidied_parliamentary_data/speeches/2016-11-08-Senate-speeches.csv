Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (12:37):  I rise today to make a contribution on behalf of the opposition on the second reading debate on the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016, to put forward our views. As we know, the bill seeks to amend the 2012 Murray-Darling Basin Plan, allowing for the second notification of supply and efficiency measures, and further adds a deadline for sustainable diversion limit, SDL, adjustment. The amendment bill also puts a deadline on determination of the adjustment of the sustainable diversion limit until 15 December 2017. This deadline is here to add more certainty to the plan.


The bill is integral, as it allows for the development of supply and efficiency measures for basin states—New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT, Queensland and South Australia—as requested by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. We have in this bill before us an additional year to help develop and refine projects that will deliver for the environment and for farmers.


As those across the chamber would be aware, Labor overcame more than 100 years of conflict and partisan politics to put the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in place. The significance of this achievement should not be underestimated. The basin covers approximately one-seventh of the coastal area of mainland Australia, with over two million people living there, including Canberra and many of our other regional centres: Toowoomba, Bendigo, Albury-Wodonga, Tamworth, Dubbo, Orange, Wagga Wagga, Queanbeyan and Shepparton. It is also home to many bioregions and includes landscapes as diverse as subtropical rainforests in the north, our semi-arid desert in the west, and alpine areas and snowfields in the south. It has an incredible array of animals, including endangered birds, mammals and snakes.


In addition to its environmental assets, the basin contains some of the oldest remains of modern humans. It is worth noting that ritual burial sites at Lake Mungo in New South Wales highlight that humans have been in this region for more than 40,000 years, and the region is home to around 50 Aboriginal nations. They have long and strong connections with the rivers and land in this region. It houses a vast ecosystem, but, as many know, agriculture is the most significant user of the basin's land and water resources. It provides employment for basin residents and contributes significantly to our regional economies. Here in the Murray-Darling Basin region, we have approximately 20 per cent of Australia's total agricultural land area and also one-third of the nation's food supply and exports, which go to many countries overseas, 40 per cent of Australia's farms and 65 per cent of all irrigation farms. The scale of irrigated cropping production in the basin is not matched by any other region in Australia. It was worth approximately $6.7 billion when the Basin Plan was put in place.


While the scale of production is not matched by any other region, the volume of water that flows into the Murray from its tributaries and out to the Southern Ocean can, as we know, be extremely variable. This means the water for farmers and water for the environment, including the precious wetlands, is not always there. Variation also means that, when there is a flood, there can be too much water. These pressures and variability in water availability are expected to increase with climate change. So, to manage the extreme dry times, a plan to buy back water licences from irrigators and improve farm efficiency has been developed. Examples like this highlight how vulnerable the basin is and how we need to ensure its management through supply and efficiency measures for years to come.


So Labor is committed to returning the Murray-Darling system to health through the implementation of this plan. As I previously stated, in 2012 the Labor government introduced the plan, which sought to secure the long-term health of the basin. It set limits for irrigators and other water users and established where more water was needed for the system to survive. The plan aimed to return to the basin 2,750 billion litres of water which was being used mainly for irrigation and allows for up to 3,200 billion litres to be recovered. Stakeholder input was key to developing the plan and to a number of consultation activities taking place, including formal consultation periods, community meetings, round tables, visits to Aboriginal communities, briefings with businesses and almost 12,000 submissions during the consultation period. We know from this that discussions and differences continue to some degree about the plan and its impact. The plan, however, continues to provide a clear framework and certainty that was long overdue. This certainty is critical to rural communities and to the precious environment that exists in our Murray-Darling Basin. The 641-page final plan delivered on the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's draft recommendations, which the water minister at the time, Tony Burke, said would mean an extra focus on infrastructure investments to improve water use efficiency. However, it would not forget water buybacks and water for our environment. Basin state governments along the river system were tasked with coming up with ideas to return 650 gigalitres to the environment, with the final 450 gigalitres to be found in removing capacity restrictions. The bill that we have before us today is another step in this process.


The bill will help people on the ground as well as the basin states. Achieving greater water offsets requires projects that can provide more environmental water and projects that address physical and operational constraints to free up the delivery of environmental water to where it is needed. While some have criticised the delay in implementation of these projects, there is, however, little point having these innovations without the funding and consideration they need; otherwise, they will be set up to fail.


Basin states have submitted a range of projects and have asked for time to further develop some of these. While we do not want to see delays to such an important plan, we want quality projects to receive the attention they deserve and the funding they need, so it is only natural that we would like to support good environmental policy. Labor wants the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to work and we are committed to returning the Murray-Darling system to health through the implementation of the plan. The coalition's political moves to cap water buybacks in 2015 and to slash infrastructure funding in 2014 put pressure on every other component of the Basin Plan, making it more fragile than it needs to be.


We on this side will always carefully monitor the implementation of the plan, because we have always done so. We support this bill so Labor's Murray-Darling Basin Plan can continue to be effectively implemented.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:46):  I support the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016 before the Senate today. It concerns a sustainable diversion limit applicable in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and it extends the deadline for any decision to adjust this limit. The SDL, sustainable diversion limit, is the maximum amount of water that can be taken for consumptive use. The extension will allow further time to gather information that should lead to a greater upward adjustment in the limit—in other words, more water for consumptive use. This would mean: more for farmers to grow food and to support productivity throughout the basin; more time for the current floods to recede so that we can appreciate the natural restorative effects of flooding rains that we were told were never likely to return; and more time to see if we can get the implementation of the Basin Plan right.


We do not have any more time to wait for the government's response to the Senate Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which I chaired, and from which the committee's report was tabled on 17 March 2016. That report made 31 recommendations, which, if implemented, would significantly reduce the negative impact the plan is having on communities in the basin, from Queensland to the mouth of the Murray in South Australia.


It was reported last month that a Murray-Darling Basin Authority report on the northern basin showed employment in northern irrigation communities has been smashed by the removal of water from farming. The report also found that the targets legislated under the Basin Plan would have quite large socio-economic impacts in the Condamine and Balonne valleys if they were pursued. This is what the local communities have been saying for years, but they have not been listened to. Communities in the southern basin wonder why there was no study of the socioeconomic impacts in their area, particularly given they have borne the brunt of water recovery. Their expectation is that the economic impact will be even more severe than in northern communities.


Last week, the media reported on the frustration of the chairman of the Southern Riverina Irrigators, Graeme Pyle, who called on the government to take the blinkers off and act on the select committee inquiry's recommendations. Mr Pyle said:


Under the Basin Plan, there have been ongoing reductions in availability and affordability of productive water, so it is reasonable to assume the results of any social and economic study will not be pretty. They will show the plan for what it is … an economic disaster without evidence of environmental gains.


This goes to the crux of some of the key recommendations in the inquiry report: no more water buybacks; a full assessment of the social and economic impacts of the plan; and a cost-benefit analysis of the various options to adapt the management of the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. Hundreds of farming communities across four states are feeling the pain of the Basin Plan implementation. We are now seeing analysis confirming what those communities have been saying. It is time for the government to accept the recommendations of the select committee, which have been endorsed by many basin communities, so that further implementation of the plan has the support of the communities most affected.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-11-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:50):  I support the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016, and I will outline the reasons why. Before I do so, I will give some background. Back in 2007, when I stood for election for the Senate and was elected, the southern states of Australia, in particular, were gripped by what was called the millennium drought, one of the most severe droughts we had seen for many generations. I spoke to so many farmers, so many environmentalists, who indicated just how awful it was in terms of rising salinity levels and a lack of ability to draw water out of the great Murray-Darling river system. Our farmers were in dire straits as a result of the deteriorating water levels and water quality levels. There was a need to manage the environmental flows better so that we could get a better outcome for agriculture as well. 


Back then it was almost a case of musical chairs and pass the parcel, in that nobody wanted to take responsibility for the whole issue of water and maintaining the great Murray-Darling Basin from Queensland to New South Wales, ACT, Victoria and, of course, South Australia, where we are particularly vulnerable because we are at the end of the river system. The Lower Lakes are what many leading water economists and environmentalists, such as Professor Mike Young from the University of Adelaide, have described as the lungs of the river system. You need to ensure that the nutrients and salinity are flushed out through the Lower Lakes. That is critical for the health of the river system upstream as well.


I had an opportunity in early 2009 to negotiate with the then Rudd government to ensure that there was going to be an increase in water buybacks, to the tune of half a billion dollars, to improve environmental flows so our farmers would have a healthier river system. Unless we have a healthy river system, our farmers cannot rely on that river system. If you have rising salinity levels, if you do not do the right thing environmentally, you compromise the agricultural production of our great river system. I also managed to negotiate $200 million in stormwater harvesting, which was used in projects around the country because it is an efficient way of ensuring that you can access water. It is much cheaper than desalination plants and it makes a huge difference in terms of a good environmental outcome and saving water. I also negotiated a $200 million package for river communities that were at breaking point because of the drought. These were communities in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT.


I think we did the right thing then. We should remember that the $10 billion package for water—that great program—was initiated by the Howard government because former Prime Minister Howard understood the importance of having a national plan instead of a state-by-state, piecemeal approach when it comes to the management of our great river system, the Murray-Darling, and the communities that rely on it in the Murray-Darling Basin. 


So I support the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016. This bill will help deliver on the 2012 decision by the basin ministers to enhance Basin Plan environmental and socio-economic outcomes through three key elements: firstly, adjusting sustainable diversion limits to offset the originally proposed water recovery target of 2,750 gigalitres by 2019; secondly, addressing physical and operational constraints on the use of environmental water; and, thirdly, recovering an additional 450 gigalitres of water for the environment by 2024 through so-called efficiency measures.


On the issue of efficiency measures: South Australia has had to, by virtue of drought since the 1960s, be more efficient and adopt water efficiency measures earlier than other states by virtue of the fact that we are vulnerable being at the tail end of this great river system. That is something I do not believe has ever been adequately taken into account in the formation of policy. This bill, agreed to by the Basin ministers in April this year, primarily addresses the first element—that is, to adjust sustainable diversion limits by giving states more time to develop projects to offset the need for water recovery. This is very important and could potentially allow diversion limits to be increased; notwithstanding that, you need to give them more time to transition. I see this as part of having a healthy river system so that our farmers can have a long-term, viable future in relation to their agricultural produce.


However, it is just as important that all jurisdictions maintain their efforts in the second and third elements of the Basin Plan implementation—that is, by addressing constraints and by recovering the extra 450 gigalitres by 2024. I support this bill with the expectation that New South Wales and Victoria, in particular, will honour their commitments around addressing constraints on the use of environmental water and the recovery of the extra 450 gigalitres. The constraints that Basin governments agreed would be addressed as part of the Basin Plan implementation are essentially a set of operating rules and structures that currently limit the delivery and timing of environmental flows. Addressing these constraints is vital for enabling additional areas of wetlands and flood plains to receive water when they really need it. Again, this is about getting the balance between the environment and agricultural production right because farmers cannot have a viable, agricultural production and economic model unless we have good quality water so that they can grow crops.


While addressing constraints, this will have significant environmental benefits. The potential constraint projects being considered by Basin governments also provide an opportunity to further offset the need for water recovery, which again would benefit irrigators, and that to me is very important. Those irrigators in the Riverland and in the lower part of the Murray lands in the Lower Lakes need our support. Just as importantly, constraints projects also have a potential to benefit regional communities and individual landholders by providing greater protection against both naturally occurring and managed higher flow events in key parts of the Murray-Darling Basin. So I urge the New South Wales and Victorian governments to continue working with their communities to realise the full potential of these constraints projects for the benefit of Basin irrigators, affected communities and the environment.


In supporting the passage of this bill, I also wish to highlight the need for states to put forward sound water recovery offset projects in a timely manner, and it must be done in a way that gives good value for taxpayer money, as well as a good environmental benefit and, through it, a good benefit for our farmers. Constraints are one set of projects that can offset water recovery as well as deliver broader community and environmental health benefits. Projects such as the Menindee Lakes water-saving project is another type of activity that can offset water recovery by delivering evaporative water savings. 


In relation to Menindee Lakes, it supplies water to Broken Hill. It is on the same time zone as South Australia, so many people in Broken Hill are much closer to Adelaide than they are to Sydney and there is a close affinity and bond between the people of Broken Hill and South Australians by virtue of geography and history. I have been asking questions in Senate estimates, going back eight years now, about the reason why it has taken so long for the New South Wales government, or rather governments since that time, to implement some sensible measures to deal with the massive evaporation in the lakes and to secure a high-quality potable water supply for the people of Broken Hill. I hope we will get a breakthrough on that sooner rather than later because the people of Broken Hill deserve better.


The Menindee Lakes water-saving project will significantly change how the River Murray is operated. To ensure its success, New South Wales is to engage the Australian, Victorian and South Australian governments as early as possible to make sure the project takes into account all jurisdictions—I emphasise 'all jurisdictions'—and the River Murray water requirements.


I support this bill. I believe this is the best we can do. I also consider that not having a national plan, not going ahead with this, will ultimately harm our irrigators and harm our farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin and all of those great communities that are in that basin. But, of course, it is reasonable, as always, where communities' livelihoods are at stake, where taxpayers' moneys are being expended at a significant level, to ensure a constant scrutiny and questioning. That is why, whilst I may disagree with Senator Leyonhjelm's conclusions in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin, I welcome that level of robust debate because it is a healthy thing in our democracy with respect to getting the best outcome for the great Murray-Darling river system.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-11-08,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (13:00):  I rise to support the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016, which, in the words of the minister, amends the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to allow basin states to notify a second package of sustainable diversion limit adjustment measures.


Let me get straight to the point. If this means that our farmers get more water, One Nation unhesitatingly supports this bill. However, the fact that parliament needs to legislate to allow farmers to draw the water that they need to feed Australia out of the rivers raises the greater concern: just what has happened to water management in this country? The Labor-inspired Murray-Darling Plan is just the latest example of big government telling ordinary Australians what they can do on something as basic as water use. It is contrary to both the spirit and intent of our Australian Constitution and the Australian way of life. The relevant parts of the Constitution are section 99, titled 'Commonwealth not to give preference', and section 100, which states in no uncertain terms:


The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.


What emerged in section 100 was in effect a bill of rights for our farmers and for the residents of the towns along the Murray-Darling. It was never intended under the Constitution that the Commonwealth receive, and the Commonwealth did not receive, any other power—in particular any power over conservation and irrigation. Basically, politicians, including the Nationals, have given away these rights, which should belong to the people.


This is Canberra acting as a puppet of the United Nations and its various instruments, including Agenda 21. Under Agenda 21, section 18 states what they want to do with the Earth Summit that was brought in in 1992, which we became a signatory to with 176 other countries around the world. It was put out to people around the world to look at the privatisation of water. Under chapter 18 of that, the document that I read years ago stated that if you put a dam on your property of a certain size you will only capture about 10 percent of the water into that dam, and for anything else you would actually have to let it flow to the rivers or creeks. If not, you would be taxed on it. It was put in there to actually make sure that water would be privatised around the world. It would become a commodity. Therefore, our right to water would be taken away from us and put into the hands of international interests—those who were to make a lot of money out of it.


Then, I have to say, Agenda 21 has not been in our best interest. If you do not believe me, then go out onto the farms and into the rural areas of the nation, talk to the locals in the pubs and the townships of our country and realise that what I am saying touches the heartstrings across Australia.


Once again, big government is using a big stick to favour extreme environmental claims over the needs of working farms. The left-wing obsession with so-called sustainable development finds expression in Agenda 21's prosperity-denying principles. These, among other things, seek to deny the right of democratic nations to control and regulate their own water to maximise their food production and growth. What we are seeing happening in one state, in South Australia—Senator Xenophon was just here—is that now the state government wants to impose low-flow bypasses on farms and properties there, which is going to deny them the right to use water on their farms and properties—the right to have that water so they can grow their crops. Dams are being stopped from being put in. All I can see across Australia is the controlling of our water.


I also have a grave concern: why did the Howard government, in 2004, separate water from land, allowing people to come in here, buy up the water rights and deny the farming sector the right to that water? It is our right to that water. No government owns it. No-one owns it. Foreign interests should not own this. This is water for the people.


At times I have said that, if we are going to charge the man on the land for the water that is in his dams or deny him the right to expand his farms and to carry the water that will see him through in times of drought, the next thing that will be imposed on the people of Australia is that we will be taxed on the water that we catch in our water tanks. This may start in the farming sector around our country, but eventually every Australian will feel the effects of this if they have a water tank. Over the years, since the time I was a young child, I have seen the rising costs of water in this country. That should never be happening.


What I am proposing is that governments have not looked after the water issues in this country. We have failed to put in enough dams to service the needs of the people. We have not provided that. We are actually shutting it down. We have to be smart. We keep increasing the population in this country, and we are not putting in the infrastructure to cater for this. That is why we must look after putting in more dams and allowing the farmers to have the water they need. We would not need this legislation so the farmers could come cap in hand saying, 'We can have a few more beggarly litres of water.' It should not be happening that way.


The farmers are the people of this land. They are the environmentalists. They are not going to destroy their livelihoods. They have come through generations of looking after the environment, and they are not going to destroy something. Unless we stand by them and protect them with water and with land, we are not going to have the farming sector in this country anymore. I see it constantly shut down. We are now bringing in imports of food, but what I can say is that I hear too often that the food imports are not up to the standard that we impose on our own farmers here. They have to come up to standards that we do not even put on the imports that come into Australia.


I will go back to the whole thing. In conclusion, Australia's national sovereignty is being undermined by the thousands of excessive UN treaties which promote green tape and are death to the best interests of Australia. If all the rivers and creeks that run across this land become subject to the laws of the UN, how long will it be before the rain collected in the tanks on the properties of our farmers will also become subject to Agenda 21 regulation and tax? How long before the UN dictates that we must pay a tax for the privilege of sunlight? Australia is its own country with its own Constitution and should not be dictated to by unrepresentative foreign organisations with agendas that are opposed to our best interests.


I support this bill because I think it is a start, but we have a long way to go. I will call on this parliament and our governments: please support the farming sector. They are struggling. I have just been out there. I have been through on two hay runs to take much-needed hay to farmers. We are not doing enough to support them. If we encourage them to put dams on their properties, they can drought-proof themselves to feed their stock and irrigate through times of drought. I thank you for your time.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-11-08,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:10):  In speaking to the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016, can I say that the government is absolutely committed to the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Can I also acknowledge the bipartisan approach that was undertaken in establishing this plan in the first place. The 'one basin, one plan' mantra that followed the establishment of the negotiations when this plan was first put in place is a testament, I think, to how governments and oppositions in parliaments can work together to deliver the best possible outcome on something as critical as our water security.


Key to our ability to deliver this plan is recognising that it is not just environmental concerns and outcomes that need to be delivered; we also need to take into account the social and economic impacts of any changes through legislation or regulation. As you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am an irrigator, and I can assure you that there is nobody on the land in Australia that understands better the need for a healthy river environment than an irrigator. It is the basis of our sustainability. Without a healthy river system, we do not have an economy, and without an economy we do not have our river communities.


The SDL adjustment mechanism process is a fundamental part in our ability to deliver this triple-bottom-line outcome. It provides a mechanism by which environmental outcomes can also be tested for their efficiency. We focused on irrigation efficiencies in the initial commencement of the rollout of the plan, whether they be on-farm or off-farm efficiencies for the delivery of water for irrigation, stock and domestic, and other consumptive use purposes. But it is equally important that we use water for environmental purposes equally efficiently.


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan in 2012 set out the process for coordinated and sustainable management of this very important river system. It also set out the long-term-average sustainable diversion limits, and it included an adjustment mechanism to adjust those limits by up to five per cent. The adjustment mechanism provides for the amendment of the SDLs based on either supply measure projects that deliver the Basin Plan environmental outcomes with less environmental water or efficiency measure projects that recover more environmental water in ways that deliver neutral or beneficial social and economic outcomes.


This bill amends the Basin Plan to provide for a second opportunity to notify adjustment measures by 30 June 2017. It provides another opportunity for the basin states to develop new projects to allow the SDL to be adjusted—and beyond those that have already been notified as of June 2016. It provides opportunities to maximise social, economic and environmental outcomes of the Basin Plan by augmenting the potential SDL adjustment.


It also builds on the Australian government's commitment to sustainable agricultural production. As you would well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, water is an absolutely critical input to agriculture, and it is one of the key pillars of this government's platform that agriculture is a very important part of our economy. We have done other things through the implementation of the plan. We have applied a sense of adaptive management to the implementation of this plan, an example of which was the capping of water purchases as part of the return of water for this purpose to 1,500 gigalitres last year.


We have also looked at some other really exciting measures for our ability to deliver efficient environmental water. There are such initiatives as the other no-flow measures that are being currently considered, the most famous of which is the carp control measure, which we are hoping will clear the river of the toxic carp that have been introduced and, in the process of doing so, increase our native fish populations. Up until now, this has not been able to be considered as an adjustment mechanism. However, we have given the states the opportunity to consider this and other types of no-flow measures, which could add to the environmental outcomes with either no damage at all to the social and economic communities that rely on the river or possibly even providing additional benefits.


We intend to continue to work in partnership with the basin states. As you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, the Basin Plan requires the support of all of the basin states for us to be able to make any changes in the delivery of the legislation and the regulations that sit with it. I also assure Senator Hanson that we are very well aware of the rights of irrigators and of people and the communities who live on the river. One of the fundamental rights that we absolutely understand are riparian rights—that is, the rights of those people who live down river are equally entitled to expect that water will also flow past their properties and they will have access to it. This is not a case of those highest up the river get the best deal.


In concluding, I thank everybody—the opposition, the Nick Xenophon Team, the One Nation team, Senator Leyonhjelm and the other crossbenchers, and of course the Greens, who I am hoping will also be supporting this because of the importance of this delivering for the whole river community—for the support of this bill and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (12:37):  I rise today to make a contribution on behalf of the opposition on the second reading debate on the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016, to put forward our views. As we know, the bill seeks to amend the 2012 Murray-Darling Basin Plan, allowing for the second notification of supply and efficiency measures, and further adds a deadline for sustainable diversion limit, SDL, adjustment. The amendment bill also puts a deadline on determination of the adjustment of the sustainable diversion limit until 15 December 2017. This deadline is here to add more certainty to the plan.


The bill is integral, as it allows for the development of supply and efficiency measures for basin states—New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT, Queensland and South Australia—as requested by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. We have in this bill before us an additional year to help develop and refine projects that will deliver for the environment and for farmers.


As those across the chamber would be aware, Labor overcame more than 100 years of conflict and partisan politics to put the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in place. The significance of this achievement should not be underestimated. The basin covers approximately one-seventh of the coastal area of mainland Australia, with over two million people living there, including Canberra and many of our other regional centres: Toowoomba, Bendigo, Albury-Wodonga, Tamworth, Dubbo, Orange, Wagga Wagga, Queanbeyan and Shepparton. It is also home to many bioregions and includes landscapes as diverse as subtropical rainforests in the north, our semi-arid desert in the west, and alpine areas and snowfields in the south. It has an incredible array of animals, including endangered birds, mammals and snakes.


In addition to its environmental assets, the basin contains some of the oldest remains of modern humans. It is worth noting that ritual burial sites at Lake Mungo in New South Wales highlight that humans have been in this region for more than 40,000 years, and the region is home to around 50 Aboriginal nations. They have long and strong connections with the rivers and land in this region. It houses a vast ecosystem, but, as many know, agriculture is the most significant user of the basin's land and water resources. It provides employment for basin residents and contributes significantly to our regional economies. Here in the Murray-Darling Basin region, we have approximately 20 per cent of Australia's total agricultural land area and also one-third of the nation's food supply and exports, which go to many countries overseas, 40 per cent of Australia's farms and 65 per cent of all irrigation farms. The scale of irrigated cropping production in the basin is not matched by any other region in Australia. It was worth approximately $6.7 billion when the Basin Plan was put in place.


While the scale of production is not matched by any other region, the volume of water that flows into the Murray from its tributaries and out to the Southern Ocean can, as we know, be extremely variable. This means the water for farmers and water for the environment, including the precious wetlands, is not always there. Variation also means that, when there is a flood, there can be too much water. These pressures and variability in water availability are expected to increase with climate change. So, to manage the extreme dry times, a plan to buy back water licences from irrigators and improve farm efficiency has been developed. Examples like this highlight how vulnerable the basin is and how we need to ensure its management through supply and efficiency measures for years to come.


So Labor is committed to returning the Murray-Darling system to health through the implementation of this plan. As I previously stated, in 2012 the Labor government introduced the plan, which sought to secure the long-term health of the basin. It set limits for irrigators and other water users and established where more water was needed for the system to survive. The plan aimed to return to the basin 2,750 billion litres of water which was being used mainly for irrigation and allows for up to 3,200 billion litres to be recovered. Stakeholder input was key to developing the plan and to a number of consultation activities taking place, including formal consultation periods, community meetings, round tables, visits to Aboriginal communities, briefings with businesses and almost 12,000 submissions during the consultation period. We know from this that discussions and differences continue to some degree about the plan and its impact. The plan, however, continues to provide a clear framework and certainty that was long overdue. This certainty is critical to rural communities and to the precious environment that exists in our Murray-Darling Basin. The 641-page final plan delivered on the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's draft recommendations, which the water minister at the time, Tony Burke, said would mean an extra focus on infrastructure investments to improve water use efficiency. However, it would not forget water buybacks and water for our environment. Basin state governments along the river system were tasked with coming up with ideas to return 650 gigalitres to the environment, with the final 450 gigalitres to be found in removing capacity restrictions. The bill that we have before us today is another step in this process.


The bill will help people on the ground as well as the basin states. Achieving greater water offsets requires projects that can provide more environmental water and projects that address physical and operational constraints to free up the delivery of environmental water to where it is needed. While some have criticised the delay in implementation of these projects, there is, however, little point having these innovations without the funding and consideration they need; otherwise, they will be set up to fail.


Basin states have submitted a range of projects and have asked for time to further develop some of these. While we do not want to see delays to such an important plan, we want quality projects to receive the attention they deserve and the funding they need, so it is only natural that we would like to support good environmental policy. Labor wants the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to work and we are committed to returning the Murray-Darling system to health through the implementation of the plan. The coalition's political moves to cap water buybacks in 2015 and to slash infrastructure funding in 2014 put pressure on every other component of the Basin Plan, making it more fragile than it needs to be.


We on this side will always carefully monitor the implementation of the plan, because we have always done so. We support this bill so Labor's Murray-Darling Basin Plan can continue to be effectively implemented.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-11-08,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:46):  I support the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016 before the Senate today. It concerns a sustainable diversion limit applicable in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and it extends the deadline for any decision to adjust this limit. The SDL, sustainable diversion limit, is the maximum amount of water that can be taken for consumptive use. The extension will allow further time to gather information that should lead to a greater upward adjustment in the limit—in other words, more water for consumptive use. This would mean: more for farmers to grow food and to support productivity throughout the basin; more time for the current floods to recede so that we can appreciate the natural restorative effects of flooding rains that we were told were never likely to return; and more time to see if we can get the implementation of the Basin Plan right.


We do not have any more time to wait for the government's response to the Senate Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which I chaired, and from which the committee's report was tabled on 17 March 2016. That report made 31 recommendations, which, if implemented, would significantly reduce the negative impact the plan is having on communities in the basin, from Queensland to the mouth of the Murray in South Australia.


It was reported last month that a Murray-Darling Basin Authority report on the northern basin showed employment in northern irrigation communities has been smashed by the removal of water from farming. The report also found that the targets legislated under the Basin Plan would have quite large socio-economic impacts in the Condamine and Balonne valleys if they were pursued. This is what the local communities have been saying for years, but they have not been listened to. Communities in the southern basin wonder why there was no study of the socioeconomic impacts in their area, particularly given they have borne the brunt of water recovery. Their expectation is that the economic impact will be even more severe than in northern communities.


Last week, the media reported on the frustration of the chairman of the Southern Riverina Irrigators, Graeme Pyle, who called on the government to take the blinkers off and act on the select committee inquiry's recommendations. Mr Pyle said:


Under the Basin Plan, there have been ongoing reductions in availability and affordability of productive water, so it is reasonable to assume the results of any social and economic study will not be pretty. They will show the plan for what it is … an economic disaster without evidence of environmental gains.


This goes to the crux of some of the key recommendations in the inquiry report: no more water buybacks; a full assessment of the social and economic impacts of the plan; and a cost-benefit analysis of the various options to adapt the management of the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. Hundreds of farming communities across four states are feeling the pain of the Basin Plan implementation. We are now seeing analysis confirming what those communities have been saying. It is time for the government to accept the recommendations of the select committee, which have been endorsed by many basin communities, so that further implementation of the plan has the support of the communities most affected.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-11-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:50):  I support the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016, and I will outline the reasons why. Before I do so, I will give some background. Back in 2007, when I stood for election for the Senate and was elected, the southern states of Australia, in particular, were gripped by what was called the millennium drought, one of the most severe droughts we had seen for many generations. I spoke to so many farmers, so many environmentalists, who indicated just how awful it was in terms of rising salinity levels and a lack of ability to draw water out of the great Murray-Darling river system. Our farmers were in dire straits as a result of the deteriorating water levels and water quality levels. There was a need to manage the environmental flows better so that we could get a better outcome for agriculture as well. 


Back then it was almost a case of musical chairs and pass the parcel, in that nobody wanted to take responsibility for the whole issue of water and maintaining the great Murray-Darling Basin from Queensland to New South Wales, ACT, Victoria and, of course, South Australia, where we are particularly vulnerable because we are at the end of the river system. The Lower Lakes are what many leading water economists and environmentalists, such as Professor Mike Young from the University of Adelaide, have described as the lungs of the river system. You need to ensure that the nutrients and salinity are flushed out through the Lower Lakes. That is critical for the health of the river system upstream as well.


I had an opportunity in early 2009 to negotiate with the then Rudd government to ensure that there was going to be an increase in water buybacks, to the tune of half a billion dollars, to improve environmental flows so our farmers would have a healthier river system. Unless we have a healthy river system, our farmers cannot rely on that river system. If you have rising salinity levels, if you do not do the right thing environmentally, you compromise the agricultural production of our great river system. I also managed to negotiate $200 million in stormwater harvesting, which was used in projects around the country because it is an efficient way of ensuring that you can access water. It is much cheaper than desalination plants and it makes a huge difference in terms of a good environmental outcome and saving water. I also negotiated a $200 million package for river communities that were at breaking point because of the drought. These were communities in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT.


I think we did the right thing then. We should remember that the $10 billion package for water—that great program—was initiated by the Howard government because former Prime Minister Howard understood the importance of having a national plan instead of a state-by-state, piecemeal approach when it comes to the management of our great river system, the Murray-Darling, and the communities that rely on it in the Murray-Darling Basin. 


So I support the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016. This bill will help deliver on the 2012 decision by the basin ministers to enhance Basin Plan environmental and socio-economic outcomes through three key elements: firstly, adjusting sustainable diversion limits to offset the originally proposed water recovery target of 2,750 gigalitres by 2019; secondly, addressing physical and operational constraints on the use of environmental water; and, thirdly, recovering an additional 450 gigalitres of water for the environment by 2024 through so-called efficiency measures.


On the issue of efficiency measures: South Australia has had to, by virtue of drought since the 1960s, be more efficient and adopt water efficiency measures earlier than other states by virtue of the fact that we are vulnerable being at the tail end of this great river system. That is something I do not believe has ever been adequately taken into account in the formation of policy. This bill, agreed to by the Basin ministers in April this year, primarily addresses the first element—that is, to adjust sustainable diversion limits by giving states more time to develop projects to offset the need for water recovery. This is very important and could potentially allow diversion limits to be increased; notwithstanding that, you need to give them more time to transition. I see this as part of having a healthy river system so that our farmers can have a long-term, viable future in relation to their agricultural produce.


However, it is just as important that all jurisdictions maintain their efforts in the second and third elements of the Basin Plan implementation—that is, by addressing constraints and by recovering the extra 450 gigalitres by 2024. I support this bill with the expectation that New South Wales and Victoria, in particular, will honour their commitments around addressing constraints on the use of environmental water and the recovery of the extra 450 gigalitres. The constraints that Basin governments agreed would be addressed as part of the Basin Plan implementation are essentially a set of operating rules and structures that currently limit the delivery and timing of environmental flows. Addressing these constraints is vital for enabling additional areas of wetlands and flood plains to receive water when they really need it. Again, this is about getting the balance between the environment and agricultural production right because farmers cannot have a viable, agricultural production and economic model unless we have good quality water so that they can grow crops.


While addressing constraints, this will have significant environmental benefits. The potential constraint projects being considered by Basin governments also provide an opportunity to further offset the need for water recovery, which again would benefit irrigators, and that to me is very important. Those irrigators in the Riverland and in the lower part of the Murray lands in the Lower Lakes need our support. Just as importantly, constraints projects also have a potential to benefit regional communities and individual landholders by providing greater protection against both naturally occurring and managed higher flow events in key parts of the Murray-Darling Basin. So I urge the New South Wales and Victorian governments to continue working with their communities to realise the full potential of these constraints projects for the benefit of Basin irrigators, affected communities and the environment.


In supporting the passage of this bill, I also wish to highlight the need for states to put forward sound water recovery offset projects in a timely manner, and it must be done in a way that gives good value for taxpayer money, as well as a good environmental benefit and, through it, a good benefit for our farmers. Constraints are one set of projects that can offset water recovery as well as deliver broader community and environmental health benefits. Projects such as the Menindee Lakes water-saving project is another type of activity that can offset water recovery by delivering evaporative water savings. 


In relation to Menindee Lakes, it supplies water to Broken Hill. It is on the same time zone as South Australia, so many people in Broken Hill are much closer to Adelaide than they are to Sydney and there is a close affinity and bond between the people of Broken Hill and South Australians by virtue of geography and history. I have been asking questions in Senate estimates, going back eight years now, about the reason why it has taken so long for the New South Wales government, or rather governments since that time, to implement some sensible measures to deal with the massive evaporation in the lakes and to secure a high-quality potable water supply for the people of Broken Hill. I hope we will get a breakthrough on that sooner rather than later because the people of Broken Hill deserve better.


The Menindee Lakes water-saving project will significantly change how the River Murray is operated. To ensure its success, New South Wales is to engage the Australian, Victorian and South Australian governments as early as possible to make sure the project takes into account all jurisdictions—I emphasise 'all jurisdictions'—and the River Murray water requirements.


I support this bill. I believe this is the best we can do. I also consider that not having a national plan, not going ahead with this, will ultimately harm our irrigators and harm our farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin and all of those great communities that are in that basin. But, of course, it is reasonable, as always, where communities' livelihoods are at stake, where taxpayers' moneys are being expended at a significant level, to ensure a constant scrutiny and questioning. That is why, whilst I may disagree with Senator Leyonhjelm's conclusions in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin, I welcome that level of robust debate because it is a healthy thing in our democracy with respect to getting the best outcome for the great Murray-Darling river system.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-11-08,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (13:00):  I rise to support the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016, which, in the words of the minister, amends the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to allow basin states to notify a second package of sustainable diversion limit adjustment measures.


Let me get straight to the point. If this means that our farmers get more water, One Nation unhesitatingly supports this bill. However, the fact that parliament needs to legislate to allow farmers to draw the water that they need to feed Australia out of the rivers raises the greater concern: just what has happened to water management in this country? The Labor-inspired Murray-Darling Plan is just the latest example of big government telling ordinary Australians what they can do on something as basic as water use. It is contrary to both the spirit and intent of our Australian Constitution and the Australian way of life. The relevant parts of the Constitution are section 99, titled 'Commonwealth not to give preference', and section 100, which states in no uncertain terms:


The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.


What emerged in section 100 was in effect a bill of rights for our farmers and for the residents of the towns along the Murray-Darling. It was never intended under the Constitution that the Commonwealth receive, and the Commonwealth did not receive, any other power—in particular any power over conservation and irrigation. Basically, politicians, including the Nationals, have given away these rights, which should belong to the people.


This is Canberra acting as a puppet of the United Nations and its various instruments, including Agenda 21. Under Agenda 21, section 18 states what they want to do with the Earth Summit that was brought in in 1992, which we became a signatory to with 176 other countries around the world. It was put out to people around the world to look at the privatisation of water. Under chapter 18 of that, the document that I read years ago stated that if you put a dam on your property of a certain size you will only capture about 10 percent of the water into that dam, and for anything else you would actually have to let it flow to the rivers or creeks. If not, you would be taxed on it. It was put in there to actually make sure that water would be privatised around the world. It would become a commodity. Therefore, our right to water would be taken away from us and put into the hands of international interests—those who were to make a lot of money out of it.


Then, I have to say, Agenda 21 has not been in our best interest. If you do not believe me, then go out onto the farms and into the rural areas of the nation, talk to the locals in the pubs and the townships of our country and realise that what I am saying touches the heartstrings across Australia.


Once again, big government is using a big stick to favour extreme environmental claims over the needs of working farms. The left-wing obsession with so-called sustainable development finds expression in Agenda 21's prosperity-denying principles. These, among other things, seek to deny the right of democratic nations to control and regulate their own water to maximise their food production and growth. What we are seeing happening in one state, in South Australia—Senator Xenophon was just here—is that now the state government wants to impose low-flow bypasses on farms and properties there, which is going to deny them the right to use water on their farms and properties—the right to have that water so they can grow their crops. Dams are being stopped from being put in. All I can see across Australia is the controlling of our water.


I also have a grave concern: why did the Howard government, in 2004, separate water from land, allowing people to come in here, buy up the water rights and deny the farming sector the right to that water? It is our right to that water. No government owns it. No-one owns it. Foreign interests should not own this. This is water for the people.


At times I have said that, if we are going to charge the man on the land for the water that is in his dams or deny him the right to expand his farms and to carry the water that will see him through in times of drought, the next thing that will be imposed on the people of Australia is that we will be taxed on the water that we catch in our water tanks. This may start in the farming sector around our country, but eventually every Australian will feel the effects of this if they have a water tank. Over the years, since the time I was a young child, I have seen the rising costs of water in this country. That should never be happening.


What I am proposing is that governments have not looked after the water issues in this country. We have failed to put in enough dams to service the needs of the people. We have not provided that. We are actually shutting it down. We have to be smart. We keep increasing the population in this country, and we are not putting in the infrastructure to cater for this. That is why we must look after putting in more dams and allowing the farmers to have the water they need. We would not need this legislation so the farmers could come cap in hand saying, 'We can have a few more beggarly litres of water.' It should not be happening that way.


The farmers are the people of this land. They are the environmentalists. They are not going to destroy their livelihoods. They have come through generations of looking after the environment, and they are not going to destroy something. Unless we stand by them and protect them with water and with land, we are not going to have the farming sector in this country anymore. I see it constantly shut down. We are now bringing in imports of food, but what I can say is that I hear too often that the food imports are not up to the standard that we impose on our own farmers here. They have to come up to standards that we do not even put on the imports that come into Australia.


I will go back to the whole thing. In conclusion, Australia's national sovereignty is being undermined by the thousands of excessive UN treaties which promote green tape and are death to the best interests of Australia. If all the rivers and creeks that run across this land become subject to the laws of the UN, how long will it be before the rain collected in the tanks on the properties of our farmers will also become subject to Agenda 21 regulation and tax? How long before the UN dictates that we must pay a tax for the privilege of sunlight? Australia is its own country with its own Constitution and should not be dictated to by unrepresentative foreign organisations with agendas that are opposed to our best interests.


I support this bill because I think it is a start, but we have a long way to go. I will call on this parliament and our governments: please support the farming sector. They are struggling. I have just been out there. I have been through on two hay runs to take much-needed hay to farmers. We are not doing enough to support them. If we encourage them to put dams on their properties, they can drought-proof themselves to feed their stock and irrigate through times of drought. I thank you for your time.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-11-08,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:10):  In speaking to the Water Legislation Amendment (Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2016, can I say that the government is absolutely committed to the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Can I also acknowledge the bipartisan approach that was undertaken in establishing this plan in the first place. The 'one basin, one plan' mantra that followed the establishment of the negotiations when this plan was first put in place is a testament, I think, to how governments and oppositions in parliaments can work together to deliver the best possible outcome on something as critical as our water security.


Key to our ability to deliver this plan is recognising that it is not just environmental concerns and outcomes that need to be delivered; we also need to take into account the social and economic impacts of any changes through legislation or regulation. As you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am an irrigator, and I can assure you that there is nobody on the land in Australia that understands better the need for a healthy river environment than an irrigator. It is the basis of our sustainability. Without a healthy river system, we do not have an economy, and without an economy we do not have our river communities.


The SDL adjustment mechanism process is a fundamental part in our ability to deliver this triple-bottom-line outcome. It provides a mechanism by which environmental outcomes can also be tested for their efficiency. We focused on irrigation efficiencies in the initial commencement of the rollout of the plan, whether they be on-farm or off-farm efficiencies for the delivery of water for irrigation, stock and domestic, and other consumptive use purposes. But it is equally important that we use water for environmental purposes equally efficiently.


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan in 2012 set out the process for coordinated and sustainable management of this very important river system. It also set out the long-term-average sustainable diversion limits, and it included an adjustment mechanism to adjust those limits by up to five per cent. The adjustment mechanism provides for the amendment of the SDLs based on either supply measure projects that deliver the Basin Plan environmental outcomes with less environmental water or efficiency measure projects that recover more environmental water in ways that deliver neutral or beneficial social and economic outcomes.


This bill amends the Basin Plan to provide for a second opportunity to notify adjustment measures by 30 June 2017. It provides another opportunity for the basin states to develop new projects to allow the SDL to be adjusted—and beyond those that have already been notified as of June 2016. It provides opportunities to maximise social, economic and environmental outcomes of the Basin Plan by augmenting the potential SDL adjustment.


It also builds on the Australian government's commitment to sustainable agricultural production. As you would well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, water is an absolutely critical input to agriculture, and it is one of the key pillars of this government's platform that agriculture is a very important part of our economy. We have done other things through the implementation of the plan. We have applied a sense of adaptive management to the implementation of this plan, an example of which was the capping of water purchases as part of the return of water for this purpose to 1,500 gigalitres last year.


We have also looked at some other really exciting measures for our ability to deliver efficient environmental water. There are such initiatives as the other no-flow measures that are being currently considered, the most famous of which is the carp control measure, which we are hoping will clear the river of the toxic carp that have been introduced and, in the process of doing so, increase our native fish populations. Up until now, this has not been able to be considered as an adjustment mechanism. However, we have given the states the opportunity to consider this and other types of no-flow measures, which could add to the environmental outcomes with either no damage at all to the social and economic communities that rely on the river or possibly even providing additional benefits.


We intend to continue to work in partnership with the basin states. As you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, the Basin Plan requires the support of all of the basin states for us to be able to make any changes in the delivery of the legislation and the regulations that sit with it. I also assure Senator Hanson that we are very well aware of the rights of irrigators and of people and the communities who live on the river. One of the fundamental rights that we absolutely understand are riparian rights—that is, the rights of those people who live down river are equally entitled to expect that water will also flow past their properties and they will have access to it. This is not a case of those highest up the river get the best deal.


In concluding, I thank everybody—the opposition, the Nick Xenophon Team, the One Nation team, Senator Leyonhjelm and the other crossbenchers, and of course the Greens, who I am hoping will also be supporting this because of the importance of this delivering for the whole river community—for the support of this bill and I commend the bill to the Senate.

When subsequent information emerged which suggested that there may be a link, we made a decision, under the circumstances, not to pay any rent.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:09):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions asked by Senators Cameron and Farrell relating to the provision of funds to the North East Vocational College.


I have never heard such a hapless defence of the rorting of public funds by any government as the pathetic defence put up by Senator Birmingham today. He is a minister who went to the North East Vocational College with Senator Day in May 2015. He met with Senator Day in June 2015 and received a presentation from Senator Day on his so-called alternative apprenticeship models. He then set up an advisory group and used that advisory group through the next minister, Minister Hartsuyker, to provide $1.84 million and GST on top of that—over $2 million of public funds—to Senator Day's pet project, the North East Vocational College.


Why was that done? That was done because former Senator Day provided many services to the coalition. It was a payment for services rendered to the coalition. It was a payment because Senator Day, at that time, was a reliable and consistent vote for the government. That is why a request for $1.4 million from Senator Day resulted in this minister and his government providing over $2 million to Senator Day's pet project—that is, to take employment rights and a contract of training away from apprentices in South Australia, because that is what the result of this is. It is not an alternative apprenticeship. These young people who will be undertaking this so-called training in the North East Vocational College under the guise of an alternative apprenticeship will never be classified as a tradesperson. It does not meet the law of the land. It does not meet what is required to be a tradesperson. What Senator Day was seeking to do was to have these young people engaged as students, so they would be paid no money from an employer. They would be forced to rely on VET FEE-HELP and student loans. This was the magical so-called program that was going to deliver benefits to the apprenticeship system. It was not even about a proper apprenticeship. This was simply a rort. This was a project put in place to award former Senator Day for his loyalty to the coalition government. That is what this was about. It was a reward for loyalty.


For Senator Birmingham to sit there and tell us that he may have met Senator Day is an absolute contempt of this place. All you have to do is go to the departmental advice to Mr Hartsuyker, the then minister, where it says, 'Senator Day presented his proposal to the former Assistant Minister for Education and Training, Senator the Hon. Simon Birmingham, on 1 June 2015 and subsequently presented to the Apprenticeships Reform Advisory Group on 14 September.' There were no ifs or buts. The minister should have been honest. The minister should have been up-front and accepted that he did meet Senator Day, but what he did—




Senator Brandis:
  The senator is reflecting on the minister. The senator said the minister should have been honest. There is a plain assertion the minister is being dishonest. That is unparliamentary. It must be withdrawn.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  I did not hear the comment, but I would ask Senator Cameron, if he made the comment, to perhaps think about rephrasing.





Senator CAMERON:
  If it assists the Senate I will do that. Senator Day was getting special benefits from the coalition for his fealty to the coalition, for doing everything the coalition wanted him to do. Senator Day and Senator Birmingham were in this up to their necks. This was a misuse of public money. This was an unacceptable operation and this should be clearly looked at further, because this is a complete misuse of public money to make sure a vote was received. (Time expired)

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:14):  I had a real sense of deja vu when I was sitting here during question time today listening to the questions asked by those opposite, and I had to check the date just to make sure that we had not been transported back three weeks ago when the Senate last sat and those opposite pursued a very similar line of questioning on an unrelated but obviously to them very important matter. That matter was, of course, the Solicitor-General. They asked question after question, day after day, but I note upon return to the Senate this week that they have lost their interest in that matter and they are no longer taking it up. 


I hope that in a few weeks time they look back at their questions on this matter in a similar light and they move on, because what they have demonstrated is a total lack of interest in the policy issues that affect the lives of the Australian people. They have demonstrated a total obsession with their ideas—their fantasies—of scandals that need to be pursued at the expense of real policy issues that actually affect the lives of Australian people. 


I would have thought that someone such as Senator Cameron, himself a former union official, who now in his new life is a self-appointed spokesperson for working people, would actually be interested in the policy merits of this issue, in apprenticeships and in what this government is trying to do to fix the absolute disaster that was left to it by the former government and the quartering of apprenticeship numbers across the country, but no. All that Senator Cameron appeared to be interested in doing was slurring the education minister, slurring former senator Bob Day and making two very serious accusations, which I think should be dealt with.


The first part of his accusation—or, certainly implied by his comments—was that this government is engaging in a practice of buying the votes of crossbench senators with taxpayers' money. That is a serious accusation, which he has absolutely failed to back up and absolutely failed to demonstrate is true. The second thing which he engaged in was an attempt to suggest that former Senator Day is someone who is able to be bought by taxpayers' money to a training organisation. That is a very unfair and unjust slur. 


I have had the pleasure of knowing former Senator Day briefly in this role, as we briefly overlapped in the Senate, and I also knew him in both of our previous lives prior to being senators. All that I can say about former Senator Day is that in all my personal dealings with him I have found him to be an honourable person, an upstanding person, an honest person, a person who tries his best. He has obviously fallen on hard times with his business, and that is a sad thing. That is something that all of us should be sad about—not just for him and his workers and his customers but because of the distinguished contribution he had been making to the Senate prior to that. I think he is a loss to this place. But those opposite are only interested in smear and innuendo without much evidence to back it up. 


Why don't we turn to the actual policy issue at hand here—the actual substance of the issue of apprenticeships. The previous government cut $1.2 billion in apprenticeship incentives in government, and that led to the single largest drop in apprenticeships on record. Perhaps it is not a surprise then that they are not so interested in talking about the policy merits but instead are pursuing a strategy of smear and innuendo. 


Senator Birmingham established and commissioned the Apprenticeships Reform Advisory Group to consider a range of issues, including incentives, pre-apprenticeships and alternative models. The advisory group made 22 recommendations, including to explore and pilot alternative apprenticeship delivery arrangements. The government addressed this recommendation by providing $9.2 million under the apprenticeships training alternative delivery pilots initiative. The Australian government is funding five projects under the pilots. The pilots are being delivered by Master Builders Australia, the National Electrical and Communications Association, the North East Vocational College, the Australian Industry Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers.


The pilots will test the training models, which will provide alternative skills development options for both industry and those undertaking the training. The Turnbull government wants to support industry efforts to explore new arrangements and examine and test potential regulatory or administrative barriers to innovative, industry-led apprenticeship training practices, something we have to do due to the failure of the former government.


I end my remarks by awarding a gold star to Senator Moore, who was able to ask a policy question today in Senate question time, and I encourage those opposite to come back tomorrow with some more substantive matters.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2016-11-08,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:19):  Today we saw more obfuscation and obstruction in relation to this whole sordid Bob Day affair. From what we have seen over the last two days and in media reports leading up to this week, it is quite clear that the Abbott-Turnbull government has let nothing get in the way of securing Bob Day's support for its antiworker agenda. The Leader of the Government in the Senate is not at this stage front and centre of this discussion, but the performances of Senator Cormann and Senator Birmingham in the Senate have been less than satisfactory. In my contribution to the address-in-reply I compared Senator Brandis and some of his efforts in recent times to Donald Trump and what we are seeing in America. At the moment, Senator Brandis is the ball and chain around Malcolm Turnbull. Senator Brandis can no longer carry that on. At some stage, we are going to see the Prime Minister act in regard to Senator Brandis's role in this matter and also to his role in regard to the Solicitor-General matter.


Senator Birmingham, the Minister for Education and Training, clearly has not given satisfactory answers today to the questions that have been asked about his conduct. We have to ask ourselves why that is. It is absolutely clear and well known that Senator Day was the most reliable vote for the coalition on their agenda. We know that those opposite want to bring in changes to the workplace laws, in relation to the ABCC. We get lectures about how important that is. But we still have not seen the legislation. It has still not come before the chamber. Why is that the case? Why were they working so feverishly to keep Bob Day in this chamber?


Serious questions were asked of Senator Birmingham today as to how the government came to fund a training college that Senator Day was the director of, to the tune of $2 million. They were not adequately answered. Senator Birmingham actually toured the North East Vocational College in May 2015, but in estimates last month completely forgot that Senator Day was there with him. That is despite the fact that Senator Day subsequently met with the minister a month later to push his case further. At estimates it was also revealed that the department knew about Senator Day's involvement in the organisation and had told the minister about that involvement. Yet Senator Birmingham still gave the college over $2 million in taxpayers' funds, while Senator Day's businesses were going down the gurgler. Senator Birmingham failed to answer questions about these issues today. He also failed to answer questions regarding the role of Mr Hartsuyker in this matter. It is outrageous that the government has aided and abetted Senator Day over the last couple of months in relation to this issue.


Senator Cormann was, at that stage, Acting Special Minister of State. His so-called comprehensive statement left a lot to be desired in relation to the spelling out of his role in this matter. Again, today, he failed to answer the questions that were put to him. Senator Cormann revealed yesterday that shortly after he had been sworn into the job, on 29 December last year, Senator Day emailed him about whether the Commonwealth would be paying rent for his office. Senator Cormann was ready and willing to make that happen. He wrote back to the senator agreeing to provide an extra six months of rental back payments for the property. That was until, it seems, the Department of Finance put the brakes on the matter, and a simple search found that the bank account details were linked to Senator Day. That was in March, some three months before an election was due, but the government raised no concerns about Senator Day's ability to stand in the election campaign.


What makes matters worse for this government is that it really should have seen this coming. It should not have been blinded by their need to secure Senator Day's vote for its antiworker agenda. The coalition would have known a lot about 77 Fullarton Road. It is the same building that Senator Bernardi's Conservative Leadership Foundation was based in. Maybe Senator Bernardi smelled a rat that Senator Cormann didn't, because he vacated the premises last year. It is beyond ridiculous that the government has let this go this far. Senator Day was even using the email address 'bobday@77fullarton.com.au' in his direct emails to ministers. It is beyond ridiculous that the government could not see this. (Time expired)

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:24):  May I first express my disappointment at the quality, the tone and the intent of the questions of those opposite today. I realise that I am new to this place, but—



Senator Gallacher interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  Senator Gallacher's question was one of those, Madam Deputy Speaker. I realise that I am new to this place, but I really had hoped to learn my statecraft not only from those on my own side of the chamber but also from the wisdom and experience of those opposite. I have been sadly disappointed. You can only imagine my disappointment at the questions of those opposite today. There are so many important issues to address in this place—so much going on that matters to the lives of ordinary Australians and that matters—



Senator Gallacher interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  That matters to your constituents: so much that affects their everyday lives. Yet the opposition continues to pursue a line of questioning that has already been comprehensively dealt with by Senator Ryan, Special Minister of State; that has been comprehensively dealt with by Senator Cormann, Minister for Finance; and that has been methodically addressed and transparently presented to this chamber just 24 hours ago. And today the issue of the North East Vocational College and the alternative apprentice pilot was comprehensively dealt with by Senator Birmingham.


There is no doubt that we have been presented with complex legal and constitutional issues by Senator Day and, indeed, there is no definitive body of jurisprudence on section 44(v), so I will give the opposition the benefit of the doubt. Because this is such a complex legal and constitutional issue, it is perhaps no wonder that those opposite continue to ask questions that have already been comprehensively answered by the Special Minister of State and the Minister for Finance.


They were unequivocal in their remarks. The government has taken every step to explore this matter, to seek further facts and then to take the appropriate steps to bring these matters to the appropriate body for consideration. The Special Minister of State appropriately sought and received legal advice—and the advice was comprehensive, but it was not determinative. Indeed, in this case the Special Minister of State cannot determine whether there has been a breach of the Constitution. The ultimate answer will not come from the Special Minister of State, nor will it come from the Minister for Finance, despite the persistent questioning of those opposite.


The ultimate answer in this case will not come from the government. Indeed, the ultimate answer in this case will not come from the Senate. This is a matter for the court to decide. The government moved a motion in the Senate to refer the election of the former Senator Bob Day to the High Court to determine whether there has in fact been a breach of section 44(v) of the Constitution, and that motion passed unanimously. As this matter has now been referred to the High Court it is important that we respect the process, and it would be highly, highly inappropriate for any person to pre-empt their decision in this complex legal and constitutional matter. So it is time to move on. It is time to move on to the important matters of state.


My frustration lies with an opposition that will not talk about those matters. Why is it that the opposition is not talking about the Enterprise Tax Plan? Why is it that they are not talking about why it is important to reduce company tax rates to create jobs and growth opportunities? Why is it that they are not talking about superannuation reform? These are the issues of the day. These are the issues that are in the newspapers, that we talk about at doorstops and that are going on in the other place. Why are they not talking about this here?


Why are they not talking about mental health, an issue that is the scourge of our society? There are no questions about those things here. It is simply political game-playing. Why are they not talking about Northern Australia infrastructure and all the opportunities that present themselves there? Why are they not talking about the working holiday-makers tax plan that we have spent so much effort getting just right to be fair for all Australians, and to assist our regional and rural industries and tourism industries? And why are they not talking about the ABCC and registered organisations bills, which are so important to the progress and productivity of our country? (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2016-11-08,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:30):  I will attempt to answer a couple of those questions posed by Senator Hume. The simple facts are that, based on eminent advice given to the government, Senator Day's qualification to be a senator has been referred to the High Court based on whether or not he had a pecuniary interest in a facility. Anybody who has been elected to the Senate will know that, when you get elected, you get offered an office. They say: 'There's an office. It's been leased. Move into it.' I have been in Senator Farrell's old office, eminently fitted out and eminently suited for the work of a senator—but not for Senator Day. Senator Day says, 'No, I'm not going there. I refuse to go there' for whatever reasons he trotted out. This is why we are talking about it now. It is because of the actions of several special ministers of state in conceding to Senator Day's position that he is not moving into an office. There are other senators on this side of the chamber and on that side of the chamber who did not want to move into a particular facility, but, in order to make sure taxpayers' money was effectively used, they did. They waited until the lease expired or till an arrangement was made and then moved.


We are talking about the Hon. Simon Birmingham's position in all this, and I think it is worth putting on the record why it is worth following up another aspect of Senator Day's activity: his pursuit of this grant for this vocational training college. We know from a cursory examination of the media that the $1.84 million handed to the college chaired for a decade by Senator Day equates to $90,000 for each of the 20 construction apprentices involved in a four-year trial of Mr Day's pet project. The equivalent certificate IV in construction and building at TAFE costs just $30,000 per student. There is a huge disconnect there. The other providers of TAFE certificate IV are only charging $30,000 per student, and Mr Day's college was handed the same sum as the two industry bodies, Master Builders Australia and the National Electrical and Communications Association, who promised to train hundreds of apprentices.


So it is not that we are reinventing the wheel here; we are questioning the actions of authorised ministers in the government: special ministers of state Ronaldson, Ryan and Cormann and Senator Birmingham in respect of his role in granting this very generous provision to Senator Day—almost three times the industry standard in cost for a lot fewer students. These are legitimate questions for debate in this place. I totally reject Senator Paterson and Senator Hume's assertion that we are on the wrong track here. This is about probity. This is about taxpayers' money. This is about due diligence and governance. As Shakespeare said, there is something rotten in Denmark. There is something rotten on that side. They have not acted with due diligence, governance and probity in respect of Senator Day's office and they have not acted with due diligence and probity in respect of granting his pet project an extreme amount of money equivalent to that given to the Master Builders and the electricians, who train hundreds of apprentices, at more than twice or even three times the cost. That does not look good on their resume. It has happened on their watch.


Senator Cameron has been very vigorous in saying that they got paid for that, that Senator Day voted for them all the time. I do not know if that is the case, but you are entitled to ask the question. You are entitled to join the dots. He was able to get away with a situation which no senator that I know has been able to get away with: refusing to move into a taxpayer funded office. He has then had a project which has been funded at double the cost of the industry standard for not as many people. You are entitled to ask those ministers on the other side questions about this behaviour. They have all got sworn statements and they have something to explain. It will continue. (Time expired)

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-11-08,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (15:55):  It is worth starting this contribution with a clear statement of fact: the government's so-called border protection policies have failed in every conceivable way. This is a government that have a policy framework in extreme disarray. Firstly, they have failed in human terms—the basic test.



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  The basic test, Senator Bushby—they have failed in human terms, because they rely on the deliberate mistreatment of men, women and children in Australia's detention centre network. Make no mistake: people have died at their own hand as a result of this government's policy and the neglect of this government. Others have been badly injured and there is a toll, as yet unrevealed, specifically in terms of those who have been left traumatised and mentally scarred, no doubt in many cases for life, because of this government's policy. So the cost in human terms has been absolutely massive. Remember, Amnesty International, an extremely well-regarded non-political international organisation, has found that what is happening to people on Nauru fits the internationally accepted definition of torture. What do we get from the government in response to that allegation? We get a blanket denial, with no engagement at all on the detail of what constitutes torture, on the detail of what we are doing to these poor children, women and men on Nauru. It is effectively a government that is putting its fingers in its ears and saying, 'La, la, la,' every time something is said that it disagrees with.


There is still no solution for the people on Manus Island and Nauru. The Papua New Guinean foreign minister said just yesterday that the Manus refugee processing centre is undergoing final phases of shutting down. If it is in the final phases of shutting down, as the Papua New Guinean government is saying publicly, what is going to happen to those poor people who are incarcerated there in Australia's name? What is going to happen to them? The answer from the government is deafening silence. We know from public statements made by Australian ministers that the Australian government is in negotiation with other countries to try to find a resettlement option for the people on Manus Island and Nauru when the only reasonable settlement option is staring them in the face: bring those people, our fellow human beings, back to Australia so that we can look after them properly in line with our moral obligation to them and in line with our international obligations under instruments such as the refugee convention.


We have seen sad tale after sad tale. The Nauru files made it abundantly clear that we have seen widespread violence and abuse, including sexual abuse, against men, children and women who have sought Australia's protection. They reach out a hand, asking us to look after them, to help them, and we kick them in the face. We subject them to arbitrary imprisonment and we expose them to conditions of torture.


The Nauru files also made clear the deliberate under-reporting and downplaying of serious incidents on Nauru. As the landmark Island of despair report from Amnesty International recently made clear, what is happening on Nauru is torture and it is Australia's responsibility. For the Attorney to come here and to quote a High Court case, as he did earlier today, that found that Australia is not responsible for what is happening on Nauru simply ignores reality. We are funding every single dollar of expenditure on Nauru. Every single dollar of expenditure on the detention centre on Nauru is being funded by the Australian taxpayer. What the government is doing is outsourcing cruelty and torture. That is what our government is doing.


The framework is also in disarray because we are witnessing contractor after contractor abandoning offshore detention in absolute droves because they know that they are suffering extreme reputational damage by being associated with such cruel and draconian conditions. We have seen Wilson Security and Broadspectrum pull out of providing services on Manus and on Nauru after strong public campaigns against them. So we are seeing contractor after contractor voting with their feet and saying that they do not want their company associated with what is going on on Manus and on Nauru due to the reputational damage they are suffering. 


The policy has also been a failure in pure financial terms, so it is not just the massive human cost that we are dealing with here. In pure dollar terms, the cost of Operation Sovereign Borders has blown out to almost $10 billion in the last three years. The Australia National Audit Office found that the department was not following government procedure in issuing tenders, which has resulted in massive overspends. It also found that Australia's policy framework is costing well over half a million dollars—in fact, $573,000—per detainee per year. This is a government that spent the last few years warning Australia that we had a budget crisis. Well, if we have a budget crisis, why on earth would they implement a policy regime that has cost well over half a million dollars per person per year to detail people on Manus and on Nauru. 


At the core of this government's policy is an overwhelming desire for secrecy because the government simply does not want the rest of the world to know what is being done in our name. That is why section 42 of the Border Force Act imposes terms of imprisonment for up to two years for people who blow the whistle on what is going on on Manus Island and on Nauru. How instructive that, in fact, that provision has recently been overturned for doctors because a group of doctors had a High Court case coming up. 


But, if it is good enough to remove the gag from doctors, what about teachers, nurses and the many other categories of support workers who operate on Manus and on Nauru. They still remain caught by section 42 of the Border Force Act. They still face a term of imprisonment for up to two years if they speak publicly about what they have witnessed in those places. This is a commitment to secrecy almost unparalleled in recent Australian history. This is a government that knows that it ought to be ashamed of what it is doing and a government that has a commitment to secrecy that is, quite frankly, disgusting and disgraceful.


One day the truth will come out. The full truth of the horrors of this regime and this policy framework will come out. There will be a truth and reconciliation style process. Mark my words; one day in the future, and I do not know when it will be, an Australian Prime Minister will stand up in this parliament and apologise for what is being done today and what has been done over the last few years. Yes, that will be a great day and, yes, that is a necessary thing to occur, but this is happening today. The solution is obvious: engage with our regional partners and come up with a cooperative policy framework that has reasonable times for assessing people's claims for asylum and their claims for refugee status and ensure that those time frames are followed. It is not the situation now, where you front up in Kuala Lumpur at the UNHCR office and get told to come back in three years time for your first appointment. We need a comprehensive policy solution. It can only be delivered on a regional basis—that is, Australia working collaboratively with other countries in our region. Yes, we should contribute financially to it. We can do that by closing the camps and bringing the people who are in those camps here to Australia, and save the $3 billion a year plus that it is currently costing us to run those camps.


This is a policy failure, because although the mantra of this government is, 'The boats have stopped,' in fact we know that they have not—on the government's own admission. This government and the previous government under Tony Abbott have, on their own figures, turned back or intercepted 30 boats since Operation Sovereign Borders started three years ago. They are running at about one a month, on the government's own figures. They are just the ones they are admitting to. They are the ones that we know have been turned back and intercepted. So, when the Attorney gets up and says, 'No people have died at sea,' it is a claim he cannot reasonably make because that claim would rely on the government knowing exactly when boats set off to sea. We know that they do not know that, because many of those boats have nearly made it to Australia before they have been turned back or intercepted. I ask the government: how many people have died between their boats setting out to sea and the government first becoming aware of them? The answer, of course, is that the government do not know. None of us know. To assert that no-one has died at sea is a falsehood. The government cannot reasonably make that claim.


What of the ones that we do turn back? We are turning back people to die somewhere else. We are turning back people to face arbitrary detention, arbitrary imprisonment, torture and potentially death. This idea that no-one is dying under this government's policy is quite simply untrue. The government cannot possibly make that claim. 


So we have a military-like shroud of secrecy that has been thrown over this government's nonsensical, ineffective, inconsistent policy framework, where the best they can do is say 'no comment' on operational matters because that is the phrase they use to keep the Australian people in the dark about what is going on. Make no mistake, a Prime Minister will apologise for what is happening today in the future. That will be a necessary step in the healing that this country needs to undergo to get over the cruel and inhumane policies of today.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:10):  I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate today, and I thank the Greens and Senator McKim for moving this motion. It is funny, in a way, that the government is very happy to talk about this issue and the Greens are very happy to talk about this issue. We are happy to talk about this issue because we have a record that we are proud of—and I will come to that in a moment. The Greens are happy to talk about this issue because they have a very sincere and deeply held belief on this issue—I do not share it and I think it is a bit strange—and they have been prosecuting their point of view on this issue consistently for many years. What I have left out there is the Labor Party. Interestingly, on the day on which they finally resolved their position on this issue and declared their hand—that they would be opposing the proposed legislation by Minister Dutton—they did not ask a single question in question time in the Senate today about this issue. It fell to Senator McKim to ask a question on behalf of the Greens. It fell to Senator Reynolds to ask a question about it on behalf of the government.


Those opposite showed a curious lack of interest in this issue—although I am looking forward to Senator Carr's contribution to the debate shortly. Personally, I do not think Senator Carr has a great deal to be proud of. Senator Carr was part of a government which at the encouragement of, in part, the Greens presided over one of the greatest public policy failures in the 21st century. I think there will be an apology by a future Australian Prime Minister, as Senator McKim said, but it will not be for the strong border protection policies that this government has implemented, nor the strong border protection policies that John Howard and his government implemented, both of which saved lives; it will in fact be the border protection—or lack thereof—policies that prevailed between 2007 and 2013 which wreaked a trail of human havoc and misery for six years, for which those opposite have still not been held responsible but should bear great shame.


This is their record. In 2007, when they came to government, they were warned: 'Do not weaken John Howard's successful, strong border protection policies. If you do, there will be serious consequences.' Opposition leaders Nelson, Turnbull and Abbott all pleaded with various iterations of that government to not water down and weaken John Howard's successful border protection policies. They did not follow that advice. They ignored that advice. And the result of ignoring that advice was that, over six years, 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals came on 800 boats. Over 8,000 children were placed into detention. We know of at least 1,200 deaths that occurred at sea—although there may have been more. There was an $11 billion blowout in the border protection budget and there were 17 new detention centres opened.


I remember, in the dying days of the Howard government, the great criticism made of the detention centres in operation. They were many fewer than the number that had to be opened and operated under the Labor government under former prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. I remember all the criticisms of the harsh conditions in detention centres. By the end of the Howard government—and again under this government—there were no people experiencing those conditions. But, under the former Labor government, 8,000 children alone experienced those conditions.


By contrast, this government has a very proud record of recognising the problem created by our predecessors, acting to fix that problem and having success in doing so. Under our watch, there have been no deaths at sea. That is despite the fact that, when we were in opposition, we were warned that if we implemented a policy of boat turn-backs, tough border protection policies—temporary protection visas and other measures—there would be deaths at sea and human carnage from that. We were warned not just that it was wrong and not just that it would not work but that it was illegal and immoral. But we proceeded with our policy and it has been a stunning success. There have now been 835 days without a boat arrival. All the children who were put in detention by the previous Labor government are now out of detention. The 17 detention centres that were opened under their watch have now been closed, and our humanitarian intake is to be increased from 13,750 to 18,750 by 2018-19.


I have to borrow a phrase from one of my distinguished colleagues, Senator Abetz, who, commenting recently on Kevin Rudd's opinion piece on this issue, said that it was very much reminiscent of an arsonist returning to a fire and giving a lecture to the firefighters about how to fight that fire. Sadly, we have seen, with the decision taken by the opposition today, that they too are arsonists coming back to lecture firefighters.


In 2013, members opposite were part of a government that ran an expensive, lavish taxpayer-funded advertising campaign. It featured grainy writing; it featured photos of boats; it was translated into many languages; it was published here in Australia and overseas; and it said, 'If you come here by boat, you will never be settled in Australia.' This government and Peter Dutton are trying to put into effect that promise, made in 2013 by Kevin Rudd and those opposite.


There are two options here for those opposite. One is to admit that they were insincere in 2013, that they did not really believe it. They were just pretending to be tough on border protection because they knew there would be political consequences if they did not, and because they were aware of their failings while in government. The other option is that they have changed their minds since. That is fair and reasonable, because we do all change our minds. But if they have changed their minds, they should admit it and should explain why Bill Shorten's promise, made prior to this election, that he would be a carbon copy of the coalition when it comes to border protection, was also false. Their record on this issue is nothing to be proud of. By contrast, we in the coalition can be very proud of our great success in this policy area.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:17):  It is great to be here and to follow Senator Paterson and his remarks. I am not surprised that he is quoting Senator Abetz, because they are bedfellows in many ways. It strikes me that this government has demonstrated that its measures to impose a lifetime ban on entry to Australia for asylum seekers who arrive by boat are crazy and desperate politics. It is crazy because the ban would even exclude people who have been assessed as genuine refugees and have been settled in a third country who then seek to make temporary visits to Australia on business or as tourists. It is desperate because it is a measure of just how far this government is prepared to go to win over the xenophobes of One Nation. And it is a measure of the obsequious capitulation of this Prime Minister to the very hard right elements of Senator Paterson's type within the Liberal Party and the National Party, in a desperate attempt to stay afloat in what is a drowning government. The implication of this measure has not been lost on One Nation. Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts have both crowed about the assertion that they are in fact responsible for this government's measures.


This bill, proposed by this government, is in fact very broad in its sweep. It would permanently exclude from Australia, in all circumstances, anyone who is over the age of 18 when they are taken to Manus or Nauru—that is, anyone taken after 19 July 2013. It may well be that these people are still in an offshore centre. It may well be that they are in a detention centre in Australia. It may well be that they are in community detention in Australia. It may well be that they are people who have voluntarily resolved to return to their country of origin. They may well be people who have resettled in a third country.


This measure, that this government announced, would affect 3,000 people. It is a blanket exclusion, and the very idea of it is so ridiculous, if anyone actually thought about it for any length of time at all. We would see a person excluded who is a refugee who was settled in another country and wishes to come to this country as a tourist. And that may well be in 10 or 20 years time. That in itself is sufficiently ludicrous, I would have thought.


Just think about this for a moment. Are we talking about a surgeon who might want to come here to attend a medical conference? Are we talking about a person who came to Australia as a refugee, was resettled in another country and who ends up winning a Nobel Prize? What would happen to those folks? Of course we might even have a person who has been a refugee, settles in another country and ends up being the Prime Minister of another country! Under these measures, they would be excluded. The government says, 'Yes, but there is this ""ministerial discretion"".' How ludicrous would it be if a prominent person, a prominent citizen of another country, cannot visit this country on a temporary visa because they had once sought refugee protection in this country and arrived by boat? If they arrived by plane, of course they would not be affected. That measure would not apply. They would have to rely upon the good graces of a future politician, in this case a minister, to show the appropriate discretion in those circumstances.


Labor have made it perfectly clear: we support the offshore processing of people who do arrive by boat. And while we do say that those persons should not settle in this country, it is a very different measure to propose that they should never visit Australia. Of course the attempts to verbal Labor with regard to this know very few limits. What we are seeing in this circumstance is just how far this government is prepared to go to try to wedge Labor. We know that this is a proposition that flies in the face of common humanity. Labor have always said, 'Yes, we want offshore processing', but we have made it very clear that it cannot be on the basis of indefinite detention. We never ever have said that the conditions of confinement of detention in themselves should be a deterrent for people seeking to apply for refugee status in this country. But that is exactly what has happened under this government: the very conditions on Nauru and Manus have been used by this government as a deterrent in itself.


The inhumanity of that proposition has drawn worldwide protest. And this measure that the government is proposing now goes even further, because it demonstrates that in these circumstances there is no depth to which this government will not sink to when it comes to the question of seeking to actually force people into a position of demonising refugees. This is irrespective of the international implications of this measure. It has been made perfectly clear that Labor would not support breaches of international law. And we have a situation where the UNHCR regional representatives in Canberra have made some comments on this matter. What we are raising are very serious concerns: Australia is a signatory to the Refugee Convention, and in article 31 it states:


2. The Contracting States shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularized or they obtain admission into another country.


Professor Ben Saul, the Challis Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney, has raised very serious concerns about the government's approach in terms of its potential breaches of Australia's international law obligation. He argues that this measure breaches article 31 of the Refugee Convention as well as Australia's family reunion obligations under article 17 and article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 


This is a situation where the government is quite prepared to verbal its opponents, is quite prepared to say and do anything to try to justify its actions. And what we know is that under these circumstances it is constantly engaged in a downward spiral of brutality when it comes to the question of asylum seekers. We demean ourselves as a country when we allow that type of behaviour to go unchallenged. We simply cannot allow people to be abused in our name in that way. That is why the Labor Party were very keen to participate in the Senate inquiry into the reports of abuse on Nauru. And we have sought to ensure that our offshore facilities are subject to proper independent oversight, because we want to make sure that we do not have a circumstance where our international reputation as a compassionate society is actually brought into question.


This government argues that this is now a matter of national security. Is there any limit to the hyperbole that we are going to be subjected to on these questions? We have seen a government that has offered no rational and certainly no consistent explanation for why these measures are necessary. That is why we are left with the conclusion that this is a government that is desperate to find yet another example to divide the community. This is another example of the way in which it seeks to demonise refugees no matter what the circumstances of their departure from other countries have been or the conditions under which they are held. Instead of paying proper attention to finding alternative sites for people to take up residence in another country, this is a government that is now seeking to use this as a device to delude the Australian people about its actual intentions here.


We have on Nauru a situation where thousands of people have been left completely without hope of future engagement and without the prospect that they are entitled to have of saying that the people who are detaining them—the legal fiction is that it is the government of Nauru, but the reality is that it is the actions of this government—have obligations to ensure they are treated humanely and that their conditions are not in themselves part of any deterrent regime. This government has an obligation to ensure that there are third-party settlement arrangements put in place.


The government is deluding itself if it thinks there is widespread support in the Australian community for these types of demeaning measures. My office has been subjected to quite a large amount of correspondence and a number of complaints on this matter. I have not seen anything quite like it from such a wide group of people who are genuinely concerned that this is a bridge far too far.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2016-11-08,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:27):  I rise to speak on the issue of the brutal detention of refugees on Nauru and Manus and the government's cynical amendments to try to prevent permanent settlement of boat people seeking asylum on our shores. This whole proposal to ban people seeking asylum for their entire lives from visiting Australia makes me think of a quote from Martin Luther King, in that it would be 'adding a deeper darkness into a night already devoid of stars'. He went on to say:


Darkness cannot drive out of darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.


This government wants Australians to be hateful, heartless and cruel. It wants us to be afraid. It wants us to be scared of the 'other'. It wants us to somehow turn a blind eye to the very expensive torture that is happening in our name just off our shores, funded by our taxpayer dollars—$3 billion a year out of our budget. That is what this government spends on locking up women, men and children who have fled circumstances that many of us will never have to face simply because they want their families safe and they want to be able to live their lives and contribute to society in a way where they are not threatened with death, torture or persecution. They simply want to be able to have a safe life and contribute. This government wants us to be afraid of those people. It tells us that we need to lock them up, make sure that nobody whistle blows and tells us what is happening in those detention centres and allow them to be subject to abuse, even sexual abuse, including even children, and that somehow that will make us safer.


I do not think anybody buys that. The reason I say that is that there have been some very heartening examples recently in Queensland which I want to share with the chamber where people have stood up to that cruel rhetoric that is sheer nonsense and have said: 'No. That is not who we are. We are welcoming. We are strong. We are stronger in our diversity, and we are safer when we are kind to people than when we demonise them.' The example I am thinking of and have spoken on in this chamber before is the staff and workers at the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital. When Baby Asha came into their care from Nauru, they nursed her and her mother back to health. They then refused to release Baby Asha back into the arms of the government that would have deported her back to Nauru. They kept her in the care of the hospital until such time as the government agreed not to deport that child. They stared down the fear and the demonising that this government wants us all to accept. They stared that down and they won. On that day—as on other days, but on that day in particular—I was so proud to be a Queenslander and I was so proud of those people for taking a stand for all of us and letting the government know that we can be stronger and kinder and safer if we simply do not demonise other human beings who are coming to our shores seeking refuge.


We had a great win that day, and perhaps there was some cause for hope. Sadly, that cause for hope has been dashed because this government has found a new low. I did not think it was possible that we could sink to further lows in this debate and this country's treatment of people seeking asylum, but this government has managed it. Whether or not they are pandering to the racism and bigotry of the new One Nation party in this place or whether they have always been as cruel and heartless as this, they have now found a new low in that they want to deprive people, some of whom have already been settled here in Australia, of ever staying here permanently, or even of ever visiting.


The sheer nonsense in that approach is just ridiculous. What is particularly important now is that we do not see bipartisan support for this new low. Sadly, we have seen bipartisan support for offshore detention. We have seen the boats turned back—the deaths are still happening, just not in our waters. We have seen $3 billion every year spent on holding people in prisonlike conditions where they are tortured and abused. We cannot see bipartisan support for this new low.


I would urge the Labor Party not just to allow people to come as tourists in the future—yes, of course, it is the very least they should support—but to block this proposal by the government for a ban on permanent resettlement of refugees and asylum seekers who have spent time on Manus or Nauru. If we do not see that commitment from the Labor Party then it will truly be a black day in this country's history, and it will be a day that does not reflect the warm hearts of so many Australians, and Queenslanders in particular, who want a different approach that actually welcomes and strengthens our community.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:32):  I too rise to speak in relation to this matter of public importance. There are no easy solutions in dealing with the scourge of people smuggling, and no-one in this place has a monopoly on compassion. I believe that the most compassionate—indeed the only—option is to put and keep people smugglers out of business and to worry not about future tourists in 30 years but about the 14,000 people waiting to our north who want to come here by boat, to stop them from drowning. That to me is by far and away the most compassionate course of action, preventing deaths now and not worrying about tourists in 20, 30 or 40 years time.


Often in this place we do not give enough consideration to the real-world implications of the words we use in this chamber. Those opposite often talk about the impacts of the words that others use, but very rarely do they stop to think about the implication of their own words on others that serve our nation, including the words that they have uttered in this chamber today and the wording of this motion itself. 


So I want to start off by paying tribute to and acknowledging the work of our thousands of men and women who protect our borders, whether they be public servants or whether they be men and women in border protection or defence uniforms. Their service in protecting us all is crucial and invaluable, yet they are often subject to unkind, hateful and demoralising vilification by those opposite. Rarely do those opposite stop to consider the impact that their words have on the people who serve our nation.


But it is not only the words of those opposite but also their policies. If you put people smugglers back in business, the 14,000 waiting in Indonesia will start to board boats again—and some will die of horrific deaths. We must consider not only the impact of those who lose their lives and those who survive and are permanently traumatised but the impact on our personnel who have to deal with the dead bodies and with the traumatised survivors? I do not think any of you there have had to fish out of the water the dead body of someone who has drowned making that trip. 


Let me share with you the personal perspectives of those who have to pick up the mess of the policies of those opposite. Mr Pezzullo, the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, shared with us at estimates last month some of the implications of the loss of control of our borders on his men and women. He said this:


The immediate crisis … which involved, regrettably, an almost daily encounter with death, has passed into some historical memory, particularly for those officers of the then Customs and Border Protection Service and the Royal Australian Navy who variously had to attend some of these very gruesome scenes … there is ongoing trauma and post-traumatic stress associated with those events …


He also said:


Let me give voice to those members of my staff … They do not get to speak to you. But let me convey their sentiment. They get on with their job. They hear the claims. Some of them find those claims so traumatic that they ask to be reassigned to other roles. The majority carry on with great resilience and they go about their work with great dignity.


That is despite the often-proved unsubstantiated allegations of torture and waterboarding that our men and women are supposed to have committed, which they clearly did not. Mr Pezzullo also said:


… we reject utterly any suggestion that we are involved in organised and systemic torture, abuse, the running of concentration camps, the running of Nazi-like programs. They are rejected utterly. They get repeated all the time—


By those opposite—


sometimes by way of references to other reports. And all of those accusations and aspersions are rejected utterly.


He said that there have been reports that both he and the Commissioner of Border Force have had to deal with where part of the internal impact on their own staff translates to their families and their children at schools. Bullying comments made on Facebook postings are sometimes of a very personal and direct nature. This is as a direct result of the vilification of their staff—their men and women—by those opposite, including what we have just heard in this chamber today.


The Acting Commissioner of Australian Border Force also shared his thoughts on the consequences for his men and women in uniform:


… the men and women of the Australian Border Force, including the public servants and the officers, bring with them to work Australian values. That was a direct reference to the issue you raise. We do not recruit people on the basis of Nazism, fascism or anything else. We recruit people on the basis of their adherence to good values, integrity. They are incredibly committed. They do a very difficult job. But the mission—


That is, of serving all Australians—


is under their skin. But, yes, when you hear comments like that, of course it hurts people. But I can assure you I am very proud of our people.


Not often do we hear that or bother to talk about it in this place. Senator McKim heard those words from the acting commissioner and the secretary. I hope those opposite have had an opportunity to reflect on the power of their own words to hurt, particularly now that we have this highly inflammatory matter of public importance on the Notice Paper. Our men and women will see this. They will read this. Their children and their families will read and see this, and believe that their parents are evil. Their friends at school will continue to bully and taunt them that their parents are evil. Shame on you. (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2016-11-08,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:39):  It is always interesting to follow on from those opposite when it comes to bashing refugees. Just when you thought this government could not lurch any further to the right, they go and smash it out of the park. Whenever the polls get worse for the Turnbull government, what does Mr Turnbull do? He goes to border protection or national security. That is what he does each and every time. Hold onto your hats, because Mr Turnbull is again willing to compromise on his principles. In fact, I should correct myself. I do not think Mr Turnbull has any principles anymore. 'Whatever it takes' is Mr Turnbull's new mantra. Quite frankly, it is a very sad day when the Prime Minister of this country is willing to go this far.


Let me be clear regarding this important issue from the outset: Labor has made clear our commitment to offshore processing and regional resettlement, combined with the policy of turning back boats to ensure people smugglers are denied their trade in exploiting vulnerable people. We have also made clear our view that we have a special obligation to ensure those most vulnerable people are not subjected to any further harm or violence. Labor will never put people smugglers back in business. Despite what those people on that side say, I will make it very clear: Labor will never put people smugglers back into business.


The government has had three years to secure durable and credible third-country resettlement options for refugees living in Australian funded offshore detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru, but they have failed to announce any arrangements and are desperate to distract from that fact. That is what was behind this thought bubble that Malcolm Turnbull pulled out of the air last Sunday. Labor is one with the government when it comes to protecting our borders and shutting down the people-smuggling trade; that is very clear. But let us consider this life ban. It is ridiculous, for example, to suggest that a former genuine refugee who becomes a citizen in either the US or Canada will be banned for a lifetime from entering Australia under tourism or business visas in the next 20, 30 or 40 years time. It is absurd and it just reflects the desperation of this Prime Minister.


This legislation is designed for one purpose only, and that is to distract from Dutton's and Turnbull's complete failure to secure permanent third-country resettlement arrangements and get people out of Nauru. It is this government's failure, and that was the motivation behind this absurd policy bubble that was grabbed out of the air. This is government is so desperate. It has a desperate Prime Minister leading it, trying to shift the focus from his government that is dysfunctional and in complete chaos. This government fails to recognise the proud history of migration to this country. Refugees have gone on to achieve amazing things in their adopted country—people like Frank Lowy or those doctors that work at the Launceston General Hospital or at the Royal Hobart Hospital. Right around this country refugees who have come to this country have contributed greatly to the country that we are today, and we should be proud of that. We have a proud history to defend. But this government is responsible for this and says it is okay because ministerial discretion could apply in certain visa circumstances.


Let us be clear: it would be up to the minister of the day to use his or her discretion to allow a former refugee who has made an outstanding contribution to wherever they have been relocated. If they wanted to come out here to a conference as a visiting doctor, they would not be able to unless they got ministerial approval. This is such ad hoc, absurd, dysfunctional rhetoric from this government that goes from one crisis to another. They have no plan. They have no vision. As I said in my speech yesterday, this is a Prime Minister who had a plan to become Prime Minister. Yes, he succeeded in becoming the Prime Minister, but he will go down in history as one of the worst Prime Ministers this country has ever seen.


We cannot possibly trust Mr Dutton to make decisions in the national interest. Heaven forbid! To think that some people are counting numbers for him to take over from Malcolm Turnbull is quite absurd. It is nearly as bad as this policy and this legislation that they want to put in. This is a minister who is completely incompetent. Frankly, I do not know how he has been able to retain the confidence of the Prime Minister. But I really do know how he has been able to manage that: he needs his numbers to keep his job.


There are many problems with an indefinite ban on refugees. For example, as I said, it could be a doctor coming out to a medical conference. It could be an elite athlete who wants to come out to compete at the Commonwealth Games. But, no, that may not necessarily happen. We are supposed to trust this government or a future government, whoever that may be, to allow that in the future.


If former refugees already have family who have been able to migrate and live in this country, they would not even be able to visit their family. So firstly, according to this legislation, a surgeon or a doctor visiting to attend a medical conference would not be able to re-enter or come to Australia. If you are an elite athlete who happens to be a refugee currently on Manus Island and you relocate to Canada, the US or anywhere else, you would not be able to come to this country. If you have family already living here, you would not be able to come to this country. This is absurd.


We know that whenever this government is in trouble—as it appears to be every single day with its chaos and with the shambolic, dysfunctional government that it has proven to be—then what does it do? Either it goes for border protection as an issue or it goes to refugees. What it has done here is quite ludicrous.


Rather than playing petty politics, muddying the waters about rumoured third-country deals and doing One Nation's bidding, the government should be focusing on securing third-country resettlement options. This government should be focused on getting refugees off Manus Island and Nauru. People have been held in indefinite detention for too long because this government has failed to secure viable alternative countries to resettle these refugees in.


As part of the public discussion this week, the government have repeatedly claimed that this legislation is needed to secure third-country resettlement options. But they have provided no credible evidence that any of these agreements are pending. We are not even sure—one minister says one thing and the Prime Minister says something else. Then you have another minister with a completely different view on what this legislation is going to be. But when this policy was first released by the desperate Prime Minister of this country—the Liberal Prime Minister of this country—not only was I shocked, and my family, but so were my neighbours. I have been inundated in my office with emails and phone calls from people who say that this is just a bridge too far. That is what I came out with on the Sunday when this was announced. I thought I was hearing things. How could a desperate government be so foolish as to want to take this step—a bridge too far?


Now, I have supported the Labor Party's decision to back the government when it comes to turning back the boats. I understand that, and we certainly do not want people smugglers back in business. But colleagues in this chamber and, I know, the people in my community—Tasmanians—are right behind me when I say that this is a bridge too far. Enough is enough.


I know that every senator in this place and, I am sure, every House of Representatives member in the other place, would be inundated with phone calls and emails as well. But I know that—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Only from GetUp!




Senator POLLEY:
  Yes, I can always rely on Senator Macdonald to come in and start blustering. What he will do is start rewriting history, as he normally does. And he is very good at personal insults, but the facts speak for themselves: we have a very strong history of supporting refugees in this country. They make a valuable contribution. We should not condemn those refugees to a lifetime ban simply because this government is so incompetent.


They go from one disaster to the other. Malcolm Turnbull picks one bubble out after another, and what we need to do is just burst those bubbles once and for all.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Williams, a point of order?




Senator Williams:
  It is quite common for Senator Polley to refer to those in the other place not by their correct titles but just by their Christian names and surnames. I ask you to remind her to refer to those in the other place with respect—and to remember that, because I am sick of taking points of order on this very issue with Senator Polley.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Williams. Senator Polley, your time is up!

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:48):  I am not quite sure which planet Senator Polley lives on or comes from, but clearly it is not the same planet as most other Australians. Whilst I am disappointed that the Labor Party has breached the bipartisan nature of our border security today, I guess that from a political point of view it probably suits us well, because most Australians totally and strongly support the government's position and actions to stop the uncontrolled entry across our borders by many people who are not refugees but simply people expecting and wanting a better economic life.


I will go through a few statistics just to put this argument in perspective. Under the Howard government, the influx of refugees across our borders had stopped and the number of people in detention, including children, was very low. In fact, I think there were no children in detention at the end of the Howard government. The Labor government came along and opened the borders up to everybody and anybody. Whether you were a refugee or just someone who wanted a better life, it was: 'Come to Australia.' They were welcomed by the Labor Party. They probably signed a lot of them up in their branches when they arrived. What I can never understand about the Labor Party and the Greens is that, because Australia's very generous refugee intake is a fixed number, every time someone jumped the queue it meant that genuine refugees living in squalid refugee camps right around the world had to wait another year for their chance to get to the promised land. The Labor Party seemed to be keen to help those very wealthy people who could afford the airfare from wherever they came from to Malaysia and Indonesia. A husband, wife and several children were all paying for airfares. When these people got there they then paid the people smugglers $15,000 a head. These are not poor refugees. These are not the sort of people waiting in the squalid camps that the UNHCR has to run around the world. These people were jumping the queue. And not only were they jumping the queue; but many of them were putting their own lives at risk. We were aware of the fact that the 1,200-odd bodies recovered were of those who drowned on the way here. We do not know how many other thousands of people drowned in attempting to illegally get across Australia's borders. 


Australia has nothing to be ashamed of as far as refugees are concerned, and certainly the coalition government has a very proud record. For years, we have taken approximately 13,000 to 14,000 genuine refugees—people who follow the rules, who apply to the UNHCR to come to Australia. We have houses for them. We have jobs for them. We plan our social security because we know they are coming. Just recently, the coalition government increased that number—I do not have the exact number on me—to about 17,000 to 18,000. In addition to that—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  and we heard Senator Polley with her old 'desperate PM', 'desperate government'; she keeps saying it. Senator Polley, just because you are saying it does not make it true. There is no desperation in the government. The coalition government actually increased the intake of genuine refugees by an additional 12,000 people—something the Labor Party never did. These people are genuine refugees, who actually do the right thing and take their turn. For some reason, the Labor Party and the Greens seem to fancy the wealthy people who can fly from their country of origin to Malaysia or Indonesia and pay people smugglers $15,000. 


The whole Manus and Nauru issue has been debated to death. We have had about four, five or six Senate committees inquiring into it. We get the same old people making the same old submissions, trying to get their mates into the country—out of the queue, out of the system. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which is holding yet another inquiry into this issue, recently had the gall to approach the President about the committee visiting Manus and Nauru. I do not know what the President has done, whether he has dealt with the matter or not. I know that Senator Reynolds and I, two government members of the committee, were totally opposed to it. Do you realise, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it would take, according to my investigation, something like $40,000 and plus, plus, plus—because that is just for airfares alone—to get the committee up to those places. I am sure the taxpayers of Australia would rather their taxpayer dollars be spent on things other than having this committee doing a jaunt up to Nauru and Manus. And for what? Any evidence that is legally useful in Senate committees can be got from sitting in a committee room here in Australia. I think this just demonstrates the weird approach the Greens and the Labor Party have to this whole situation. This new legislation is not the subject of this debate—but Senator Polley talked of nothing else. It will come before the parliament and it is destined to say to people: 'Don't bother leaving your homeland. If you are a genuine refugee do it via the appropriate places, but if you are not a genuine refugee do not bother. Apply via the normal migration situation and entry level.' 


Most of these people are not refugees. They are wealthy people who want a better life—and I do not blame them for that. But it just makes the real situation intolerable. Genuine refugees wait longer in squalid camps thanks to the Labor Party— (Time expired)

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (16:57):  On behalf of the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present reports of the committee and a corrigendum, as listed at item 13 on today's Order of Business and move:


That the Senate take note of the reports.


I am pleased to present the committee's reports on the Criminal Code relisting of six terrorist organisations and the declaration of Islamic State as a terrorist organisation under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007. These reports fulfil the committee's statutory obligations to review the listing and relisting of terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code and the declaration of terrorist organisations under the Citizenship Act. For each of the six Criminal Code relistings, which include some of the world's most notorious organisations, including al-Qaeda, Jabhat al-Nusra and Jemaah Islamiyah, the committee was satisfied that appropriate processes had been followed and that the organisations continue to meet the criteria to be defined as terrorist organisations. 


The declaration of Islamic State as a terrorist organisation under the Australia Citizenship Act 2007 was the first of its kind to be reviewed by the committee. The effect of the declaration is that a person aged 14 years or older who is a national or citizen of another country loses their Australian citizenship if they engage in certain conduct on behalf of Islamic State. The committee was satisfied that appropriate processes had been followed and agreed that Islamic State is a terrorist organisation that is opposed to Australia's interests, values, democratic beliefs, rights and liberties, so that if a person were to fight for or be in the service of Islamic State the person would be acting inconsistently with their allegiance to Australia. I am presenting these reports at a time of sustained threat to the security of our community from people who seek to achieve their goals through violent means. 


I note that the committee's advisory report on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016 was presented out of session last week. The legislation reviewed in these reports demonstrates the need for continued vigilance and the importance of updating Australia's counterterrorism framework to protect the Australian community.

NARCOTIC DRUGS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL


The Narcotic Drugs Legislation Amendment Bill contains amendments to protect the integrity of the medicinal cannabis scheme. Cannabis is a crop of significant interest to criminal elements and preventing infiltration of organised crime into the legitimate medicinal cannabis industry must be a priority for the Commonwealth. 


As members will well remember, the Narcotic Drugs Act was amended earlier this year to create a regime to allow for the first time the cultivation of cannabis in Australia for the purposes of providing access by Australians to medicinal cannabis. As I said at the time, it is important that we have an effective national licensing system to enable a sustainable supply of safe medicinal cannabis product to Australian patients in the future. 


An important element of such a system is ensuring that only those who are 'fit and proper' can be granted a licence. The Narcotic Drugs Legislation Amendment Bill contains additional amendments to the Narcotic Drugs Act to protect sensitive law enforcement information used in making licensing decisions so that infiltration by criminal elements into the medicinal cannabis scheme can be prevented.


It is critical to ensure that participants in the medicinal cannabis scheme are of good character and repute. This is an important part of the anti-diversion controls for the scheme and allows the Commonwealth to comply with our obligations under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961.


The Commonwealth is working with law enforcement agencies from all jurisdictions to put in place arrangements for the sharing of information around the suitability of licence applicants. The Commonwealth accepts that there are limitations to what types of information can be shared through such arrangements, but remains committed to protecting the integrity of the scheme.


The primary purpose of the Narcotic Drugs Legislation Amendment Bill is to put in place protection for information provided by law enforcement agencies used in decision making under the Act. These protections prevent the disclosure of 'sensitive law enforcement information', the improper release of which could have the effect of disrupting criminal investigations, revealing law enforcement intelligence gathering and investigative techniques or exposing the lives of people involved in criminal investigations to risk. Leaks of this type of information can have serious implications for the effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies and so it is in the public interest to prevent this from occurring. 


The provisions in the Bill prevent the release of sensitive law enforcement information to the applicant, their lawyers and to the public at large when decisions are being made on whether to grant or revoke licences. The Bill also carries protections against release of this information during related Tribunal and court proceedings. The Bill creates offences with harsh penalties for revealing sensitive law enforcement information, except within some very narrow confines including, for instance, where it is necessary to allow its use for the proper administration of the Narcotic Drugs Act licensing provisions.


The Bill also includes provisions to allow the Secretary to refuse to grant a licence where the applicant has provided false or misleading information; to provide for the making of standards and guidelines to support the detailed elements of the scheme; to allow for the revocation of licences and permits where applicable standards are not met, and to allow for the supply of cannabis seeds grown in the course of medicinal cannabis research to be supplied to other cultivator licence holders for further propagation purposes. 


In February this year, this Parliament supported the introduction of the legislation to enable the legal cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes, in order to supply Australian patients and to comply with our international obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. These amendments are necessary so that licences are only issued to persons who will work to meet these objectives. The risk of criminal elements diverting precious medicine to illicit uses is too great – this would be detrimental to the patients who would benefit from the availability of medicinal cannabis and would mean that the Government sanctioned system would be creating another public health risk.


Without this Bill, law enforcement agencies around the country will be reluctant to engage with the Commonwealth in providing the necessary information to manage these risks. These agencies understand and support the need for this cultivation scheme; but they rightly can only participate fully, if doing so will not compromise their own activities.


The cannabis cultivation and production licensing scheme commenced on 30 October 2016. It was intended that these amendments commence at the same time to ensure that scheme endorsed by the Parliament in February can operate effectively. A slight delay in the commencement of these amendments should not adversely affect the operation of the framework. However, any prolonged delay could adversely affect the protection of any sensitive information held or obtained by the Secretary of the Department of Health, or law enforcement agencies may not be willing to provide such information.


NARCOTIC DRUGS (LICENCE CHARGES) BILL 2016


There is no existing medicinal cannabis industry as cannabis is currently an illegal narcotic drug. Allowing for the creation and existence of a legitimate industry provides a benefit to that industry by opening a new market for commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of medicinal cannabis products. 


It is appropriate to seek to recover the direct costs that government incurs in regulating the medicinal cannabis industry through both direct fee recovery and through the imposition of levies. 


Direct fee recovery for services specific to a holder of a licence for cultivation, production or manufacture will be implemented by way of regulations made under the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. The imposition of charges, typically on an annual basis, to capture the indirect costs associated with regulating this industry do, however, require separate legislation, thus the Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Bill. 


Charges (or levies) under this Bill include those where costs cannot otherwise reasonably be assigned directly to a particular licence holder. For example, the annual charges will fund risk based inspections across industry. While direct fees will be applied for standard and regular inspections of cannabis cultivation and production facilities (such as those required to provide an initial licence), risk based inspections are typically unannounced and will vary in frequency. They are designed to target licence holders where there are concerns over their compliance with licence conditions, regulations or the legislation. 



Through this, all licensees participating in the new cannabis cultivation industry will benefit, as the Department of Health is able to ensure that none gain an advantage that might otherwise eventuate if a company were about to breach the strict conditions placed on its licence; conditions designed to ensure that Australia prevents the diversion of cannabis to illicit purposes and fulfils its obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961.



This Bill establishes the legal authority to develop regulations that will contain the actual proposed charges. The scheme for the cultivation and production of cannabis for medicinal purposes commenced on 30 October 2016 – it is important that the Government is able to communicate on the full regulatory costs of this scheme as soon as possible in order to allow potential applicants to plan their businesses and complete their applications.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:15):  I continue my remarks on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016.


Moreover, the evidence presented may well be derived solely from information provided by foreign intelligence agencies, without our own security and intelligence having completed their own investigations or analysis. No doubt the government is thinking of the need to act quickly in response to intelligence, especially highly classified communications or signals intelligence obtained from Australia's primary intelligence partners, the so-called 'Five Eyes' of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. There may well be cases where urgent action is required. It is also the case, however, that signals intelligence often requires careful analysis, understanding of context and, frequently, extensive additional research.


Moreover, intelligence from foreign sources is not only from our Five Eyes partners. Australia's intelligence agencies have broad liaison relationships, including with some foreign intelligence and security services, some of whom have reputations that are, at best, mixed. The government keeps the details of those relationships highly classified, but it is not unreasonable to consider the possibility that a person might be subject to an application for a control order on the basis of information not from the British Security Service or the US Central Intelligence Agency, but from, for instance, the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate or Pakistan's notorious Inter-Services Intelligence. The potential for injustice similar to that involved in the Haneef case is clear. However, we will never know the story because the whole process will be secret.


More broadly, the implementation of this regime—the arguments and decisions for imposing control orders—will be a further step in the development of a body of secret legal opinion and precedent. Courts will take secret decisions on the basis of secret information; precedents will be set. Secret courts and secret law are never a desirable development. Senators should be very clear in their understanding of what is proposed here.


While the Law Council of Australia has welcomed the inclusion of the special advocate scheme as a measure that will mitigate the procedural unfairness identified in the original bill—and I welcome it—it has also recommended an immediate review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I note that there are no crossbenchers on that committee.


There are certainly very significant issues raised by these provisions of the bill. To take but one example in relation to legal professional privilege in communications between the special advocate and the person subject to a control order: the court will be responsible for on-forwarding communications between the special advocate and the party, with a responsibility to ensure that such communications do not prejudice national security. Significantly, there is provision for the court to consult with the Attorney-General or his or her representative in determining whether a communication may prejudice national security. The Attorney-General and his representatives will thus be privy to communications between the special advocates and persons subject to a control order. Significantly, while special advocates will be appointed by the courts, it is the executive that will prescribe by regulation the requirements a person must meet in order to be appointed as a special advocate.


The Attorney-General has acknowledged that while the bill creates the architecture for a special advocate role:


… some time will be needed for the supporting regulations and administrative arrangements to be established for the regime to work.


Given the obvious importance of the special advocate role in what is proposed, it would be much better if these arrangements were incorporated within the bill and the entire proposal subject to further parliamentary committee scrutiny. These are matters that ought quite reasonably to be asked of the Attorney in the committee stage.


The other provisions I wish to focus on now are those relating to the secrecy provisions of section 35P of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, which implement the government's response to recommendations made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. Schedule 18 broadly implements the recommendations made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor in his report on section 35P of the ASIO Act, which was a scathing report on section 35P.


That report arose from the previous failure of the parliament and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence Services in considering the government's original proposals for draconian secrecy provisions relating to the conduct of special intelligence operations by ASIO. I voted against those provisions. They were something the joint committee said ought to be passed, and they were passed by the parliament. But that change was subsequently referred to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the Hon. Roger Giles AO QC, a former Federal Court judge and eminent lawyer and jurist. Quite frankly, I am sad to see him go. He has retired or resigned from that position.


Professor Clinton Fernandes, a former army intelligence officer, now a professor of the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy, and I made a joint submission to that inquiry. No other members of parliament made a submission at that time. Our main concern was the chilling effect that the new law would have on scrutiny of ASIO's operations, especially through media reporting. After conducting his inquiry, Mr Giles observed that section 35P:


... creates uncertainty as to what may be published about the activities of ASIO without fear of prosecution. The so-called chilling effect of that uncertainty is exacerbated because it also applies in relation to disclosures made to editors for the purpose of discussion before publication.


Mr Giles went on to say: 


Journalists are prohibited from publishing anywhere at any time any information relating to an SIO, regardless of whether it has any, or any continuing, operational significance and even if it discloses reprehensible conduct by ASIO insiders.


That is quite chilling. The underlying issues were summed up by the INSLM as follows:


The basic problem with section 35P is that it does not distinguish between journalists and others (outsiders) and ASIO insiders. The application in this manner of broad secrecy prohibitions to outsiders is not satisfactorily justified, including by precedents in Australia or elsewhere.


Mr Giles also made this point:


Section 35P is arguably invalid on the basis that it infringes the constitutional protection of freedom of political communication. Section 35P is also arguably inconsistent with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so not in accordance with Australia's international obligations.


The fact that that legislation got a tick of approval from the PJCIS and enjoyed bipartisan support from the coalition government and the Labor opposition tells me that parliamentary scrutiny of new counterterrorism and national security legislation needs to be much more rigorous and robust. 


We now have before us the government's effort to put things right on the basis of recommendations made by the INSLM, Mr Giles. These amendments aim to introduce new protections to section 35P by establishing two separate offence regimes, with one regime to apply to persons who came to the knowledge or into the possession of the relevant information in their capacity as an entrusted person and a separate regime for outsiders. Under these new regimes the disclosure of information made by members of the community, except those who received information in their capacity as an entrusted person, will only constitute an offence if the information will endanger the health or safety of a person or prejudice the effective conduct of a special intelligence operation. The amendments will also establish a defence of prior publication available only to persons who did not receive the relevant information in their capacity as an entrusted person. This bill reflects the INSLM's view that it is appropriate to retain disclosure offences, and that the special intelligence operation scheme is both necessary and proportionate.


The government argues that its agreement to implement all of the INSLM's recommendations regarding section 35P demonstrates its commitment to ensuring that we are achieving 'the right balance between the public interest and our national security requirements'. I agree that the amendments within the present bill are an improvement on the provisions of section 35P that were previously passed by the parliament. However, I do make the point that they are measures of considerable complexity and some ambiguity. Some significant stakeholders have certainly expressed the view that the INSLM's recommendations, and by implication the provisions of this bill, do not go far enough to provide certainty to journalists and others to know what information may be published without exposure to criminal liability or to protect journalists and whistleblowers who might seek to disclose allegations of wrongdoing in the course of a special intelligence operation. These are matters that I hope to raise with the Attorney in the committee stage. For example Paul Murphy, CEO of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, stated:


The Monitor’s report, while welcome, has not changed the fundamental intent of section 35P which is to intimidate whistleblowers and journalists.


These amendments are certainly worthy of further close and critical scrutiny, if not by the PJCIS then by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. That would certainly allow media organisations, journalists, legal experts and other interested parties to make detailed submissions in relation to the precise amendments that are before the Senate now.


There are many other complex and potentially controversial provisions within this bill. While some have been reviewed by the PJCIS, others have not. If we are serious about the balance between security and accountability, between secrecy and scrutiny of our intelligence legislation, there needs to be further debate and review. This is a duty that the parliament, and especially the Senate, needs to commit itself to with every new piece of counterterrorism and national security legislation. With each of these bills we are asked to strike the right balance. With each of them we are asked to trade off hard-won rights and long-established principles in favour of public safety and security. I do not think anyone doubts the importance of public safety. The threat of terrorism is real and persistent, but that does not diminish our responsibility to look at every measure with objectivity, scepticism and a determination to not lightly deviate from fundamental principles upon which our legal system and democracy rest.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-11-08,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:26):  As my colleague Senator Nick McKim has already indicated, the Greens will be strongly opposing the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016, just as we have strongly opposed most of the erosions of basic freedoms that have been pushed through this parliament and previous parliaments over the course of the last 15 years. One of the most noxious elements of the current bill is that it purports to extend the operation of control orders to children as young as 14. For the people who may be listening, control orders are the instruments which allow a court to make an order, on the evidence of the Federal Police, that severely restricts the movement and the freedoms of an individual.


There has been much debate about control orders in the past. The former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Bret Walker SC, said that there is no need at all for control orders—that is, control orders simply serve no purpose. Mr Walker pointed out that existing provisions are more than sufficient to achieve the purpose of keeping the community safe from possible acts of terrorism and other violence—that is, his belief was that the same could be achieved through existing provisions, existing laws. If there is any evidence that would justify the restriction of somebody's freedom on the basis that they are planning to commit an act of violence, then that person should be placed under conditions of bail or, indeed, remanded in custody. That is our view and that it is consistent with the view of Bret Walker SC.


Senator Xenophon just referred to the current Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Mr Roger Gyles QC, who was a former Court of Appeal judge in New South Wales. He was also of the view that much stricter safeguards in relation to control orders are warranted. He has made it very clear that, if control orders are to exist, we need much stricter safeguards. So here we have two fine minds, two esteemed legal professionals, who have made it very clear that they see no case for expanding control orders and yet here we are in this parliament, after almost 15 years of legislation that has opposed very basic freedoms, with a government proposing to apply control orders to 14-year-old children. The Attorney-General's claim is that this measure is necessary because adults are now using 14- and 15-year-old children to get around the control order regime as it already applies to adults, but of course using that logic begs the question: what happens when this bill passes and adults work out that they can do what they were doing previously using 12- and 13-year-old children to get around control orders, or perhaps younger children? Should we apply them to 10-year-olds or eight-year-olds? Are we then to look forward to yet another bill in the future which extends control orders to children barely out of primary school?


In its submission to the inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security into the previous version of this bill, the Australian Human Rights Commission—and we do have respect for the Australian Human Rights Commission, unlike some others in this place—said:


The Commission is not aware of what evidence there is to support these claims—


that is, about lowering the age for control orders—


… However, they are, on their own, insufficient to demonstrate that allowing control orders to be granted for children between 14 and 15 would be necessary and proportionate … 


It is a view that was echoed by a number of other organisations in their submissions to the same inquiry. We had the Muslim Legal Network's submission, which again said that on their own they are insufficient to demonstrate that allowing control orders to be granted for children between 14 and 15 would be necessary and proportionate.


The unfortunate reality is that this parliament has waved through far too many restrictions on basic freedoms and individual liberties. If we reflect on how a control order works in practice, we can see just how profound the impact is with the restrictions of individuals. Suspects who are subject to control orders might need to wear tracking devices. They might face curfews. They might be restricted from using phones and from communicating with particular people. They might be restricted from using the internet. All of this is in the face of suspects sometimes being denied knowing what the evidence is against them. They may not in fact be facing any criminal charge. These are people who are rounded up and sometimes not told what evidence the police may have against them. They may not be facing any criminal charge, yet they are faced with significant restrictions on individual liberties. Of course, any breach of a control order carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. You have to ask yourself: at what point does a democracy look less like a democracy and more like a police state?


I was having an interesting conversation with some members of the Muslim community, and a young man who migrated to Australia from the former Yugoslavia spoke about the nation that he knew and that he grew up in and how slowly the country he grew up in and loved changed with further restrictions on individual liberties and went from being a democracy to essentially a police state. His view was that many of these changes happen incrementally and chip away over time and, at some point, the nation you once knew becomes unrecognisable.


We have seen over the past 15 years an incremental chipping away at our basic freedoms and liberties. I say 'incremental' for most of these changes, but occasionally there are extraordinary leaps and the changes are significant. It is for that reason that Australia is now commonly recognised amongst developed countries as having some of the most restrictive anti-terrorism legislation in the democratic world.


I have said this on a number of occasions, as have many others: you do not remove freedom in order to protect it. That is not how you protect individual freedom. Removing freedom is not the way to protect it. You cannot protect liberty by locating more of it behind a police line. We have to remember that if you are fighting a real threat—and, of course, we acknowledge that there are significant threats—you do not do it by becoming more like the threat that you are facing. Of course we should be taking sensible, evidence based actions to prevent acts of terrorism and violence—no question. We understand that the threat is real. But the key here is that the response must be both sensible and evidence based. It needs to be proportionate and measured.


The tendency, sadly, of this parliament has been to simply sign off on more and more restrictions on individual freedoms, often on the vague justification of national security. It is a great shame that there has not been a full and frank debate in this place about what we are giving up. There has not been the scrutiny that is required of this sort of legislation, largely because we have seen both a government and an opposition that are too afraid of being seen as soft on terrorism to ensure that we have scrutiny of legislation that removes some of the most basic individual freedoms and liberties. Yes, there is an issue that needs to be addressed. We are seeing young people being radicalised and we are seeing people who are engaged in violent activities. Often they are groomed through the internet, sometimes via a particular self-proclaimed religious leader. They are recruited into a hateful ideology, the ideology of ISIS and many other extreme groups. We know that these are toxic ideologies and of course we should be doing everything in our power to prevent their reach to our young people. But people who work in this area, who are experts in the field of youth radicalisation and this extremist ideology, say time and time again that the very worst thing that the Australian state can do is to buy into the logic of fear, division and marginalisation. Unfortunately, that is what bills such as this one do. Again, let's remember what part of this legislation seeks to achieve. A 14-year-old child can be rounded up, locked up and have their freedoms restricted, all without charge, and for a breach face imprisonment for five years. It is social cohesion—not division, not demonisation and control and, more and more, not just surveillance of particular individuals—that is going to help keep our community safe. 


We should acknowledge that it is Australia's very successful and quite unique model of multiculturalism—our celebration of cultural differences within our diverse Australian nation—which represents our greatest strength and our real protection from some of the acts that we have seen in other parts of the world. People of different cultures working together, going to school together, learning from each other, building trust within communities and creating families together are Australia's true strength and our best defence against this poisonous ideology. The most toxic effect of this bill and other, similar bills is that they do the opposite. They drive more fear and more division within our community. All you have to do is spend five minutes talking to members of the community who practise the Muslim faith to know exactly how they are feeling. They feel that they have been isolated, marginalised and demonised and they see division being sewn within their community. 


Let's be clear about the impact of this legislation—I accept that it is not the intention but it is the consequence. Again, speaking to members of the Muslim community, when you hear young people say, 'We are afraid of putting deep roots into our community because we worry that at some point in the future we will have the authorities knocking on our door,' you know just how deep that fear is. Let's not beat around the bush here. There are some communities in Australia who will cop the brunt of this country's ever-expanding national security enterprise. As I said, I do not think that is the intention of the government or indeed the opposition when they put up and vote for bills like this, but everyone of us who votes in this chamber must be aware of the implications of our vote: that we are making our community less safe rather than more safe. Regardless of what we intend, we have to be aware that when we support bills like this we are ensuring that particular minority communities in Australia will be targeted even more, and that does not support our efforts at enhancing social cohesion. 


It is for those reasons that the Greens are voting against this bill. We do want to keep our communities safe, but we do not believe this is the vehicle to do that. We do not agree that there is a basis for this legislation. We are deeply concerned at the continual erosion of our basic freedoms and liberties, because, when we give up those freedoms and liberties, those people with whom we are fighting—they win. We believe that ultimately this legislation will drive a deeper wedge between members of the community who are concerned about the impacts of terrorism and those members of the community who will be targeted by this legislation. We understand that Australia's diversity is our great strength. We understand that people of different cultures coming together, working together is how we combat some of the threats that Australia faces.


The Greens will be voting against the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016 and we urge the government and, indeed, the Labor Party to rethink their position on this bill.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2016-11-08,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:41):  I rise to speak in favour of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016. This bill was first introduced into the last parliament in November 2015 and was immediately referred, of course, to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The joint committee held public hearings and received submissions in December 2015 before reporting in February 2016, and the parliament was, of course, prorogued before either house had a chance to consider the bill.


Before turning to the specific provisions of the bill I wanted to take a moment to discuss the importance of this oversight process provided by the parliamentary joint committee and to touch on Labor's approach to security legislation in general. Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Australian parliament has debated and enacted 65 pieces of anti-terrorism legislation. Taken together, they constitute substantial changes to the architecture of Australia's security legislation framework. These changes have been made in the face of emerging and serious threats to our national security. These threats are not abstract and they are not distant. Australians have been affected by terror plots both at home and abroad, and the work of our law enforcement and security agencies has prevented Australians from being affected by many more.


Earlier this year we understood that there were more than 100 Australians fighting or engaged with terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria and many more providing support or facilitation from Australia. Australia's national terror threat is currently set at 'probable'. This means there is credible intelligence indicating that individuals or groups have both the intent and the capability to conduct an attack. It is incumbent upon us to respond properly to this threat. As a parliament we have no more important responsibility than to do what is appropriate and necessary in protecting the safety of the Australian people. However, we will not meet this demand that is made of us by simply voting in favour of security legislation in the form in which the government initially proposes it. Parliament must endeavour to find a balance between protecting the safety of our community on the one hand and maintaining the values and the freedoms of our community on the other. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security plays an important role in finding this balance.


I was not a member of the joint committee when it considered the present bill, but it is worth turning to what the chair of the joint committee said in the other place when tabling the report on the bill. He said:


I commend the bipartisanship of the committee, but 'bipartisanship' should not be taken to mean that we all sit there and agree with each other on every matter that we have discussed. I can say without breaching any provisions of the Intelligence Services Act that on many occasions there has been much robust conversation with respect to that, but that is the job of our committee—a committee behind closed doors that operates on behalf of the Australian people.


Indeed, in my short time on the committee this has been my experience. As a party, Labor seek to approach security legislation from the position of bipartisanship. We believe that our national security apparatus must be properly equipped to protect Australians from terrorism and this means providing security agencies and institutions with the resources and powers that they need to do this. It is, however, worth repeating what Senator Collins said earlier in the debate today:


…our bipartisan assistance to the government on matters of national security is never a blank cheque. Bipartisanship on national security means that we will support necessary and effective measures to address threats to our nation …


The converse is also true. Ultimately, as a parliament we abrogate our responsibilities if we knowingly support measures that burden people's rights but are not necessary or effective in addressing threats to our nation. The oversight provided by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is an important bulwark against this, and, for reasons I will go on to explain later in the speech, the present bill provides an example of how the joint committee can work together to make sure that security legislation is more appropriate, more properly targeted and more proportional.


As I noted before, however, the Australian parliament has debated and enacted 65 pieces of anti-terrorism legislation since 2001, and with each additional piece of security legislation we are providing greater and further powers to our national security agencies and institutions. Our agencies cannot function properly without the trust and confidence of the public, and nor should they be allowed to. Reliable, effective external oversight is essential in ensuring this. As the powers of the national security agencies grow, so too does the importance of oversight. This is not something that can be left to the courts. A judicial system of course plays an important role in policing the boundaries of executive activity; however, Australians would not, and should not, be satisfied with merely knowing that there is an absence of illegality in the cases that happen to come before the courts. Parliament also plays an important role in ensuring that legislation is appropriate and proportionate.


This is not enough, however. Australians deserve to know that their national security agencies and institutions are effectively, efficiently and appropriately serving the purpose for which they were created, and the joint committee is the forum in the parliament that is best placed to do this job. I quote again from the tabling speech in the other place by the Chair of the PJCIS:


Fundamentally I think the Australian people need this committee to have the capacity to inquire more diligently and more thoroughly into matters that it should be tasked to look at. That would include, potentially, the capacity for the committee to have self-referencing power …


It is for this reason that I commend to this chamber the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015, which is sponsored by Senator Wong. As noted in the second reading speech for that bill:


The maintenance of public security in the current security environment does require enhanced powers for the agencies charged with this responsibility. However, the protection of our hard-won democratic freedoms equally demands enhanced oversight of the exercise of these powers.


The PJCIS Amendment Bill 2015 provides for enhanced oversight by, amongst other things, removing the constraints on membership of the committee and allowing greater flexibility in determining PJCIS membership; providing for the PJCIS to conduct own-motion inquiries after consultation with the responsible minister; authorising the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to provide the PJCIS with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the committee; requiring the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to give the PJCIS a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or a minister within three months; giving the PJCIS the function of conducting pre-sunset reviews of legislation that contain sunset provisions; and adding the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the national security adviser to officers who are able to be consulted by the PJCIS. This is a good bill that will provide necessary and appropriate powers to an important parliamentary body.


I will now return to the bill before us, and I thank the chamber for their indulgence. As I mentioned earlier, the bill provides an example of how the joint committee works in a bipartisan way to make sure that security legislation is more appropriate, more properly targeted and more proportional. The bill that is before the chamber now is not the same as the bill that was introduced in the last parliament. The 2015 bill was referred to the joint committee immediately upon being introduced, and the committee received 17 submissions. The committee made 21 recommendations, subject to which it recommended that the bill be passed. These recommendations have resulted in improvements to the bill which is now before the chamber.


The bill extends the control order regime to young offenders. The committee made a number of recommendations about these provisions. The committee recommended that the bill require the best interest of the child to be a primary consideration. This ensures that the bill is consistent with Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The bill now contains provisions to this effect. The committee also recommended that the bill be amended to expressly provide that a young person has the right to legal representation in control order proceedings. The bill now contains provisions to this effect. As Senator Collins said earlier in this debate, Labor pushed for these amendments in order to make sure that the legislation properly balanced the rights of young people who are the subject of control order proceedings with the safety of the Australian community as a whole.


The committee also made recommendations about the creation of a new offence of 'advocating genocide.' The creation of this offence is in line with the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The joint committee recommended that a fault element of 'recklessness' be included as there were concerns raised by submitters that the offence was drafted too broadly. Specifically, submitters raised concerns that the offence as drafted could have the unintended consequence of limiting reporting of terrorism. The 2016 bill now includes the fault element as recommended.


As Senator Collins set out, there are a number of other recommendations made by the committee, which Labor has pushed to have as amendments incorporated into the bill. Our commitment to bipartisanship does not mean that we offer the government a blank cheque on security legislation—nor, for that matter, do the government's own parliamentarians. In this case, as in many others, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Security and Intelligence provides an important mechanism for the parliament as a whole to provide proper scrutiny of security legislation, and to make sure it operates as intended and protects our community without unnecessarily burdening individuals. I hope in due course that we will have another opportunity in this place to further consider Senator Wong's private member's bill to enhance the committee's ability to perform this oversight function.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-11-08,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:52):  I oppose this bill—the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016—because it significantly, permanently and unjustifiably expands the power of the Commonwealth government to hold people without charge.


The Commonwealth government introduced preventative detention orders in 2005 to authorise the holding of a person without charge for 48 hours. The power can be used in two circumstances. First, the power can be used if detention is reasonably necessary to preserve evidence of a terrorist act that occurred in the last 28 days. Second, the power can be used if detention is reasonably necessary to substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act, on the proviso that the terrorist act 'is imminent and is expected to occur, in any event, at some time in the next 14 days'. The wisdom of allowing preventative detention orders in this second circumstance is debatable, given that authorities have significant power to engage in surveillance, authorities with a skerrick of evidence can detain people by charging them, and detention without charge is a violation of a fundamental right.


But at least this preventative detention is detention—it can only occur on the proviso that a terrorist act is imminent and is expected to occur. Unfortunately, the government now wants to get rid of this proviso. In its place, the government will simply require that relevant officers 'suspect on reasonable grounds that a terrorist act is capable of being carried out and could occur within the next 14 days'. Note the replacement of 'is' with 'suspect'. I can suspect that someone is out to get me, but that does not mean there is someone out to get me. Note also the replacement of the word 'imminent' with 'could'. The difference between these words is as stark as the difference between winning the lottery and merely buying a lotto ticket. If you win the lottery, a massive boost to your wealth is imminent. If you merely buy a lotto ticket then it is indeed the case that a massive boost to your wealth could occur, but it is far from likely and definitely not certain.


The government has not explained why it needs a power to detain people without charge when a terrorist act is not imminent. Instead it has the gall to say that its bill is merely clarifying the law rather than changing it. We should see the pattern here. First, the scaremongers persuade the parliament to enact preventative detention powers by citing all the qualifications and limitations on those powers. Then, with each amendment, these qualifications and limitations get pared back—all in the name of clarification. There is little public sympathy for people who could find themselves in preventative detention, because it is common to assume that police would only ever chose to detain bad guys and would never make mistakes about who is a bad guy and who is not. So when the police asked for beefed up preventative detention powers I can understand why the coalition agreed, and Labor has not resisted. But it is a dereliction of their duty to the public nonetheless. 


There are many other retrograde provisions in this bill. The bill ramps up search and surveillance powers used against people who are subject to a control order and denies them access to the information that put them under a control order in the first place. The bill effectively bans computer games that are said to promote terrorism, even though there is no evidence that playing a game makes someone act out the game. The bill makes it easier to get a search warrant and delay telling the property owner about the search. The bill bans the advocacy of genocide. That hurts our ability to identify people with genocidal views and to rebut those views—and inciting genocide is already a crime. So, sadly, once again I oppose the government's counterterrorism legislation and, once again, I find myself in a minority with the Greens. Will the government please give me a break?


Even when the government introduces a good provision it does so in a half-hearted fashion—for instance, this bill amends section 35P of the ASIO Act to reduce penalties for outsiders like journalists who disclose information about special intelligence operations where the information does not endanger health or safety or prejudice an operation. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was asked to review 35P, and he recommended this reduction. The reduction is a good thing and is something I called for when 35P was first debated two years ago, but the Senate was full of deaf ears. They were yes-men and yes-women when the government introduced the lengthy penalties, and, as no-one is objecting to this bill's lessening of the penalties, they are clearly yes-men and yes-women now.


The reduction in penalties is a good thing, but it is half-arsed. The offences in 35P for disclosing information about ASIO's special intelligence operations were based on offences for disclosing information about the AFP's controlled operations. Now the government is reducing penalties for journalists when it comes to disclosures about special intelligence operations involving ASIO but doing nothing about the penalties for journalists when it comes to disclosures about the AFP's controlled operations. The logic of penalties for journalists being lower than penalties for insiders is the same whether we are talking about ASIO or the AFP.


But the government is a logic-free zone when it comes to civil liberties and national security. Logically, this bill should be substantially altered, if passed at all. We deserve better. My constructive proposal is to make the coercive aspects subject to a sunset clause of 10 years. In other words, unless re-enacted, they will lapse automatically in 10 years. That will give the government, Labor and the law enforcement agencies plenty of time to determine, objectively rather than anecdotally, whether this constant chipping away at our liberty is actually making us safer and whether, just as we were told there would always be reds under our beds, claims that the threat of Islamic terrorism will be always with us. I am dubious about whether we need this law, but I am certain that we do not need it on the books permanently.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-11-08,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (19:00):  I rise in support of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016, and I will explain why. Yes, it is a shame that 14-year-olds may be dragged before the courts on charges of terrorism and it is a shame what may happen to them, but that is the way of life and that is what has happened to our country. Many Australians are very concerned about terrorism and live in fear. Just recently a poll was taken where 49 per cent of Australians said they wished for a ban on further Muslim immigration to this country, and, of that 49 per cent, 47 per cent based that view on the fact that Muslims do not integrate. Senator Di Natale made a comment here earlier about Muslims saying how they feel marginalised and demonised and that they are afraid. I think the majority of Australians feel very afraid, because we are now seeing terrorism on our streets. People live in fear. I here from many people who say that they are afraid to go on trains or to shopping centres or sporting venues; they are in fear. We need to address this, and I do believe that we need to act with very hard leadership and say that we are not going to allow this to happen on our streets. 


We talk about control orders and tracking devices. There are now over 500 Australians who are under surveillance, and the authorities are having trouble tracking them. Why is that so? Why do we have so many people like that here? These people have not come here to Australia for the right reasons. They are here to push their own agenda, their own beliefs. Senator Di Natale says that we are a multicultural nation—and, yes, we are. People have come here from different parts of this world. They have migrated to Australia for a new way of life—to leave behind terror and their way of life for a better way of life. I think that is wonderful, because Australia has been based on all the different cultures that have come here. But what has happened now is that people are coming here not to assimilate, not to integrate, not be one of us, not to abide by our culture, our laws or our way of life. They do not have respect for us. Some carry with them a hatred towards us—and that can never be accepted or allowed to happen. 


It is a shame that people as young as 14 years of age could be affected by this legislation—but it is justified. Otherwise, what do we say to the family of Curtis Cheng, who was shot dead by a 15-year-old? What do we tell his family? We are now finding that younger and younger people are wanting to commit these crimes. We cannot allow that to happen. They are not children. They are people with their own beliefs and determinations. They are not a child anymore. People have to start being responsible for their actions, no matter what their age, especially when an Australian's life—I do not care how many there are; even one—may be taken by someone who does not believe in our culture or our way of life and who bears us hate in their heart—and I hate to see it. 


You talk about multiculturalism and how Muslims feel offended, demonised and marginalised. When the grand mufti of Australia, Ibrahim Abu Mohammed, wrote a letter warning that to criticise even a gay hating imam is to risk inciting terrorist attacks against us, was he pulled up? Did anyone say he should not be saying that? What about his support of Sheik Shady? 


In his online sermons he attacked Jews, called on God to help destroy the enemies, declared that the punishment for adulterers is stoning to death, damned Christian parties as worshippers of Satan, declared that the Australian government is oppressing Muslims and accused gays of spreading diseases through evil actions that bring evil outcomes to our society. What does Senator Di Natale have to say about that—or does he defend that?


No hatred should be accepted from anyone in this country. We are all Australians trying to live in this country in peace and harmony together. That is what I purport and that is what I will stand strongly for. We must take strong actions against these people—anyone, regardless of whether they have a religious or cultural background that opposes our way of life, must be dealt with harshly. Many other countries around the world are now feeling that—and they are attending to the problems in their own country by having these people deported. If these people are not happy in our country then please go back where you came from or go and find another country that suits your beliefs.


I have a duty to the people of Australia to ensure that they feel safe on our streets. I do not want Australia to become like other countries around the world. We talk about people's civil liberties and their rights. Their rights start with them. The majority of Australians are not under the law, they do not have tracking devices and they are not in our court system—because they abide by our laws. We have to send a clear message to other people that we are not going to accept it. That is why I support the government's legislation on this and send a clear message to those who wish to come here and disrupt our way of life.


I will be moving an amendment to this bill. The legislation states that these people will be given free legal aid. Our legal aid system is under enormous stress at the moment. I know of people in the Family Court who cannot get legal aid—they are fighting for their rights—and many who do not get it are suiciding, taking their own life. In Australia, there is no reference in any of the eligibility or assessment criteria documentation that says an applicant for legal aid in criminal matters must be an Australian citizen. I believe they should be. It is the taxpayers who are paying for this, and I think legal aid should be available to Australian citizens or permanent residents. Under our legal aid system if another person supports you, provides financial support to you or can be reasonably expected to provide you with financial help, then the means test will take this person's income and assets into account. My amendment to this bill would add: 'And there is evidence that at least one parent or guardian of the person has the means to appoint a lawyer to act for that person'. That means if a parent or guardian of that child between 14 and 17 can afford to pay for the legal costs, so they should; it is not up to the Australian taxpayer. Let's treat them exactly the same as we treat anyone else who applies for legal aid in this country. I will be moving that amendment to the bill.


There is a lot more to be said on this. As I have said, let's look at this fairly. I take into account what Senator Leyonhjelm said about this: we should have a sunset clause. The days and times are changing rapidly. Maybe we need to look at immigration—who we actually bring into Australia—as I have always said. Let's address the problem before it gets out of hand. I hear time and time again that our authorities are stretched to the limit. I hear that there is a probable attack and a possible attack. That is what we are told. We need to make sure that our country is safe, and if these people, even as young as 14, want to go out there and try to commit a crime against us and this nation, they will certainly receive the wrath of the law as far as I am concerned. Thank you.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-08,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:10):  I thank honourable senators for their contributions. I thank in particular the Australian Labor Party for their support for this measure and Senator Hanson for One Nation's support for the measure. Can I, by the way, clarify a matter that you just raised, Senator Hanson? The national terrorism alert level is 'probable' at the moment. It has been at that level or the equivalent level since September 2014. Last year we changed the nomenclature to make the expression of the alert level a little more clear. It used to be 'high', and 'high' was defined as 'a terrorism event was assessed to be likely'. Now at the same level the descriptor is not 'possible' but 'probable'.


I thank honourable Senators for their contributions to the debate and I will turn in a moment, as time permits, to responding to certain observations that have fallen from some crossbench senators. The bill provides significant measures to address the ongoing terrorism threat in Australia. The measures were developed in response to lessons learned from recent counterterrorism operations, and the bill is informed by a number of independent and parliamentary committee reports, including the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on the 2015 bill of the same name, which lapsed when the parliament was dissolved earlier in the year. To give even fuller effect to the recommendations of the PJCIS, I will be moving a government amendment to the bill regarding legal representation for young persons in control order proceedings.


The government has worked closely with the states and territories on these reforms and will continue to do so as part of our comprehensive reform agenda to strengthen Australia's national security and counterterrorism legislation. Importantly, the bill includes measures that will modernise the control order regime, including reducing the minimum age for which a control order can be imposed on a person from 16 years to 14 years or older but introducing a new safeguards regime for minors; creating targeted regimes to facilitate the monitoring of individuals subject to control orders through physical search, telecommunications interception and surveillance device powers; and providing greater protection to sensitive information in control order proceedings.


The bill will also criminalise the advocacy of genocide, which, as I said in the second reading speech, is the incitement to murder an entire population, not an exercise in free speech. These are important measures in preventing terrorism and the spread of extremism in Australia. They are supported by a robust countering violent extremism—or CVE—program which focuses on prevention as our first defence against terrorism. Our program works with communities to address the underlying factors that, unfortunately, make violent extremism appealing to some individuals, particularly young people. It includes adopting new methods to counter the spread and allure of extremist propaganda online and makes sure that our families, communities and institutions like schools and workplaces have the knowledge and tools to respond to radicalisation.


Changing an individual's circumstances, behaviour and feelings is hard. While there is evidence that these programs are working, we know that there will be cases where they will not succeed, and we are in the relatively early days of developing the body of knowledge and understanding of what works in CVE and what works less well. That is why we need to ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the powers that they need to respond when a situation escalates.


The bill also reflects the government's decision to implement in full all of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor's recommendations in his report on section 35P of the ASIO Act. The government understands the importance of maintaining public awareness of and confidence in the activities of our security agencies. This and other measures in this bill provide further demonstration of the government's commitment to ensuring that we are achieving the right balance between the needs of national security and the great principles of the rule of law in a free society.


In the time available to me before the adjournment, let me briefly respond to some of the points that I understand have been made from the crossbench. It has been said by Senator McKim that the Greens will oppose the bill because it restricts civil liberties. There is always a trade-off between appropriate protection of the community and the protection of civil liberties. This bill, which is hedged by even more extensive safeguards than we have known before, achieves that balance. 'Civil liberties' cannot be used intelligently as a mantra or a slogan. You have to identify, in the case of each particular measure, why the trade-off is wrong. It is my job both to protect civil liberties and to protect national security, and every day of my life I grapple with the task of ensuring we get the balance right. In performing that task, I am advised not merely by those who advise the government but by the parliament, particularly through its committees, like the PJCIS, the fruit of whose work this bill in large measure is.


Senator McKim, I am told that you said the fact that a 15-year-old attacked Curtis Cheng is no argument for lowering the age of control orders. That is an extraordinary proposition. There have been two lethal terrorist attacks on Australian soil since September 2014. One was by Man Haron Monis at Martin Place, and the other was on Curtis Cheng. One of the two attacks was committed by a 15-year-old. If you do not think that that demonstrates that people younger than the age of 15 are susceptible to radicalisation and the blandishments of those who would entice them down a self-destructive path of violence and, in the case of the late Mr Curtis Cheng, murder, I do not know where you learned your logic from, Senator McKim. One of the two lethal attacks was committed by a 15-year-old, and I can tell you, having in my role as the Attorney to review cases and issue warrants on a regular basis, that it is not at all uncommon—in fact, sadly it is very common—to see at-risk people below the age of 16. To meet your objection, Senator McKim, about the need to balance these measures with appropriate protections of civil liberties, we have introduced a whole new regime, which did not exist in the previous legislation, to protect minors who are the subject of control orders.


I agree with Senator Xenophon's observations that careful scrutiny of agencies and powers is essential. As Senator Xenophon knows, we have that. We have a very elaborate architecture of protection through the parliament; through statutory offices like the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security; and through accountability measures within policing and national security agencies themselves. I had the benefit of meeting the Attorney General of Canada this afternoon, and we were discussing the ways in which our respective countries address this very problem. I can assure you, Senator, that Australia leads the world not merely in protecting our people but in protecting our liberties through the careful and thorough architecture of oversight mechanisms and accountability mechanisms which are built into the legislation.


Senator Leyonhjelm, I note your opposition to the changes. It reflects your principled libertarian stand, which I acknowledge and respect. But, nevertheless, might I gently chide you: when one has to deal with the real consequences and the real problem of keeping communities safe, a purist libertarian policy position will not always meet the occasion. It just will not. So, as I said to Senator McKim, what we have striven to do is to be as sparing as possible in invasions of civil liberties and only invade civil liberties to the extent absolutely necessary to protect our community. I look forward to the debate in the committee stage of the bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-11-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:15):  I continue my remarks on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016.


Moreover, the evidence presented may well be derived solely from information provided by foreign intelligence agencies, without our own security and intelligence having completed their own investigations or analysis. No doubt the government is thinking of the need to act quickly in response to intelligence, especially highly classified communications or signals intelligence obtained from Australia's primary intelligence partners, the so-called 'Five Eyes' of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. There may well be cases where urgent action is required. It is also the case, however, that signals intelligence often requires careful analysis, understanding of context and, frequently, extensive additional research.


Moreover, intelligence from foreign sources is not only from our Five Eyes partners. Australia's intelligence agencies have broad liaison relationships, including with some foreign intelligence and security services, some of whom have reputations that are, at best, mixed. The government keeps the details of those relationships highly classified, but it is not unreasonable to consider the possibility that a person might be subject to an application for a control order on the basis of information not from the British Security Service or the US Central Intelligence Agency, but from, for instance, the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate or Pakistan's notorious Inter-Services Intelligence. The potential for injustice similar to that involved in the Haneef case is clear. However, we will never know the story because the whole process will be secret.


More broadly, the implementation of this regime—the arguments and decisions for imposing control orders—will be a further step in the development of a body of secret legal opinion and precedent. Courts will take secret decisions on the basis of secret information; precedents will be set. Secret courts and secret law are never a desirable development. Senators should be very clear in their understanding of what is proposed here.


While the Law Council of Australia has welcomed the inclusion of the special advocate scheme as a measure that will mitigate the procedural unfairness identified in the original bill—and I welcome it—it has also recommended an immediate review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I note that there are no crossbenchers on that committee.


There are certainly very significant issues raised by these provisions of the bill. To take but one example in relation to legal professional privilege in communications between the special advocate and the person subject to a control order: the court will be responsible for on-forwarding communications between the special advocate and the party, with a responsibility to ensure that such communications do not prejudice national security. Significantly, there is provision for the court to consult with the Attorney-General or his or her representative in determining whether a communication may prejudice national security. The Attorney-General and his representatives will thus be privy to communications between the special advocates and persons subject to a control order. Significantly, while special advocates will be appointed by the courts, it is the executive that will prescribe by regulation the requirements a person must meet in order to be appointed as a special advocate.


The Attorney-General has acknowledged that while the bill creates the architecture for a special advocate role:


… some time will be needed for the supporting regulations and administrative arrangements to be established for the regime to work.


Given the obvious importance of the special advocate role in what is proposed, it would be much better if these arrangements were incorporated within the bill and the entire proposal subject to further parliamentary committee scrutiny. These are matters that ought quite reasonably to be asked of the Attorney in the committee stage.


The other provisions I wish to focus on now are those relating to the secrecy provisions of section 35P of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, which implement the government's response to recommendations made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. Schedule 18 broadly implements the recommendations made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor in his report on section 35P of the ASIO Act, which was a scathing report on section 35P.


That report arose from the previous failure of the parliament and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence Services in considering the government's original proposals for draconian secrecy provisions relating to the conduct of special intelligence operations by ASIO. I voted against those provisions. They were something the joint committee said ought to be passed, and they were passed by the parliament. But that change was subsequently referred to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the Hon. Roger Giles AO QC, a former Federal Court judge and eminent lawyer and jurist. Quite frankly, I am sad to see him go. He has retired or resigned from that position.


Professor Clinton Fernandes, a former army intelligence officer, now a professor of the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy, and I made a joint submission to that inquiry. No other members of parliament made a submission at that time. Our main concern was the chilling effect that the new law would have on scrutiny of ASIO's operations, especially through media reporting. After conducting his inquiry, Mr Giles observed that section 35P:


... creates uncertainty as to what may be published about the activities of ASIO without fear of prosecution. The so-called chilling effect of that uncertainty is exacerbated because it also applies in relation to disclosures made to editors for the purpose of discussion before publication.


Mr Giles went on to say: 


Journalists are prohibited from publishing anywhere at any time any information relating to an SIO, regardless of whether it has any, or any continuing, operational significance and even if it discloses reprehensible conduct by ASIO insiders.


That is quite chilling. The underlying issues were summed up by the INSLM as follows:


The basic problem with section 35P is that it does not distinguish between journalists and others (outsiders) and ASIO insiders. The application in this manner of broad secrecy prohibitions to outsiders is not satisfactorily justified, including by precedents in Australia or elsewhere.


Mr Giles also made this point:


Section 35P is arguably invalid on the basis that it infringes the constitutional protection of freedom of political communication. Section 35P is also arguably inconsistent with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so not in accordance with Australia's international obligations.


The fact that that legislation got a tick of approval from the PJCIS and enjoyed bipartisan support from the coalition government and the Labor opposition tells me that parliamentary scrutiny of new counterterrorism and national security legislation needs to be much more rigorous and robust. 


We now have before us the government's effort to put things right on the basis of recommendations made by the INSLM, Mr Giles. These amendments aim to introduce new protections to section 35P by establishing two separate offence regimes, with one regime to apply to persons who came to the knowledge or into the possession of the relevant information in their capacity as an entrusted person and a separate regime for outsiders. Under these new regimes the disclosure of information made by members of the community, except those who received information in their capacity as an entrusted person, will only constitute an offence if the information will endanger the health or safety of a person or prejudice the effective conduct of a special intelligence operation. The amendments will also establish a defence of prior publication available only to persons who did not receive the relevant information in their capacity as an entrusted person. This bill reflects the INSLM's view that it is appropriate to retain disclosure offences, and that the special intelligence operation scheme is both necessary and proportionate.


The government argues that its agreement to implement all of the INSLM's recommendations regarding section 35P demonstrates its commitment to ensuring that we are achieving 'the right balance between the public interest and our national security requirements'. I agree that the amendments within the present bill are an improvement on the provisions of section 35P that were previously passed by the parliament. However, I do make the point that they are measures of considerable complexity and some ambiguity. Some significant stakeholders have certainly expressed the view that the INSLM's recommendations, and by implication the provisions of this bill, do not go far enough to provide certainty to journalists and others to know what information may be published without exposure to criminal liability or to protect journalists and whistleblowers who might seek to disclose allegations of wrongdoing in the course of a special intelligence operation. These are matters that I hope to raise with the Attorney in the committee stage. For example Paul Murphy, CEO of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, stated:


The Monitor’s report, while welcome, has not changed the fundamental intent of section 35P which is to intimidate whistleblowers and journalists.


These amendments are certainly worthy of further close and critical scrutiny, if not by the PJCIS then by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. That would certainly allow media organisations, journalists, legal experts and other interested parties to make detailed submissions in relation to the precise amendments that are before the Senate now.


There are many other complex and potentially controversial provisions within this bill. While some have been reviewed by the PJCIS, others have not. If we are serious about the balance between security and accountability, between secrecy and scrutiny of our intelligence legislation, there needs to be further debate and review. This is a duty that the parliament, and especially the Senate, needs to commit itself to with every new piece of counterterrorism and national security legislation. With each of these bills we are asked to strike the right balance. With each of them we are asked to trade off hard-won rights and long-established principles in favour of public safety and security. I do not think anyone doubts the importance of public safety. The threat of terrorism is real and persistent, but that does not diminish our responsibility to look at every measure with objectivity, scepticism and a determination to not lightly deviate from fundamental principles upon which our legal system and democracy rest.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-11-08,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:26):  As my colleague Senator Nick McKim has already indicated, the Greens will be strongly opposing the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016, just as we have strongly opposed most of the erosions of basic freedoms that have been pushed through this parliament and previous parliaments over the course of the last 15 years. One of the most noxious elements of the current bill is that it purports to extend the operation of control orders to children as young as 14. For the people who may be listening, control orders are the instruments which allow a court to make an order, on the evidence of the Federal Police, that severely restricts the movement and the freedoms of an individual.


There has been much debate about control orders in the past. The former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Bret Walker SC, said that there is no need at all for control orders—that is, control orders simply serve no purpose. Mr Walker pointed out that existing provisions are more than sufficient to achieve the purpose of keeping the community safe from possible acts of terrorism and other violence—that is, his belief was that the same could be achieved through existing provisions, existing laws. If there is any evidence that would justify the restriction of somebody's freedom on the basis that they are planning to commit an act of violence, then that person should be placed under conditions of bail or, indeed, remanded in custody. That is our view and that it is consistent with the view of Bret Walker SC.


Senator Xenophon just referred to the current Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Mr Roger Gyles QC, who was a former Court of Appeal judge in New South Wales. He was also of the view that much stricter safeguards in relation to control orders are warranted. He has made it very clear that, if control orders are to exist, we need much stricter safeguards. So here we have two fine minds, two esteemed legal professionals, who have made it very clear that they see no case for expanding control orders and yet here we are in this parliament, after almost 15 years of legislation that has opposed very basic freedoms, with a government proposing to apply control orders to 14-year-old children. The Attorney-General's claim is that this measure is necessary because adults are now using 14- and 15-year-old children to get around the control order regime as it already applies to adults, but of course using that logic begs the question: what happens when this bill passes and adults work out that they can do what they were doing previously using 12- and 13-year-old children to get around control orders, or perhaps younger children? Should we apply them to 10-year-olds or eight-year-olds? Are we then to look forward to yet another bill in the future which extends control orders to children barely out of primary school?


In its submission to the inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security into the previous version of this bill, the Australian Human Rights Commission—and we do have respect for the Australian Human Rights Commission, unlike some others in this place—said:


The Commission is not aware of what evidence there is to support these claims—


that is, about lowering the age for control orders—


… However, they are, on their own, insufficient to demonstrate that allowing control orders to be granted for children between 14 and 15 would be necessary and proportionate … 


It is a view that was echoed by a number of other organisations in their submissions to the same inquiry. We had the Muslim Legal Network's submission, which again said that on their own they are insufficient to demonstrate that allowing control orders to be granted for children between 14 and 15 would be necessary and proportionate.


The unfortunate reality is that this parliament has waved through far too many restrictions on basic freedoms and individual liberties. If we reflect on how a control order works in practice, we can see just how profound the impact is with the restrictions of individuals. Suspects who are subject to control orders might need to wear tracking devices. They might face curfews. They might be restricted from using phones and from communicating with particular people. They might be restricted from using the internet. All of this is in the face of suspects sometimes being denied knowing what the evidence is against them. They may not in fact be facing any criminal charge. These are people who are rounded up and sometimes not told what evidence the police may have against them. They may not be facing any criminal charge, yet they are faced with significant restrictions on individual liberties. Of course, any breach of a control order carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. You have to ask yourself: at what point does a democracy look less like a democracy and more like a police state?


I was having an interesting conversation with some members of the Muslim community, and a young man who migrated to Australia from the former Yugoslavia spoke about the nation that he knew and that he grew up in and how slowly the country he grew up in and loved changed with further restrictions on individual liberties and went from being a democracy to essentially a police state. His view was that many of these changes happen incrementally and chip away over time and, at some point, the nation you once knew becomes unrecognisable.


We have seen over the past 15 years an incremental chipping away at our basic freedoms and liberties. I say 'incremental' for most of these changes, but occasionally there are extraordinary leaps and the changes are significant. It is for that reason that Australia is now commonly recognised amongst developed countries as having some of the most restrictive anti-terrorism legislation in the democratic world.


I have said this on a number of occasions, as have many others: you do not remove freedom in order to protect it. That is not how you protect individual freedom. Removing freedom is not the way to protect it. You cannot protect liberty by locating more of it behind a police line. We have to remember that if you are fighting a real threat—and, of course, we acknowledge that there are significant threats—you do not do it by becoming more like the threat that you are facing. Of course we should be taking sensible, evidence based actions to prevent acts of terrorism and violence—no question. We understand that the threat is real. But the key here is that the response must be both sensible and evidence based. It needs to be proportionate and measured.


The tendency, sadly, of this parliament has been to simply sign off on more and more restrictions on individual freedoms, often on the vague justification of national security. It is a great shame that there has not been a full and frank debate in this place about what we are giving up. There has not been the scrutiny that is required of this sort of legislation, largely because we have seen both a government and an opposition that are too afraid of being seen as soft on terrorism to ensure that we have scrutiny of legislation that removes some of the most basic individual freedoms and liberties. Yes, there is an issue that needs to be addressed. We are seeing young people being radicalised and we are seeing people who are engaged in violent activities. Often they are groomed through the internet, sometimes via a particular self-proclaimed religious leader. They are recruited into a hateful ideology, the ideology of ISIS and many other extreme groups. We know that these are toxic ideologies and of course we should be doing everything in our power to prevent their reach to our young people. But people who work in this area, who are experts in the field of youth radicalisation and this extremist ideology, say time and time again that the very worst thing that the Australian state can do is to buy into the logic of fear, division and marginalisation. Unfortunately, that is what bills such as this one do. Again, let's remember what part of this legislation seeks to achieve. A 14-year-old child can be rounded up, locked up and have their freedoms restricted, all without charge, and for a breach face imprisonment for five years. It is social cohesion—not division, not demonisation and control and, more and more, not just surveillance of particular individuals—that is going to help keep our community safe. 


We should acknowledge that it is Australia's very successful and quite unique model of multiculturalism—our celebration of cultural differences within our diverse Australian nation—which represents our greatest strength and our real protection from some of the acts that we have seen in other parts of the world. People of different cultures working together, going to school together, learning from each other, building trust within communities and creating families together are Australia's true strength and our best defence against this poisonous ideology. The most toxic effect of this bill and other, similar bills is that they do the opposite. They drive more fear and more division within our community. All you have to do is spend five minutes talking to members of the community who practise the Muslim faith to know exactly how they are feeling. They feel that they have been isolated, marginalised and demonised and they see division being sewn within their community. 


Let's be clear about the impact of this legislation—I accept that it is not the intention but it is the consequence. Again, speaking to members of the Muslim community, when you hear young people say, 'We are afraid of putting deep roots into our community because we worry that at some point in the future we will have the authorities knocking on our door,' you know just how deep that fear is. Let's not beat around the bush here. There are some communities in Australia who will cop the brunt of this country's ever-expanding national security enterprise. As I said, I do not think that is the intention of the government or indeed the opposition when they put up and vote for bills like this, but everyone of us who votes in this chamber must be aware of the implications of our vote: that we are making our community less safe rather than more safe. Regardless of what we intend, we have to be aware that when we support bills like this we are ensuring that particular minority communities in Australia will be targeted even more, and that does not support our efforts at enhancing social cohesion. 


It is for those reasons that the Greens are voting against this bill. We do want to keep our communities safe, but we do not believe this is the vehicle to do that. We do not agree that there is a basis for this legislation. We are deeply concerned at the continual erosion of our basic freedoms and liberties, because, when we give up those freedoms and liberties, those people with whom we are fighting—they win. We believe that ultimately this legislation will drive a deeper wedge between members of the community who are concerned about the impacts of terrorism and those members of the community who will be targeted by this legislation. We understand that Australia's diversity is our great strength. We understand that people of different cultures coming together, working together is how we combat some of the threats that Australia faces.


The Greens will be voting against the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016 and we urge the government and, indeed, the Labor Party to rethink their position on this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,2,speech
"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2016-11-08,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:41):  I rise to speak in favour of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016. This bill was first introduced into the last parliament in November 2015 and was immediately referred, of course, to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The joint committee held public hearings and received submissions in December 2015 before reporting in February 2016, and the parliament was, of course, prorogued before either house had a chance to consider the bill.


Before turning to the specific provisions of the bill I wanted to take a moment to discuss the importance of this oversight process provided by the parliamentary joint committee and to touch on Labor's approach to security legislation in general. Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Australian parliament has debated and enacted 65 pieces of anti-terrorism legislation. Taken together, they constitute substantial changes to the architecture of Australia's security legislation framework. These changes have been made in the face of emerging and serious threats to our national security. These threats are not abstract and they are not distant. Australians have been affected by terror plots both at home and abroad, and the work of our law enforcement and security agencies has prevented Australians from being affected by many more.


Earlier this year we understood that there were more than 100 Australians fighting or engaged with terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria and many more providing support or facilitation from Australia. Australia's national terror threat is currently set at 'probable'. This means there is credible intelligence indicating that individuals or groups have both the intent and the capability to conduct an attack. It is incumbent upon us to respond properly to this threat. As a parliament we have no more important responsibility than to do what is appropriate and necessary in protecting the safety of the Australian people. However, we will not meet this demand that is made of us by simply voting in favour of security legislation in the form in which the government initially proposes it. Parliament must endeavour to find a balance between protecting the safety of our community on the one hand and maintaining the values and the freedoms of our community on the other. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security plays an important role in finding this balance.


I was not a member of the joint committee when it considered the present bill, but it is worth turning to what the chair of the joint committee said in the other place when tabling the report on the bill. He said:


I commend the bipartisanship of the committee, but 'bipartisanship' should not be taken to mean that we all sit there and agree with each other on every matter that we have discussed. I can say without breaching any provisions of the Intelligence Services Act that on many occasions there has been much robust conversation with respect to that, but that is the job of our committee—a committee behind closed doors that operates on behalf of the Australian people.


Indeed, in my short time on the committee this has been my experience. As a party, Labor seek to approach security legislation from the position of bipartisanship. We believe that our national security apparatus must be properly equipped to protect Australians from terrorism and this means providing security agencies and institutions with the resources and powers that they need to do this. It is, however, worth repeating what Senator Collins said earlier in the debate today:


…our bipartisan assistance to the government on matters of national security is never a blank cheque. Bipartisanship on national security means that we will support necessary and effective measures to address threats to our nation …


The converse is also true. Ultimately, as a parliament we abrogate our responsibilities if we knowingly support measures that burden people's rights but are not necessary or effective in addressing threats to our nation. The oversight provided by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is an important bulwark against this, and, for reasons I will go on to explain later in the speech, the present bill provides an example of how the joint committee can work together to make sure that security legislation is more appropriate, more properly targeted and more proportional.


As I noted before, however, the Australian parliament has debated and enacted 65 pieces of anti-terrorism legislation since 2001, and with each additional piece of security legislation we are providing greater and further powers to our national security agencies and institutions. Our agencies cannot function properly without the trust and confidence of the public, and nor should they be allowed to. Reliable, effective external oversight is essential in ensuring this. As the powers of the national security agencies grow, so too does the importance of oversight. This is not something that can be left to the courts. A judicial system of course plays an important role in policing the boundaries of executive activity; however, Australians would not, and should not, be satisfied with merely knowing that there is an absence of illegality in the cases that happen to come before the courts. Parliament also plays an important role in ensuring that legislation is appropriate and proportionate.


This is not enough, however. Australians deserve to know that their national security agencies and institutions are effectively, efficiently and appropriately serving the purpose for which they were created, and the joint committee is the forum in the parliament that is best placed to do this job. I quote again from the tabling speech in the other place by the Chair of the PJCIS:


Fundamentally I think the Australian people need this committee to have the capacity to inquire more diligently and more thoroughly into matters that it should be tasked to look at. That would include, potentially, the capacity for the committee to have self-referencing power …


It is for this reason that I commend to this chamber the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015, which is sponsored by Senator Wong. As noted in the second reading speech for that bill:


The maintenance of public security in the current security environment does require enhanced powers for the agencies charged with this responsibility. However, the protection of our hard-won democratic freedoms equally demands enhanced oversight of the exercise of these powers.


The PJCIS Amendment Bill 2015 provides for enhanced oversight by, amongst other things, removing the constraints on membership of the committee and allowing greater flexibility in determining PJCIS membership; providing for the PJCIS to conduct own-motion inquiries after consultation with the responsible minister; authorising the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to provide the PJCIS with a copy of any report on a matter referred to it by the committee; requiring the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to give the PJCIS a copy of any report provided to the Prime Minister or a minister within three months; giving the PJCIS the function of conducting pre-sunset reviews of legislation that contain sunset provisions; and adding the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the national security adviser to officers who are able to be consulted by the PJCIS. This is a good bill that will provide necessary and appropriate powers to an important parliamentary body.


I will now return to the bill before us, and I thank the chamber for their indulgence. As I mentioned earlier, the bill provides an example of how the joint committee works in a bipartisan way to make sure that security legislation is more appropriate, more properly targeted and more proportional. The bill that is before the chamber now is not the same as the bill that was introduced in the last parliament. The 2015 bill was referred to the joint committee immediately upon being introduced, and the committee received 17 submissions. The committee made 21 recommendations, subject to which it recommended that the bill be passed. These recommendations have resulted in improvements to the bill which is now before the chamber.


The bill extends the control order regime to young offenders. The committee made a number of recommendations about these provisions. The committee recommended that the bill require the best interest of the child to be a primary consideration. This ensures that the bill is consistent with Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The bill now contains provisions to this effect. The committee also recommended that the bill be amended to expressly provide that a young person has the right to legal representation in control order proceedings. The bill now contains provisions to this effect. As Senator Collins said earlier in this debate, Labor pushed for these amendments in order to make sure that the legislation properly balanced the rights of young people who are the subject of control order proceedings with the safety of the Australian community as a whole.


The committee also made recommendations about the creation of a new offence of 'advocating genocide.' The creation of this offence is in line with the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The joint committee recommended that a fault element of 'recklessness' be included as there were concerns raised by submitters that the offence was drafted too broadly. Specifically, submitters raised concerns that the offence as drafted could have the unintended consequence of limiting reporting of terrorism. The 2016 bill now includes the fault element as recommended.


As Senator Collins set out, there are a number of other recommendations made by the committee, which Labor has pushed to have as amendments incorporated into the bill. Our commitment to bipartisanship does not mean that we offer the government a blank cheque on security legislation—nor, for that matter, do the government's own parliamentarians. In this case, as in many others, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Security and Intelligence provides an important mechanism for the parliament as a whole to provide proper scrutiny of security legislation, and to make sure it operates as intended and protects our community without unnecessarily burdening individuals. I hope in due course that we will have another opportunity in this place to further consider Senator Wong's private member's bill to enhance the committee's ability to perform this oversight function.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-11-08,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:52):  I oppose this bill—the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016—because it significantly, permanently and unjustifiably expands the power of the Commonwealth government to hold people without charge.


The Commonwealth government introduced preventative detention orders in 2005 to authorise the holding of a person without charge for 48 hours. The power can be used in two circumstances. First, the power can be used if detention is reasonably necessary to preserve evidence of a terrorist act that occurred in the last 28 days. Second, the power can be used if detention is reasonably necessary to substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act, on the proviso that the terrorist act 'is imminent and is expected to occur, in any event, at some time in the next 14 days'. The wisdom of allowing preventative detention orders in this second circumstance is debatable, given that authorities have significant power to engage in surveillance, authorities with a skerrick of evidence can detain people by charging them, and detention without charge is a violation of a fundamental right.


But at least this preventative detention is detention—it can only occur on the proviso that a terrorist act is imminent and is expected to occur. Unfortunately, the government now wants to get rid of this proviso. In its place, the government will simply require that relevant officers 'suspect on reasonable grounds that a terrorist act is capable of being carried out and could occur within the next 14 days'. Note the replacement of 'is' with 'suspect'. I can suspect that someone is out to get me, but that does not mean there is someone out to get me. Note also the replacement of the word 'imminent' with 'could'. The difference between these words is as stark as the difference between winning the lottery and merely buying a lotto ticket. If you win the lottery, a massive boost to your wealth is imminent. If you merely buy a lotto ticket then it is indeed the case that a massive boost to your wealth could occur, but it is far from likely and definitely not certain.


The government has not explained why it needs a power to detain people without charge when a terrorist act is not imminent. Instead it has the gall to say that its bill is merely clarifying the law rather than changing it. We should see the pattern here. First, the scaremongers persuade the parliament to enact preventative detention powers by citing all the qualifications and limitations on those powers. Then, with each amendment, these qualifications and limitations get pared back—all in the name of clarification. There is little public sympathy for people who could find themselves in preventative detention, because it is common to assume that police would only ever chose to detain bad guys and would never make mistakes about who is a bad guy and who is not. So when the police asked for beefed up preventative detention powers I can understand why the coalition agreed, and Labor has not resisted. But it is a dereliction of their duty to the public nonetheless. 


There are many other retrograde provisions in this bill. The bill ramps up search and surveillance powers used against people who are subject to a control order and denies them access to the information that put them under a control order in the first place. The bill effectively bans computer games that are said to promote terrorism, even though there is no evidence that playing a game makes someone act out the game. The bill makes it easier to get a search warrant and delay telling the property owner about the search. The bill bans the advocacy of genocide. That hurts our ability to identify people with genocidal views and to rebut those views—and inciting genocide is already a crime. So, sadly, once again I oppose the government's counterterrorism legislation and, once again, I find myself in a minority with the Greens. Will the government please give me a break?


Even when the government introduces a good provision it does so in a half-hearted fashion—for instance, this bill amends section 35P of the ASIO Act to reduce penalties for outsiders like journalists who disclose information about special intelligence operations where the information does not endanger health or safety or prejudice an operation. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was asked to review 35P, and he recommended this reduction. The reduction is a good thing and is something I called for when 35P was first debated two years ago, but the Senate was full of deaf ears. They were yes-men and yes-women when the government introduced the lengthy penalties, and, as no-one is objecting to this bill's lessening of the penalties, they are clearly yes-men and yes-women now.


The reduction in penalties is a good thing, but it is half-arsed. The offences in 35P for disclosing information about ASIO's special intelligence operations were based on offences for disclosing information about the AFP's controlled operations. Now the government is reducing penalties for journalists when it comes to disclosures about special intelligence operations involving ASIO but doing nothing about the penalties for journalists when it comes to disclosures about the AFP's controlled operations. The logic of penalties for journalists being lower than penalties for insiders is the same whether we are talking about ASIO or the AFP.


But the government is a logic-free zone when it comes to civil liberties and national security. Logically, this bill should be substantially altered, if passed at all. We deserve better. My constructive proposal is to make the coercive aspects subject to a sunset clause of 10 years. In other words, unless re-enacted, they will lapse automatically in 10 years. That will give the government, Labor and the law enforcement agencies plenty of time to determine, objectively rather than anecdotally, whether this constant chipping away at our liberty is actually making us safer and whether, just as we were told there would always be reds under our beds, claims that the threat of Islamic terrorism will be always with us. I am dubious about whether we need this law, but I am certain that we do not need it on the books permanently.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-11-08,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (19:00):  I rise in support of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016, and I will explain why. Yes, it is a shame that 14-year-olds may be dragged before the courts on charges of terrorism and it is a shame what may happen to them, but that is the way of life and that is what has happened to our country. Many Australians are very concerned about terrorism and live in fear. Just recently a poll was taken where 49 per cent of Australians said they wished for a ban on further Muslim immigration to this country, and, of that 49 per cent, 47 per cent based that view on the fact that Muslims do not integrate. Senator Di Natale made a comment here earlier about Muslims saying how they feel marginalised and demonised and that they are afraid. I think the majority of Australians feel very afraid, because we are now seeing terrorism on our streets. People live in fear. I here from many people who say that they are afraid to go on trains or to shopping centres or sporting venues; they are in fear. We need to address this, and I do believe that we need to act with very hard leadership and say that we are not going to allow this to happen on our streets. 


We talk about control orders and tracking devices. There are now over 500 Australians who are under surveillance, and the authorities are having trouble tracking them. Why is that so? Why do we have so many people like that here? These people have not come here to Australia for the right reasons. They are here to push their own agenda, their own beliefs. Senator Di Natale says that we are a multicultural nation—and, yes, we are. People have come here from different parts of this world. They have migrated to Australia for a new way of life—to leave behind terror and their way of life for a better way of life. I think that is wonderful, because Australia has been based on all the different cultures that have come here. But what has happened now is that people are coming here not to assimilate, not to integrate, not be one of us, not to abide by our culture, our laws or our way of life. They do not have respect for us. Some carry with them a hatred towards us—and that can never be accepted or allowed to happen. 


It is a shame that people as young as 14 years of age could be affected by this legislation—but it is justified. Otherwise, what do we say to the family of Curtis Cheng, who was shot dead by a 15-year-old? What do we tell his family? We are now finding that younger and younger people are wanting to commit these crimes. We cannot allow that to happen. They are not children. They are people with their own beliefs and determinations. They are not a child anymore. People have to start being responsible for their actions, no matter what their age, especially when an Australian's life—I do not care how many there are; even one—may be taken by someone who does not believe in our culture or our way of life and who bears us hate in their heart—and I hate to see it. 


You talk about multiculturalism and how Muslims feel offended, demonised and marginalised. When the grand mufti of Australia, Ibrahim Abu Mohammed, wrote a letter warning that to criticise even a gay hating imam is to risk inciting terrorist attacks against us, was he pulled up? Did anyone say he should not be saying that? What about his support of Sheik Shady? 


In his online sermons he attacked Jews, called on God to help destroy the enemies, declared that the punishment for adulterers is stoning to death, damned Christian parties as worshippers of Satan, declared that the Australian government is oppressing Muslims and accused gays of spreading diseases through evil actions that bring evil outcomes to our society. What does Senator Di Natale have to say about that—or does he defend that?


No hatred should be accepted from anyone in this country. We are all Australians trying to live in this country in peace and harmony together. That is what I purport and that is what I will stand strongly for. We must take strong actions against these people—anyone, regardless of whether they have a religious or cultural background that opposes our way of life, must be dealt with harshly. Many other countries around the world are now feeling that—and they are attending to the problems in their own country by having these people deported. If these people are not happy in our country then please go back where you came from or go and find another country that suits your beliefs.


I have a duty to the people of Australia to ensure that they feel safe on our streets. I do not want Australia to become like other countries around the world. We talk about people's civil liberties and their rights. Their rights start with them. The majority of Australians are not under the law, they do not have tracking devices and they are not in our court system—because they abide by our laws. We have to send a clear message to other people that we are not going to accept it. That is why I support the government's legislation on this and send a clear message to those who wish to come here and disrupt our way of life.


I will be moving an amendment to this bill. The legislation states that these people will be given free legal aid. Our legal aid system is under enormous stress at the moment. I know of people in the Family Court who cannot get legal aid—they are fighting for their rights—and many who do not get it are suiciding, taking their own life. In Australia, there is no reference in any of the eligibility or assessment criteria documentation that says an applicant for legal aid in criminal matters must be an Australian citizen. I believe they should be. It is the taxpayers who are paying for this, and I think legal aid should be available to Australian citizens or permanent residents. Under our legal aid system if another person supports you, provides financial support to you or can be reasonably expected to provide you with financial help, then the means test will take this person's income and assets into account. My amendment to this bill would add: 'And there is evidence that at least one parent or guardian of the person has the means to appoint a lawyer to act for that person'. That means if a parent or guardian of that child between 14 and 17 can afford to pay for the legal costs, so they should; it is not up to the Australian taxpayer. Let's treat them exactly the same as we treat anyone else who applies for legal aid in this country. I will be moving that amendment to the bill.


There is a lot more to be said on this. As I have said, let's look at this fairly. I take into account what Senator Leyonhjelm said about this: we should have a sunset clause. The days and times are changing rapidly. Maybe we need to look at immigration—who we actually bring into Australia—as I have always said. Let's address the problem before it gets out of hand. I hear time and time again that our authorities are stretched to the limit. I hear that there is a probable attack and a possible attack. That is what we are told. We need to make sure that our country is safe, and if these people, even as young as 14, want to go out there and try to commit a crime against us and this nation, they will certainly receive the wrath of the law as far as I am concerned. Thank you.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-08,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:10):  I thank honourable senators for their contributions. I thank in particular the Australian Labor Party for their support for this measure and Senator Hanson for One Nation's support for the measure. Can I, by the way, clarify a matter that you just raised, Senator Hanson? The national terrorism alert level is 'probable' at the moment. It has been at that level or the equivalent level since September 2014. Last year we changed the nomenclature to make the expression of the alert level a little more clear. It used to be 'high', and 'high' was defined as 'a terrorism event was assessed to be likely'. Now at the same level the descriptor is not 'possible' but 'probable'.


I thank honourable Senators for their contributions to the debate and I will turn in a moment, as time permits, to responding to certain observations that have fallen from some crossbench senators. The bill provides significant measures to address the ongoing terrorism threat in Australia. The measures were developed in response to lessons learned from recent counterterrorism operations, and the bill is informed by a number of independent and parliamentary committee reports, including the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on the 2015 bill of the same name, which lapsed when the parliament was dissolved earlier in the year. To give even fuller effect to the recommendations of the PJCIS, I will be moving a government amendment to the bill regarding legal representation for young persons in control order proceedings.


The government has worked closely with the states and territories on these reforms and will continue to do so as part of our comprehensive reform agenda to strengthen Australia's national security and counterterrorism legislation. Importantly, the bill includes measures that will modernise the control order regime, including reducing the minimum age for which a control order can be imposed on a person from 16 years to 14 years or older but introducing a new safeguards regime for minors; creating targeted regimes to facilitate the monitoring of individuals subject to control orders through physical search, telecommunications interception and surveillance device powers; and providing greater protection to sensitive information in control order proceedings.


The bill will also criminalise the advocacy of genocide, which, as I said in the second reading speech, is the incitement to murder an entire population, not an exercise in free speech. These are important measures in preventing terrorism and the spread of extremism in Australia. They are supported by a robust countering violent extremism—or CVE—program which focuses on prevention as our first defence against terrorism. Our program works with communities to address the underlying factors that, unfortunately, make violent extremism appealing to some individuals, particularly young people. It includes adopting new methods to counter the spread and allure of extremist propaganda online and makes sure that our families, communities and institutions like schools and workplaces have the knowledge and tools to respond to radicalisation.


Changing an individual's circumstances, behaviour and feelings is hard. While there is evidence that these programs are working, we know that there will be cases where they will not succeed, and we are in the relatively early days of developing the body of knowledge and understanding of what works in CVE and what works less well. That is why we need to ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the powers that they need to respond when a situation escalates.


The bill also reflects the government's decision to implement in full all of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor's recommendations in his report on section 35P of the ASIO Act. The government understands the importance of maintaining public awareness of and confidence in the activities of our security agencies. This and other measures in this bill provide further demonstration of the government's commitment to ensuring that we are achieving the right balance between the needs of national security and the great principles of the rule of law in a free society.


In the time available to me before the adjournment, let me briefly respond to some of the points that I understand have been made from the crossbench. It has been said by Senator McKim that the Greens will oppose the bill because it restricts civil liberties. There is always a trade-off between appropriate protection of the community and the protection of civil liberties. This bill, which is hedged by even more extensive safeguards than we have known before, achieves that balance. 'Civil liberties' cannot be used intelligently as a mantra or a slogan. You have to identify, in the case of each particular measure, why the trade-off is wrong. It is my job both to protect civil liberties and to protect national security, and every day of my life I grapple with the task of ensuring we get the balance right. In performing that task, I am advised not merely by those who advise the government but by the parliament, particularly through its committees, like the PJCIS, the fruit of whose work this bill in large measure is.


Senator McKim, I am told that you said the fact that a 15-year-old attacked Curtis Cheng is no argument for lowering the age of control orders. That is an extraordinary proposition. There have been two lethal terrorist attacks on Australian soil since September 2014. One was by Man Haron Monis at Martin Place, and the other was on Curtis Cheng. One of the two attacks was committed by a 15-year-old. If you do not think that that demonstrates that people younger than the age of 15 are susceptible to radicalisation and the blandishments of those who would entice them down a self-destructive path of violence and, in the case of the late Mr Curtis Cheng, murder, I do not know where you learned your logic from, Senator McKim. One of the two lethal attacks was committed by a 15-year-old, and I can tell you, having in my role as the Attorney to review cases and issue warrants on a regular basis, that it is not at all uncommon—in fact, sadly it is very common—to see at-risk people below the age of 16. To meet your objection, Senator McKim, about the need to balance these measures with appropriate protections of civil liberties, we have introduced a whole new regime, which did not exist in the previous legislation, to protect minors who are the subject of control orders.


I agree with Senator Xenophon's observations that careful scrutiny of agencies and powers is essential. As Senator Xenophon knows, we have that. We have a very elaborate architecture of protection through the parliament; through statutory offices like the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security; and through accountability measures within policing and national security agencies themselves. I had the benefit of meeting the Attorney General of Canada this afternoon, and we were discussing the ways in which our respective countries address this very problem. I can assure you, Senator, that Australia leads the world not merely in protecting our people but in protecting our liberties through the careful and thorough architecture of oversight mechanisms and accountability mechanisms which are built into the legislation.


Senator Leyonhjelm, I note your opposition to the changes. It reflects your principled libertarian stand, which I acknowledge and respect. But, nevertheless, might I gently chide you: when one has to deal with the real consequences and the real problem of keeping communities safe, a purist libertarian policy position will not always meet the occasion. It just will not. So, as I said to Senator McKim, what we have striven to do is to be as sparing as possible in invasions of civil liberties and only invade civil liberties to the extent absolutely necessary to protect our community. I look forward to the debate in the committee stage of the bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.

 (Northern Territory) (19:27):  I would like to speak about the visit I had recently in the Northern Territory with the Seafood Council. I met with Katherine Winchester and Rob Fish from the Northern Territory Seafood Council, who have been working quite passionately in support of the industry.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, Senator McCarthy. I know it is exciting that there is the opportunity for people to now leave the chamber and go home, but I would ask to hear Senator McCarthy's contribution in silence. Thank you, Senators.




Senator McCARTHY:
  It is very exciting, what I have to say. 



A government senator interjecting—




Senator McCARTHY:
  It is about the Northern Territory, the best territory here in this country, and I urge all senators to visit and do some fishing. There are great barramundi up my way—



Senator Scullion interjecting—




Senator McCARTHY:
  as my fellow senator from the Northern Territory would know. I had the chance to meet with Katherine Winchester and Rob Fish and talk about some of the issues that concern the NT Seafood Council. There is an increasing demand for seafood in Australia and there is certainly a strong push, not just from the Northern Territory Seafood Council but from business owners and consumers, to have greater transparency of labelling requirements for imported seafood. The NT Seafood Council reports that Australians eat 200,000 tonnes of seafood per year and this trend continues to rise. With an increase in demand comes an increase in jobs in the seafood industry and investment. The Australian prawn industry is planning to increase its production by 50 per cent for the Australian market. This expansion across the Northern Territory, Far North Queensland and Western Australia is projected to create 1,700 jobs.


The country-of-origin labelling gives the consumer the opportunity to make informed decisions about their seafood consumption. According to the Label My Fish campaign, most Australians do not know that about 72 per cent of the seafood we eat is imported. They do not know this because it is not labelled. There is no requirement to indicate the country of origin of seafood sold for immediate consumption, so consumers lack easy access to information that would enable them to make informed decisions about what seafood to purchase.


The Northern Territory Seafood Council has also highlighted the impact this more transparent labelling will have on business. In 2008 the previous Northern Territory Labor government introduced country-of-origin labelling for cooked and pre-prepared seafood. According to the Seafood Council, this labelling has resulted in an increase of the consumption of seafood in NT restaurants. Darwin business owner Jason Hanna owns four restaurants in Darwin. He has told the Northern Territory Seafood Council that customers want to know where the product they have ordered comes from. They want to know if it is local or if it is imported. The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation project reports tracking the impacts on seafood consumption at dining venues arising from the Northern Territory's seafood-labelling laws showed that one business owner reported a 20 per cent increase in seafood sales after the country-of-origin labelling was introduced.


Transparent labelling also benefits Australian producers, and the market becomes an even playing field. The country-of-origin labelling in the Northern Territory has resulted in the retail sector reporting the biggest selling fish are now the Australian red snapper and Australian-grown red snapper.


I would certainly urge all states and territories to protect our industry and to grow our own. We saw today in recent media reports what is happening in Victoria, with the possible threat to at least 1,000 jobs there in terms of SPC and their negotiation with Woolworths. I certainly encourage the big corporates to look at the local grown companies around Australia. Support our industries. Make sure that we have jobs for all Australians.
