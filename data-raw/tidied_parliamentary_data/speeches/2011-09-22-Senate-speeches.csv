Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:31):  I rise to support the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011. This is a bill which has been brought forward by  Senator Larissa Waters on behalf of the Greens and I am delighted to stand here today supporting it. It is a bill which requires coal seam gas corporations to gain the written authorisation of farmers to enter their land to conduct coal seam gas activities. It provides that authorisation must contain independent advice about all the risks to food security and groundwater and also makes it clear that the farmer can refuse to sign. It provides that any corporation entering land without the permission of the farmer would incur a daily $55,000 fine, risk prosecution and be subject to the farmer's right to seek an injunction from the Federal Court which the corporation must pay for. 


The bill applies to all land that has produced food at any time in the 10 years prior to the first proposed coal seam gas activity on the land, from commercial primary production through to urban vegetable gardens. The bill does not alter the ownership of the minerals and gas which remain vested in the states. The bill does not affect the ability of the federal and state governments to compulsorily acquire the land in order to access the resources, with appropriate compensation.


This goes absolutely to the heart of one of the most significant debates of this century: the issue of food security. The Greens have been very clear about this for some time. We are facing a global food insecurity crisis. With climate change accelerating, we are seeing extreme weather events around the world occurring with such frequency that the loss of agricultural production is impacting on the ability of countries to feed their own populations and to engage in trade. For example, we have had extreme weather events in Australia, Russia and the United States at similar times affecting the global grain harvest. Mr Putin banned the export of grain from Russia. That led to massive increases in the price of bread in the Middle East, and that was one of the main triggers of the riots in Tunisia that sparked the Arab Spring.


We are going to be facing this issue throughout this century and one of the critical things we as a parliament must do is protect agricultural land for agriculture. It is essential that we do that because Australia needs to maximise the amount of food it grows not only for itself but also for global circulation because that is going to be a major contribution not only to keeping people alive but also to global security. Where you have food scarcity leading to famine, it leads to displacement of people and riots like we had through the Middle East and as we currently have in Africa. It is essential that we move in now and say that Australia must protect its food-producing land for food production.


The Greens have a very long history on this. In particular, this is how I began my political career, because I worked on behalf of the farmers in the Wesley Vale district, where my parents had a dairy farm, to oppose the North Broken Hill pulp mill proposal for a massive industrial develop­ment in the heart of first-class agricultural land in north-west Tasmania. It would have polluted Bass Strait to the detriment of the fisheries and it would have spread a toxic cloud around the farmlands which form best front country on the north-west coast with early seasonal crops. The farmers stood very strongly. The first sticker I ever produced said 'Save our soil, sea and sand, protect the land'. That is still a heartfelt responsibility I and the Greens have for the production of food. If you are going to maintain food security, both maximising food production in Australia and for export, you have to enable farmers to stay on the land. There are two sets of issues. One is the sustainability of food production and maintaining sustainable systems for food production and the other is a set of policies that will enable farmers to stay on the land. What we have here is absolutely at the heart of this: the conflict between what the mining and the gas companies want. They do not care about whether farmers stay on the land. All they care about is maximising their profits from the extraction of coal seam gas. That is all they care about. We now have the most appalling situation where 40,000 coal seam gas wells are expected to be rolled out across Queensland in the next few years and there is rapid expansion planned for New South Wales and Victoria as well. So now is the time for robust protection for our landholders and of course for the environment. 


One of the very big unknowns with coal seam gas is the long-term consequences for our aquifers and our river systems. Already, a very substantial petition from the Myall Lakes has been submitted to the hearings and in that submission they say: 'It is a Ramsar ecosystem. It is protected for its signifi­cance.' Yet there is no protection if coal seam gas gets its way. There will be contamination of the river system that flows into those lakes and that will undermine the capacity for long-term sustainability. And we know full well that there has been no assessment of the impact of this kind of activity on the Great Artesian Basin. Nobody knows, not even the Coordinator-General in Queensland, who is the person in that state with the authority to approve and condition these particular licences for coal seam gas. So if the Queens­land government and Queensland's own Coordinator-General cannot tell people what the long-term impacts are, how can a farmer have any confidence that at the end of the day they are not going to have their groundwater contaminated and the groundwater lowered because of the huge volumes of water required for this activity, or about the long-term impact on the Great Artesian Basin?


This is a reckless experiment by coal and gas companies to maximise their profits at the expense of farmers. Can the Wentworth Group answer the question: what will the impact be on the Great Artesian Basin? No, they cannot. Can the CSIRO? In their most recent report, they said they had serious concerns about long-term impacts. The National Water Commission have said that they are very concerned about long-term impacts. So that is what has been said by those bodies who look after water and the serious environmental issues in our desert continent.


If you are going to have food security and food production, if you are going to maintain ecosystems into the future, you have to protect your river systems. You have to protect your groundwater. You have to protect the Great Artesian Basin. None of those things are protected. There is no precautionary principle being engaged here. Governments are simply turning a blind eye. What is this parliament going to do? When it was put to the Leader of the Opposition on radio that landholders must have the last word surely on when anyone can enter their property, Mr Abbott, said:


... there is an old saying—an Englishman's home is his castle.


He went on to say:


... the thing is if, if you don't want something to happen on your land, you ought to have a right to say no.


I agree with Mr Abbott: you ought to have the right to say no. He went on:


... okay, under certain circumstances the Government ought to be able to resume your land but it has to be done at a fair price.


Yes, and that is about compulsory acquisition and this bill has nothing to do with compulsorily acquiring land. This bill says that a farmer has the right to say no, that they do not want coal seam gas activities on their property.


I have heard the government say, 'We've always had the situation where the minerals underneath the ground are collectively owned by the people and therefore not the preserve of the farmer at the surface.' This is an entirely different industry to all the things that have gone before in terms of extraction. This is a situation where not only are they coming on the land and disrupting the activities on the land, and adversely impacting the person carrying on agricultural activities but they are jeopardising the long-term capacity of the land to produce food because of the contamination of ground­water, the lowering of the groundwater, and the potential long-term impacts on the Great Artesian Basin. So if ever there was an argument for a farmer to say no, it is now.


I agree with the Leader of the Opposition. So what happened? I think he must not have remembered to write it down, because within days the opposition spokesperson was manoeuvring to clarify what his leader said. Mr Macfarlane had to clarify this issue and back off absolutely. Where are the Nationals on this? The National Party tell farmers they are out there protecting their interests. But all they are doing is talking to farmers about getting fair compensation. Compensation is fair if a farmer says, 'Okay, I am prepared to have coal seam gas.' It is appropriate then that there are appropriate levels of compensation. But that is a cop-out from the fundamental point: should a landholder have a right to say, 'No, you cannot come onto my property and you may not drill wells on my property for coal seam gas'? That is the point of this legislation and that is the challenge for the parliament here. It is very straightforward. Anyone who goes out to rural Queensland will be able to see the adverse impacts. Talk to the community groups—and I have cited the one from the Myall Lakes in New South Wales—and you will find people are putting in submissions all over the place. There is ample evidence of the adverse impacts. 


It is now time to make decisions. It is no longer appropriate for people to say: 'It is not obvious yet. We are not sure about the long-term impacts. We'll just proceed regardless.' We should not be proceeding regardless because the question is: are you putting the profits of mining and gas companies ahead of the capacity of farmers to stay on the land and produce food, and to stay on the land and produce food sustainably by maintaining access to uncontaminated water?


We all know that water becomes contaminated where there is fracking involved. Of the chemicals used in fracking, only six of around 60 chemicals that are used have even been assessed, so nobody actually knows what the long-term impact of these activities is going to be.


Yes, the New South Wales government panicked in the face of community uproar, especially as this has reached the suburbs of Sydney. I understand St Peters has become an area of exploration and people in the suburbs are now saying: 'For goodness sake! What is going on here? You are giving these companies the right to dig up suburbia as well as to dig all over the rural and regional areas.' But in New South Wales the moratorium is only against fracking; it is not against the ongoing rolling out of coal seam gas across New South Wales.


If the coalition and the government have a vision for Australia as being a quarry for miners—dig it up, cut it down, ship it away; dig it up, cut it down, pump out the gas as well—then let me put on the record that that means we will seriously reduce the capacity of this country to produce food and, furthermore, we will see more farmers driven off their land.


I note the submission from Doctors for the Environment Australia to the inquiry of the Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee into the management of the Murray-Darling Basin. They made a strong case that we are already seeing high rates of mental illness in rural and regional Australia because of the stresses associated with trying to stay on the land, with collapsing commodity prices and with the high dollar acting against them. Farmers are already under pressure as a result of extreme weather events like the drought we suffered through the Murray-Darling Basin and of course the floods that occurred more recently.


People in rural and regional Australia want to get on with the job of producing food and do not want to be harassed by companies they do not want on their land. That is the question here: when are we going to stand up and say, 'We are going to support farmers because we prioritise food security, ecologically sustainable agriculture and the right of farmers and farming communities to influence their own destiny'? Or are we going to say that the destiny of rural and regional Australia is in the hands of mining and gas companies—many of which are owned outside Australia and many of whose profits leave Australia—and leave rural communities absolutely devastated and destroyed by this industry. That is what we are actually seeing right now.


I am very interested in what the coalition is going to say, because in spite of Mr Macfarlane trying to reposition the coalition there is nothing clearer than what the Leader of the Opposition had to say originally—before he wrote it down. I do not know whether he has written down his backdown on this particular issue, but it is clear that the opposition no longer supports the right of a farmer in Australia to say no to coal seam gas exploration and drilling wells on their land. Well, the Greens do say no and the Greens are putting it to this parliament and inviting everyone in the parliament to either join us and say no or go out and tell people in rural and regional Australia why they should not have the right to say no.


I will conclude my remarks with a discussion of climate change. People are arguing you need coal seam gas in order to attack the accelerating impact of climate change. Let me get this straight: there is a lot of emerging evidence to say that coal seam gas, because it is methane, has a much, much greater impact on global warming in the short term than carbon dioxide has. What you are going to do if you accelerate the mining of coal seam gas is put a blast of methane to the atmosphere in the short term and actually make the situation worse in the short term than it otherwise would have been. The short term matters, because global emissions have to peak and come down. The scientists agree that the date for that should have been 2015 but, because we are not going to meet 2015, they have now said it should be at least by 2020. We are not going to get global emissions to peak and come down by 2020 if we engage in this massive expansion of coal seam gas across the planet. We are seeing an acceleration of climate change, as I pointed out in here only a week ago, with record loss of Arctic ice. Once you lose that, of course, you get massive emissions to the atmosphere after the ice has melted, with impacts on the tundra et cetera.


This is something Australia needs to take seriously. We need to have a strategic plan for food production in Australia in light of these issues, and that is why I am co-hosting a bill this afternoon, with Senator Xenophon, about protecting agricultural land in relation to foreign ownership. Not only are we seeing the loss of food production through extreme weather events; we are now seeing other countries moving in and buying up large tracts of agricultural land around the world to feed their own people—not to put into the trade but to feed their own people when other countries opt not to export. There has been a massive land grab around the world and it is happening with agricultural land in this country as well. Already 30 per cent of water licences in Western Australia are foreign owned or partially foreign owned, and 40 per cent of the Northern Territory's land area is already partially or fully foreign owned. Those things should be a matter of concern to this parliament.


If you are serious about sustainability, if you are serious about food security, if you are serious about keeping farmers on the land and taking the pressure and stress away from them then you will support this bill giving them the right to say no, they do not want coal seam gas explorers and their wells on their properties. There should be a very firm commitment from this parliament on push-back, or else this parliament will be giving a wink and a nod to this generation of profiteers to jeopardise the Great Artesian Basin.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (09:51):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate, which I have a strong interest in. The Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011 seeks to provide farmers with the opportunity to say no to coal seam gas mining on their properties without written consent. It would exercise powers to apply penalties on any constitutional corporation if it undertook any activity to explore or produce coal seam gas on food-producing land without the prior written authorisation of everyone who has an ownership interest in that land.


To date, mining and urban expansion has not threatened Australia's food security. Australia is food secure. We are sheltered from direct concerns about food shortages because we have a world-class agricultural sector and our farmers produce far more food than we consume. On 15 August 2011, the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism, Martin Ferguson, told ABC NewsRadio that 'it is constitutionally the states' responsibility, in association with the territories, to manage the development of our resources'. He also said that 'it would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth to start undermining the constitutional capacity of the states for short-term political gain'. Therefore we will not be supporting this bill.


Mineral resources belong to the Australian people. This bill would give veto rights to landholders and preventing access would mean that those assets belonged to the landowner—in other words, privatisation. This undermines the ownership of resources by the state government on behalf of the people. The Australian government believes that landholders and mining companies are able to work together and this position is shared by the National Farmers Federation. Vice-President and Chair of the NFF Mining and Coal Seam Gas Taskforce, Duncan Fraser, said:


Our position, and that of our members, is not about preventing mining and CSG exploration or extraction–but rather ensuring that agriculture, CSG and mining can coexist, so as to guarantee the long-term sustainability of our food and fibre production.


According to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, APPEA, agriculture and gas industries have already coexisted for many years—we have seen gas extracted in Roma for half a century.


In my state of Queensland coal seam gas is prominent, with more than 90 per cent of the state's gas supply being CSG. CSG also constitutes one-third of eastern Australia's gas supplies. It powers a number of domestic electricity generation projects throughout Queensland, including the Origin Energy operated Darling Downs power station and the Braemar 2 power station. APPEA says that the CSG industry supports more than 5,000 jobs and expects this to boom to 18,000 jobs. They say the Queensland industry injects $850 million into the Queensland government through taxes, which means more funding for vital infrastructure. 


CSG's continuous growth outran the global financial crisis, kept Australians in jobs and supplemented the fiscal and economic position of Australia. In 1997, the total output of the coal seam gas industry in Queensland was 3,652 petajoules. By the end of the 2009-2010 financial year, this figure had climbed to 27,992 petajoules, representing growth of more than 750 per cent over the past 13 years.


The international market, particularly the Asia-Pacific region, has experienced increased demand for liquefied natural gas. Coal seam gas will be fed through over 4,000 kilometres of already constructed pipeline and liquefied to produce LNG. The expected explosive demand for LNG will continue to encourage production of coal seam gas. In October last year, Treasurer Wayne Swan and resources minister Martin Ferguson welcomed an announcement by BG Group that it would invest US $15 billion to develop its coal seam gas and LNG operations to export gas from Gladstone. This funding will go towards construction and expansion of a 540-kilometre gas pipeline. It is estimated that the project will increase gross state product by up to $32 billion between 2010 and 2021 and add about $4 billion in value to our exports each year. The project also means 5,000 jobs and 1,000 prominent positions.


CSG is significant in both Queensland and New South Wales, with APPEA suggesting that these two states can produce and power a city of five million—just over what the population of Queensland is—for 1,000 years. APPEA also says that more than 1,400 land access agreements between landholders and the industry had been signed and that 'every single aspect of taking CSG to LNG for export has been examined through the public environmental impact assessment process. Both state and federal government environmental approvals have been granted, with conditions to further safeguard aquifers, landholders and the environment'.


Lock the Gate Alliance Inc, in which former Greens candidate Drew Hutton is involved, state on their website:


Coal seam gas (CSG) is a fossil fuel—a dirty energy source that adds to greenhouse pollution. 


According to APPEA, electricity generated using gas produces up to 70 per cent less in greenhouse gas emissions than some existing coal generation technology, meaning coal seam gas has a significant role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Gas is an important fuel for the transition to a low-carbon economy. LNG can produce the same amount of energy as coal with significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions. According to a study conducted by WorleyParsons, the greenhouse gas intensity of LNG over its life cycle is approximately 50 per cent lower than that of coal. The development of the CSG to LNG industry is providing the opportunity to develop the massive CSG resources of Queensland economically and to bring forward the development of CSG reserves in other states.


Lock the Gate put forward a submission to the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural Affairs and Transport into the management of the Murray-Darling Basin. In a statement dated 21 September 2011, APPEA Chief Executive Belinda Robinson said that Lock the Gate's submission included content which was copied and pasted from a United States study, with the words 'coal seam gas' substituted for the words 'shale gas'. Ms Robinson said:


The study that this group has drawn its material from actually makes no mention of coal seam gas or the Australian industry.


APPEA stated in a media release on 18 August 2011 that some people have insinuated that greenhouse gas emissions of CSG are worse than those of natural gas. APPEA refutes this. It said that any leakage from CSG is monitored and the emissions are lower by up to 70 per cent from gas-fired electricity. It said:


Since the passage of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 every major gas company in Australia—CSG or otherwise—has been legally required to monitor, measure or estimate, and report all emissions associated with its operations to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency; including fugitive emissions and emissions associated with venting, combustion, and flaring. No emissions are undisclosed.


In July, I launched the Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance, GISERA, in Brisbane on behalf of Minister Kim Carr. The launch was at a marvellous new structure where the old Boggo Road jail used to be. To see the construction alone you would more or less comply with the belief that this is an environmentally friendly building so no doubt the release was prominent and it was appropriate to do so in a building that houses CSIRO and groups of other scientists that are paving the way and certainly making steps as to the way that we look at our environment and move to a sustainable greenhouse and protected environment for our future. The Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance is a partnership that was founded by the CSIRO and Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd, who have invested $4 million and $10 million respectively to investigate the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the natural gas industry over the next five years.


I had the opportunity to question some of the people involved in this launch and get some reasonable feedback about the appropriateness of this sort of injection into this particular area. As I indicated earlier, it is not a new area and it has been happening in my home state of Queensland for many decades. The alliance is to establish research, to establish fair consultation with and feedback from people in particular areas where this mining is happening to make sure concerns are allayed. The alliance will help fill the knowledge gaps of this vast energy resource and it is a chance to increase the evidence based understanding of what we are dealing with. Regulators, developers, land owners and the broader community will have a common basis to negotiate approaches which balance both the challenges and the opportunities.


I can really appreciate there being some confusion out there from the public and also some members of parliament about the effects of coal seam gas. It was not that long ago, while on a plane trip down from Brisbane, that the member for Wright and I were discussing this particular area. I think at that particular stage that member, being a member of the National Party, had some views and some concerns about the effect on farmers and about compensation and I think we were having a reasonable discussion. I think most of those issues have now been dismissed and I am sure that those people on the opposition side from the Nationals understand the value of this particular area for the industry and also for farmers in general.


Issues which will be explored by GISERA include groundwater and surface water, biodiversity, land management, the marine environment and also the socioeconomic impacts. The research will enable us to predict the consequences of decisions. It means we can assess how certain courses of action will affect the economy, the environment and the community. The results of these findings will be made available for the public. I think that is appropriate to make sure that the public is fully aware of any likely concern that is raised as a result of the research that the CSIRO and the partnership with GISERA will certainly establish and which will be available to the public.


In October last year the Queensland government's new laws in relation to land access came into effect. A document released by the Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation states:


The new land access laws are vital to achieving a balanced approach to private land access and compensation. They recognise and clarify the Government's expectations and rights of tenement ... authority holders and land holders relating to how resource activities must be undertaken on private land.


DEEDI states the key features of this legislation as:


... a requirement that all resource authority holders must comply with a single Land Access Code; an entry notice requirement for 'prelim­inary activities', for example, those that will have no or only a minor impact on landholders; a requirement that a conduct and compensation agreement be negotiated before a resource authority holder comes onto a landholder's property to undertake 'advanced activities', for example, those likely to have a significant impact on a landholder's business or land use; a graduated process for negotiation and resolving disputes about agreements which ensures matters are only referred to the Land Court as a last resort; stronger compliance and enforcement powers for government agencies where breaches of the Land Access Code occur.


As you can see, Mr Acting Deputy President, there is a series of steps already to work through a process to identify any concern landholders might have as a result of coal seam gas exploration on their particular land, a process that has been implemented by the Queensland Labor government to assure people that they have no concerns over risk as to what might be occurring on their particular space on the land.


In April this year the state government announced that gas and  petroleum companies must provide 10 business days notice to landholders of any drilling, fracking or certain exploration taking place as well as 10 business days notice of work completion. The Queensland Minister for Employment, Skills and Mining, Stirling Hinchliffe, said:


These new laws are designed to make sure landholders know exactly what is happening on their land and when it is happening. They apply to all activities including hydraulic fracturing used in producing Coal Seam Gas, drilling, completing or abandoning a well or bore as well as seismic and other surveys associated with exploration or production. This will also help the government monitor the use of chemicals in the extraction of Coal Seam Gas in Queensland.


Just last week the Bligh government announced that it would expand its AgForward Coal Seam Gas Landholder Support Initiative into the Galilee and Bowen basins, which is an area I know quite well through my travels in the state of Queensland. It is a beautiful part of Far North Queensland. The $1.4 million injection is to assist landholders by providing them with the education and tools to properly negotiate with mining companies. The state Minister for Agriculture, Food and Regional Economies Tim Mulherin said:


We want landholders to have the knowledge and the information they need to negotiate the best agreement possible with CSG companies. Landholders and CSG companies will be working together for years to come, so it is important that the relationship is based on a firm foundation.


The minister said that this program had already been rolled out in the Surat region with four pilot sessions and 32 FarmShed workshops where the training is delivered to the 875 people taking part. The funding injection means another 20 workshops in the Galilee and Bowen basins can take place. These training sessions will assist land­holders in being able to successfully negotiate with a coal seam gas company before exploration or production takes place. Minister Mulherin said:


The aim of delivering mutually acceptable agreements is to minimise disruption to the landholder's enterprise, wherever possible, and to set out appropriate arrangements for land access and financial compensation. This is a key step in establishing a successful coexistence of the coal seam gas industry and the agriculture sector.


The state government has also introduced a strategic cropping land policy framework. This aims to produce a balance between protecting prime agricultural land while allowing for the development of the CSG industry. The Queensland Premier has also announced that CSG and mining activities will not be permitted within two kilometres of population centres over 1,000 people. These announcements from the state government prove that it is committed to ensuring that Queensland landholders are protected as well as enabling our mining industry to survive.


Investment decisions in Queensland's CSG to LNG industry taken since October 2010 total more than $45 billion. This industry will create jobs, particularly in regional communities, boost the economy at both a state and federal level and deliver billions in government revenue. It will lift Australia's export income and provide states and the Commonwealth government with a significant source of royalty and PRRT revenue. As a cleaner alternative to coal-fired power LNG is an essential part of the global solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provides many jobs and opportunities in regional Australia. APPEA states that the CSG land-use footprint is much smaller than other energy sources and the land can be returned to its original use.


I took the opportunity some weeks ago, when APPEA was in the building, to have a presentation done by them and saw the before-and-after slides of what the effects of land management are as a result of them using this particular mining on properties. Virtually the end result is negligible. There is little or no impact on the particular land, certainly as seen from the photographs that were supplied. I made the point earlier that, in my travels to Roma on numerous occasions over the years, I have seen that firsthand.


The state government already has effective legislation in place ensuring protection for our landholders. They have introduced training programs so that landholders can effectively negotiate with coal seam gas companies before entering into agreements. They have introduced legislation to protect prime agricultural land under a strategic cropping land framework while allowing the gas industry to continue. We believe the right way forward is for the gas industry and landholders to effectively work together for the benefit of everyone. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (10:11):  It is not a great surprise that, when we look at an area where there has been some concern expressed, particularly in rural and regional areas of Australia, about an area of public policy such as the use of prime agricultural land with people expressing concerns about what is unfolding in some parts of our country, the Australian Greens are there to rush forward with a solution. The solutions are quick and easy in areas which have defied wiser, more sober heads. In those areas the Greens seem to be able to come up with solutions relatively quickly. The question of being able to address an issue as complex as this with a simple solution, I might say a simplistic solution, is one that the Senate deserves to give closer attention to than is presented by the opportunity of this bill.


This bill represents far too ready a solution to a problem which is, in fact, a complex one, which deserves case-by-case consideration in many instances and is one which state governments are generally grappling with with varying degrees of success. We need to remind ourselves that this is, indeed, a state responsibility. The use of land is a primary responsibility of our states and territories, and for the Greens to enter into this space in this way with a simplistic solution again calls into question their commitment, a commitment that has been restated many times in this place, that they have a strong regard for the rights of states and territories to legislate within their own areas of responsibility. This was exhibited only a few weeks ago in this very place, but I will come back to that issue in a moment.


The coalition does not see any merit in this bill. As I said, this is an issue for state governments, who have accountability to their electors to issue licences for exploration and the subsequent exploitation of resources. The fact is that resource companies cannot enter a landowner's property to exploit the minerals and resources on that property without a negotiated or, in the worst case, a Land Court arbitrated agreement with that landowner. 


The coalition, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, has made it perfectly clear that within that framework the federal opposition's view is that prime agricultural land must be protected. We will work with state governments to ensure that that objective is reached. There is clear evidence in Queensland that many landholders are able to come together sensibly to reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for the future use of their land and that the coexistence of agricultural and resource industry activities is not only possible but is also, in fact, the norm. Both the Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, and the man who I think is widely expected to be the next Premier of Queens­land, Campbell Newman, have addressed this issue very directly. They are both fully seized of the importance of protecting prime agricultural land and have committed to the objective of ensuring that there is a strong and direct response to the concerns raised by landholders about their land being properly used and its present owners being properly consulted about the way in which that occurs.


I had the opportunity a few months ago to visit the electorate of Flynn in Central Queensland—the electorate of Mr Ken O'Dowd, the LNP member, who is fully apprised of the concerns of local landowners about how their land is used and how prime agricultural land may be at risk. It is through representations such as his that the LNP in Queensland has come to address this issue directly. I will speak about that in a moment. At the federal level the coalition supports the expansion of the coal seam gas industry where that is in harmony with the rights of landholders and the protection of prime agricultural land for food production. 


I emphasise again that we are not talking about a one or the other response—we are not saying we either exploit the resources or we exploit the land for its food production capability. It is possible to deliver a balanced approach, acknowledging the importance of the mining industry to Australia's future economic sustainability while also acknowledging that Australia has a tremendous asset in its agricultural land. The quality of farm products in Australia is enormously important to Australia's reputation as an exporter, and it is critical that we acknowledge and respect the rights of farmers. 


The federal opposition supports the work of its state colleagues in delivering a more balanced approach than the approach offered by state Labor governments in recent years. In fact, it needs to be acknowledged very directly that the characterisation of this debate as an all-out war between farmers and miners grossly understates the extent of cooperation which has been occurring for a long time in regional and rural Australia. Mining companies by and large are well apprised of the values of the communities in which they work. They seek to add value as much as possible to those communities—there are exceptions, of course—and it is important that the potential for agreement making in these areas be enhanced by creating opportunities for those agreements without blanket decisions being imposed on parties by legislation introduced in the federal parliament. 


The mining industry and the farming community have worked together in Australia in many areas and both sectors are prospering as a result. There are long-established systems in place which allow miners and farmers to negotiate land access, and there are very few cases where disagreements end up in court.




Senator Waters:
  Not anymore.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  You will have your opportunity, Senator, to put an alternative point of view. We know how well embedded the Greens are in rural Australia, how popular they are there and how many people vote for them in those parts of Australia. I am sure you have very good connections that tell you what is going on there—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Humphries, please address your remarks through the chair.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Liberal Party and the National Party have a much better understanding of what goes on in rural and regional Australia. We have worked in those communities, we have represented those communities, for decades. We understand the pressures they are under and we are working at both the federal level and the state and territory level to solve these problems in a realistic fashion. I suspect there are many communities around Australia that will not thank the Greens for rushing forward to advise them on how they can solve their problems when the Greens have, as a party, very little connection with those parts of Australia—except when it comes to marching into the local forest to chain themselves to trees to prevent logging or to protest in some other way about activities going on in a rural industry of some sort or another.


As I said, there are numerous examples of farmers and mining companies working cooperatively and negotiating mutually beneficial outcomes. The development of the coal seam gas industry in Queensland is not some kind of rampant uncontrolled exercise which is resulting in the destruction of rural communities; it is a process which is highly regulated. In Queensland the industry is subject to more than 1,500 state and territory conditions. In fact, the coal seam gas industry is more regulated than the uranium mining industry. Coal seam gas companies operating in Queensland, and I include among those Queensland Gas Co. and Santos, have in fact shown that they are willing to work with local communities and to carry out the process of exploring and exploiting mineral and gas deposits in good faith. By way of an example, all of the Queensland Gas Co.'s work on private properties in Queensland has been done with the express permission of landholders. That might not be a fact that suits the case put forward by the Greens, but it is true. In fact, Queensland Gas Co. prefers voluntary agreements and now has more than 800 agreements following negotiations on land access with about 1,000 landholders across the state.


The coalition believe that there are some sections of productive land that are of such significance that they should be given additional safeguards. We acknowledge that is sometimes a necessary step to take, but we also acknowledge that, under our federal arrangements, state governments are responsible for both land use and mining. Therefore, we believe it is a matter for each state government to determine which areas are considered prime agricultural land and for each state to put in place protective measures where appropriate in consultation with farmers, rural communities and resource companies. We urge those parties to deal effectively with the issue of the protection of prime agricultural land and to do so as a matter of urgency.


I think it is fair to say that this is an area in which activity is happening in the right direction. We can see, not just in Queensland but also in New South Wales, that state governments are apprised of the need to take steps that make it clearer what are the respective responsibilities and rights of parties on both sides of this debate. The O'Farrell government in New South Wales have certainly taken steps to balance the needs of mining and agriculture in that state. The government there have put in place a moratorium and there are strategic land-use plans to identify and protect productive farmland. Those plans involve communities in local decision making, ensure a sustainable and healthy mining industry and encourage industry best practice. Obviously the O'Farrell government's arrangements have not been in place for very long and I think it is quite unreasonable for the Greens to march forward and attempt to overturn the balance that has been struck there by virtue of the legislation that is before the Senate today. I might also add that the O'Farrell government are developing at the present time a system of stringent groundwater regulation. They are reviewing fracking standards and they are reviewing access arrangements. So this is very much a matter under close consideration by governments such as that.


I mentioned before that the Liberal National Party in Queensland had also taken steps to show that it is addressing this issue, even though it is not yet in government. It has published a discussion paper that notes the importance of gas to the Queensland economy but does raise a number of issues that have not been addressed by the Bligh Labor government, including the depletion of underground water, the issue of land access, the location of coal seam gas infrastructure close to dwellings and the increasing pressure on inadequate existing regional infrastructure. I think that, with steps such as that, the LNP is well placed to provide for the people of Queensland a much better, more balanced approach than has been achieved by the knee-jerk reaction of the Bligh government to this problem.


It is also necessary to put on the record that the Senate itself has a committee that is currently looking at the management of the Murray-Darling Basin, including the impact of mining coal seam gas. The Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee, chaired by Senator Heffernan, will report on 30 November. Waiting might not be in the genes of the Greens, but it would be a good idea in this case to do so. I note that committee will examine:


The economic, social and environmental impacts of mining coal seam gas on:


the sustainability of water aquifers and future water licensing arrangements;


the property rights and values of landholders;


the sustainability of prime agricultural land and Australia’s food task;


the social and economic benefits or otherwise for regional towns and the effective management of relationships between mining and other interests; and


other related matters including health impacts.


I have been in this place long enough to be lectured plenty of times by the Greens about the need to pay close attention to what committees in this place do and to listen to what the committees are saying before making decisions, yet on this occasion it does not appear as if the Greens are prepared to follow their own advice.


I also take exception to the characterisation by the Greens of coal seam gas itself. At various stages some Greens have referred to it as dirty energy, when in fact coal seam gas is significantly cleaner in terms of greenhouse emissions than many other alternative fossil fuels. I note Senator Furner referred to it being 70 per cent less productive of emissions than other forms of fossil fuels and I have no reason to doubt that is the case.


With this legislation the Greens portray themselves once again as a beast that is strangely torn between adhering to the best science and being the 21st century's version of the Luddites. On areas such as global warming, they are prepared to trot out scientists ad nauseam to tell us how we need to change our ways and to improve our performance as a carbon-producing society. In areas like exploitation of natural resources and genetic modification of food the Greens seem to shy away from the best application of science. They seem to think that it is their preserve to pick and choose what science they believe and what science they do not. It is possible to use technology to exploit coal seam gas in this country in a way which balances the needs of both mining and farming users of that land. For the Greens to characterise this in other ways is just dishonest.


I also cannot help but mention that once again we see the Greens shifting and changing on the question of the rights of states and territories. I think the last piece of legislation the Greens presented to this Senate, only a few weeks ago, was legislation to prevent federal governments from disallowing the laws of territory parliaments. Today, we have been presented with legislation which effectively tells state and territory governments how they deal with their most important single area of responsibility—the use of their land. State and territory governments probably have no more important responsibility than managing the land mass of those states and territories. That is their responsibility and they have a longstanding constitutional responsibility for dealing with mining leases and with agricultural issues. Everything contained in this bill effectively cuts across respon­sibilities of state and territory governments.


But that does not bother the Greens because the Greens do not have those sorts of concerns about being a supporter of one group one day and being a supporter of the enemies of that group the next day. They are perfectly capable of doing that. Senator, as you spend more time in this place, I think you will need to develop a better sense of what a mish-mash the Greens are with their policies and their causes. The fact is that the Greens are, above all, a populist party. They detect some concern about this issue and so they decide that they have a solution. They rush forward into the Senate with a solution to issues which are complex and which deserve careful, sober consideration almost on a case-by-case basis. The Senate therefore should soundly reject this half-baked proposal from the Greens today and allow other processes to deal with these complex but important issues.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:32):  I am very pleased to speak to the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011 and I warmly congratulate Senator Larissa Waters on her initiative. The Greens bill will achieve a goal for which the Greens have campaigned for many years, and that has been clearly set out by Senator Waters. We are working with many farmers, environmentalists and the wider public to ensure that coal seam gas companies gain consent from farmers prior to entering their properties to carry out exploration activities for coal seam gas and to get a number of protections in place. We clearly need balance in how the mining industry operates in this country.


As I think all senators would be aware, more and more communities are becoming deeply troubled about the activities of the coal seam gas industry. In New South Wales, the industry's hunger for new coal seam gas exploration areas has seen a push into both prime agricultural land and even Sydney suburbs. Landholders must have the right to say no and must be able to make informed choices about whether or not they want to risk the exploration of their land. For decades, Labor and the coalition parties when in government have failed to bring balance to how the mining industry operates. The Greens' position as we have already heard in this debate, is often distorted by others. In no way are we talking about shutting down the mining industry. It is about bringing balance, and that is what Senator Waters' bill will achieve if it is passed.


I will deal with some of the misinformation that has already been put forward in this debate. We have had speakers from Labor and the coalition parties and already we see a whole series of arguments trotted out, put forward so that these parties can avoid doing the right thing by farming communities and the wider environment. One of the popular arguments—and I saw this when I was in the New South Wales parliament—is buck-passing between the federal and state governments. Here we have federal senators saying we should leave this up to the states.


The states are doing a bad job—I will come to that in detail—and that is very clear to see. Groundwater and food security clearly need to be national issues. This legislation provides the means for us to achieve the important protection that is needed. This bill is not a replacement for state regulation. It provides an additional tier of protection, and that is the essence of this argument that the senators from Labor and the coalition need to recognise before they come forward with their dishonest arguments.


Another area that needs to be addressed concerns climate change. We need independent Australian coal seam studies to determine the climate change implications. The government should not take the industry's word for it because at the moment the studies that have been trotted out are from industry. Another point where we see distortion in the arguments from the other parties is that this bill does not alter the ownership of the minerals and gas, which remain vested in the states. The bill does not affect the ability of the federal and state governments to compulsorily acquire the land with appropriate compensation. So I ask senators who are coming in on this debate to be accurate about the information that they put forward and not throw up smokescreens to try to justify why their party is not going to support this important legislation.


As I mentioned, this is a huge issue in New South Wales. Communities have become more informed and, as their awareness increases, their concerns certainly are growing. In New South Wales, the public opposition to coal seam gas mining, and particularly to the controversial method of fracking with its associated toxicity, has built to such a strong point that we are seeing wide collaboration between farming com­munities, environmentalists and urban communities. There is a recognition that the economic and health impacts are just not worth the risk. I understand that many people who are actively working in this campaign do support a total ban on coal seam gas mining in New South Wales. Local govern­ment is not embracing coal seam gas proposals. Motions supporting a moratorium have been passed by many affected councils. They have been left with little choice but to oppose this activity because they are not properly informed about the immediate risks of long-term impacts either by the government or the industry. Just yesterday the first day of a New South Wales state parliamentary inquiry was held at Alstonville. The Sydney Morning Herald describes the passionate opposition that was displayed there: 


Passionate opposition to the industry's growth in the region united doctors, cattle farmers, activists, town residents and organic produce growers. 


That is an interesting description from the Sydney Morning Herald and it certainly sums up my own experience working in rural New South Wales as the awareness about this problem has grown.


What we are seeing here too, and it was again reflected at yesterday's hearing, is this point I just mentioned about the growing concern amongst local councils. Richmond Valley, Kyogle, Liverpool City and Tweed Shire councils all gave evidence at the inquiry. It was only the Richmond Valley which has seen any benefit in the coal seam gas production. All those other councils are standing with the majority of people in their communities and representing them effectively, raising their concerns. Let us remember the area that they cover. They cover an area where I know many of my colleagues in this place come from. It is a beautiful, rich area where we see beef and dairy cattle, sugarcane, nuts and coffee. It is such a rich area with those beautiful, fertile soils, which is all at risk if the hundreds, indeed thousands, of proposed well-heads go ahead. I congratulate those councils for the stand they have taken.


It is incredible that the New South Wales government, and indeed the government speakers in this debate, defend the right of mining companies to exploit our natural resources yet they will not defend border security for farmers who are trying to protect the long-term viability of their groundwater from mining damage. Groundwater cannot be separated from food security. In May this year the New South Wales Greens MP and mining spokesperson Jeremy Buckingham introduced a coal seam gas moratorium bill into the New South Wales parliament that will place a 12-month moratorium on the coal seam gas industry in the state and prohibit coal seam gas mining in its entirety in the Sydney metropolitan area. The moratorium would provide adequate time for an independent inquiry into the economic, social and environmental impacts. The call for a moratorium is justified because the industry has not demonstrated that it can operate safely. That is where I put it to my colleagues from the coalition parties and Labor that what they should be getting behind is a moratorium. That is a responsible position when there is so much concern in the community and the safety impacts are so serious.


Senator Waters' legislation before the Senate will be a test for the coalition and the federal government on where they stand on food security and the longevity of our rural communities. I want to repeat that: this is a test for these parties. I have seen this play out in New South Wales, and I will go through that in some detail because it was informative how the other parties responded. Despite what Senator Humphries said about the Greens rushing into this and offering simplistic solutions, I and my colleagues have been working with rural communities for many years. It was on the back of our work with farmers in Liverpool Plains, in the area of Gloucester and in the upper Hunter that I introduced a bill into the New South Wales parliament to stop mining on prime agricultural land and to ensure that the water resources are protected. 


How the campaign was built up to ensure the legislation was passed is most informative. First off we did not get any support from the coalition or the Labor Party. The farmers rallied. They campaigned hard and then the National Party said that they would support the legislation. The Liberals came on board. The New South Wales Farmers Association spoke at a rally attended by about 300 farmers from many parts of New South Wales who bused in for the day. They brought their produce. It was one of the most moving days I had in state parliament with the produce all lined up at the parliamentary gates and the farmers protesting and then they came into the gallery. So we got the coalition on board. For the first time they broke ranks with the mining industry. Some of the comments of the farmers were interesting, and I understand this is why the Nationals changed their position. They said, 'How come the Greens are moving this bill? Why didn't the Nationals, who have been in the parliament much longer, put forward this legislation?' Unfortunately the bill was defeated by one vote, on the combined vote of the Labor government with the Shooters Party and Reverend Fred Nile from the Christian Democrats. But it was informative in terms of the attitude from the other parties and the public pressure which pushed the Nationals to vote the right way.


In 2008 Senator Bob Brown, together with Tony Windsor, the member for New England, built on this campaign when they called on the federal National Party to amend the Water Act to protect the farmers of the Liverpool Plains from mining threats. At the time the Greens in New South Wales also called for our bill to be reintroduced by the Nationals and to include a moratorium on coal seam gas mining and exploration on prime agricultural land. This work with communities from Gloucester, from the upper Hunter and from the Liverpool Plains has been rolling out for many years in the community and the Greens have taken this work into parliament. I am pleased that my colleague in the New South Wales parliament Jeremy Buckingham has taken up this important work for the Greens with such gusto. 


I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to some of the communities that I worked with in the early days of this campaign. I recently met Rosemary Nankivell again at the coal seam gas inquiry committee hearing in Narrabri, where she gave expert testimony on the impacts of coal seam gas in her region. Rosemary is one of the people who have put this issue on the map. She was instrumental in getting one of the first stories into the Sydney Morning Herald. It was when it was very hard to get coverage of this issue. Rosemary was a strong voice for the community. She invited me to a packed community meeting she organised to object to the coal seam gas exploration works being carried out by Santos. This was quite a few years ago. Rosemary was part of the Caroona Coal Action Group, which has done so much excellent community based work in that region to oppose coal exploration by BHP Billiton and China's Shenhua, as well as coal seam gas mining by Santos.


In July 2009 there was a meeting at Mullaley on the Liverpool Plains to call for an end to coal seam gas exploration and extraction on the best food-producing land in the Gunnedah Basin. Mining for coal seam gas, as we know, should have no place in the fertile food-producing lands in this area. Back then we gave an opportunity to the government to quarantine the area from both exploration and drilling. We were arguing that, in the context of climate change and ongoing drought, the profits of the big gas companies should not be allowed to take precedence over the protection of critical water supplies that feed our prime agricultural lands.


My colleague Senator Christine Milne has laid out very clearly the climate change impacts of this industry and how serious they are. There are also many local environmental impacts in various areas. This is particularly so in the Pilliga area in western New South Wales, where Eastern Star Gas has started extracting gas in an area known as the Pilliga Scrub in what is called a pilot project. The company Santos has taken over from Easter Star Gas.


I congratulate the locals there, particularly Tony Pickard and his many colleagues, other local farmers and the various environment groups: the Northern Inland Council for the Environment, the Wilderness Society and the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales. They produced a report titled Under the radar, which I commend strongly. They have identified that the activities being undertaken by Eastern Star Gas in the Pilliga Forest are being done without seeking federal assessment on matters of national environmental significance. The report has found that coal seam gas operations in this area have cleared more than 150 hectares and fragmented 1,700 hectares of bushland. They have drilled 92 coal seam gas wells, constructed more than 56 kilometres of pipeline and operated 35 production wells without seeking approval under the federal EPBC Act. These activities have occurred in habitat for federally listed threatened species, such as the south-eastern long-eared bat. Pepe Clarke, the CEO of the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, has said:


Under Commonwealth legislation, any potential impacts on nationally-threatened species must be referred to the environment department for approval. Eastern Star Gas has been flying under the radar to avoid this process in the Pilliga.


I have visited this area with local farmer Tony Pickard and many of his colleagues. I was alarmed at what is called a pilot project, at how extensive the damage occurring in this area is. The measures put in place by Eastern Star Gas to avoid or mitigate impacts are totally inadequate for preventing such impacts, and their effectiveness is uncertain and not scientifically established. A visit to this area quickly establishes that. You see leaking pipes, unprotected areas where gas is coming out and an industry that looks very dodgy from all angles.


Farmers deserve the right to refuse entry to their land where they are concerned about the long-term risks posed to their land and water resources. I am aware that some farmers have been very badly treated by mining companies, and it is vital that this problem be addressed. It is another reminder of the failure of the National Party to stand up for their constituency. Urban communities also deserve the right to say no to coal seam gas operations that are moving into the suburbs.


The movement against the unbridled expansion of the coal seam gas industry in New South Wales is very broad based; it is extremely diverse and includes farmers, environmentalists, inner city people and retirees on the coast. People are coming together from very diverse sections of the public. From the comments made by speakers from the Labor and coalition parties there is every indication they will join forces to prevent this bill from becoming law. But we can assure you that the movement will bring some sanity to this to protect farming land, to bring in environmental protections and to ensure that another fossil fuel industry that will add to greenhouse gas emissions will not open up. Just last Sunday more than 1,000 people walked down the centre of King Street, Newtown, one of the busiest thoroughfares in Sydney, to express their opposition to this industry. It is quite unique for people in Sydney to develop that understanding about the mining industry. Again, it shows the fantastic work the farming community has done to alert people across this state and across this country.


In New South Wales alone there are currently 100 wells, with proposals to move to 1,500. That is what is on the books. The opposition is considerable and it will build. People feel deeply concerned about it. I call on senators to look into their own hearts for what they will allow to happen to the communities they come from if they do not take a stance. It is not about being against the mining industry; it is about being in balance with how our society works: where we take our energy from, how we ensure we have food security for future generations and how we protect the water resources that are so essential to food security.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (10:51):  At the outset it is a very useful thing to identify the purpose of the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011, which I will now do. The bill seeks to make the recovery of coal seam gas unlawful on food-producing land without the prior written authorisation of all who have any legal interest in that land. From that definition, which is contained in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, I believe, necessarily, that the bill needs to be considered in the context of two other bills either currently before the chamber or about to be introduced into the chamber: firstly, the government's clean energy package of bills and, secondly, the government's proposed Minerals Resource Rent Tax Bill. Both of those sets of bills, as I understand it, are strongly supported by the proponents and advocates of this bill for good, sound and cogent reasons. Their reasons have been well articulated and well established on the public record. Indeed, in passing on rates in respect of the mineral resources rent tax, the Greens have publicly identified that they seek to increase the rent tax imposed by the Commonwealth for access to minerals below the ground. The context of those two sets of bills, therefore, and their relevancy and connection to this bill are important. I will return to that issue later in my remarks.


Let us now consider a range of matters or propositions contained in the bill before the chair. Firstly, the bill exercises Common­wealth power to apply penalties on any constitutional corporation if it, the constitutional corporation, undertakes any activity to explore or produce coal seam gas on food-producing land without the prior written authorisation of everyone who has an ownership interest in that land. Let us think about that critically important proposition. The bill defines 'coal seam gas mining activity' and 'food-producing land' extraordinarily widely. Coal seam gas mining activity is defined as any activity undertaken for exploration—we should note that—or production of coal seam gas. Let us stop here.


Exploration is the first phase of exploration of a mineral or mineral-like deposit. It is the stage only where a potential deposit is identified. Issues like the scope, breadth or depth of the deposit come later. Issues of content come later. Issues relating to value come later. Issues relating to purity come later. Issues relating to commerciality come later. Issues relating to access come later, and issues relating to cost and accessibility must come much later in the process of development.


But the process of raising capital in incremental amounts as potential deposits are valued and revalued is vital to all stages but particularly the exploration stage. Essen­tially, miners raise debt or equity by selling future rights to producers from a site during all phases of development, including post exploration. Yet this bill would stop such a process from the beginning because it requires the written authorisation of everyone who has an ownership interest in the land. It is the most perfect vehicle ever devised to prevent the proving up of likely deposits of coal seam gas.


Let us now turn to the second unlikely phrase used in the bill—that of 'food-producing land'. At the outset I observed that such a phrase is also extraordinarily wide in application. What does 'food-producing land' mean? It is clearly not just arable land, fertile land, developed land, marginal land, grazing land, crop-growing land or irrigated land. If it were, it would be so defined in the bill. No, I suggest it is arguably and clearly intended to mean any land capable of producing food. Let us think about that for a moment. Let us think about technology and science. Let us think about the ingenuity of humankind. Let us think about desert land recovered across Australia and around the world for wheat production. Frankly, there is not any land anywhere in Australia that, with the correct application of science, technology, finance and endeavour, is not capable of producing food.


Let us go back to the post-war years—post the First World War and post the Second World War—and look at land areas that have been sequentially developed in this country. I refer in particular to the river lands of South Australia and Victoria, to the marginal wheat belt territories in the south of Western Australia, to the Ord River lands in Western Australia and to the rich, fruit growing areas of Carnarvon in the north-west of Western Australia. All of those land areas over time have been developed and exploited with a combination of those matters—technology, science, finance and human endeavour. The bill, in that context, seeks to prohibit any coal seam gas activity from the beginning of exploration in any land anywhere in Australia which is or has been capable of producing food. Again, in that context, food is not defined.


In stopping that process, the bill expressly identifies at the outset how that end is to be achieved. The bill, if enacted, would not transfer the ownership of coal seam gas deposits from the Crown; it would transfer control of those resources and probably also any coal deposits requiring the draining of methane from the Crown to the holders of surface rights on food-producing land. Such a change would enable the owners of any surface rights to extract economic rents in exchange for authorising exploration and production of gas of which they have no ownership, thus depriving the community of its right to maximise its return from assets commonly held. Let us break up that proposition into its parts so that it is clearly understood. Firstly, ownership of minerals for hundreds of years has vested in the Crown. Secondly, the Crown has received income via taxation or royalties or excise for permitting lawful exploitation. Thirdly, the Crown uses that revenue for the everyday purpose of government. Fourthly, because mineral rights were vested in the Crown, the value of exploration is never included in the price of land. Fifthly, and finally, the bill proposes to pass that value, that unpriced value, to the current and temporary owner of the land without payment of any consideration—truly a most remarkable proposition. But it gets even worse. 


The government has had a clear position on the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Bill for at least the last 15 or 18 months. The government's position is to increase royalties on major companies who seek to develop mineral deposits around Australia. There has been criticism of that position from the opposition. They are opposed to it. There has also been criticism of that position from the Greens party—not that we are doing it, but they say that our rate, our levy, is manifestly inadequate and should be increased. Senator Brown has repeatedly said that he and his party will move amendments in this chamber to the MRRT Bill when it is introduced to increase the rate. So, for every other mineral, the Greens want to increase the take to the Commonwealth for the purpose of everyday government, but with the bill before the house the Greens want to transfer that benefit to the current titleholders, however temporary, without payment of any consideration at all. Such a transfer of wealth or potential wealth is totally unprecedented, totally unwarranted, unfair and totally devoid of any equity at all. 



Senator Waters interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Bishop, ignore the interjections and address your remarks through the chair, please. 




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  I will indeed, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will say it again. Such a transfer of wealth is unprecedented, totally unwarranted, unfair and devoid of even a scintilla of equity at all. 


Earlier I referred to the authorisation process contained in the bill. The bill requires that such authorisation must include details of an independent assessment of the current and future risks associated with the proposed coal seam gas mining activity on or affecting the food-producing land and any associated groundwater systems. It is unclear whether this assessment would mean an environmental impact statement, an EIS. If so, it clearly would impose a significant impost on landholders. What does this mean? It means this: the bill is seeking to deal with environmental issues by privatising assets owned by the community and setting up a further but protracted environmental process which will not produce improved environ­mental outcomes, since the existing Commonwealth EPBC Act and state environmental processes will continue to apply. 


In that context, let me turn to the work that has been done on the package of clean energy bills for the last nine months. We all know there has been nine months of exhausting committee work. We know that the Greens accepted an invitation from the government to provide the deputy chair to that committee. We know also that it has concluded its deliberations and that its policy recommendations have been examined and accepted by government. We now know that the work of that committee on the clean energy bills has been referred to a parliamentary committee for some six, seven or eight days of exhaustive examination. We know and we hope that that package of bills will be passed in this chamber prior to Christmas. And we know that that package of bills is about carbon reduction, carbon abatement and a clean energy future. 


In that context, the carbon pricing package contains more than $10 billion to promote renewable energy, but early emissions reductions are expected to be driven by the carbon price forming a switch from coal-fired electricity generation to gas-fired generation, which of course has significantly lower emissions. There have been numerous repeated and respected scientific inquiries and findings from universities all around the world that say that the output of carbon emissions from the gas production and gas use process in manufacturing energy is something in the order of 50 to 70 per cent below that of coal. So efforts by the Greens in this bill to prevent the development of gas in this country are totally inconsistent with the transition to a lower carbon future. It is manifestly clear that gas-fired electricity generation is more reliable than renewables at present. The coal seam methane industry is a stunning example, a great example, of our success as a nation and a government at state and Commonwealth level in attracting investment. Three years ago this industry was not even thought about. Now, we have got a $45 billion investment. If the Greens want to reduce CO2 emissions, they must understand that gas is going to make a huge contribution to that because it is clean energy, it is plentiful, it is cost-effective and it is reliable. 


I might be tempted to say what the opposition would say of this bill. They might say it is green extremism. They might say it is absurd bureaucratic process. They might say it is a misuse of policy to achieve an adverse predetermined outcome. But I do not say those things. The opposition might say them in due course, but I do not say them. What I do say of this bill is that it is an example of poor thinking, confused thinking, woolly thinking and silly thinking. It seeks to achieve sound environmental outcomes by absurd bureaucratic processes. 


As I said at the outset, the bill effectively provides an absolute veto of coal seam gas activities by the owners of food-producing land, which is broadly defined in the bill. The bill seeks to overturn state laws which seek to properly balance—




Senator Heffernan:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: could I just point out to the chamber the incorrectness of some of the logic in this debate. Santos has already agreed— 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Pratt
):  There is no point of order. You cannot take frivolous points of order. Senator Bishop, please continue.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. The bill seeks to overturn state laws which seek to properly balance the competing interests of the owners of surface rights to land as granted by a particular state with the rights granted by the same state to explore for and produce coal seam gas. It does this by ensuring that, at a minimum, surface owners are fully compensated for any economic loss or inconvenience as determined through a proper process. Such a change in this bill would enable the owners of any surface right to extract economic rents in exchange for authorising exploration for and production of gas of which they have no ownership, never had any ownership and never wanted any ownership, thus depriving the wider community—all of us—of its right to maximise its return from assets commonly held. This has been the case since European settlement of this continent in the 18th century and it has been the case in right of the Crown since the 12th century in Great Britain. This bill seeks to overturn that right of common ownership, common value and common return to the government—to the people—by the Crown through the provision of common services.


The excuse for overturning these long-established state systems is concern about the alleged environmental impacts of coal seam gas projects. But the bill itself does not do one thing for the environment. It simply transfers control of assets owned by us—or by us through the state—to owners of any interest no matter how remote in terms of surface rights. The bill proposes no change to environmental regulation, because it does not need to. Where matters of national economic significance are involved, the EPBC Act comes into play, as it did with all current Queensland CSG projects—projects which the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, on behalf of this government—




Senator Heffernan:
  It's all lies.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Heffernan, come to order.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
 All these CSG projects are fully subject to state environmental regulation. In any event, the bill, if passed, would undermine efforts by the Australian government to assist the states to develop a harmonised, regulatory and best practice framework for CSG activity work currently being undertaken cooperatively by all interested jurisdictions, including the New South Wales government—Senator Heffernan's own colleagues down the road. That the bill is a crude political exercise is shown by the fact that it will not affect arrangements with respect to petroleum not found in coal seam or minerals not found in association with gas, even when there might be analogous environmental or regulatory issues. Again, as I said at the outset, the bill is so broadly drafted that any competent person could drive a bull and dray through it. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-09-22,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:12):  There are so many things that the previous speaker, Senator Bishop, said on the Landholders' Right To Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill that I would like to deal with—I could spend the rest of my time on them—but let me start with the Greens. The Greens, who apparently want to put themselves up as the champions of coal seam gas by reason of the protection of property rights, are the same Greens who were quite at one with divesting the landholder of their rights for the ownership of the trees and the vegetation on their place. They never put up a bill to hand that property right back to the farmers. They never cared about that—shutting down the land by basically divesting the person of their vegetation rights. They are also the same Greens that want to take 7,600 gigalitres out of the Murray-Darling Basin to shut it down. They never put up a bill saying they do not believe in shutting down the Murray-Darling Basin. They are quite happy to do that. So they will take the vegetation rights off you, they will take irrigation rights off you, they will absolutely tie you up like Franz Kafka in red tape up and down the Great Barrier Reef with environmental regulations, and then we are supposed to believe them when they come in here to talk about their views on coal seam gas and the property rights of farmers. We know exactly what they are doing: they are creating a wedge. That is their right, but they should be upfront about it. 


There are so many people back where I live who would love the opportunity to speak in this chamber about something that is so pertinent to their lives. Yes, their issues must be addressed, but let us start at the beginning. We have an inquiry that is afoot. The extension of the terms of that inquiry—my name was put to it on the website because you were attacking the National Party—were put up by the National Party. You now sit on that inquiry with the National Party to try to bring about a resolution. That committee will report in mid-November. Senator Heffernan, who is in here; is chairing it. We in the National Party have been driving this agenda. We are happy that we have taken it. But we will want to collect the votes around this chamber to come up with a constructive outcome. There are four issues that need to be dealt with. First and foremost, we must make sure that the aquifers are protected and not destroyed. We acknowledge that there are serious questions as to whether anyone knows what is going on. Prime agricultural land must be protected. Tony Abbott has stated that, and I am happy he has done so. That is movement we have never got from Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard or anybody else, but now we have—from Tony Abbott. We have moved the agenda for the protection of prime agri­cultural land, and it was essential we did so. I would say that the people east of the Condamine are precisely on prime agri­cultural land. Anna Bligh moved for the buffer zone around residential areas, yes, but wasn't it funny that that happened after we got this inquiry afoot? We do not want people's quiet enjoyment being disturbed by the intrusion into their lives of a problem that they did not buy when they bought their house. That issue has to be addressed. If you tick the boxes—not destroying the aquifers, not destroying prime agricultural land, not destroying the quiet enjoyment of a residential estate—then there must be a proper pecuniary return delivered to the farmer. Currently they are getting less then 75c for every $1,000 that is earned by the miner.


It is very important to go through the history here, because some of the things that were said by Senator Bishop, although well meaning, were just not correct. He went right back and talked about what happened in 1200. Magna Carta was actually 1215, without trying to sound too eccentric. If we go right back to that, we find that the Latin maxim at that point in time was cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos: you owned from the heavens above to the infernal regions. In the 16th century, that was changed—the crown took from them gold and silver, fair enough. But there is still the contention that these rights have been displaced for hundreds of years; Bill Shorten, Craig Emerson and other people have said it, but they are just incorrect. Certainly the Crown in Australia had prospecting rights—it still does, and it should—but it did not have extracting rights; those had to be negotiated with the landholder. Over time, by reason of national crises, those rights have been taken from the farmer. A very good dissertation on that was given by Neville Wran in his second reading speech on the New South Wales Coal Acquisition Bill of 1981. Queensland's Petroleum Act  of 1915 says:


… it is hereby declared that petroleum on or below the surface of all land in Queensland, whether alienated in fee simple or not so alienated from the Crown, and if so alienated whensoever alienated, is and always has been the property of the Crown.


This is where in 1915 the Queensland government took those assets, the coal and the oil, from the farmer by reason of the First World War. It could see the calamity unfolding in Europe and wanted to ensure the security of their hydrocarbon material. The war finished, but the asset was never handed back. That legislation is obviously imbalanced, because all the rights—the presumption of ownership rights—that were held by the farmer were taken from the farmer, but there was no legislation to compensate in any way or to give any form of security right to the farmer. In South Australia, similar legislation was introduced in 1971. In the territories it was 1953. There were other, related, acts during the 1930s—I think 1935 or 1938, although 1938 may have been New Zealand. In New South Wales the final removal of this asset that was owned by the farmer happened in 1981. So it is not correct to say that farmers never had this asset; they did. It is an asset which historically they owned and that was extracted from their land. That is why frustration and absolute anger are permeating through farmers. They are finding that someone has a superior right of ownership because of a transaction they have never been a party to, involving people they have never met, in a room they have never been to. In Western Australia—Colin Barnett stated this the other day—people still have the right of veto on freehold land. I note that the majority of Western Australia is leasehold land, but this is where you see the imbalance.


The other problem is that the states are compromised. The states are the second-biggest beneficiary from mining, after the miners. The landholder sits there with no parity in the bargaining process. This is why we are conducting the inquiry. We need to be able to collect the numbers in such a way as to bring some sort of outcome. The Greens jump in with a little wedge bill once other people have done the hard work—they always do it. They put it in the middle of the process and then say, 'We provided a solution but you wouldn't take it.' No, because you have to go through the process. We are taking this extremely seriously. I think Senator Heffernan is taking it very seriously, Senator Shaun Edwards is taking it very seriously and no doubt the Greens are taking it very seriously. But, if you are serious on this, there has to be consistency on other things such as handing back to farmers their vegetation rights, making sure you do not compromise the irrigation rights of farmers, making sure you do not tie up farmers with environmental laws that completely ipso facto remove their sovereign right of ownership. You have to be consistent on this, and we will hold the Greens to it.


This is absolutely a core issue. The core of my involvement in the National Party is property rights—it is one of the key issues. What is the point of going to work and working for something if you find out later on that you do not actually own it? What is the point of going through the privations, of going without, if someone has a superior right of ownership to you? I have to declare my interest. I bought a place when I came into parliament. I sold my accountancy practice, got a little bit of money and jammed it into a property. I grew up on the land and I like the land. I will be going down there next week to do the cattle work. About six months ago my neighbour Bruce McConaghy rang up and said, 'Eastern Star Gas is here, and they're going to do exploratory work on your place.' So there it is: I declare my interest. But it is like saying that someone who is thrown in the sea has an interest in swimming. I have an interest in making sure we get this right, and I think the people who live around me are absolutely focused on making sure there is a bit of mustard on my tail, because it makes me work very hard for a just outcome.


There is this idea that people can go to court over this. That is a load of rubbish. This is how it works: if a person comes on to my place in Queensland, he has to negotiate an access agreement with me. He has 50 days to do that. If, after 50 days, we have not negotiated an access agreement, he might just say, 'I like to go where I want, whenever I want, and I want to put a gravel road in to get there, and I want bore heads here, here and here.' If we cannot come to an agreement within 50 days because I say, 'Mate, I think you're absolutely destroying the whole complexion of my place,' then we go to the land court. However, once we go to the land court he is right; he can start work. And he gives me—the farmer—maybe $400 or $500 to deal with that. That is all I would get to try to deal with a mining company that has multiple billions of dollars worth of backing.


The disparity in the bargaining positions of the landowners and the companies is absurd. This is something that people from the Labor Party, who understand Work Choices, should understand. The disparity in the bargaining positions is outrageous. We have to try to make sure we help those who are weak against those who are strong and get a sense of equivalence. I know you people agree with that. So this is absurd.


The next part, of course, is that he—and I say 'he' because they are generally blokes—can pay what he wants. The companies can pay you what they want. You might say: 'You've completely compromised my asset here. I can't get on to my cultivation. Basically the place I purchased is not my own anymore, and nobody wants to buy it off me.' It is a case of 'Is that a drilling rig on your place, or are you just happy to see me?' Nobody wants your place once they see that you have a coal seam gas factory, basically, situated on the area where years ago you had your barley crop or your wheat crop.


They can pay you anything they want. In some instances we have heard of people getting a slab of beer as payment. Some of these wells are earning $1 million a day. And the company says: 'But we gave you $1,500 a year. You're so much better off now.' Then they put a confidentiality agreement on it so you cannot talk to anybody. You cannot talk to your fellow workers and find out what they are being paid. No, you are not allowed to do that.


I know that in the Labor Party there will be some essence—some little seed down in your soul—that would say: 'I don't think I agree with that sort of concept of how you bargain. I think there should be transparency in collective bargaining against a stronger party.' You have to be philosophically consistent and work out how you are going to deal with this issue. The committee is afoot, and we will want to see exactly how you participate in that process.


And then there is this argument that somehow private ownership is anathema to the progression of commerce. I did not think it was. I thought private ownership was something we actually believed in. I thought we believed in the right of the individual to be commensurate with their capacity not only to improve their own position but to improve the position of the community around them. Not only do I think that, but apparently so does Henry Ergas, who said, in relation to coal seam gas, in his Catallaxy Files:


Shifting the rights to farmers will not affect the extent of development; rather, it will affect who gains the rents from development.


I do not think they have had any problems in Texas, as far as development goes. They might have had problems environmentally; I acknowledge the visual interjections of other senators. But you cannot say Texas has stayed behind as far as mineral development goes. It is privately owned. They are doing all right. I do not want Texas in Baradine.




Senator Heffernan:
  The Wild West!




Senator JOYCE:
  I do not want that. But we have to debunk the argument that we can believe in private ownership and commerce but not believe in the rights of farmers to be greater masters of their destiny. We acknowledge the financial predicament Australia has got itself into with debt—both the debt of the states, who are going to be $250 billion in gross debt by 2014-15, and the position we are in federally, with $205 billion in gross debt. We know that means that if we do not have mining we do not have money, and if we do not have money we have a big, big problem. But this cannot come at the expense of the fundamental injustice we are now seeing in so many areas. If we ignore this issue, it will not go away.


The Armstrongs and the Brimblecombes, the people around Cecil Plains and the multigenerational farmers from down in the Lockyer, up into the Downs and out west are an extremely collegiate group. They are and will continue to be on the phone to one another, surveying the horizon and saying, 'Are we going to get a form of justice, and who is going to give us that justice?' They will be having discussions with people in northern New South Wales—with whom, as I have explained, I have some involvement. These people will then be talking to the people on the coast and to people everywhere else. They are our shareholders. The voters are our shareholders. They are the most important people to us. They are the people we are here to serve. We are their servants first and foremost, before allegiances to any other group, party, body or corporation. So there is that expectation. There is a Senate inquiry on foot. My belief is that that Senate inquiry will report and, from that, we will have the capacity to try and start to move this agenda. We must acknowledge that for the vast majority of this issue you must follow the money: who makes the money out of the royalties? It is the states. So the vast majority of the ownership of this problem rests with the states. That is not saying for one moment that we do not also have a role in this, because as far as the shareholder—the individual, the Australian citizen, the farmer—goes we are the closest thing they are ever going to get to an independent party, because the states are the second-biggest earners after the mining companies. But we cannot just quietly walk away from this. Likewise, we cannot have these sundry pieces of legislation that are slipped in prior to the conclusion of a process that is on foot, which is to bring about some sort of resolution, which has moved the agenda from the middle pages to the front pages and which has been at the forefront of keeping pressure on state Labor governments, such as in Queensland, to now bring about a two-kilometre buffer. These are the issues which have been brought about by the actions thus far, but it has not yet finished.


First of all, this issue has been brought up by Senator Waters. I have to say she is doing most of the work on this, although she is not going to get a chance to speak today. If they are consistent, we will see them working in an effective manner towards resolutions at the end of the inquiry. We will also see, in later times, when we bring up other things that may happen—when we reinstall the vegetation rights and so hand back farmers another asset that was stolen from them in the middle of the night without any compensation—we will get the same sort of emphatic support that they apparently have for the coal seam gas issue. And, when they later on tell us that we are going to lose 7,600 gigs from the Murray-Darling Basin, obviously that will change now—because they are worried about farmers now, so they will obviously change their views on that as well; otherwise, someone might just get a sniff of hypocrisy from a party that believes in stealing your trees, shutting down the Murray-Darling Basin, shutting down the live cattle trade, tying up legislation in caveats and imposts—but apparently does believe in coal-seam gas— (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (11:32):  I am very pleased to rise in support of the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011 today. I support the bill because it is good policy, it is prudent policy and it also happens to be popular with the vast majority of the Australian community. The bill gives farmers the right to refuse a miner permission to extract coal seam gas on their properties. As it stands, farmers who grow the food we eat, and export food, do not have this right. When it comes to facing down the miners who want to move in, dig up their properties and extract what is underneath, farmers hardly have any rights at all. We do think that they should have the right to preserve the lands under their care from a potentially devastating industry. It is true that the minerals under their properties are public property. This bill does not change that fact. It does not seek to create a precedent.


In our mad scramble to exploit the supposed riches of coal seam gas, we are taking some very dangerous risks with one of our country's most precious resources: this nation's farmlands. If things are left to the mining industry, the methane under our farmlands will be extracted and sold as quickly as possible. Preserving our most fertile land for the future will be less than an afterthought. Given what we know about the risks of coal seam gas extraction, this is reckless and premature. This bill does nothing more than add a note of caution to the debate.


In terms of our food production, this bill is aimed at protecting agricultural land and our environment; in particular it is aimed at preserving our best quality farming land. Farming is important in terms of Australia's economy, but it is also important in terms of the Australian tradition. Despite this being a highly urbanised country, our farmers rightly hold a special place in the Australian consciousness. This nation was built on the back of our farmers and our agricultural resources. Agriculture remains an important sector of the economy and an important part of our national identity. We are extremely lucky in this country to have access to such a bounty of high-quality fresh food. Over 90 per cent of what we eat is grown here. We have food security. Food security has had a bit of press recently, and we do take it for granted, but it is becoming an issue of increasing urgency. Only a tiny proportion of this country is made up of high-quality farmland. We do not have any farmland to spare, so no populist campaign of dam-building is going to change that. Therefore, our best land should not be foolishly used for short-term gain.


Unlike what Senator Bishop was suggesting, this bill only applies to land that has been used in the last 10 years for producing food that Australians eat and that we export to the rest of the world. With the UN now projecting that global food production needs to rise by about 70 per cent by the middle of next century, safeguarding food-producing land should be one of our highest priorities. Coal seam gas extraction uses billions of litres of water, it competes with agriculture for this precious resource and we have not had the debate that says that mining should win out in this current argument.


Mining is, of course, very important for our country and for our economic prosperity. We are not an anti-mining party. We understand that the world needs our resources and that Australia can provide them. But the Greens are the party of long-term thinking. You can only dig up minerals or extract gas once. What happens then? What does the future look like?


This is particularly important when it comes to the coal seam gas industry. Once we have extracted and sold the gas, once the miners have left our properties, what does the land look like? Is it still fit for growing food?


We have not done a complete analysis of the risks associated with this industry. Let me name a few here. Of course, there is the significant risk of groundwater contamination. We know that some coal seams connect with the watertable. We know that the associated water that is produced as a by-product is often polluted with some dangerous chemicals, some of which I will refer to shortly. We know that this by-product often lies in evaporation ponds and risks leaking into rivers and becoming part of our potable water supply. We know that there are some real concerns about whether this industry is in fact helping us to make the transition away from high-emissions industries, particularly when one considers the potent nature of methane as a greenhouse gas, and that the footprint of this industry has been largely understated when we take a full life cycle analysis into account. We know that there are problems with leakage with compression for export. We need more independent analysis. We need to see Australian studies on this industry, independent of industry propaganda.


And coal seam gas is unnecessary. We do not need it now, especially from prime agricultural land. We know that there are alternative sources of energy.


As a medical professional, I want to spend a moment or two to focus on the health impacts of this industry. Most people would, of course, be very protective against any industry that might cause the potential health impacts associated with the mining of coal seam gas. We do not know enough about what those impacts are at the moment. We know that only four of the 60 fracking chemicals have been assessed as safe by NICNAS, the national chemicals regulator, but we know that there is very good reason to think that some of those chemicals will have very serious health impacts.


When we look at the hundreds of different chemicals used in the extraction process, in particular there has been some focus on the BTEX group of chemicals: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. These are the same products that are found in cigarette smoke. They are the same products that are found in exhaust pollution from motor vehicles. We know that they cause a range of health impacts. We know that some of them are potent carcinogens. We know that they affect a number of the body's systems, including our nervous system and circulatory system. So there are some real concerns about the impacts of the chemicals used in this process.


We know that these chemicals leave a lasting legacy. They have the potential to contaminate billions of litres of water through the process. I am really concerned that we do not have enough information to be able to say that this industry is safe and that we can safeguard against the potential health impacts on the Australian community. The potential for these chemicals to get into drinking and irrigation water supplies is significant, and we simply do not understand their impact on human health.


We need in this instance to use the precautionary principle. Until the toxicity profiles of all of these chemicals—in particular, the BTEX group of chemicals—are clearly understood, why on earth would we take a chance with one of our most precious resources, our groundwater?


Of course, there is a risk that the chemicals from the coal seams themselves—that is, the chemicals that lie dormant within these seams—will in fact be brought to the surface and into the water supply and our food chain. We know that there are a number of volatile organic compounds that exist within these coal seams and that they have the potential to cause cancer and other teratogenic effects. We also know that the underground channels by which a coal seam might link to an aquifer are complex. We need to make sure that we get more evidence and that we have a greater understanding of the impacts of these chemicals and their use before we jump headlong into the coal seam gas gold rush.


Given the potential for damage to human health, we think that one of the things that has been lacking in this debate has been the involvement of the public health community and public health experts as part of this process. I refer to publications in the Medical Journal of Australia which indicate some of the concerns expressed by the medical community when it comes to coal seam gas. It is important that, when we plan for proposals such as this, no proposal should go ahead without a complete consideration of the public health ramifications of this industry, and none should operate without strict and rigorous monitoring of the full impacts of the industry. Prevention is much, much more sensible than cure. Let us apply that principle not just to our health system but to this debate around coal seam gas mining.


I would like to say a few things about my home state of Victoria. While this debate has largely focused on the states of Queensland and New South Wales, Victoria is now the next target in the coal seam gas battle. In Victoria over 30 applications have been received for exploration for coal seam gas mining, and a number of these are exclusively for coal seam gas. It is of great concern to me and to many Victorians.


We in Victoria have some of the nation's most productive farmland. For example, Victoria produces two-thirds of this country's milk. We have a dairy industry that is worth approximately $2 billion in exports. The Victorian public is now very, very alarmed by the coal seam gas gold rush.


It is clear that in my own local community in the region of Colac and south of Colac there is growing anxiety about an exploration permit that has been granted now to ECI International. At a community meeting that was held in the town of Forrest last Friday, in the wonderful Otway Ranges, my own place of residence, we saw almost 100 residents attend a community meeting who were particularly concerned about the impact of coal seam gas mining on groundwater.


We have seen issues in other areas such as the Ovens and King valleys, which were very strongly opposed to the possibility of coal seam gas exploration licences. In fact, the city of Wangaratta also expressed that view. An exploration licence for an area near the town of Warrnambool was withdrawn after significant community opposition.


We know that that story is consistent with what is happening right across the country. A Galaxy poll indicated that 68 per cent of Australians do support a moratorium on coal seam gas until the full health and environ­mental impacts are understood. We know that is how the Australian community feels. In fact this bill does not even go that far. All it says is that farmers should have a say. Disappointingly, this was not reflected by the other parties, who voted down the Greens motion for a moratorium on coal seam gas just last week. Their position is out of step with that of the majority of the Australian community.


The passage of Senator Waters' bill is nothing more than a nod to caution and good sense. It does not ban coal seam gas mining. It simply taps on the brakes and says: 'Look, we don't know enough about this industry, its impact on agriculture and its impact on human health. Let's make sure we get a much fuller picture around what those impacts are before we rush headlong into this industry.' I proudly stand here in support of the bill. I think that, if we do not support it, we do risk damaging human health and we do risk long-term damage to our groundwater and to our farmland. For those reasons I very proudly stand here in support of this bill.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (11:46):  The coalition supports the expansion of the coal seam gas industry, in harmony with the rights of landholders and the protection of prime agricultural land for food production. Issues related to land use are, of course, primarily a matter for the states. It is important that we take a balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of the mining industry to Australia's economic future while protecting prime agricultural land and respecting the rights of farmers.


The coalition supports the work done by our state colleagues in delivering a more balanced approach than that currently being offered by state Labor governments. The mining industry and the farming community have a long history of working together in Australia, which has allowed both sectors to prosper. There are long-established systems in place that allow miners and farmers to negotiate land access and very few cases end up in court. There are numerous examples of farmers and mining companies who have been working cooperatively and who have negotiated mutually beneficial outcomes.


It is also important to note that the development of the coal seam gas industry in Queensland is subject to more than 1,500 state and federal conditions, making it more regulated than the uranium industry. The coal seam gas companies operating in Queensland, such as the Queensland Gas Co. and Santos, have shown they are willing to carry out the process in good faith. By way of example, all the Queensland Gas Co. work on private properties has been done with the express permission of landholders. The Queensland Gas Co. prefers voluntary agreements and now has more than 800 agreements, following negotiations on land access with about 1,000 landholders.


The coalition believes there are some sections of productive land that are of such significance that they should be given additional safeguards. Under the Constit­ution, it is state governments that are responsible for land use and mining. Therefore, in our view, it is a matter for each state government to determine which areas are considered prime agricultural land and for each state to put in place protective measures where appropriate in consultation with farmers, rural communities and resources companies. We urge those resources companies to deal effectively with the issue of protection of prime agricultural land. That is of course a matter that state governments need to continue to pursue as a matter of priority.


Positive steps have been taken, for example, by the O'Farrell government in New South Wales to balance the needs of mining and agriculture. The O'Farrell government has put in place a moratorium and strategic land use plans which will identify and protect productive farmland, involve communities in local decision making, ensure a sustainable and healthy mining industry and encourage industry best practice. The O'Farrell government is also developing a stringent groundwater regula­tion, reviewing fracking standards and reviewing access arrangements. The Liberal-National Party in Queensland has shown how seriously it takes the issue of safeguarding prime agricultural land with the publication of a discussion paper noting the importance of gas to the Queensland economy and raising a number of issues that have not been addressed by the Bligh Labor government. These include the depletion of underground water, land access, the location of coal seam gas infrastructure close to dwellings and the increased pressure on inadequate existing regional infrastructure.


The Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee, chaired by my colleague Senator Heffernan, is currently inquiring into the management of the Murray-Darling Basin, including the impact of mining coal seam gas, and will report on 30 November 2011. That committee is examining the economic, social and environ­mental impacts of mining coal seam gas on the sustainability of water aquifers and future water licensing arrangements; the property rights and values of landholders; the sustainability of prime agricultural land and Australia's food task; the social and economic benefits or otherwise for regional towns; the effective management of relationships between mining and other interests; and various other matters.


The federal coalition will continue to work with the coalition in New South Wales, with the LNP in Queensland and with other state parties to ensure the rights of farmers are always respected in this context. Mr President, I seek your guidance as to whether I can continue my remarks now or whether I need to seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:52):  by leave—We have a general agreement in the Senate that private members' time, because it is short, will be organised so that the primary piece of legislation being brought on each week for discussion will be brought to a vote. What we have just seen is that fail to happen.




Senator Cormann:
  Are you saying that I am not allowed to speak?




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, I am. Senator Cormann, you are interjecting against the standing orders. I am saying you should organise, within the ambit of a commitment from your side as well as everybody else's, to have an orderly arrangement whereby a vote is taken in private members' time. What you are otherwise saying, Senator Cormann, is that you do not want opposition bills coming to a vote in the chamber. If that is your position, that is new. Let us know about it. The same goes for the government.

  My position is that, if want to speak, I should be allowed to speak.

  Your position is that you do not want any action, Senator Cormann. It is obvious from the contribution you were giving why that is the case. I am just saying to the government and the opposition that this is a breach of spirit by both sides and it ought to be brought back into order. Otherwise private members' time goes back to being of no significance—government bills get through; private members' bills do not get through. That is not proper in this place.

The PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator FIFIELD:
  There was no agreement that this particular piece of legislation would come to a vote today. There are on occasion informal arrangements reached between the parties, but there was not one with this particular piece of legislation. Senator Cormann is only part-way through his contribution. On the circulated speakers list there is still Senator Xenophon and Senator Williams to speak. So I do not see what has happened today as being in any way controversial or out of the ordinary. It is a piece of legislation that is being appropriately debated.

  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator McEWEN:
  I would have to concur on this occasion with the comments made by Senator Fifield. There has been no agreement by the parties to take this particular piece of legislation to a vote. As we know, on past occasions in private senators' time, some bills have been taken to a vote. But there was no agreement. It has been discussed numerous times at whips meetings. It has also been discussed on occasion by the Procedure Committee, where there was also no agreement reached. The government's view is that each piece of legislation that comes to this chamber should be treated with respect and, as Senator Fifield noted, there are other speakers on the list. So we believe the process this morning has been in accordance with generally agreed principles in the Senate.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:31):  I rise to support the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011. This is a bill which has been brought forward by  Senator Larissa Waters on behalf of the Greens and I am delighted to stand here today supporting it. It is a bill which requires coal seam gas corporations to gain the written authorisation of farmers to enter their land to conduct coal seam gas activities. It provides that authorisation must contain independent advice about all the risks to food security and groundwater and also makes it clear that the farmer can refuse to sign. It provides that any corporation entering land without the permission of the farmer would incur a daily $55,000 fine, risk prosecution and be subject to the farmer's right to seek an injunction from the Federal Court which the corporation must pay for. 


The bill applies to all land that has produced food at any time in the 10 years prior to the first proposed coal seam gas activity on the land, from commercial primary production through to urban vegetable gardens. The bill does not alter the ownership of the minerals and gas which remain vested in the states. The bill does not affect the ability of the federal and state governments to compulsorily acquire the land in order to access the resources, with appropriate compensation.


This goes absolutely to the heart of one of the most significant debates of this century: the issue of food security. The Greens have been very clear about this for some time. We are facing a global food insecurity crisis. With climate change accelerating, we are seeing extreme weather events around the world occurring with such frequency that the loss of agricultural production is impacting on the ability of countries to feed their own populations and to engage in trade. For example, we have had extreme weather events in Australia, Russia and the United States at similar times affecting the global grain harvest. Mr Putin banned the export of grain from Russia. That led to massive increases in the price of bread in the Middle East, and that was one of the main triggers of the riots in Tunisia that sparked the Arab Spring.


We are going to be facing this issue throughout this century and one of the critical things we as a parliament must do is protect agricultural land for agriculture. It is essential that we do that because Australia needs to maximise the amount of food it grows not only for itself but also for global circulation because that is going to be a major contribution not only to keeping people alive but also to global security. Where you have food scarcity leading to famine, it leads to displacement of people and riots like we had through the Middle East and as we currently have in Africa. It is essential that we move in now and say that Australia must protect its food-producing land for food production.


The Greens have a very long history on this. In particular, this is how I began my political career, because I worked on behalf of the farmers in the Wesley Vale district, where my parents had a dairy farm, to oppose the North Broken Hill pulp mill proposal for a massive industrial develop­ment in the heart of first-class agricultural land in north-west Tasmania. It would have polluted Bass Strait to the detriment of the fisheries and it would have spread a toxic cloud around the farmlands which form best front country on the north-west coast with early seasonal crops. The farmers stood very strongly. The first sticker I ever produced said 'Save our soil, sea and sand, protect the land'. That is still a heartfelt responsibility I and the Greens have for the production of food. If you are going to maintain food security, both maximising food production in Australia and for export, you have to enable farmers to stay on the land. There are two sets of issues. One is the sustainability of food production and maintaining sustainable systems for food production and the other is a set of policies that will enable farmers to stay on the land. What we have here is absolutely at the heart of this: the conflict between what the mining and the gas companies want. They do not care about whether farmers stay on the land. All they care about is maximising their profits from the extraction of coal seam gas. That is all they care about. We now have the most appalling situation where 40,000 coal seam gas wells are expected to be rolled out across Queensland in the next few years and there is rapid expansion planned for New South Wales and Victoria as well. So now is the time for robust protection for our landholders and of course for the environment. 


One of the very big unknowns with coal seam gas is the long-term consequences for our aquifers and our river systems. Already, a very substantial petition from the Myall Lakes has been submitted to the hearings and in that submission they say: 'It is a Ramsar ecosystem. It is protected for its signifi­cance.' Yet there is no protection if coal seam gas gets its way. There will be contamination of the river system that flows into those lakes and that will undermine the capacity for long-term sustainability. And we know full well that there has been no assessment of the impact of this kind of activity on the Great Artesian Basin. Nobody knows, not even the Coordinator-General in Queensland, who is the person in that state with the authority to approve and condition these particular licences for coal seam gas. So if the Queens­land government and Queensland's own Coordinator-General cannot tell people what the long-term impacts are, how can a farmer have any confidence that at the end of the day they are not going to have their groundwater contaminated and the groundwater lowered because of the huge volumes of water required for this activity, or about the long-term impact on the Great Artesian Basin?


This is a reckless experiment by coal and gas companies to maximise their profits at the expense of farmers. Can the Wentworth Group answer the question: what will the impact be on the Great Artesian Basin? No, they cannot. Can the CSIRO? In their most recent report, they said they had serious concerns about long-term impacts. The National Water Commission have said that they are very concerned about long-term impacts. So that is what has been said by those bodies who look after water and the serious environmental issues in our desert continent.


If you are going to have food security and food production, if you are going to maintain ecosystems into the future, you have to protect your river systems. You have to protect your groundwater. You have to protect the Great Artesian Basin. None of those things are protected. There is no precautionary principle being engaged here. Governments are simply turning a blind eye. What is this parliament going to do? When it was put to the Leader of the Opposition on radio that landholders must have the last word surely on when anyone can enter their property, Mr Abbott, said:


... there is an old saying—an Englishman's home is his castle.


He went on to say:


... the thing is if, if you don't want something to happen on your land, you ought to have a right to say no.


I agree with Mr Abbott: you ought to have the right to say no. He went on:


... okay, under certain circumstances the Government ought to be able to resume your land but it has to be done at a fair price.


Yes, and that is about compulsory acquisition and this bill has nothing to do with compulsorily acquiring land. This bill says that a farmer has the right to say no, that they do not want coal seam gas activities on their property.


I have heard the government say, 'We've always had the situation where the minerals underneath the ground are collectively owned by the people and therefore not the preserve of the farmer at the surface.' This is an entirely different industry to all the things that have gone before in terms of extraction. This is a situation where not only are they coming on the land and disrupting the activities on the land, and adversely impacting the person carrying on agricultural activities but they are jeopardising the long-term capacity of the land to produce food because of the contamination of ground­water, the lowering of the groundwater, and the potential long-term impacts on the Great Artesian Basin. So if ever there was an argument for a farmer to say no, it is now.


I agree with the Leader of the Opposition. So what happened? I think he must not have remembered to write it down, because within days the opposition spokesperson was manoeuvring to clarify what his leader said. Mr Macfarlane had to clarify this issue and back off absolutely. Where are the Nationals on this? The National Party tell farmers they are out there protecting their interests. But all they are doing is talking to farmers about getting fair compensation. Compensation is fair if a farmer says, 'Okay, I am prepared to have coal seam gas.' It is appropriate then that there are appropriate levels of compensation. But that is a cop-out from the fundamental point: should a landholder have a right to say, 'No, you cannot come onto my property and you may not drill wells on my property for coal seam gas'? That is the point of this legislation and that is the challenge for the parliament here. It is very straightforward. Anyone who goes out to rural Queensland will be able to see the adverse impacts. Talk to the community groups—and I have cited the one from the Myall Lakes in New South Wales—and you will find people are putting in submissions all over the place. There is ample evidence of the adverse impacts. 


It is now time to make decisions. It is no longer appropriate for people to say: 'It is not obvious yet. We are not sure about the long-term impacts. We'll just proceed regardless.' We should not be proceeding regardless because the question is: are you putting the profits of mining and gas companies ahead of the capacity of farmers to stay on the land and produce food, and to stay on the land and produce food sustainably by maintaining access to uncontaminated water?


We all know that water becomes contaminated where there is fracking involved. Of the chemicals used in fracking, only six of around 60 chemicals that are used have even been assessed, so nobody actually knows what the long-term impact of these activities is going to be.


Yes, the New South Wales government panicked in the face of community uproar, especially as this has reached the suburbs of Sydney. I understand St Peters has become an area of exploration and people in the suburbs are now saying: 'For goodness sake! What is going on here? You are giving these companies the right to dig up suburbia as well as to dig all over the rural and regional areas.' But in New South Wales the moratorium is only against fracking; it is not against the ongoing rolling out of coal seam gas across New South Wales.


If the coalition and the government have a vision for Australia as being a quarry for miners—dig it up, cut it down, ship it away; dig it up, cut it down, pump out the gas as well—then let me put on the record that that means we will seriously reduce the capacity of this country to produce food and, furthermore, we will see more farmers driven off their land.


I note the submission from Doctors for the Environment Australia to the inquiry of the Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee into the management of the Murray-Darling Basin. They made a strong case that we are already seeing high rates of mental illness in rural and regional Australia because of the stresses associated with trying to stay on the land, with collapsing commodity prices and with the high dollar acting against them. Farmers are already under pressure as a result of extreme weather events like the drought we suffered through the Murray-Darling Basin and of course the floods that occurred more recently.


People in rural and regional Australia want to get on with the job of producing food and do not want to be harassed by companies they do not want on their land. That is the question here: when are we going to stand up and say, 'We are going to support farmers because we prioritise food security, ecologically sustainable agriculture and the right of farmers and farming communities to influence their own destiny'? Or are we going to say that the destiny of rural and regional Australia is in the hands of mining and gas companies—many of which are owned outside Australia and many of whose profits leave Australia—and leave rural communities absolutely devastated and destroyed by this industry. That is what we are actually seeing right now.


I am very interested in what the coalition is going to say, because in spite of Mr Macfarlane trying to reposition the coalition there is nothing clearer than what the Leader of the Opposition had to say originally—before he wrote it down. I do not know whether he has written down his backdown on this particular issue, but it is clear that the opposition no longer supports the right of a farmer in Australia to say no to coal seam gas exploration and drilling wells on their land. Well, the Greens do say no and the Greens are putting it to this parliament and inviting everyone in the parliament to either join us and say no or go out and tell people in rural and regional Australia why they should not have the right to say no.


I will conclude my remarks with a discussion of climate change. People are arguing you need coal seam gas in order to attack the accelerating impact of climate change. Let me get this straight: there is a lot of emerging evidence to say that coal seam gas, because it is methane, has a much, much greater impact on global warming in the short term than carbon dioxide has. What you are going to do if you accelerate the mining of coal seam gas is put a blast of methane to the atmosphere in the short term and actually make the situation worse in the short term than it otherwise would have been. The short term matters, because global emissions have to peak and come down. The scientists agree that the date for that should have been 2015 but, because we are not going to meet 2015, they have now said it should be at least by 2020. We are not going to get global emissions to peak and come down by 2020 if we engage in this massive expansion of coal seam gas across the planet. We are seeing an acceleration of climate change, as I pointed out in here only a week ago, with record loss of Arctic ice. Once you lose that, of course, you get massive emissions to the atmosphere after the ice has melted, with impacts on the tundra et cetera.


This is something Australia needs to take seriously. We need to have a strategic plan for food production in Australia in light of these issues, and that is why I am co-hosting a bill this afternoon, with Senator Xenophon, about protecting agricultural land in relation to foreign ownership. Not only are we seeing the loss of food production through extreme weather events; we are now seeing other countries moving in and buying up large tracts of agricultural land around the world to feed their own people—not to put into the trade but to feed their own people when other countries opt not to export. There has been a massive land grab around the world and it is happening with agricultural land in this country as well. Already 30 per cent of water licences in Western Australia are foreign owned or partially foreign owned, and 40 per cent of the Northern Territory's land area is already partially or fully foreign owned. Those things should be a matter of concern to this parliament.


If you are serious about sustainability, if you are serious about food security, if you are serious about keeping farmers on the land and taking the pressure and stress away from them then you will support this bill giving them the right to say no, they do not want coal seam gas explorers and their wells on their properties. There should be a very firm commitment from this parliament on push-back, or else this parliament will be giving a wink and a nod to this generation of profiteers to jeopardise the Great Artesian Basin.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (09:51):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate, which I have a strong interest in. The Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011 seeks to provide farmers with the opportunity to say no to coal seam gas mining on their properties without written consent. It would exercise powers to apply penalties on any constitutional corporation if it undertook any activity to explore or produce coal seam gas on food-producing land without the prior written authorisation of everyone who has an ownership interest in that land.


To date, mining and urban expansion has not threatened Australia's food security. Australia is food secure. We are sheltered from direct concerns about food shortages because we have a world-class agricultural sector and our farmers produce far more food than we consume. On 15 August 2011, the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism, Martin Ferguson, told ABC NewsRadio that 'it is constitutionally the states' responsibility, in association with the territories, to manage the development of our resources'. He also said that 'it would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth to start undermining the constitutional capacity of the states for short-term political gain'. Therefore we will not be supporting this bill.


Mineral resources belong to the Australian people. This bill would give veto rights to landholders and preventing access would mean that those assets belonged to the landowner—in other words, privatisation. This undermines the ownership of resources by the state government on behalf of the people. The Australian government believes that landholders and mining companies are able to work together and this position is shared by the National Farmers Federation. Vice-President and Chair of the NFF Mining and Coal Seam Gas Taskforce, Duncan Fraser, said:


Our position, and that of our members, is not about preventing mining and CSG exploration or extraction–but rather ensuring that agriculture, CSG and mining can coexist, so as to guarantee the long-term sustainability of our food and fibre production.


According to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, APPEA, agriculture and gas industries have already coexisted for many years—we have seen gas extracted in Roma for half a century.


In my state of Queensland coal seam gas is prominent, with more than 90 per cent of the state's gas supply being CSG. CSG also constitutes one-third of eastern Australia's gas supplies. It powers a number of domestic electricity generation projects throughout Queensland, including the Origin Energy operated Darling Downs power station and the Braemar 2 power station. APPEA says that the CSG industry supports more than 5,000 jobs and expects this to boom to 18,000 jobs. They say the Queensland industry injects $850 million into the Queensland government through taxes, which means more funding for vital infrastructure. 


CSG's continuous growth outran the global financial crisis, kept Australians in jobs and supplemented the fiscal and economic position of Australia. In 1997, the total output of the coal seam gas industry in Queensland was 3,652 petajoules. By the end of the 2009-2010 financial year, this figure had climbed to 27,992 petajoules, representing growth of more than 750 per cent over the past 13 years.


The international market, particularly the Asia-Pacific region, has experienced increased demand for liquefied natural gas. Coal seam gas will be fed through over 4,000 kilometres of already constructed pipeline and liquefied to produce LNG. The expected explosive demand for LNG will continue to encourage production of coal seam gas. In October last year, Treasurer Wayne Swan and resources minister Martin Ferguson welcomed an announcement by BG Group that it would invest US $15 billion to develop its coal seam gas and LNG operations to export gas from Gladstone. This funding will go towards construction and expansion of a 540-kilometre gas pipeline. It is estimated that the project will increase gross state product by up to $32 billion between 2010 and 2021 and add about $4 billion in value to our exports each year. The project also means 5,000 jobs and 1,000 prominent positions.


CSG is significant in both Queensland and New South Wales, with APPEA suggesting that these two states can produce and power a city of five million—just over what the population of Queensland is—for 1,000 years. APPEA also says that more than 1,400 land access agreements between landholders and the industry had been signed and that 'every single aspect of taking CSG to LNG for export has been examined through the public environmental impact assessment process. Both state and federal government environmental approvals have been granted, with conditions to further safeguard aquifers, landholders and the environment'.


Lock the Gate Alliance Inc, in which former Greens candidate Drew Hutton is involved, state on their website:


Coal seam gas (CSG) is a fossil fuel—a dirty energy source that adds to greenhouse pollution. 


According to APPEA, electricity generated using gas produces up to 70 per cent less in greenhouse gas emissions than some existing coal generation technology, meaning coal seam gas has a significant role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Gas is an important fuel for the transition to a low-carbon economy. LNG can produce the same amount of energy as coal with significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions. According to a study conducted by WorleyParsons, the greenhouse gas intensity of LNG over its life cycle is approximately 50 per cent lower than that of coal. The development of the CSG to LNG industry is providing the opportunity to develop the massive CSG resources of Queensland economically and to bring forward the development of CSG reserves in other states.


Lock the Gate put forward a submission to the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural Affairs and Transport into the management of the Murray-Darling Basin. In a statement dated 21 September 2011, APPEA Chief Executive Belinda Robinson said that Lock the Gate's submission included content which was copied and pasted from a United States study, with the words 'coal seam gas' substituted for the words 'shale gas'. Ms Robinson said:


The study that this group has drawn its material from actually makes no mention of coal seam gas or the Australian industry.


APPEA stated in a media release on 18 August 2011 that some people have insinuated that greenhouse gas emissions of CSG are worse than those of natural gas. APPEA refutes this. It said that any leakage from CSG is monitored and the emissions are lower by up to 70 per cent from gas-fired electricity. It said:


Since the passage of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 every major gas company in Australia—CSG or otherwise—has been legally required to monitor, measure or estimate, and report all emissions associated with its operations to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency; including fugitive emissions and emissions associated with venting, combustion, and flaring. No emissions are undisclosed.


In July, I launched the Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance, GISERA, in Brisbane on behalf of Minister Kim Carr. The launch was at a marvellous new structure where the old Boggo Road jail used to be. To see the construction alone you would more or less comply with the belief that this is an environmentally friendly building so no doubt the release was prominent and it was appropriate to do so in a building that houses CSIRO and groups of other scientists that are paving the way and certainly making steps as to the way that we look at our environment and move to a sustainable greenhouse and protected environment for our future. The Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance is a partnership that was founded by the CSIRO and Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd, who have invested $4 million and $10 million respectively to investigate the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the natural gas industry over the next five years.


I had the opportunity to question some of the people involved in this launch and get some reasonable feedback about the appropriateness of this sort of injection into this particular area. As I indicated earlier, it is not a new area and it has been happening in my home state of Queensland for many decades. The alliance is to establish research, to establish fair consultation with and feedback from people in particular areas where this mining is happening to make sure concerns are allayed. The alliance will help fill the knowledge gaps of this vast energy resource and it is a chance to increase the evidence based understanding of what we are dealing with. Regulators, developers, land owners and the broader community will have a common basis to negotiate approaches which balance both the challenges and the opportunities.


I can really appreciate there being some confusion out there from the public and also some members of parliament about the effects of coal seam gas. It was not that long ago, while on a plane trip down from Brisbane, that the member for Wright and I were discussing this particular area. I think at that particular stage that member, being a member of the National Party, had some views and some concerns about the effect on farmers and about compensation and I think we were having a reasonable discussion. I think most of those issues have now been dismissed and I am sure that those people on the opposition side from the Nationals understand the value of this particular area for the industry and also for farmers in general.


Issues which will be explored by GISERA include groundwater and surface water, biodiversity, land management, the marine environment and also the socioeconomic impacts. The research will enable us to predict the consequences of decisions. It means we can assess how certain courses of action will affect the economy, the environment and the community. The results of these findings will be made available for the public. I think that is appropriate to make sure that the public is fully aware of any likely concern that is raised as a result of the research that the CSIRO and the partnership with GISERA will certainly establish and which will be available to the public.


In October last year the Queensland government's new laws in relation to land access came into effect. A document released by the Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation states:


The new land access laws are vital to achieving a balanced approach to private land access and compensation. They recognise and clarify the Government's expectations and rights of tenement ... authority holders and land holders relating to how resource activities must be undertaken on private land.


DEEDI states the key features of this legislation as:


... a requirement that all resource authority holders must comply with a single Land Access Code; an entry notice requirement for 'prelim­inary activities', for example, those that will have no or only a minor impact on landholders; a requirement that a conduct and compensation agreement be negotiated before a resource authority holder comes onto a landholder's property to undertake 'advanced activities', for example, those likely to have a significant impact on a landholder's business or land use; a graduated process for negotiation and resolving disputes about agreements which ensures matters are only referred to the Land Court as a last resort; stronger compliance and enforcement powers for government agencies where breaches of the Land Access Code occur.


As you can see, Mr Acting Deputy President, there is a series of steps already to work through a process to identify any concern landholders might have as a result of coal seam gas exploration on their particular land, a process that has been implemented by the Queensland Labor government to assure people that they have no concerns over risk as to what might be occurring on their particular space on the land.


In April this year the state government announced that gas and  petroleum companies must provide 10 business days notice to landholders of any drilling, fracking or certain exploration taking place as well as 10 business days notice of work completion. The Queensland Minister for Employment, Skills and Mining, Stirling Hinchliffe, said:


These new laws are designed to make sure landholders know exactly what is happening on their land and when it is happening. They apply to all activities including hydraulic fracturing used in producing Coal Seam Gas, drilling, completing or abandoning a well or bore as well as seismic and other surveys associated with exploration or production. This will also help the government monitor the use of chemicals in the extraction of Coal Seam Gas in Queensland.


Just last week the Bligh government announced that it would expand its AgForward Coal Seam Gas Landholder Support Initiative into the Galilee and Bowen basins, which is an area I know quite well through my travels in the state of Queensland. It is a beautiful part of Far North Queensland. The $1.4 million injection is to assist landholders by providing them with the education and tools to properly negotiate with mining companies. The state Minister for Agriculture, Food and Regional Economies Tim Mulherin said:


We want landholders to have the knowledge and the information they need to negotiate the best agreement possible with CSG companies. Landholders and CSG companies will be working together for years to come, so it is important that the relationship is based on a firm foundation.


The minister said that this program had already been rolled out in the Surat region with four pilot sessions and 32 FarmShed workshops where the training is delivered to the 875 people taking part. The funding injection means another 20 workshops in the Galilee and Bowen basins can take place. These training sessions will assist land­holders in being able to successfully negotiate with a coal seam gas company before exploration or production takes place. Minister Mulherin said:


The aim of delivering mutually acceptable agreements is to minimise disruption to the landholder's enterprise, wherever possible, and to set out appropriate arrangements for land access and financial compensation. This is a key step in establishing a successful coexistence of the coal seam gas industry and the agriculture sector.


The state government has also introduced a strategic cropping land policy framework. This aims to produce a balance between protecting prime agricultural land while allowing for the development of the CSG industry. The Queensland Premier has also announced that CSG and mining activities will not be permitted within two kilometres of population centres over 1,000 people. These announcements from the state government prove that it is committed to ensuring that Queensland landholders are protected as well as enabling our mining industry to survive.


Investment decisions in Queensland's CSG to LNG industry taken since October 2010 total more than $45 billion. This industry will create jobs, particularly in regional communities, boost the economy at both a state and federal level and deliver billions in government revenue. It will lift Australia's export income and provide states and the Commonwealth government with a significant source of royalty and PRRT revenue. As a cleaner alternative to coal-fired power LNG is an essential part of the global solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provides many jobs and opportunities in regional Australia. APPEA states that the CSG land-use footprint is much smaller than other energy sources and the land can be returned to its original use.


I took the opportunity some weeks ago, when APPEA was in the building, to have a presentation done by them and saw the before-and-after slides of what the effects of land management are as a result of them using this particular mining on properties. Virtually the end result is negligible. There is little or no impact on the particular land, certainly as seen from the photographs that were supplied. I made the point earlier that, in my travels to Roma on numerous occasions over the years, I have seen that firsthand.


The state government already has effective legislation in place ensuring protection for our landholders. They have introduced training programs so that landholders can effectively negotiate with coal seam gas companies before entering into agreements. They have introduced legislation to protect prime agricultural land under a strategic cropping land framework while allowing the gas industry to continue. We believe the right way forward is for the gas industry and landholders to effectively work together for the benefit of everyone. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (10:11):  It is not a great surprise that, when we look at an area where there has been some concern expressed, particularly in rural and regional areas of Australia, about an area of public policy such as the use of prime agricultural land with people expressing concerns about what is unfolding in some parts of our country, the Australian Greens are there to rush forward with a solution. The solutions are quick and easy in areas which have defied wiser, more sober heads. In those areas the Greens seem to be able to come up with solutions relatively quickly. The question of being able to address an issue as complex as this with a simple solution, I might say a simplistic solution, is one that the Senate deserves to give closer attention to than is presented by the opportunity of this bill.


This bill represents far too ready a solution to a problem which is, in fact, a complex one, which deserves case-by-case consideration in many instances and is one which state governments are generally grappling with with varying degrees of success. We need to remind ourselves that this is, indeed, a state responsibility. The use of land is a primary responsibility of our states and territories, and for the Greens to enter into this space in this way with a simplistic solution again calls into question their commitment, a commitment that has been restated many times in this place, that they have a strong regard for the rights of states and territories to legislate within their own areas of responsibility. This was exhibited only a few weeks ago in this very place, but I will come back to that issue in a moment.


The coalition does not see any merit in this bill. As I said, this is an issue for state governments, who have accountability to their electors to issue licences for exploration and the subsequent exploitation of resources. The fact is that resource companies cannot enter a landowner's property to exploit the minerals and resources on that property without a negotiated or, in the worst case, a Land Court arbitrated agreement with that landowner. 


The coalition, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, has made it perfectly clear that within that framework the federal opposition's view is that prime agricultural land must be protected. We will work with state governments to ensure that that objective is reached. There is clear evidence in Queensland that many landholders are able to come together sensibly to reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for the future use of their land and that the coexistence of agricultural and resource industry activities is not only possible but is also, in fact, the norm. Both the Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, and the man who I think is widely expected to be the next Premier of Queens­land, Campbell Newman, have addressed this issue very directly. They are both fully seized of the importance of protecting prime agricultural land and have committed to the objective of ensuring that there is a strong and direct response to the concerns raised by landholders about their land being properly used and its present owners being properly consulted about the way in which that occurs.


I had the opportunity a few months ago to visit the electorate of Flynn in Central Queensland—the electorate of Mr Ken O'Dowd, the LNP member, who is fully apprised of the concerns of local landowners about how their land is used and how prime agricultural land may be at risk. It is through representations such as his that the LNP in Queensland has come to address this issue directly. I will speak about that in a moment. At the federal level the coalition supports the expansion of the coal seam gas industry where that is in harmony with the rights of landholders and the protection of prime agricultural land for food production. 


I emphasise again that we are not talking about a one or the other response—we are not saying we either exploit the resources or we exploit the land for its food production capability. It is possible to deliver a balanced approach, acknowledging the importance of the mining industry to Australia's future economic sustainability while also acknowledging that Australia has a tremendous asset in its agricultural land. The quality of farm products in Australia is enormously important to Australia's reputation as an exporter, and it is critical that we acknowledge and respect the rights of farmers. 


The federal opposition supports the work of its state colleagues in delivering a more balanced approach than the approach offered by state Labor governments in recent years. In fact, it needs to be acknowledged very directly that the characterisation of this debate as an all-out war between farmers and miners grossly understates the extent of cooperation which has been occurring for a long time in regional and rural Australia. Mining companies by and large are well apprised of the values of the communities in which they work. They seek to add value as much as possible to those communities—there are exceptions, of course—and it is important that the potential for agreement making in these areas be enhanced by creating opportunities for those agreements without blanket decisions being imposed on parties by legislation introduced in the federal parliament. 


The mining industry and the farming community have worked together in Australia in many areas and both sectors are prospering as a result. There are long-established systems in place which allow miners and farmers to negotiate land access, and there are very few cases where disagreements end up in court.




Senator Waters:
  Not anymore.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  You will have your opportunity, Senator, to put an alternative point of view. We know how well embedded the Greens are in rural Australia, how popular they are there and how many people vote for them in those parts of Australia. I am sure you have very good connections that tell you what is going on there—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Humphries, please address your remarks through the chair.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Liberal Party and the National Party have a much better understanding of what goes on in rural and regional Australia. We have worked in those communities, we have represented those communities, for decades. We understand the pressures they are under and we are working at both the federal level and the state and territory level to solve these problems in a realistic fashion. I suspect there are many communities around Australia that will not thank the Greens for rushing forward to advise them on how they can solve their problems when the Greens have, as a party, very little connection with those parts of Australia—except when it comes to marching into the local forest to chain themselves to trees to prevent logging or to protest in some other way about activities going on in a rural industry of some sort or another.


As I said, there are numerous examples of farmers and mining companies working cooperatively and negotiating mutually beneficial outcomes. The development of the coal seam gas industry in Queensland is not some kind of rampant uncontrolled exercise which is resulting in the destruction of rural communities; it is a process which is highly regulated. In Queensland the industry is subject to more than 1,500 state and territory conditions. In fact, the coal seam gas industry is more regulated than the uranium mining industry. Coal seam gas companies operating in Queensland, and I include among those Queensland Gas Co. and Santos, have in fact shown that they are willing to work with local communities and to carry out the process of exploring and exploiting mineral and gas deposits in good faith. By way of an example, all of the Queensland Gas Co.'s work on private properties in Queensland has been done with the express permission of landholders. That might not be a fact that suits the case put forward by the Greens, but it is true. In fact, Queensland Gas Co. prefers voluntary agreements and now has more than 800 agreements following negotiations on land access with about 1,000 landholders across the state.


The coalition believe that there are some sections of productive land that are of such significance that they should be given additional safeguards. We acknowledge that is sometimes a necessary step to take, but we also acknowledge that, under our federal arrangements, state governments are responsible for both land use and mining. Therefore, we believe it is a matter for each state government to determine which areas are considered prime agricultural land and for each state to put in place protective measures where appropriate in consultation with farmers, rural communities and resource companies. We urge those parties to deal effectively with the issue of the protection of prime agricultural land and to do so as a matter of urgency.


I think it is fair to say that this is an area in which activity is happening in the right direction. We can see, not just in Queensland but also in New South Wales, that state governments are apprised of the need to take steps that make it clearer what are the respective responsibilities and rights of parties on both sides of this debate. The O'Farrell government in New South Wales have certainly taken steps to balance the needs of mining and agriculture in that state. The government there have put in place a moratorium and there are strategic land-use plans to identify and protect productive farmland. Those plans involve communities in local decision making, ensure a sustainable and healthy mining industry and encourage industry best practice. Obviously the O'Farrell government's arrangements have not been in place for very long and I think it is quite unreasonable for the Greens to march forward and attempt to overturn the balance that has been struck there by virtue of the legislation that is before the Senate today. I might also add that the O'Farrell government are developing at the present time a system of stringent groundwater regulation. They are reviewing fracking standards and they are reviewing access arrangements. So this is very much a matter under close consideration by governments such as that.


I mentioned before that the Liberal National Party in Queensland had also taken steps to show that it is addressing this issue, even though it is not yet in government. It has published a discussion paper that notes the importance of gas to the Queensland economy but does raise a number of issues that have not been addressed by the Bligh Labor government, including the depletion of underground water, the issue of land access, the location of coal seam gas infrastructure close to dwellings and the increasing pressure on inadequate existing regional infrastructure. I think that, with steps such as that, the LNP is well placed to provide for the people of Queensland a much better, more balanced approach than has been achieved by the knee-jerk reaction of the Bligh government to this problem.


It is also necessary to put on the record that the Senate itself has a committee that is currently looking at the management of the Murray-Darling Basin, including the impact of mining coal seam gas. The Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee, chaired by Senator Heffernan, will report on 30 November. Waiting might not be in the genes of the Greens, but it would be a good idea in this case to do so. I note that committee will examine:


The economic, social and environmental impacts of mining coal seam gas on:


the sustainability of water aquifers and future water licensing arrangements;


the property rights and values of landholders;


the sustainability of prime agricultural land and Australia’s food task;


the social and economic benefits or otherwise for regional towns and the effective management of relationships between mining and other interests; and


other related matters including health impacts.


I have been in this place long enough to be lectured plenty of times by the Greens about the need to pay close attention to what committees in this place do and to listen to what the committees are saying before making decisions, yet on this occasion it does not appear as if the Greens are prepared to follow their own advice.


I also take exception to the characterisation by the Greens of coal seam gas itself. At various stages some Greens have referred to it as dirty energy, when in fact coal seam gas is significantly cleaner in terms of greenhouse emissions than many other alternative fossil fuels. I note Senator Furner referred to it being 70 per cent less productive of emissions than other forms of fossil fuels and I have no reason to doubt that is the case.


With this legislation the Greens portray themselves once again as a beast that is strangely torn between adhering to the best science and being the 21st century's version of the Luddites. On areas such as global warming, they are prepared to trot out scientists ad nauseam to tell us how we need to change our ways and to improve our performance as a carbon-producing society. In areas like exploitation of natural resources and genetic modification of food the Greens seem to shy away from the best application of science. They seem to think that it is their preserve to pick and choose what science they believe and what science they do not. It is possible to use technology to exploit coal seam gas in this country in a way which balances the needs of both mining and farming users of that land. For the Greens to characterise this in other ways is just dishonest.


I also cannot help but mention that once again we see the Greens shifting and changing on the question of the rights of states and territories. I think the last piece of legislation the Greens presented to this Senate, only a few weeks ago, was legislation to prevent federal governments from disallowing the laws of territory parliaments. Today, we have been presented with legislation which effectively tells state and territory governments how they deal with their most important single area of responsibility—the use of their land. State and territory governments probably have no more important responsibility than managing the land mass of those states and territories. That is their responsibility and they have a longstanding constitutional responsibility for dealing with mining leases and with agricultural issues. Everything contained in this bill effectively cuts across respon­sibilities of state and territory governments.


But that does not bother the Greens because the Greens do not have those sorts of concerns about being a supporter of one group one day and being a supporter of the enemies of that group the next day. They are perfectly capable of doing that. Senator, as you spend more time in this place, I think you will need to develop a better sense of what a mish-mash the Greens are with their policies and their causes. The fact is that the Greens are, above all, a populist party. They detect some concern about this issue and so they decide that they have a solution. They rush forward into the Senate with a solution to issues which are complex and which deserve careful, sober consideration almost on a case-by-case basis. The Senate therefore should soundly reject this half-baked proposal from the Greens today and allow other processes to deal with these complex but important issues.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:32):  I am very pleased to speak to the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011 and I warmly congratulate Senator Larissa Waters on her initiative. The Greens bill will achieve a goal for which the Greens have campaigned for many years, and that has been clearly set out by Senator Waters. We are working with many farmers, environmentalists and the wider public to ensure that coal seam gas companies gain consent from farmers prior to entering their properties to carry out exploration activities for coal seam gas and to get a number of protections in place. We clearly need balance in how the mining industry operates in this country.


As I think all senators would be aware, more and more communities are becoming deeply troubled about the activities of the coal seam gas industry. In New South Wales, the industry's hunger for new coal seam gas exploration areas has seen a push into both prime agricultural land and even Sydney suburbs. Landholders must have the right to say no and must be able to make informed choices about whether or not they want to risk the exploration of their land. For decades, Labor and the coalition parties when in government have failed to bring balance to how the mining industry operates. The Greens' position as we have already heard in this debate, is often distorted by others. In no way are we talking about shutting down the mining industry. It is about bringing balance, and that is what Senator Waters' bill will achieve if it is passed.


I will deal with some of the misinformation that has already been put forward in this debate. We have had speakers from Labor and the coalition parties and already we see a whole series of arguments trotted out, put forward so that these parties can avoid doing the right thing by farming communities and the wider environment. One of the popular arguments—and I saw this when I was in the New South Wales parliament—is buck-passing between the federal and state governments. Here we have federal senators saying we should leave this up to the states.


The states are doing a bad job—I will come to that in detail—and that is very clear to see. Groundwater and food security clearly need to be national issues. This legislation provides the means for us to achieve the important protection that is needed. This bill is not a replacement for state regulation. It provides an additional tier of protection, and that is the essence of this argument that the senators from Labor and the coalition need to recognise before they come forward with their dishonest arguments.


Another area that needs to be addressed concerns climate change. We need independent Australian coal seam studies to determine the climate change implications. The government should not take the industry's word for it because at the moment the studies that have been trotted out are from industry. Another point where we see distortion in the arguments from the other parties is that this bill does not alter the ownership of the minerals and gas, which remain vested in the states. The bill does not affect the ability of the federal and state governments to compulsorily acquire the land with appropriate compensation. So I ask senators who are coming in on this debate to be accurate about the information that they put forward and not throw up smokescreens to try to justify why their party is not going to support this important legislation.


As I mentioned, this is a huge issue in New South Wales. Communities have become more informed and, as their awareness increases, their concerns certainly are growing. In New South Wales, the public opposition to coal seam gas mining, and particularly to the controversial method of fracking with its associated toxicity, has built to such a strong point that we are seeing wide collaboration between farming com­munities, environmentalists and urban communities. There is a recognition that the economic and health impacts are just not worth the risk. I understand that many people who are actively working in this campaign do support a total ban on coal seam gas mining in New South Wales. Local govern­ment is not embracing coal seam gas proposals. Motions supporting a moratorium have been passed by many affected councils. They have been left with little choice but to oppose this activity because they are not properly informed about the immediate risks of long-term impacts either by the government or the industry. Just yesterday the first day of a New South Wales state parliamentary inquiry was held at Alstonville. The Sydney Morning Herald describes the passionate opposition that was displayed there: 


Passionate opposition to the industry's growth in the region united doctors, cattle farmers, activists, town residents and organic produce growers. 


That is an interesting description from the Sydney Morning Herald and it certainly sums up my own experience working in rural New South Wales as the awareness about this problem has grown.


What we are seeing here too, and it was again reflected at yesterday's hearing, is this point I just mentioned about the growing concern amongst local councils. Richmond Valley, Kyogle, Liverpool City and Tweed Shire councils all gave evidence at the inquiry. It was only the Richmond Valley which has seen any benefit in the coal seam gas production. All those other councils are standing with the majority of people in their communities and representing them effectively, raising their concerns. Let us remember the area that they cover. They cover an area where I know many of my colleagues in this place come from. It is a beautiful, rich area where we see beef and dairy cattle, sugarcane, nuts and coffee. It is such a rich area with those beautiful, fertile soils, which is all at risk if the hundreds, indeed thousands, of proposed well-heads go ahead. I congratulate those councils for the stand they have taken.


It is incredible that the New South Wales government, and indeed the government speakers in this debate, defend the right of mining companies to exploit our natural resources yet they will not defend border security for farmers who are trying to protect the long-term viability of their groundwater from mining damage. Groundwater cannot be separated from food security. In May this year the New South Wales Greens MP and mining spokesperson Jeremy Buckingham introduced a coal seam gas moratorium bill into the New South Wales parliament that will place a 12-month moratorium on the coal seam gas industry in the state and prohibit coal seam gas mining in its entirety in the Sydney metropolitan area. The moratorium would provide adequate time for an independent inquiry into the economic, social and environmental impacts. The call for a moratorium is justified because the industry has not demonstrated that it can operate safely. That is where I put it to my colleagues from the coalition parties and Labor that what they should be getting behind is a moratorium. That is a responsible position when there is so much concern in the community and the safety impacts are so serious.


Senator Waters' legislation before the Senate will be a test for the coalition and the federal government on where they stand on food security and the longevity of our rural communities. I want to repeat that: this is a test for these parties. I have seen this play out in New South Wales, and I will go through that in some detail because it was informative how the other parties responded. Despite what Senator Humphries said about the Greens rushing into this and offering simplistic solutions, I and my colleagues have been working with rural communities for many years. It was on the back of our work with farmers in Liverpool Plains, in the area of Gloucester and in the upper Hunter that I introduced a bill into the New South Wales parliament to stop mining on prime agricultural land and to ensure that the water resources are protected. 


How the campaign was built up to ensure the legislation was passed is most informative. First off we did not get any support from the coalition or the Labor Party. The farmers rallied. They campaigned hard and then the National Party said that they would support the legislation. The Liberals came on board. The New South Wales Farmers Association spoke at a rally attended by about 300 farmers from many parts of New South Wales who bused in for the day. They brought their produce. It was one of the most moving days I had in state parliament with the produce all lined up at the parliamentary gates and the farmers protesting and then they came into the gallery. So we got the coalition on board. For the first time they broke ranks with the mining industry. Some of the comments of the farmers were interesting, and I understand this is why the Nationals changed their position. They said, 'How come the Greens are moving this bill? Why didn't the Nationals, who have been in the parliament much longer, put forward this legislation?' Unfortunately the bill was defeated by one vote, on the combined vote of the Labor government with the Shooters Party and Reverend Fred Nile from the Christian Democrats. But it was informative in terms of the attitude from the other parties and the public pressure which pushed the Nationals to vote the right way.


In 2008 Senator Bob Brown, together with Tony Windsor, the member for New England, built on this campaign when they called on the federal National Party to amend the Water Act to protect the farmers of the Liverpool Plains from mining threats. At the time the Greens in New South Wales also called for our bill to be reintroduced by the Nationals and to include a moratorium on coal seam gas mining and exploration on prime agricultural land. This work with communities from Gloucester, from the upper Hunter and from the Liverpool Plains has been rolling out for many years in the community and the Greens have taken this work into parliament. I am pleased that my colleague in the New South Wales parliament Jeremy Buckingham has taken up this important work for the Greens with such gusto. 


I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to some of the communities that I worked with in the early days of this campaign. I recently met Rosemary Nankivell again at the coal seam gas inquiry committee hearing in Narrabri, where she gave expert testimony on the impacts of coal seam gas in her region. Rosemary is one of the people who have put this issue on the map. She was instrumental in getting one of the first stories into the Sydney Morning Herald. It was when it was very hard to get coverage of this issue. Rosemary was a strong voice for the community. She invited me to a packed community meeting she organised to object to the coal seam gas exploration works being carried out by Santos. This was quite a few years ago. Rosemary was part of the Caroona Coal Action Group, which has done so much excellent community based work in that region to oppose coal exploration by BHP Billiton and China's Shenhua, as well as coal seam gas mining by Santos.


In July 2009 there was a meeting at Mullaley on the Liverpool Plains to call for an end to coal seam gas exploration and extraction on the best food-producing land in the Gunnedah Basin. Mining for coal seam gas, as we know, should have no place in the fertile food-producing lands in this area. Back then we gave an opportunity to the government to quarantine the area from both exploration and drilling. We were arguing that, in the context of climate change and ongoing drought, the profits of the big gas companies should not be allowed to take precedence over the protection of critical water supplies that feed our prime agricultural lands.


My colleague Senator Christine Milne has laid out very clearly the climate change impacts of this industry and how serious they are. There are also many local environmental impacts in various areas. This is particularly so in the Pilliga area in western New South Wales, where Eastern Star Gas has started extracting gas in an area known as the Pilliga Scrub in what is called a pilot project. The company Santos has taken over from Easter Star Gas.


I congratulate the locals there, particularly Tony Pickard and his many colleagues, other local farmers and the various environment groups: the Northern Inland Council for the Environment, the Wilderness Society and the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales. They produced a report titled Under the radar, which I commend strongly. They have identified that the activities being undertaken by Eastern Star Gas in the Pilliga Forest are being done without seeking federal assessment on matters of national environmental significance. The report has found that coal seam gas operations in this area have cleared more than 150 hectares and fragmented 1,700 hectares of bushland. They have drilled 92 coal seam gas wells, constructed more than 56 kilometres of pipeline and operated 35 production wells without seeking approval under the federal EPBC Act. These activities have occurred in habitat for federally listed threatened species, such as the south-eastern long-eared bat. Pepe Clarke, the CEO of the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, has said:


Under Commonwealth legislation, any potential impacts on nationally-threatened species must be referred to the environment department for approval. Eastern Star Gas has been flying under the radar to avoid this process in the Pilliga.


I have visited this area with local farmer Tony Pickard and many of his colleagues. I was alarmed at what is called a pilot project, at how extensive the damage occurring in this area is. The measures put in place by Eastern Star Gas to avoid or mitigate impacts are totally inadequate for preventing such impacts, and their effectiveness is uncertain and not scientifically established. A visit to this area quickly establishes that. You see leaking pipes, unprotected areas where gas is coming out and an industry that looks very dodgy from all angles.


Farmers deserve the right to refuse entry to their land where they are concerned about the long-term risks posed to their land and water resources. I am aware that some farmers have been very badly treated by mining companies, and it is vital that this problem be addressed. It is another reminder of the failure of the National Party to stand up for their constituency. Urban communities also deserve the right to say no to coal seam gas operations that are moving into the suburbs.


The movement against the unbridled expansion of the coal seam gas industry in New South Wales is very broad based; it is extremely diverse and includes farmers, environmentalists, inner city people and retirees on the coast. People are coming together from very diverse sections of the public. From the comments made by speakers from the Labor and coalition parties there is every indication they will join forces to prevent this bill from becoming law. But we can assure you that the movement will bring some sanity to this to protect farming land, to bring in environmental protections and to ensure that another fossil fuel industry that will add to greenhouse gas emissions will not open up. Just last Sunday more than 1,000 people walked down the centre of King Street, Newtown, one of the busiest thoroughfares in Sydney, to express their opposition to this industry. It is quite unique for people in Sydney to develop that understanding about the mining industry. Again, it shows the fantastic work the farming community has done to alert people across this state and across this country.


In New South Wales alone there are currently 100 wells, with proposals to move to 1,500. That is what is on the books. The opposition is considerable and it will build. People feel deeply concerned about it. I call on senators to look into their own hearts for what they will allow to happen to the communities they come from if they do not take a stance. It is not about being against the mining industry; it is about being in balance with how our society works: where we take our energy from, how we ensure we have food security for future generations and how we protect the water resources that are so essential to food security.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (10:51):  At the outset it is a very useful thing to identify the purpose of the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011, which I will now do. The bill seeks to make the recovery of coal seam gas unlawful on food-producing land without the prior written authorisation of all who have any legal interest in that land. From that definition, which is contained in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, I believe, necessarily, that the bill needs to be considered in the context of two other bills either currently before the chamber or about to be introduced into the chamber: firstly, the government's clean energy package of bills and, secondly, the government's proposed Minerals Resource Rent Tax Bill. Both of those sets of bills, as I understand it, are strongly supported by the proponents and advocates of this bill for good, sound and cogent reasons. Their reasons have been well articulated and well established on the public record. Indeed, in passing on rates in respect of the mineral resources rent tax, the Greens have publicly identified that they seek to increase the rent tax imposed by the Commonwealth for access to minerals below the ground. The context of those two sets of bills, therefore, and their relevancy and connection to this bill are important. I will return to that issue later in my remarks.


Let us now consider a range of matters or propositions contained in the bill before the chair. Firstly, the bill exercises Common­wealth power to apply penalties on any constitutional corporation if it, the constitutional corporation, undertakes any activity to explore or produce coal seam gas on food-producing land without the prior written authorisation of everyone who has an ownership interest in that land. Let us think about that critically important proposition. The bill defines 'coal seam gas mining activity' and 'food-producing land' extraordinarily widely. Coal seam gas mining activity is defined as any activity undertaken for exploration—we should note that—or production of coal seam gas. Let us stop here.


Exploration is the first phase of exploration of a mineral or mineral-like deposit. It is the stage only where a potential deposit is identified. Issues like the scope, breadth or depth of the deposit come later. Issues of content come later. Issues relating to value come later. Issues relating to purity come later. Issues relating to commerciality come later. Issues relating to access come later, and issues relating to cost and accessibility must come much later in the process of development.


But the process of raising capital in incremental amounts as potential deposits are valued and revalued is vital to all stages but particularly the exploration stage. Essen­tially, miners raise debt or equity by selling future rights to producers from a site during all phases of development, including post exploration. Yet this bill would stop such a process from the beginning because it requires the written authorisation of everyone who has an ownership interest in the land. It is the most perfect vehicle ever devised to prevent the proving up of likely deposits of coal seam gas.


Let us now turn to the second unlikely phrase used in the bill—that of 'food-producing land'. At the outset I observed that such a phrase is also extraordinarily wide in application. What does 'food-producing land' mean? It is clearly not just arable land, fertile land, developed land, marginal land, grazing land, crop-growing land or irrigated land. If it were, it would be so defined in the bill. No, I suggest it is arguably and clearly intended to mean any land capable of producing food. Let us think about that for a moment. Let us think about technology and science. Let us think about the ingenuity of humankind. Let us think about desert land recovered across Australia and around the world for wheat production. Frankly, there is not any land anywhere in Australia that, with the correct application of science, technology, finance and endeavour, is not capable of producing food.


Let us go back to the post-war years—post the First World War and post the Second World War—and look at land areas that have been sequentially developed in this country. I refer in particular to the river lands of South Australia and Victoria, to the marginal wheat belt territories in the south of Western Australia, to the Ord River lands in Western Australia and to the rich, fruit growing areas of Carnarvon in the north-west of Western Australia. All of those land areas over time have been developed and exploited with a combination of those matters—technology, science, finance and human endeavour. The bill, in that context, seeks to prohibit any coal seam gas activity from the beginning of exploration in any land anywhere in Australia which is or has been capable of producing food. Again, in that context, food is not defined.


In stopping that process, the bill expressly identifies at the outset how that end is to be achieved. The bill, if enacted, would not transfer the ownership of coal seam gas deposits from the Crown; it would transfer control of those resources and probably also any coal deposits requiring the draining of methane from the Crown to the holders of surface rights on food-producing land. Such a change would enable the owners of any surface rights to extract economic rents in exchange for authorising exploration and production of gas of which they have no ownership, thus depriving the community of its right to maximise its return from assets commonly held. Let us break up that proposition into its parts so that it is clearly understood. Firstly, ownership of minerals for hundreds of years has vested in the Crown. Secondly, the Crown has received income via taxation or royalties or excise for permitting lawful exploitation. Thirdly, the Crown uses that revenue for the everyday purpose of government. Fourthly, because mineral rights were vested in the Crown, the value of exploration is never included in the price of land. Fifthly, and finally, the bill proposes to pass that value, that unpriced value, to the current and temporary owner of the land without payment of any consideration—truly a most remarkable proposition. But it gets even worse. 


The government has had a clear position on the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Bill for at least the last 15 or 18 months. The government's position is to increase royalties on major companies who seek to develop mineral deposits around Australia. There has been criticism of that position from the opposition. They are opposed to it. There has also been criticism of that position from the Greens party—not that we are doing it, but they say that our rate, our levy, is manifestly inadequate and should be increased. Senator Brown has repeatedly said that he and his party will move amendments in this chamber to the MRRT Bill when it is introduced to increase the rate. So, for every other mineral, the Greens want to increase the take to the Commonwealth for the purpose of everyday government, but with the bill before the house the Greens want to transfer that benefit to the current titleholders, however temporary, without payment of any consideration at all. Such a transfer of wealth or potential wealth is totally unprecedented, totally unwarranted, unfair and totally devoid of any equity at all. 



Senator Waters interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Bishop, ignore the interjections and address your remarks through the chair, please. 




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  I will indeed, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will say it again. Such a transfer of wealth is unprecedented, totally unwarranted, unfair and devoid of even a scintilla of equity at all. 


Earlier I referred to the authorisation process contained in the bill. The bill requires that such authorisation must include details of an independent assessment of the current and future risks associated with the proposed coal seam gas mining activity on or affecting the food-producing land and any associated groundwater systems. It is unclear whether this assessment would mean an environmental impact statement, an EIS. If so, it clearly would impose a significant impost on landholders. What does this mean? It means this: the bill is seeking to deal with environmental issues by privatising assets owned by the community and setting up a further but protracted environmental process which will not produce improved environ­mental outcomes, since the existing Commonwealth EPBC Act and state environmental processes will continue to apply. 


In that context, let me turn to the work that has been done on the package of clean energy bills for the last nine months. We all know there has been nine months of exhausting committee work. We know that the Greens accepted an invitation from the government to provide the deputy chair to that committee. We know also that it has concluded its deliberations and that its policy recommendations have been examined and accepted by government. We now know that the work of that committee on the clean energy bills has been referred to a parliamentary committee for some six, seven or eight days of exhaustive examination. We know and we hope that that package of bills will be passed in this chamber prior to Christmas. And we know that that package of bills is about carbon reduction, carbon abatement and a clean energy future. 


In that context, the carbon pricing package contains more than $10 billion to promote renewable energy, but early emissions reductions are expected to be driven by the carbon price forming a switch from coal-fired electricity generation to gas-fired generation, which of course has significantly lower emissions. There have been numerous repeated and respected scientific inquiries and findings from universities all around the world that say that the output of carbon emissions from the gas production and gas use process in manufacturing energy is something in the order of 50 to 70 per cent below that of coal. So efforts by the Greens in this bill to prevent the development of gas in this country are totally inconsistent with the transition to a lower carbon future. It is manifestly clear that gas-fired electricity generation is more reliable than renewables at present. The coal seam methane industry is a stunning example, a great example, of our success as a nation and a government at state and Commonwealth level in attracting investment. Three years ago this industry was not even thought about. Now, we have got a $45 billion investment. If the Greens want to reduce CO2 emissions, they must understand that gas is going to make a huge contribution to that because it is clean energy, it is plentiful, it is cost-effective and it is reliable. 


I might be tempted to say what the opposition would say of this bill. They might say it is green extremism. They might say it is absurd bureaucratic process. They might say it is a misuse of policy to achieve an adverse predetermined outcome. But I do not say those things. The opposition might say them in due course, but I do not say them. What I do say of this bill is that it is an example of poor thinking, confused thinking, woolly thinking and silly thinking. It seeks to achieve sound environmental outcomes by absurd bureaucratic processes. 


As I said at the outset, the bill effectively provides an absolute veto of coal seam gas activities by the owners of food-producing land, which is broadly defined in the bill. The bill seeks to overturn state laws which seek to properly balance—




Senator Heffernan:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: could I just point out to the chamber the incorrectness of some of the logic in this debate. Santos has already agreed— 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Pratt
):  There is no point of order. You cannot take frivolous points of order. Senator Bishop, please continue.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. The bill seeks to overturn state laws which seek to properly balance the competing interests of the owners of surface rights to land as granted by a particular state with the rights granted by the same state to explore for and produce coal seam gas. It does this by ensuring that, at a minimum, surface owners are fully compensated for any economic loss or inconvenience as determined through a proper process. Such a change in this bill would enable the owners of any surface right to extract economic rents in exchange for authorising exploration for and production of gas of which they have no ownership, never had any ownership and never wanted any ownership, thus depriving the wider community—all of us—of its right to maximise its return from assets commonly held. This has been the case since European settlement of this continent in the 18th century and it has been the case in right of the Crown since the 12th century in Great Britain. This bill seeks to overturn that right of common ownership, common value and common return to the government—to the people—by the Crown through the provision of common services.


The excuse for overturning these long-established state systems is concern about the alleged environmental impacts of coal seam gas projects. But the bill itself does not do one thing for the environment. It simply transfers control of assets owned by us—or by us through the state—to owners of any interest no matter how remote in terms of surface rights. The bill proposes no change to environmental regulation, because it does not need to. Where matters of national economic significance are involved, the EPBC Act comes into play, as it did with all current Queensland CSG projects—projects which the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, on behalf of this government—




Senator Heffernan:
  It's all lies.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Heffernan, come to order.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
 All these CSG projects are fully subject to state environmental regulation. In any event, the bill, if passed, would undermine efforts by the Australian government to assist the states to develop a harmonised, regulatory and best practice framework for CSG activity work currently being undertaken cooperatively by all interested jurisdictions, including the New South Wales government—Senator Heffernan's own colleagues down the road. That the bill is a crude political exercise is shown by the fact that it will not affect arrangements with respect to petroleum not found in coal seam or minerals not found in association with gas, even when there might be analogous environmental or regulatory issues. Again, as I said at the outset, the bill is so broadly drafted that any competent person could drive a bull and dray through it. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-09-22,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:12):  There are so many things that the previous speaker, Senator Bishop, said on the Landholders' Right To Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill that I would like to deal with—I could spend the rest of my time on them—but let me start with the Greens. The Greens, who apparently want to put themselves up as the champions of coal seam gas by reason of the protection of property rights, are the same Greens who were quite at one with divesting the landholder of their rights for the ownership of the trees and the vegetation on their place. They never put up a bill to hand that property right back to the farmers. They never cared about that—shutting down the land by basically divesting the person of their vegetation rights. They are also the same Greens that want to take 7,600 gigalitres out of the Murray-Darling Basin to shut it down. They never put up a bill saying they do not believe in shutting down the Murray-Darling Basin. They are quite happy to do that. So they will take the vegetation rights off you, they will take irrigation rights off you, they will absolutely tie you up like Franz Kafka in red tape up and down the Great Barrier Reef with environmental regulations, and then we are supposed to believe them when they come in here to talk about their views on coal seam gas and the property rights of farmers. We know exactly what they are doing: they are creating a wedge. That is their right, but they should be upfront about it. 


There are so many people back where I live who would love the opportunity to speak in this chamber about something that is so pertinent to their lives. Yes, their issues must be addressed, but let us start at the beginning. We have an inquiry that is afoot. The extension of the terms of that inquiry—my name was put to it on the website because you were attacking the National Party—were put up by the National Party. You now sit on that inquiry with the National Party to try to bring about a resolution. That committee will report in mid-November. Senator Heffernan, who is in here; is chairing it. We in the National Party have been driving this agenda. We are happy that we have taken it. But we will want to collect the votes around this chamber to come up with a constructive outcome. There are four issues that need to be dealt with. First and foremost, we must make sure that the aquifers are protected and not destroyed. We acknowledge that there are serious questions as to whether anyone knows what is going on. Prime agricultural land must be protected. Tony Abbott has stated that, and I am happy he has done so. That is movement we have never got from Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard or anybody else, but now we have—from Tony Abbott. We have moved the agenda for the protection of prime agri­cultural land, and it was essential we did so. I would say that the people east of the Condamine are precisely on prime agri­cultural land. Anna Bligh moved for the buffer zone around residential areas, yes, but wasn't it funny that that happened after we got this inquiry afoot? We do not want people's quiet enjoyment being disturbed by the intrusion into their lives of a problem that they did not buy when they bought their house. That issue has to be addressed. If you tick the boxes—not destroying the aquifers, not destroying prime agricultural land, not destroying the quiet enjoyment of a residential estate—then there must be a proper pecuniary return delivered to the farmer. Currently they are getting less then 75c for every $1,000 that is earned by the miner.


It is very important to go through the history here, because some of the things that were said by Senator Bishop, although well meaning, were just not correct. He went right back and talked about what happened in 1200. Magna Carta was actually 1215, without trying to sound too eccentric. If we go right back to that, we find that the Latin maxim at that point in time was cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos: you owned from the heavens above to the infernal regions. In the 16th century, that was changed—the crown took from them gold and silver, fair enough. But there is still the contention that these rights have been displaced for hundreds of years; Bill Shorten, Craig Emerson and other people have said it, but they are just incorrect. Certainly the Crown in Australia had prospecting rights—it still does, and it should—but it did not have extracting rights; those had to be negotiated with the landholder. Over time, by reason of national crises, those rights have been taken from the farmer. A very good dissertation on that was given by Neville Wran in his second reading speech on the New South Wales Coal Acquisition Bill of 1981. Queensland's Petroleum Act  of 1915 says:


… it is hereby declared that petroleum on or below the surface of all land in Queensland, whether alienated in fee simple or not so alienated from the Crown, and if so alienated whensoever alienated, is and always has been the property of the Crown.


This is where in 1915 the Queensland government took those assets, the coal and the oil, from the farmer by reason of the First World War. It could see the calamity unfolding in Europe and wanted to ensure the security of their hydrocarbon material. The war finished, but the asset was never handed back. That legislation is obviously imbalanced, because all the rights—the presumption of ownership rights—that were held by the farmer were taken from the farmer, but there was no legislation to compensate in any way or to give any form of security right to the farmer. In South Australia, similar legislation was introduced in 1971. In the territories it was 1953. There were other, related, acts during the 1930s—I think 1935 or 1938, although 1938 may have been New Zealand. In New South Wales the final removal of this asset that was owned by the farmer happened in 1981. So it is not correct to say that farmers never had this asset; they did. It is an asset which historically they owned and that was extracted from their land. That is why frustration and absolute anger are permeating through farmers. They are finding that someone has a superior right of ownership because of a transaction they have never been a party to, involving people they have never met, in a room they have never been to. In Western Australia—Colin Barnett stated this the other day—people still have the right of veto on freehold land. I note that the majority of Western Australia is leasehold land, but this is where you see the imbalance.


The other problem is that the states are compromised. The states are the second-biggest beneficiary from mining, after the miners. The landholder sits there with no parity in the bargaining process. This is why we are conducting the inquiry. We need to be able to collect the numbers in such a way as to bring some sort of outcome. The Greens jump in with a little wedge bill once other people have done the hard work—they always do it. They put it in the middle of the process and then say, 'We provided a solution but you wouldn't take it.' No, because you have to go through the process. We are taking this extremely seriously. I think Senator Heffernan is taking it very seriously, Senator Shaun Edwards is taking it very seriously and no doubt the Greens are taking it very seriously. But, if you are serious on this, there has to be consistency on other things such as handing back to farmers their vegetation rights, making sure you do not compromise the irrigation rights of farmers, making sure you do not tie up farmers with environmental laws that completely ipso facto remove their sovereign right of ownership. You have to be consistent on this, and we will hold the Greens to it.


This is absolutely a core issue. The core of my involvement in the National Party is property rights—it is one of the key issues. What is the point of going to work and working for something if you find out later on that you do not actually own it? What is the point of going through the privations, of going without, if someone has a superior right of ownership to you? I have to declare my interest. I bought a place when I came into parliament. I sold my accountancy practice, got a little bit of money and jammed it into a property. I grew up on the land and I like the land. I will be going down there next week to do the cattle work. About six months ago my neighbour Bruce McConaghy rang up and said, 'Eastern Star Gas is here, and they're going to do exploratory work on your place.' So there it is: I declare my interest. But it is like saying that someone who is thrown in the sea has an interest in swimming. I have an interest in making sure we get this right, and I think the people who live around me are absolutely focused on making sure there is a bit of mustard on my tail, because it makes me work very hard for a just outcome.


There is this idea that people can go to court over this. That is a load of rubbish. This is how it works: if a person comes on to my place in Queensland, he has to negotiate an access agreement with me. He has 50 days to do that. If, after 50 days, we have not negotiated an access agreement, he might just say, 'I like to go where I want, whenever I want, and I want to put a gravel road in to get there, and I want bore heads here, here and here.' If we cannot come to an agreement within 50 days because I say, 'Mate, I think you're absolutely destroying the whole complexion of my place,' then we go to the land court. However, once we go to the land court he is right; he can start work. And he gives me—the farmer—maybe $400 or $500 to deal with that. That is all I would get to try to deal with a mining company that has multiple billions of dollars worth of backing.


The disparity in the bargaining positions of the landowners and the companies is absurd. This is something that people from the Labor Party, who understand Work Choices, should understand. The disparity in the bargaining positions is outrageous. We have to try to make sure we help those who are weak against those who are strong and get a sense of equivalence. I know you people agree with that. So this is absurd.


The next part, of course, is that he—and I say 'he' because they are generally blokes—can pay what he wants. The companies can pay you what they want. You might say: 'You've completely compromised my asset here. I can't get on to my cultivation. Basically the place I purchased is not my own anymore, and nobody wants to buy it off me.' It is a case of 'Is that a drilling rig on your place, or are you just happy to see me?' Nobody wants your place once they see that you have a coal seam gas factory, basically, situated on the area where years ago you had your barley crop or your wheat crop.


They can pay you anything they want. In some instances we have heard of people getting a slab of beer as payment. Some of these wells are earning $1 million a day. And the company says: 'But we gave you $1,500 a year. You're so much better off now.' Then they put a confidentiality agreement on it so you cannot talk to anybody. You cannot talk to your fellow workers and find out what they are being paid. No, you are not allowed to do that.


I know that in the Labor Party there will be some essence—some little seed down in your soul—that would say: 'I don't think I agree with that sort of concept of how you bargain. I think there should be transparency in collective bargaining against a stronger party.' You have to be philosophically consistent and work out how you are going to deal with this issue. The committee is afoot, and we will want to see exactly how you participate in that process.


And then there is this argument that somehow private ownership is anathema to the progression of commerce. I did not think it was. I thought private ownership was something we actually believed in. I thought we believed in the right of the individual to be commensurate with their capacity not only to improve their own position but to improve the position of the community around them. Not only do I think that, but apparently so does Henry Ergas, who said, in relation to coal seam gas, in his Catallaxy Files:


Shifting the rights to farmers will not affect the extent of development; rather, it will affect who gains the rents from development.


I do not think they have had any problems in Texas, as far as development goes. They might have had problems environmentally; I acknowledge the visual interjections of other senators. But you cannot say Texas has stayed behind as far as mineral development goes. It is privately owned. They are doing all right. I do not want Texas in Baradine.




Senator Heffernan:
  The Wild West!




Senator JOYCE:
  I do not want that. But we have to debunk the argument that we can believe in private ownership and commerce but not believe in the rights of farmers to be greater masters of their destiny. We acknowledge the financial predicament Australia has got itself into with debt—both the debt of the states, who are going to be $250 billion in gross debt by 2014-15, and the position we are in federally, with $205 billion in gross debt. We know that means that if we do not have mining we do not have money, and if we do not have money we have a big, big problem. But this cannot come at the expense of the fundamental injustice we are now seeing in so many areas. If we ignore this issue, it will not go away.


The Armstrongs and the Brimblecombes, the people around Cecil Plains and the multigenerational farmers from down in the Lockyer, up into the Downs and out west are an extremely collegiate group. They are and will continue to be on the phone to one another, surveying the horizon and saying, 'Are we going to get a form of justice, and who is going to give us that justice?' They will be having discussions with people in northern New South Wales—with whom, as I have explained, I have some involvement. These people will then be talking to the people on the coast and to people everywhere else. They are our shareholders. The voters are our shareholders. They are the most important people to us. They are the people we are here to serve. We are their servants first and foremost, before allegiances to any other group, party, body or corporation. So there is that expectation. There is a Senate inquiry on foot. My belief is that that Senate inquiry will report and, from that, we will have the capacity to try and start to move this agenda. We must acknowledge that for the vast majority of this issue you must follow the money: who makes the money out of the royalties? It is the states. So the vast majority of the ownership of this problem rests with the states. That is not saying for one moment that we do not also have a role in this, because as far as the shareholder—the individual, the Australian citizen, the farmer—goes we are the closest thing they are ever going to get to an independent party, because the states are the second-biggest earners after the mining companies. But we cannot just quietly walk away from this. Likewise, we cannot have these sundry pieces of legislation that are slipped in prior to the conclusion of a process that is on foot, which is to bring about some sort of resolution, which has moved the agenda from the middle pages to the front pages and which has been at the forefront of keeping pressure on state Labor governments, such as in Queensland, to now bring about a two-kilometre buffer. These are the issues which have been brought about by the actions thus far, but it has not yet finished.


First of all, this issue has been brought up by Senator Waters. I have to say she is doing most of the work on this, although she is not going to get a chance to speak today. If they are consistent, we will see them working in an effective manner towards resolutions at the end of the inquiry. We will also see, in later times, when we bring up other things that may happen—when we reinstall the vegetation rights and so hand back farmers another asset that was stolen from them in the middle of the night without any compensation—we will get the same sort of emphatic support that they apparently have for the coal seam gas issue. And, when they later on tell us that we are going to lose 7,600 gigs from the Murray-Darling Basin, obviously that will change now—because they are worried about farmers now, so they will obviously change their views on that as well; otherwise, someone might just get a sniff of hypocrisy from a party that believes in stealing your trees, shutting down the Murray-Darling Basin, shutting down the live cattle trade, tying up legislation in caveats and imposts—but apparently does believe in coal-seam gas— (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (11:32):  I am very pleased to rise in support of the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011 today. I support the bill because it is good policy, it is prudent policy and it also happens to be popular with the vast majority of the Australian community. The bill gives farmers the right to refuse a miner permission to extract coal seam gas on their properties. As it stands, farmers who grow the food we eat, and export food, do not have this right. When it comes to facing down the miners who want to move in, dig up their properties and extract what is underneath, farmers hardly have any rights at all. We do think that they should have the right to preserve the lands under their care from a potentially devastating industry. It is true that the minerals under their properties are public property. This bill does not change that fact. It does not seek to create a precedent.


In our mad scramble to exploit the supposed riches of coal seam gas, we are taking some very dangerous risks with one of our country's most precious resources: this nation's farmlands. If things are left to the mining industry, the methane under our farmlands will be extracted and sold as quickly as possible. Preserving our most fertile land for the future will be less than an afterthought. Given what we know about the risks of coal seam gas extraction, this is reckless and premature. This bill does nothing more than add a note of caution to the debate.


In terms of our food production, this bill is aimed at protecting agricultural land and our environment; in particular it is aimed at preserving our best quality farming land. Farming is important in terms of Australia's economy, but it is also important in terms of the Australian tradition. Despite this being a highly urbanised country, our farmers rightly hold a special place in the Australian consciousness. This nation was built on the back of our farmers and our agricultural resources. Agriculture remains an important sector of the economy and an important part of our national identity. We are extremely lucky in this country to have access to such a bounty of high-quality fresh food. Over 90 per cent of what we eat is grown here. We have food security. Food security has had a bit of press recently, and we do take it for granted, but it is becoming an issue of increasing urgency. Only a tiny proportion of this country is made up of high-quality farmland. We do not have any farmland to spare, so no populist campaign of dam-building is going to change that. Therefore, our best land should not be foolishly used for short-term gain.


Unlike what Senator Bishop was suggesting, this bill only applies to land that has been used in the last 10 years for producing food that Australians eat and that we export to the rest of the world. With the UN now projecting that global food production needs to rise by about 70 per cent by the middle of next century, safeguarding food-producing land should be one of our highest priorities. Coal seam gas extraction uses billions of litres of water, it competes with agriculture for this precious resource and we have not had the debate that says that mining should win out in this current argument.


Mining is, of course, very important for our country and for our economic prosperity. We are not an anti-mining party. We understand that the world needs our resources and that Australia can provide them. But the Greens are the party of long-term thinking. You can only dig up minerals or extract gas once. What happens then? What does the future look like?


This is particularly important when it comes to the coal seam gas industry. Once we have extracted and sold the gas, once the miners have left our properties, what does the land look like? Is it still fit for growing food?


We have not done a complete analysis of the risks associated with this industry. Let me name a few here. Of course, there is the significant risk of groundwater contamination. We know that some coal seams connect with the watertable. We know that the associated water that is produced as a by-product is often polluted with some dangerous chemicals, some of which I will refer to shortly. We know that this by-product often lies in evaporation ponds and risks leaking into rivers and becoming part of our potable water supply. We know that there are some real concerns about whether this industry is in fact helping us to make the transition away from high-emissions industries, particularly when one considers the potent nature of methane as a greenhouse gas, and that the footprint of this industry has been largely understated when we take a full life cycle analysis into account. We know that there are problems with leakage with compression for export. We need more independent analysis. We need to see Australian studies on this industry, independent of industry propaganda.


And coal seam gas is unnecessary. We do not need it now, especially from prime agricultural land. We know that there are alternative sources of energy.


As a medical professional, I want to spend a moment or two to focus on the health impacts of this industry. Most people would, of course, be very protective against any industry that might cause the potential health impacts associated with the mining of coal seam gas. We do not know enough about what those impacts are at the moment. We know that only four of the 60 fracking chemicals have been assessed as safe by NICNAS, the national chemicals regulator, but we know that there is very good reason to think that some of those chemicals will have very serious health impacts.


When we look at the hundreds of different chemicals used in the extraction process, in particular there has been some focus on the BTEX group of chemicals: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. These are the same products that are found in cigarette smoke. They are the same products that are found in exhaust pollution from motor vehicles. We know that they cause a range of health impacts. We know that some of them are potent carcinogens. We know that they affect a number of the body's systems, including our nervous system and circulatory system. So there are some real concerns about the impacts of the chemicals used in this process.


We know that these chemicals leave a lasting legacy. They have the potential to contaminate billions of litres of water through the process. I am really concerned that we do not have enough information to be able to say that this industry is safe and that we can safeguard against the potential health impacts on the Australian community. The potential for these chemicals to get into drinking and irrigation water supplies is significant, and we simply do not understand their impact on human health.


We need in this instance to use the precautionary principle. Until the toxicity profiles of all of these chemicals—in particular, the BTEX group of chemicals—are clearly understood, why on earth would we take a chance with one of our most precious resources, our groundwater?


Of course, there is a risk that the chemicals from the coal seams themselves—that is, the chemicals that lie dormant within these seams—will in fact be brought to the surface and into the water supply and our food chain. We know that there are a number of volatile organic compounds that exist within these coal seams and that they have the potential to cause cancer and other teratogenic effects. We also know that the underground channels by which a coal seam might link to an aquifer are complex. We need to make sure that we get more evidence and that we have a greater understanding of the impacts of these chemicals and their use before we jump headlong into the coal seam gas gold rush.


Given the potential for damage to human health, we think that one of the things that has been lacking in this debate has been the involvement of the public health community and public health experts as part of this process. I refer to publications in the Medical Journal of Australia which indicate some of the concerns expressed by the medical community when it comes to coal seam gas. It is important that, when we plan for proposals such as this, no proposal should go ahead without a complete consideration of the public health ramifications of this industry, and none should operate without strict and rigorous monitoring of the full impacts of the industry. Prevention is much, much more sensible than cure. Let us apply that principle not just to our health system but to this debate around coal seam gas mining.


I would like to say a few things about my home state of Victoria. While this debate has largely focused on the states of Queensland and New South Wales, Victoria is now the next target in the coal seam gas battle. In Victoria over 30 applications have been received for exploration for coal seam gas mining, and a number of these are exclusively for coal seam gas. It is of great concern to me and to many Victorians.


We in Victoria have some of the nation's most productive farmland. For example, Victoria produces two-thirds of this country's milk. We have a dairy industry that is worth approximately $2 billion in exports. The Victorian public is now very, very alarmed by the coal seam gas gold rush.


It is clear that in my own local community in the region of Colac and south of Colac there is growing anxiety about an exploration permit that has been granted now to ECI International. At a community meeting that was held in the town of Forrest last Friday, in the wonderful Otway Ranges, my own place of residence, we saw almost 100 residents attend a community meeting who were particularly concerned about the impact of coal seam gas mining on groundwater.


We have seen issues in other areas such as the Ovens and King valleys, which were very strongly opposed to the possibility of coal seam gas exploration licences. In fact, the city of Wangaratta also expressed that view. An exploration licence for an area near the town of Warrnambool was withdrawn after significant community opposition.


We know that that story is consistent with what is happening right across the country. A Galaxy poll indicated that 68 per cent of Australians do support a moratorium on coal seam gas until the full health and environ­mental impacts are understood. We know that is how the Australian community feels. In fact this bill does not even go that far. All it says is that farmers should have a say. Disappointingly, this was not reflected by the other parties, who voted down the Greens motion for a moratorium on coal seam gas just last week. Their position is out of step with that of the majority of the Australian community.


The passage of Senator Waters' bill is nothing more than a nod to caution and good sense. It does not ban coal seam gas mining. It simply taps on the brakes and says: 'Look, we don't know enough about this industry, its impact on agriculture and its impact on human health. Let's make sure we get a much fuller picture around what those impacts are before we rush headlong into this industry.' I proudly stand here in support of the bill. I think that, if we do not support it, we do risk damaging human health and we do risk long-term damage to our groundwater and to our farmland. For those reasons I very proudly stand here in support of this bill.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (11:46):  The coalition supports the expansion of the coal seam gas industry, in harmony with the rights of landholders and the protection of prime agricultural land for food production. Issues related to land use are, of course, primarily a matter for the states. It is important that we take a balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of the mining industry to Australia's economic future while protecting prime agricultural land and respecting the rights of farmers.


The coalition supports the work done by our state colleagues in delivering a more balanced approach than that currently being offered by state Labor governments. The mining industry and the farming community have a long history of working together in Australia, which has allowed both sectors to prosper. There are long-established systems in place that allow miners and farmers to negotiate land access and very few cases end up in court. There are numerous examples of farmers and mining companies who have been working cooperatively and who have negotiated mutually beneficial outcomes.


It is also important to note that the development of the coal seam gas industry in Queensland is subject to more than 1,500 state and federal conditions, making it more regulated than the uranium industry. The coal seam gas companies operating in Queensland, such as the Queensland Gas Co. and Santos, have shown they are willing to carry out the process in good faith. By way of example, all the Queensland Gas Co. work on private properties has been done with the express permission of landholders. The Queensland Gas Co. prefers voluntary agreements and now has more than 800 agreements, following negotiations on land access with about 1,000 landholders.


The coalition believes there are some sections of productive land that are of such significance that they should be given additional safeguards. Under the Constit­ution, it is state governments that are responsible for land use and mining. Therefore, in our view, it is a matter for each state government to determine which areas are considered prime agricultural land and for each state to put in place protective measures where appropriate in consultation with farmers, rural communities and resources companies. We urge those resources companies to deal effectively with the issue of protection of prime agricultural land. That is of course a matter that state governments need to continue to pursue as a matter of priority.


Positive steps have been taken, for example, by the O'Farrell government in New South Wales to balance the needs of mining and agriculture. The O'Farrell government has put in place a moratorium and strategic land use plans which will identify and protect productive farmland, involve communities in local decision making, ensure a sustainable and healthy mining industry and encourage industry best practice. The O'Farrell government is also developing a stringent groundwater regula­tion, reviewing fracking standards and reviewing access arrangements. The Liberal-National Party in Queensland has shown how seriously it takes the issue of safeguarding prime agricultural land with the publication of a discussion paper noting the importance of gas to the Queensland economy and raising a number of issues that have not been addressed by the Bligh Labor government. These include the depletion of underground water, land access, the location of coal seam gas infrastructure close to dwellings and the increased pressure on inadequate existing regional infrastructure.


The Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee, chaired by my colleague Senator Heffernan, is currently inquiring into the management of the Murray-Darling Basin, including the impact of mining coal seam gas, and will report on 30 November 2011. That committee is examining the economic, social and environ­mental impacts of mining coal seam gas on the sustainability of water aquifers and future water licensing arrangements; the property rights and values of landholders; the sustainability of prime agricultural land and Australia's food task; the social and economic benefits or otherwise for regional towns; the effective management of relationships between mining and other interests; and various other matters.


The federal coalition will continue to work with the coalition in New South Wales, with the LNP in Queensland and with other state parties to ensure the rights of farmers are always respected in this context. Mr President, I seek your guidance as to whether I can continue my remarks now or whether I need to seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.




The PRESIDENT:
  Order! Time for the debate has expired.

Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:52):  by leave—We have a general agreement in the Senate that private members' time, because it is short, will be organised so that the primary piece of legislation being brought on each week for discussion will be brought to a vote. What we have just seen is that fail to happen.




Senator Cormann:
  Are you saying that I am not allowed to speak?




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, I am. Senator Cormann, you are interjecting against the standing orders. I am saying you should organise, within the ambit of a commitment from your side as well as everybody else's, to have an orderly arrangement whereby a vote is taken in private members' time. What you are otherwise saying, Senator Cormann, is that you do not want opposition bills coming to a vote in the chamber. If that is your position, that is new. Let us know about it. The same goes for the government.




Senator Cormann:
  My position is that, if want to speak, I should be allowed to speak.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Your position is that you do not want any action, Senator Cormann. It is obvious from the contribution you were giving why that is the case. I am just saying to the government and the opposition that this is a breach of spirit by both sides and it ought to be brought back into order. Otherwise private members' time goes back to being of no significance—government bills get through; private members' bills do not get through. That is not proper in this place.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:53):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement.




The PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator FIFIELD:
  There was no agreement that this particular piece of legislation would come to a vote today. There are on occasion informal arrangements reached between the parties, but there was not one with this particular piece of legislation. Senator Cormann is only part-way through his contribution. On the circulated speakers list there is still Senator Xenophon and Senator Williams to speak. So I do not see what has happened today as being in any way controversial or out of the ordinary. It is a piece of legislation that is being appropriately debated.

Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (11:54):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement.




The PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator McEWEN:
  I would have to concur on this occasion with the comments made by Senator Fifield. There has been no agreement by the parties to take this particular piece of legislation to a vote. As we know, on past occasions in private senators' time, some bills have been taken to a vote. But there was no agreement. It has been discussed numerous times at whips meetings. It has also been discussed on occasion by the Procedure Committee, where there was also no agreement reached. The government's view is that each piece of legislation that comes to this chamber should be treated with respect and, as Senator Fifield noted, there are other speakers on the list. So we believe the process this morning has been in accordance with generally agreed principles in the Senate.

for inquiry and report by the second sitting day in 2012. The reasons for the referral of each these bills is set out in the section entitled “Reasons for referral”, contained in the appendices of the Selection of Bills Report 13 of 2011.


It is with a great sense of disappointment that I rise to my feet and find myself in the position of having to move an amendment to the motion to take note of the report of the Selection of Bills Committee. One of the great strengths of the Australian Senate is its committees that put partisanship aside and work cooperatively in a spirit of consensus. Those committees are the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Privileges Committee, the Senators Interests' Committee, the Regula­tions and Ordinances Committee and the committee in question today, the Selection of Bills committee, all of which have traditionally operated in a consensual fashion.


The Selection of Bills Committee, as my colleagues know, operates as the clearing house for bills in this place. It ensures that, where colleagues have legitimate reason for recommending that bills be examined by a committee, this happens. Debate about time frames certainly happens within that committee. Debate about which schedules might be referred certainly happens. Debate about which committee is best placed to examine a particular piece of legislation also occurs in that committee. There is give and take, but consensus is achieved. We are very proud that the Senate runs its own race. Whether or not there are House committees or joint committees addressing the same legislation, the Senate reserves its right as an independent chamber, as a house of review, and as a result there are often concurrent inquiries.


In my time on the Selection of Bills Committee there has never been an outright no to a committee reference. In my view the committee, in facing probably its greatest test since I have been in the parliament, has failed. It failed because the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens elected to put partisanship and party ahead of supporting the Senate's role of review. I am not entirely surprised by the Australian Labor Party's behaviour, but I am gob­smacked that those great champions of the Senate committee processes, the Australian Greens, sought to deny the opportunity for Senate committees to do their job. This is something that the Australian Democrats never would have supported.


This amendment provides the opportunity for the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party to think again. This amendment provides the opportunity for the Senate to set things right, to see the Senate provide the sort of scrutiny that the carbon tax bills warrant and that the Senate is duty bound to provide. Rather than have 19 bills corralled in one stacked joint committee with unreasonable time frames, the coalition's proposal is for all bills to be referred to the eight Senate legislation committees to consider those provisions which are relevant for each committee's jurisdiction. The coalition proposal is also for a reasonable time frame, that committees are to report back by the second sitting day of 2012. There are eight pages of detailed reasoning, which were submitted to the committee to support our proposition.


The Prime Minister, we know, essentially committed electoral fraud with her statement before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. She may end up being technically correct because the carbon tax is not due to take effect until the middle of next year, and it may well be that she is no longer the Prime Minister at that time. So she may end up being technically correct.




Senator Arbib:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Fifield has raised a term in relation to the Prime Minister which is unparliamentary, certainly in this chamber. He should withdraw.




Senator FIFIELD:
  On the point of order, I said the Prime Minister had committed electoral fraud. I do not mean that in a technical sense of breaching legislation but just in a moral sense.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Senator Fifield, in that case you should withdraw.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I have used that phrase many times in this place, but I will withdraw that part which you find objectionable.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You may proceed.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Prime Minister should not have fibbed—let's put it that way—but her day of reckoning will come. Her day of accountability will be at the next election but the place where the government is accountable between elections is in this chamber and in the committees of the Senate. The first step for those opposite to seek to regain some dignity and some honour for their government is for it to submit this package of legislation to the Australian Senate and to the full processes of scrutiny of this chamber. That is what the government should do. We on this side are giving it this opportunity to set things right, to correct the error that I believe it made in the Selection of Bills Committee last night. I commend this amendment to the chamber.

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (12:02):  Senator Fifield said at the start of his speech that he was disappointed. I am also disappointed, at the attitude and the approach that, once again, the Liberal and National Party senators are taking in this chamber to try to delay and to stall action on climate change. I speak to support the Selection of Bills Committee's report. It is a sensible, reasonable and responsible approach to the bills and to the debate.


The opposition has spoken to amend the report so that the bills of the clean energy package are referred to various legislation committees for inquiries that would not conclude until next year. This is simply an attempt by the opposition senators to delay consideration of the legislation. They are hiding behind the rhetoric of scrutiny of legislation to delay these bills in the Senate when the cost of delay is so great to our economy and environment. It is worth reiterating just how much parliamentary scrutiny these bills have had in the past 12 months and how much consideration has been given to the issue of a price on carbon. It has been considered by parliamentary inquiries over the past 20 years. I will repeat that: the parliament has been considering the issue of climate change and our response to climate change for 20 years. During that time there have been no fewer than 36 parliamentary committee inquiries looking into the issue of climate change and the policy responses. This number increases to 37 inquiries if we include the current joint parliamentary inquiry looking into the clean energy package of legislation.


These inquiries have led to a vast accumulation of facts and all inquiries have led to the same conclusion—that a price on carbon is the best way of addressing climate change. Putting a price on carbon is at the heart of the clean energy package. In the past 12 months, a parliamentary committee has developed the proposals containing the clean energy package. Exposure drafts of the legislation were available many months ago.




Senator Birmingham:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the minister is misleading the chamber if he refers to a parliamentary committee. A parliamentary committee is a committee of either chamber or of the parliament. If he can refer to which parliamentary committee developed these bills I would be quite intrigued.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  There is no point of order.




Senator ARBIB:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Exposure drafts of the legislation were available for many months. There is a current joint select committee examining these bills, not to mention a Senate select committee examining the issue. The legislation has been scrutinised. The parliamentary committee process is already at work on these bills. I should also add that coalition members of parliament were given the opportunity of contributing and being part of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, given an opportunity to be part of drafting, given an opportunity to be involved in framing and debating, and they rejected it. They boycotted it and decided they wanted no part of it. We understand why. They do not believe in climate change or taking action on climate change, so they have boycotted the process.


Let us be clear about that. They have tried to stall it at every step of the way. We know that during the debate on the bills to enact the CPRS coalition senators time and time again attempted to filibuster the debate for days and days on end. We know where that ended. This has been the tactic of the Liberal Party and the Nationals. Once again, they come into this chamber with one tactic and one tactic alone—to delay the bills. They are not trying to delay the bills; they are trying to kill the bills because they do not believe in climate change.


We know that that is where the Liberal Party stands on this. This is a stalling tactic. There have been 36 parliamentary committee inquiries that have looked at this issue, have looked at the issue of climate change, have looked at what credible steps a government can take to fight climate change. And the stakes are high. We know the economic cost, we know the environmental cost, and at the same time as that the Australian people want the government to take action on climate change. They do not want stalling; they want action. That is exactly what these bills do. It is exactly why the government brought these bills to the chamber and it is exactly why we should support the report from the Selection of Bills Committee.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (12:08):  The Australian Labor Party are deeply embarrassed by this carbon tax which was imposed on them by the Greens political party. It is true that in the last parliament between 2007 and 2010 when the current foreign minister, Mr Rudd, was Prime Minister we did have a series of parlia­mentary committees scrutinising what was then the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I pause here for a moment to observe that at least the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, was not worried about parliamentary scrutiny. But what was the conclusion of that process of parliamentary scrutiny? What did the Senate do at the end of that parliamentary scrutiny? We voted the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme down because the Senate realised that the Rudd government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was all economic pain for no environmental gain. 


The Australian people were entitled to believe that the current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in 2010 had reached the same conclusion. Why otherwise would she have gone to Mr Rudd and said, 'Let's kill this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme'? Why otherwise would she have looked down the barrel of that camera and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? After all the debate in this parliament over the last three years, given the failure of Copenhagen, given that there is no appropriately comprehensive global agree­ment, given that putting a price on carbon in Australia when China, the US, India and others are not will shift emissions, shift jobs and shift manufacturing to other parts of the world, people were entitled to believe that the current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, had realised that that was not effective action on climate change but just an irresponsible and reckless act of economic self-harm. So when the Prime Minister changed her mind after the prodding by Senator Brown, after she went into the courtyard on 24 February 2011 and announced that there would be a carbon tax, we were told, 'Don't you worry. You are going to like it once you see the detail.' But guess what: once they saw the detail the Australian people still did not like it. Then she was going to wear out her shoe leather. The more she wore out her shoe leather the less people liked it. 


After all the inquiries that we have had, I asked some basic questions of Senator Wong last week and earlier this week. Remember the question that goes to the core of this whole issue. I asked Senator Wong, 'What will be the net reduction in global emissions as a result of a carbon tax here in Australia?' She was unable to answer. The reason she was unable to answer is that she does not know what increases in emissions this Australian carbon tax would cause in other parts of the world as a result of making overseas manufacturers more competitive than manufacturers here in Australia, as a result of having overseas emitters who are less environmentally efficient than the equivalent businesses in Australia take market share away from businesses here in Australia. We now have revelations that even the climate change department itself is about to rent headquarters built with Chinese aluminium, which is cheaper, which just happens to be produced through a more emissions intensive process. It is already starting. 


This government has got no answers. This is a government which tells us this carbon tax will not have any impact on jobs, yet when you look at the fine detail it looks like they have included that as an assumption in the Treasury modelling. But they continue to dishonestly claim that this carbon tax will not have any impact on jobs. These are the sorts of issues that the Senate committee process has a responsibility to the Australian people to properly explore and properly scrutinise. We should not send this to this sham inquiry which Senator Birmingham and I are both on, which will have three hearings at present, two in Canberra and one in Melbourne, not a single meeting in Western Australia or other parts of Australia where there are particular issues. It is one week for submissions, three or four days for hearings and a report by 7 October. This is 1,100 pages of legislation, 19 bills—on something we were promised we would not get. 


If the Senate supports the recom­mendation from the Selection of Bills Committee we would be abrogating our responsibility to apply proper scrutiny to a fundamental economic change that this government wants to impose on the Australian people. Given the government's bad track record when it comes to implementing change, this Senate should make it its business to apply proper scrutiny. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:13):  I rise to indicate that the last speaker's contribution to this debate indicates why, no matter how many hearings we had, it would appear that the coalition is incapable of grasping the detail of the bills. I just heard Senator Cormann challenge the government to say what the net reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions of the clean energy package is. I put to him: what is the net reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions of the coalition's direct action plan? What is the global net reduction in emissions?



Senator Cormann interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  This is the complete nonsense—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Once again the opposition was heard in silence but now are yelling out across the chamber and interrupting Senator Milne's speech. That is against the standing orders and they should desist. 




Senator Cormann:
  On the point of order, when referring to my contribution in this chamber, Senator Milne directly challenged me to provide a particular piece of information, so I was responding to the senator's explicit invitation to provide information, which clearly she does not want to listen to.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  There is no point of order. Senators are reminded that interjections are disorderly. I expect speakers to be heard in silence.




Senator MILNE:
  What we heard in Senator Cormann's contribution a moment ago was in fact a very good example of what has happened. The coalition have been running a Senate committee process around the country on these bills for some time. But the point at issue is that they have not actually engaged with the substance of the debate. They have used the Senate committee process to run a campaign to spread quite a substantial amount of misinformation concerning not only climate change but indeed the clean energy package.


I remind the Senate that the coalition were invited, with two places being made available on the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, to engage this issue. But it was a requirement that members of the committee actually believe in climate change and believe in pricing greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with market mechanisms. At that point the coalition said they did not believe in market mechanisms. They believe in the old Eastern European model of a centralised state, collecting taxes and paying out at twice the cost to the Australian economy of a market mechanism, as the Treasury officials and climate change officials pointed out yesterday.


So it would not matter how many Senate inquiries you had into this. They have an ideological view that opposes market mechanisms, which is quite an extraordinary thing for the coalition, who for years have tried to suggest they were economic rationalists. Now they have gone to the old Eastern European model. They do not believe in market mechanisms, and they are going to vote against this, anyway.


The Leader of the Opposition has said he will repeal every single climate bill. We know that that is a falsehood, because already they have said they will not repeal the Carbon Farming Initiative, which is in the package of bills, and the very first one that went through. They spent hours in this place opposing it and then stood up in the third reading and said they would not repeal it. That is going to be the fate of all of these bills, because the coalition do not have a policy on climate change that stands up. Increasingly, business is now saying: 'Sorry, your plan is going to cost us twice as much. We actually don't support it, either.' Mr Abbott, the leader of the coalition, is going to have to stand up very soon and acknowledge that he is not going to repeal all of the climate bills, after having told a convoy here and any number of people around the country that they will repeal the bills.


What is interesting about the inquiry into the bills—a joint house committee inquiry has been passed by the parliament—is that the coalition senators yesterday were much more inclined to grandstanding and shouting rather than getting to the actual substance of the bills. In fact, I would suggest that most of the coalition members did not even read the bills before going to the inquiry. They are not interested in testing the detail of the bill. This is all a sham. Talk about honour and dignity. Honour and dignity is about respecting the processes of the place. The parliament has agreed to this. Also, I note that the coalition now spends its time at every opportunity denying people leave to present amendments and points of view. So let's not have this self-righteous honour and process. Some of us were here when the Howard government had control of both houses. There was no honour and no process. There was abuse of Senate process day in, day out. We are now seeing the coalition exhibit the same abuse of process at every turn.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (12:19):  I, too, would like to contribute to this debate and I indicate that I oppose the motion moved by Senator Fifield to amend the Selection of Bills Committee report. The reason I oppose the amendment is that once again this is just a delaying tactic by the opposition. They want to delay parliamentary consideration of a package of bills because, as we know, they are determined to do only one thing, and that is to never take any action on damaging climate change.


So that people understand it, the proposal here from the opposition is that the clean energy bills be referred to no fewer than eight Senate committees. The proposal is that those eight Senate committees would all be looking at the same legislation. It is a ridiculous proposition because the same legislation is currently under consideration by a joint select committee established, as Senator Milne said, by both houses of the parliament. Indeed, as we have heard, Senator Birmingham and Senator Cormann are on that committee and have an opportunity there to participate meaningfully in the debate on these bills. But they have chosen not to participate in—



Senator Cormann interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Order! Senator McEwen, resume your seat. I call Senator Cormann to order.




Senator McEWEN:
  As I was saying, there is already a process in place to examine this legislation. It is entirely appropriate that a significant select committee was set up by both houses of parliament to do that. It is not necessary to refer these bills to further Senate committees. That is just a delaying tactic on the part of the opposition.


As well as the bills already being considered by another committee of the parliament, we should also acknowledge that the debate about carbon emissions, carbon policy and policies to address climate change is hardly new to this parliament. It is also worth nothing that, although it may not be entirely apparent to most people, there is consensus in this parliament that we do need to do something about our carbon emissions. Both of the major parties and indeed the minor parties are signed up to reducing our carbon emissions. However, you would hardly know that from the kind of rhetoric we hear from those opposite because, of course, they do not believe in human induced climate change. They think they know better than the world's most prominent scientists in this regard and they choose to prosecute the case for, 'Steady as she goes; do absolutely nothing.' They put forward ridiculous proposals called 'direct action' which will be massively expensive for ordinary Australians and will deliver no benefits in terms of reducing carbon emissions.


The government's legislation will, once and for all time, address the fact that polluters in this country should pay for the damaging carbon pollution they put into the atmosphere. The government's position reflects what the majority of well-regarded scientists but, more importantly, well-regarded economists say—that if you want to stop a bad behaviour the best way to do it is to put a price on it. Indeed, former Prime Minister John Howard also had that view, as has been acknowledged many times in this parliament. Any sensible person would have that view as well—that, if you want to stop a behaviour, you put a price on it. The government's legislation does that.


It also includes the compensatory mechanisms that the government has worked on with the assistance of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to ensure Australians are compensated if necessary for the effects of a price on carbon. The govern­ment are very proud of this legislation. We are not embarrassed by it, Senator Cormann. We are proud of it. Those opposite are the ones who should be embarrassed because, like a bunch of troglodytes, they come in here every time there is any debate about anything to do with climate change and oppose doing anything.


I would just like to confirm that the government will be opposing this amend­ment to the Selection of Bills Committee report. We want to get on with examining this legislation in the parliament. It has been subject to numerous inquiries. It has been subject to a lot of debate in the community, as we know. It is time to get on with it. The government, as I said, will oppose the amendment. (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:24):  I want to read a few words into Hansard. They are a couple of statements, a couple of quotes. The first one says:


It is outrageous that only one week was allowed for the committee to receive submissions …


The second one says:


To make matters worse, hearings were scheduled in the week following the closing date for submissions, which did not allow enough time for the committee to properly consider the more than 5000 submissions received.


The third quote says:


In placing an unreasonable limit on the time for this inquiry, the Government has shown its disregard for the important scrutiny role performed by the Senate and its committees. It has shown no interest in taking this inquiry to the people and involving them in the work of the committee.


These are not my words; these are words from the opposition senators' dissenting report on the Work Choices legislation. These are the words of Senator Marshall, Senator Sterle and Senator Wong. You know what? Those words were right then, I am willing to say, and those words are right today as well.


The opposition, this side, understand that we made some mistakes and, for those mistakes, we were criticised and punished at the ballot box. What we see today, though, is the government repeating those mistakes that we made and that they promised never to repeat. They said they would not repeat those mistakes. They attacked those mistakes on the record in a report tabled in this parliament. These were words from people opposite, including Senator Wong. Senator Wong, who comes in here and defends the process that this government is trying to undertake at present, actually helped author these words. She put her name to these words, saying that there was an unreasonable limit on the time for that inquiry and that the government was showing disregard for the important scrutiny role performed by the Senate and its committees. Well, this government shows a disregard for the important scrutiny role performed by the Senate and its committees. This government shows a complete disregard.


The Work Choices legislation was, of course, one bill. This is a package of 19 bills. This package of 19 bills, totalling more than 1,100 pages, is far more comparable to what happened when the GST legislation was considered by this place. You know what happened with the GST legislation? We had multiple references running concurrently to multiple committees to ensure thorough analysis of those bills. Those references went to committees that were chaired either by Labor or Democrats senators with non-government majorities. That is not even what Senator Fifield is asking for here. Senator Fifield is simply asking that the standard process of a legislation committee inquiry occur in regard to these bills, that proper process is followed and that the precedent is followed for such a sweeping reform.


Those opposite tell us this is a sweeping reform. They all come in here and tell us that this is fundamental reform of the Australian economy and yet they will not let it be scrutinised in the same proper way that tax reform of the Australian economy was scrutinised. The hypocrisy of those opposite, who complained bitterly when the Senate was denied the opportunity to scrutinise legislation properly under the previous government, is that they are now coming here and repeating the mistakes themselves. That is just an astounding position that they have taken.


They are denying the proper role of the Selection of Bills Committee, which the Senate's own website says:


… considers all bills before the Senate to identify any which are complex or controversial or which senators have indicated warrant further examination by a standing committee.


It says:


Bills are usually referred to a legislative and general purpose standing committee which has responsibility for that particular portfolio area.


All Senator Fifield's motion seeks to do is follow this practice. These bills are certainly complex. They are certainly controversial. They certainly warrant further examination, and that is exactly what should happen. That is what this motion will ensure does happen, and it is astounding that those opposite would wish to oppose such basic, relevant scrutiny by the Senate of their own legislation. Question put:


That the amendment (Senator Fifield's) be agreed to.


The Senate divided. [12:34]

for inquiry and report by the second sitting day in 2012. The reasons for the referral of each these bills is set out in the section entitled “Reasons for referral”, contained in the appendices of the Selection of Bills Report 13 of 2011.


It is with a great sense of disappointment that I rise to my feet and find myself in the position of having to move an amendment to the motion to take note of the report of the Selection of Bills Committee. One of the great strengths of the Australian Senate is its committees that put partisanship aside and work cooperatively in a spirit of consensus. Those committees are the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Privileges Committee, the Senators Interests' Committee, the Regula­tions and Ordinances Committee and the committee in question today, the Selection of Bills committee, all of which have traditionally operated in a consensual fashion.


The Selection of Bills Committee, as my colleagues know, operates as the clearing house for bills in this place. It ensures that, where colleagues have legitimate reason for recommending that bills be examined by a committee, this happens. Debate about time frames certainly happens within that committee. Debate about which schedules might be referred certainly happens. Debate about which committee is best placed to examine a particular piece of legislation also occurs in that committee. There is give and take, but consensus is achieved. We are very proud that the Senate runs its own race. Whether or not there are House committees or joint committees addressing the same legislation, the Senate reserves its right as an independent chamber, as a house of review, and as a result there are often concurrent inquiries.


In my time on the Selection of Bills Committee there has never been an outright no to a committee reference. In my view the committee, in facing probably its greatest test since I have been in the parliament, has failed. It failed because the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens elected to put partisanship and party ahead of supporting the Senate's role of review. I am not entirely surprised by the Australian Labor Party's behaviour, but I am gob­smacked that those great champions of the Senate committee processes, the Australian Greens, sought to deny the opportunity for Senate committees to do their job. This is something that the Australian Democrats never would have supported.


This amendment provides the opportunity for the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party to think again. This amendment provides the opportunity for the Senate to set things right, to see the Senate provide the sort of scrutiny that the carbon tax bills warrant and that the Senate is duty bound to provide. Rather than have 19 bills corralled in one stacked joint committee with unreasonable time frames, the coalition's proposal is for all bills to be referred to the eight Senate legislation committees to consider those provisions which are relevant for each committee's jurisdiction. The coalition proposal is also for a reasonable time frame, that committees are to report back by the second sitting day of 2012. There are eight pages of detailed reasoning, which were submitted to the committee to support our proposition.


The Prime Minister, we know, essentially committed electoral fraud with her statement before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. She may end up being technically correct because the carbon tax is not due to take effect until the middle of next year, and it may well be that she is no longer the Prime Minister at that time. So she may end up being technically correct.




Senator Arbib:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Fifield has raised a term in relation to the Prime Minister which is unparliamentary, certainly in this chamber. He should withdraw.




Senator FIFIELD:
  On the point of order, I said the Prime Minister had committed electoral fraud. I do not mean that in a technical sense of breaching legislation but just in a moral sense.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Senator Fifield, in that case you should withdraw.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I have used that phrase many times in this place, but I will withdraw that part which you find objectionable.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You may proceed.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Prime Minister should not have fibbed—let's put it that way—but her day of reckoning will come. Her day of accountability will be at the next election but the place where the government is accountable between elections is in this chamber and in the committees of the Senate. The first step for those opposite to seek to regain some dignity and some honour for their government is for it to submit this package of legislation to the Australian Senate and to the full processes of scrutiny of this chamber. That is what the government should do. We on this side are giving it this opportunity to set things right, to correct the error that I believe it made in the Selection of Bills Committee last night. I commend this amendment to the chamber.

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (12:02):  Senator Fifield said at the start of his speech that he was disappointed. I am also disappointed, at the attitude and the approach that, once again, the Liberal and National Party senators are taking in this chamber to try to delay and to stall action on climate change. I speak to support the Selection of Bills Committee's report. It is a sensible, reasonable and responsible approach to the bills and to the debate.


The opposition has spoken to amend the report so that the bills of the clean energy package are referred to various legislation committees for inquiries that would not conclude until next year. This is simply an attempt by the opposition senators to delay consideration of the legislation. They are hiding behind the rhetoric of scrutiny of legislation to delay these bills in the Senate when the cost of delay is so great to our economy and environment. It is worth reiterating just how much parliamentary scrutiny these bills have had in the past 12 months and how much consideration has been given to the issue of a price on carbon. It has been considered by parliamentary inquiries over the past 20 years. I will repeat that: the parliament has been considering the issue of climate change and our response to climate change for 20 years. During that time there have been no fewer than 36 parliamentary committee inquiries looking into the issue of climate change and the policy responses. This number increases to 37 inquiries if we include the current joint parliamentary inquiry looking into the clean energy package of legislation.


These inquiries have led to a vast accumulation of facts and all inquiries have led to the same conclusion—that a price on carbon is the best way of addressing climate change. Putting a price on carbon is at the heart of the clean energy package. In the past 12 months, a parliamentary committee has developed the proposals containing the clean energy package. Exposure drafts of the legislation were available many months ago.




Senator Birmingham:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the minister is misleading the chamber if he refers to a parliamentary committee. A parliamentary committee is a committee of either chamber or of the parliament. If he can refer to which parliamentary committee developed these bills I would be quite intrigued.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  There is no point of order.




Senator ARBIB:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Exposure drafts of the legislation were available for many months. There is a current joint select committee examining these bills, not to mention a Senate select committee examining the issue. The legislation has been scrutinised. The parliamentary committee process is already at work on these bills. I should also add that coalition members of parliament were given the opportunity of contributing and being part of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, given an opportunity to be part of drafting, given an opportunity to be involved in framing and debating, and they rejected it. They boycotted it and decided they wanted no part of it. We understand why. They do not believe in climate change or taking action on climate change, so they have boycotted the process.


Let us be clear about that. They have tried to stall it at every step of the way. We know that during the debate on the bills to enact the CPRS coalition senators time and time again attempted to filibuster the debate for days and days on end. We know where that ended. This has been the tactic of the Liberal Party and the Nationals. Once again, they come into this chamber with one tactic and one tactic alone—to delay the bills. They are not trying to delay the bills; they are trying to kill the bills because they do not believe in climate change.


We know that that is where the Liberal Party stands on this. This is a stalling tactic. There have been 36 parliamentary committee inquiries that have looked at this issue, have looked at the issue of climate change, have looked at what credible steps a government can take to fight climate change. And the stakes are high. We know the economic cost, we know the environmental cost, and at the same time as that the Australian people want the government to take action on climate change. They do not want stalling; they want action. That is exactly what these bills do. It is exactly why the government brought these bills to the chamber and it is exactly why we should support the report from the Selection of Bills Committee.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (12:08):  The Australian Labor Party are deeply embarrassed by this carbon tax which was imposed on them by the Greens political party. It is true that in the last parliament between 2007 and 2010 when the current foreign minister, Mr Rudd, was Prime Minister we did have a series of parlia­mentary committees scrutinising what was then the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I pause here for a moment to observe that at least the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, was not worried about parliamentary scrutiny. But what was the conclusion of that process of parliamentary scrutiny? What did the Senate do at the end of that parliamentary scrutiny? We voted the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme down because the Senate realised that the Rudd government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was all economic pain for no environmental gain. 


The Australian people were entitled to believe that the current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in 2010 had reached the same conclusion. Why otherwise would she have gone to Mr Rudd and said, 'Let's kill this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme'? Why otherwise would she have looked down the barrel of that camera and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? After all the debate in this parliament over the last three years, given the failure of Copenhagen, given that there is no appropriately comprehensive global agree­ment, given that putting a price on carbon in Australia when China, the US, India and others are not will shift emissions, shift jobs and shift manufacturing to other parts of the world, people were entitled to believe that the current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, had realised that that was not effective action on climate change but just an irresponsible and reckless act of economic self-harm. So when the Prime Minister changed her mind after the prodding by Senator Brown, after she went into the courtyard on 24 February 2011 and announced that there would be a carbon tax, we were told, 'Don't you worry. You are going to like it once you see the detail.' But guess what: once they saw the detail the Australian people still did not like it. Then she was going to wear out her shoe leather. The more she wore out her shoe leather the less people liked it. 


After all the inquiries that we have had, I asked some basic questions of Senator Wong last week and earlier this week. Remember the question that goes to the core of this whole issue. I asked Senator Wong, 'What will be the net reduction in global emissions as a result of a carbon tax here in Australia?' She was unable to answer. The reason she was unable to answer is that she does not know what increases in emissions this Australian carbon tax would cause in other parts of the world as a result of making overseas manufacturers more competitive than manufacturers here in Australia, as a result of having overseas emitters who are less environmentally efficient than the equivalent businesses in Australia take market share away from businesses here in Australia. We now have revelations that even the climate change department itself is about to rent headquarters built with Chinese aluminium, which is cheaper, which just happens to be produced through a more emissions intensive process. It is already starting. 


This government has got no answers. This is a government which tells us this carbon tax will not have any impact on jobs, yet when you look at the fine detail it looks like they have included that as an assumption in the Treasury modelling. But they continue to dishonestly claim that this carbon tax will not have any impact on jobs. These are the sorts of issues that the Senate committee process has a responsibility to the Australian people to properly explore and properly scrutinise. We should not send this to this sham inquiry which Senator Birmingham and I are both on, which will have three hearings at present, two in Canberra and one in Melbourne, not a single meeting in Western Australia or other parts of Australia where there are particular issues. It is one week for submissions, three or four days for hearings and a report by 7 October. This is 1,100 pages of legislation, 19 bills—on something we were promised we would not get. 


If the Senate supports the recom­mendation from the Selection of Bills Committee we would be abrogating our responsibility to apply proper scrutiny to a fundamental economic change that this government wants to impose on the Australian people. Given the government's bad track record when it comes to implementing change, this Senate should make it its business to apply proper scrutiny. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:13):  I rise to indicate that the last speaker's contribution to this debate indicates why, no matter how many hearings we had, it would appear that the coalition is incapable of grasping the detail of the bills. I just heard Senator Cormann challenge the government to say what the net reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions of the clean energy package is. I put to him: what is the net reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions of the coalition's direct action plan? What is the global net reduction in emissions?



Senator Cormann interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  This is the complete nonsense—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Once again the opposition was heard in silence but now are yelling out across the chamber and interrupting Senator Milne's speech. That is against the standing orders and they should desist. 




Senator Cormann:
  On the point of order, when referring to my contribution in this chamber, Senator Milne directly challenged me to provide a particular piece of information, so I was responding to the senator's explicit invitation to provide information, which clearly she does not want to listen to.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  There is no point of order. Senators are reminded that interjections are disorderly. I expect speakers to be heard in silence.




Senator MILNE:
  What we heard in Senator Cormann's contribution a moment ago was in fact a very good example of what has happened. The coalition have been running a Senate committee process around the country on these bills for some time. But the point at issue is that they have not actually engaged with the substance of the debate. They have used the Senate committee process to run a campaign to spread quite a substantial amount of misinformation concerning not only climate change but indeed the clean energy package.


I remind the Senate that the coalition were invited, with two places being made available on the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, to engage this issue. But it was a requirement that members of the committee actually believe in climate change and believe in pricing greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with market mechanisms. At that point the coalition said they did not believe in market mechanisms. They believe in the old Eastern European model of a centralised state, collecting taxes and paying out at twice the cost to the Australian economy of a market mechanism, as the Treasury officials and climate change officials pointed out yesterday.


So it would not matter how many Senate inquiries you had into this. They have an ideological view that opposes market mechanisms, which is quite an extraordinary thing for the coalition, who for years have tried to suggest they were economic rationalists. Now they have gone to the old Eastern European model. They do not believe in market mechanisms, and they are going to vote against this, anyway.


The Leader of the Opposition has said he will repeal every single climate bill. We know that that is a falsehood, because already they have said they will not repeal the Carbon Farming Initiative, which is in the package of bills, and the very first one that went through. They spent hours in this place opposing it and then stood up in the third reading and said they would not repeal it. That is going to be the fate of all of these bills, because the coalition do not have a policy on climate change that stands up. Increasingly, business is now saying: 'Sorry, your plan is going to cost us twice as much. We actually don't support it, either.' Mr Abbott, the leader of the coalition, is going to have to stand up very soon and acknowledge that he is not going to repeal all of the climate bills, after having told a convoy here and any number of people around the country that they will repeal the bills.


What is interesting about the inquiry into the bills—a joint house committee inquiry has been passed by the parliament—is that the coalition senators yesterday were much more inclined to grandstanding and shouting rather than getting to the actual substance of the bills. In fact, I would suggest that most of the coalition members did not even read the bills before going to the inquiry. They are not interested in testing the detail of the bill. This is all a sham. Talk about honour and dignity. Honour and dignity is about respecting the processes of the place. The parliament has agreed to this. Also, I note that the coalition now spends its time at every opportunity denying people leave to present amendments and points of view. So let's not have this self-righteous honour and process. Some of us were here when the Howard government had control of both houses. There was no honour and no process. There was abuse of Senate process day in, day out. We are now seeing the coalition exhibit the same abuse of process at every turn.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (12:19):  I, too, would like to contribute to this debate and I indicate that I oppose the motion moved by Senator Fifield to amend the Selection of Bills Committee report. The reason I oppose the amendment is that once again this is just a delaying tactic by the opposition. They want to delay parliamentary consideration of a package of bills because, as we know, they are determined to do only one thing, and that is to never take any action on damaging climate change.


So that people understand it, the proposal here from the opposition is that the clean energy bills be referred to no fewer than eight Senate committees. The proposal is that those eight Senate committees would all be looking at the same legislation. It is a ridiculous proposition because the same legislation is currently under consideration by a joint select committee established, as Senator Milne said, by both houses of the parliament. Indeed, as we have heard, Senator Birmingham and Senator Cormann are on that committee and have an opportunity there to participate meaningfully in the debate on these bills. But they have chosen not to participate in—



Senator Cormann interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Order! Senator McEwen, resume your seat. I call Senator Cormann to order.




Senator McEWEN:
  As I was saying, there is already a process in place to examine this legislation. It is entirely appropriate that a significant select committee was set up by both houses of parliament to do that. It is not necessary to refer these bills to further Senate committees. That is just a delaying tactic on the part of the opposition.


As well as the bills already being considered by another committee of the parliament, we should also acknowledge that the debate about carbon emissions, carbon policy and policies to address climate change is hardly new to this parliament. It is also worth nothing that, although it may not be entirely apparent to most people, there is consensus in this parliament that we do need to do something about our carbon emissions. Both of the major parties and indeed the minor parties are signed up to reducing our carbon emissions. However, you would hardly know that from the kind of rhetoric we hear from those opposite because, of course, they do not believe in human induced climate change. They think they know better than the world's most prominent scientists in this regard and they choose to prosecute the case for, 'Steady as she goes; do absolutely nothing.' They put forward ridiculous proposals called 'direct action' which will be massively expensive for ordinary Australians and will deliver no benefits in terms of reducing carbon emissions.


The government's legislation will, once and for all time, address the fact that polluters in this country should pay for the damaging carbon pollution they put into the atmosphere. The government's position reflects what the majority of well-regarded scientists but, more importantly, well-regarded economists say—that if you want to stop a bad behaviour the best way to do it is to put a price on it. Indeed, former Prime Minister John Howard also had that view, as has been acknowledged many times in this parliament. Any sensible person would have that view as well—that, if you want to stop a behaviour, you put a price on it. The government's legislation does that.


It also includes the compensatory mechanisms that the government has worked on with the assistance of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to ensure Australians are compensated if necessary for the effects of a price on carbon. The govern­ment are very proud of this legislation. We are not embarrassed by it, Senator Cormann. We are proud of it. Those opposite are the ones who should be embarrassed because, like a bunch of troglodytes, they come in here every time there is any debate about anything to do with climate change and oppose doing anything.


I would just like to confirm that the government will be opposing this amend­ment to the Selection of Bills Committee report. We want to get on with examining this legislation in the parliament. It has been subject to numerous inquiries. It has been subject to a lot of debate in the community, as we know. It is time to get on with it. The government, as I said, will oppose the amendment. (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:24):  I want to read a few words into Hansard. They are a couple of statements, a couple of quotes. The first one says:


It is outrageous that only one week was allowed for the committee to receive submissions …


The second one says:


To make matters worse, hearings were scheduled in the week following the closing date for submissions, which did not allow enough time for the committee to properly consider the more than 5000 submissions received.


The third quote says:


In placing an unreasonable limit on the time for this inquiry, the Government has shown its disregard for the important scrutiny role performed by the Senate and its committees. It has shown no interest in taking this inquiry to the people and involving them in the work of the committee.


These are not my words; these are words from the opposition senators' dissenting report on the Work Choices legislation. These are the words of Senator Marshall, Senator Sterle and Senator Wong. You know what? Those words were right then, I am willing to say, and those words are right today as well.


The opposition, this side, understand that we made some mistakes and, for those mistakes, we were criticised and punished at the ballot box. What we see today, though, is the government repeating those mistakes that we made and that they promised never to repeat. They said they would not repeat those mistakes. They attacked those mistakes on the record in a report tabled in this parliament. These were words from people opposite, including Senator Wong. Senator Wong, who comes in here and defends the process that this government is trying to undertake at present, actually helped author these words. She put her name to these words, saying that there was an unreasonable limit on the time for that inquiry and that the government was showing disregard for the important scrutiny role performed by the Senate and its committees. Well, this government shows a disregard for the important scrutiny role performed by the Senate and its committees. This government shows a complete disregard.


The Work Choices legislation was, of course, one bill. This is a package of 19 bills. This package of 19 bills, totalling more than 1,100 pages, is far more comparable to what happened when the GST legislation was considered by this place. You know what happened with the GST legislation? We had multiple references running concurrently to multiple committees to ensure thorough analysis of those bills. Those references went to committees that were chaired either by Labor or Democrats senators with non-government majorities. That is not even what Senator Fifield is asking for here. Senator Fifield is simply asking that the standard process of a legislation committee inquiry occur in regard to these bills, that proper process is followed and that the precedent is followed for such a sweeping reform.


Those opposite tell us this is a sweeping reform. They all come in here and tell us that this is fundamental reform of the Australian economy and yet they will not let it be scrutinised in the same proper way that tax reform of the Australian economy was scrutinised. The hypocrisy of those opposite, who complained bitterly when the Senate was denied the opportunity to scrutinise legislation properly under the previous government, is that they are now coming here and repeating the mistakes themselves. That is just an astounding position that they have taken.


They are denying the proper role of the Selection of Bills Committee, which the Senate's own website says:


… considers all bills before the Senate to identify any which are complex or controversial or which senators have indicated warrant further examination by a standing committee.


It says:


Bills are usually referred to a legislative and general purpose standing committee which has responsibility for that particular portfolio area.


All Senator Fifield's motion seeks to do is follow this practice. These bills are certainly complex. They are certainly controversial. They certainly warrant further examination, and that is exactly what should happen. That is what this motion will ensure does happen, and it is astounding that those opposite would wish to oppose such basic, relevant scrutiny by the Senate of their own legislation. Question put:


That the amendment (Senator Fifield's) be agreed to.

  The government does not support dealing with complex foreign policy motions through simple Senate resolutions. That has been longstanding practice for the parliamentary Labor Party. Therefore, the government cannot support this motion.


Australia and like-minded countries nonetheless continue to urge Sri Lanka to address serious allegations of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by both sides during the final stages of the Sri Lankan conflict. In particular, the government has asked Sri Lanka to test the findings of the UN Secretary-General's advisory panel's report against the work of its Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission as well as to take further steps to ensure that the LLRC's work conforms to international standards. Australia will closely examine the LLRC report, due in November 2011, as will the international community, before considering whether further options should be pursued, including in the UN Human Rights Council.

Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator STEPHENS:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


During the HMAS Success's deployment between March and May 2009, the commanding officer of the ship became aware of reports of a number of incidents of unacceptable behaviour that eventually caused him to contact fleet headquarters for support and advice. The response from fleet command set in motion a series of events that eventually culminated in the landing of three senior sailors in Singapore on 9 May 2009. Rather than resolve the problems, this action attracted widespread and sensational publicity, damaged the good standing and character of certain crew members, cast doubt on the reputation of the ship's company and more broadly damaged Navy's image.


In part 1 of its report the committee looked at the circumstances that caused the CO to seek outside help to deal with the problems that had been brought to his attention. It considered the equity and diversity team that was sent to assist the CO, the veracity of its damning report and the conduct of some crew members and the subsequent landing of three senior sailors in Singapore.


In the second part of its report the committee focuses on the administrative and disciplinary processes that followed the removal of the sailors from Success. The committee finds that both processes were deficient.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (13:47):  by leave—In speaking to this report tabling today—this was a very important inquiry—I want to begin by saying that, in my nine years as a senator, with all of those years spent on the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee and the past three years as the shadow minister for defence, I have never been so frustrated, disappointed and angry as I have been with the way that Navy, Defence, its political leaders and sections of the media have treated the three sailors landed from HMAS Successin May 2009. I am standing here more than two years after these men were landed and they still have not been cleared or charged with anything after countless reviews, inquiries, investigations—some 11, I believe—and then the Gyles reports parts 1 and 2 and now the tabling of this Senate report, and these three men are none the wiser about what will happen to their careers.


I put it to every senator to imagine for a moment that someone in their family was stood down from their job, without being told why—asked to put their career on hold for two years and have unfounded, hurtful and completely untruthful allegations reported in the national and international media, unchallenged by anyone. How would we all cope with that? There would be an absolute outcry, I guarantee. These sailors, who have a combined 40 years of service to the Navy, have had their reputations irrevocably smeared, and their families have gone through this nightmare along with them. We are talking about Navy families here—families that we ask as a nation to move around the country for us, uprooting their kids from school; to send their loved ones overseas for months on end, sometimes on short notice; to miss birthdays and other family events. They are already made of strong stuff, but I know the anguish they have gone through during this whole sorry saga. It has had a dreadful effect on their physical and mental wellbeing and there has been little or no support from Navy or from this government.


What most people most remember when you mention HMAS Successis a 'sex scandal' or a 'sex ledger' and media articles with headlines spouting, 'Navy sex ship of shame'. The word 'sex' is mentioned and it is on for young and old—and don't let the boring truth get in the way of a good story. This story went around the world. The then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, said that the alleged behaviours were 'disturbing'. His deputy at the time, now our Prime Minister, said she feared that such alleged behaviour would stop women joining the Navy. And so on and so forth.


The Gyles report was rightly damning of the Navy for its inept management of these claims. The Gyles report, which was an independent report, said in its recommendations that an ex gratia payment to compensate these three petty officers should be paid. To this point in time, the minister has done nothing and the Navy has done nothing—this is a disgraceful episode in the annals of what is a very proud and heroic institution in Australia: the Royal Australian Navy.


I do not have enough time to continue my remarks, but I should say the minister has an opportunity to put a U-turn into what has unfolded with respect to these three men. It is unique. It is absolutely astounding that we have three sailors who have been recommended to be compensated for their treatment and nothing is happening. The minister has an opportunity to rectify and repair this unholy mess, this unjust, unfair treatment of these three men—and I think he should so something urgently.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (13:52):  The ADF, but Navy in particular, has been the subject of numerous inquiries, reviews and investigations reaching back to 1994 and the inquiry into HMAS Swan and sexual harassment in the ADF. Since then there has been a steady stream of other significant parliamentary, coronial and quasi-judicial inquiries into matters relating to unacceptable behaviour in the ADF. All have produced recom­mendations that the ADF, by and large, has accepted and then pledged to implement. Despite the efforts of successive service chiefs to make lasting reforms, nothing seems to change. This seemingly endless cycle of reports of incidents of unacceptable behaviour followed by inquiry followed by reform programs must stop.


The overriding message coming out of this most recent Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry is that Defence must take responsibility for identifying its problems and managing them. The ADF prides itself on producing leaders, and rightly so. However, it is an important part of leader­ship to step forward and take responsibility. Nevertheless, in part 1 of its report, the committee found that the management of unacceptable behaviour aboard Success demonstrated an absence of leadership; serious errors of judgment, starting with a lack of proper attention given to early warning signals of alcohol abuse in Darwin; a failure to exercise duty of care, especially towards young female sailors, who did not receive the protection or mentoring that was required; and scant regard for, or, at best, ignorance of, Defence's legal procedures. The committee was firmly of the view that, although evident at all levels through the chain of command, those in the position of highest authority must accept that their inattention, poor judgment and lack of courage meant that the safety and wellbeing of those under their charge was put at risk. The committee found this situation intolerable.


It also noted that in HMAS Success things started to go wrong from the moment an incident occurred. Rather than minimise any initial damage, each measure taken or not taken on board the ship appeared to compound the problem. In the second part of its report, the committee found that the mistakes and shortcomings in procedures continued in both the disciplinary and the administrative systems. Major problems were identified in the investigations undertaken by the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service. Overwhelming evi­dence from the investigator on the ground through to the director of operations showed that the investigations were unsatisfactory. Indeed, the director of operations referred to them as 'an aberration in terms of how the service should be doing business'. A subsequent inquiry into the performance of the investigative service in respect of HMAS Success revealed a raft of significant deficiencies. These ranged from serious allegations not being investigated or not properly investigated—for example, important witnesses were not interviewed, key documents were not considered, and signed statements were not taken—to inadequate documentation, in some cases an absence of records, and a breakdown in communication.


The committee notes that for a number of years it has raised concerns about the standard of investigations undertaken by the investigative service. The recent revelation about shortcomings in this investigative service is most disturbing. The committee suggests to ADFIS that the problems identified in the investigations that took place relating to incidents on board Success in 2009 should not be treated as an aberration. Indeed, they should be considered in the light of the committee's 2005 findings and ADFIS's continuing attempts to improve its investigations. The committee found in 2005 that the ADF had proven itself manifestly incapable of adequately performing its investigatory function. The committee has requested that the investigative service incorporate in its next report to the committee an account of the lessons to be learned from its performance in respect of HMAS Success.


There were also major flaws in the management of the three sailors removed from the ship in Singapore following allegations of unacceptable conduct. Two matters in particular should be mentioned. Firstly, for many months after their landing in Singapore, the sailors were left completely in the dark about the reasons for their removal from Success. There is no satisfactory explanation for this prolonged and unnecessary suspension of procedural fairness.


Secondly, Navy failed to correct errors and highly sensational media reports. The reports publicly pilloried the sailors for doing something that they did not do—that is, their involvement in the so-called 'sex ledger'. Those in Defence managing the media reports at that time should have made it their business at the very least to acquaint themselves with the facts as best they could. The responsibility for correcting the errors also resided with those who knew the reports were incorrect. Apparently no-one bothered. The detachment from and lack of concern for the sailors' wellbeing in the glare of adverse publicity was a continuation of the attitude shown toward them during their removal from Success and return to Sydney. Even after the distress caused by the false reports of their involvement in a sex scandal, they still, despite repeated requests, could not obtain information on why they were landed and returned to Sydney.


The inquiries and investigations into the allegations levelled against them and their treatment for many months after their landing are a sorry example of what can go wrong when things are not properly managed. There has been huge expenditure of resources on the myriad inquiries and investigations, but it is clear that the damage inflicted on the reputation of Navy and some of its personnel might have been avoided or contained if close attention had been paid to proper process and to the advice and guidance provided in the relevant manuals.


In the light of the multiple breakdowns in procedure and breaches of standard practice in the management of reports of unacceptable behaviour at Success through the mishandling of media reports, the committee recommended that Defence look carefully at its internal control mechanisms, including those for handling media requests and reports. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

For those who can see him from here, he seems a little blurry on the outside because he is, like most members of this government, a virtual minister. He is a virtual minister who is part of a virtual government that has virtual policies. The problem, as Senator Conroy escapes out of his virtual door, is that if you have virtual policies and you do not have a consistent approach to these issues then of course you end up with a complete mess, which is what our border protection is at the moment.


We have had a number of significant changes in policy, and it is really useful to have a look at some of the Prime Minister's statements. I can recall the time when she actually supported the turning back of boats:


The navy has turned back four boats to Indonesia. They were in sea-worthy shape and arrived in Indonesia. It has made a very big difference to people-smuggling that that happened.


She went on to say that 'turning the boats back not only has made a significant difference' but also 'fits in with our policy'. More recently, in 2010, she said:


I speak of the claim often made by opposition politicians that they will, and I quote: 'turn the boats back'. This needs to be seen for what it is. It's a shallow slogan.


Of course, that was all a bit of a mishmash, and somebody might have mentioned that to the Prime Minister. Now she has come back to 'virtually' turning back the boats:


They believe they are coming to Australia, but they end up somewhere else. It is a virtual turnaround of boats.


Again, this is classically in the line of developing a virtual policy from virtual governments.


The next process was temporary protection visas. In 2002, the now Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said:


The proposal in this document—Labor's policy—is that an unauthorised arrival who does not have a genuine refugee claim would in the first instance get a short temporary protection visa.


That's right: today's Prime Minister said in 2002 that her policy was temporary protection visas. But of course later, in an address to the Sydney Institute in 2010, Chris Evans said:


The Rudd government is proud of its reforms in abolishing temporary protection visas, closing the so-called Pacific Solution.


Where are they on this? They are absolutely everywhere, and this is the problem with having a virtual policy. It is a bit like watching a very old television set that is a bit broken and does not even stay on the same channel. You have a policy that goes from one channel to the other and back again, and all the channels are a little bit fuzzy.


We have been hearing recently about the so-called Malaysia solution, which of course followed the Timor solution. 'Solution' is a terrible word to throw around during such a debacle. Again, at a time when Prime Minister Gillard said that she would never go to a country that has not signed the refugee convention, in 2010, she said:


In terms of my plan for a regional framework and a regional processing centre, we want to deal with the countries that are signatory to the refugee convention.


She said that absolutely categorically. You could not say that was out of context. They are the people she wants to deal with. She went on later in 2010 to talk about her policy—and she said 'my policy', not a virtual policy—as follows:


The policy that I have announced is I want to see a regional processing centre that is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees, and East Timor is a signatory.


She then went on to say, a little later, on 6PR:


I would rule out anywhere that is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention.


From the UNHCR website, if she was not familiar with it, we could have put this to the Prime Minister:


Malaysia is not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its Protocol.…


By law, refugees are … vulnerable to arrest for immigration offences and may be subject to detention, prosecution, whipping and deportation.


One would think that was absolutely clear.


This is the problem when we have a virtual government with virtual ministers and virtual processes: at the end of the day, we are going to end up with a virtual border. Let me tell you: real ships with real people-smugglers ignore virtual borders, which is why this public should reject— (Time expired)

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (15:12):  In taking note of the answers given by Senator Carr and reflecting on the comments Senator Scullion has just contributed to this debate, I cannot help but pause and reflect on this 'virtual policy' characterisation, because it is a very selective policy characterisation. I would like to remind senators, and indeed Australians, of who made the most significant change with respect to asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat. Of course, that was Mr John Howard, in caretaker mode in the lead-up to the election on which Senator Scullion reflects.


The coalition had several policy changes after that period, but let us remember the circumstances of the first. The first was a deliberate decision by this coalition to demonise and politicise this debate and demonise asylum seekers. I will, in a moment, reflect on several other examples. But I want to remind the Senate that the most important point here is that it is very clear that the government's intention is to act consistently with our refugee convention obligations—unlike the former coalition government. It is very difficult to characterise what occurred on Nauru as consistent at all. The coalition claims that it delivered effective border protection, but let us remember another issue as we hear all this moralising. This is the principle that you cannot try and achieve deterrence, or deal with people-smugglers, without mistreating people or persecuting people. There are serious moral issues with that approach. This is the issue that dogged a former coalition minister when the coalition introduced this approach to try and deal with deterrence. I should run through the aspects of that approach quickly. Temporary protection visas: what that was really about was harming and mistreating the people who were stuck in Australia under those visas. I remember many examples during those years of people highlighting the persecution and the effect of TPVs. That is why we abolished them. I remember people drowning when left in the water or disembarking boats that had been turned back to Indonesia. I remember a Human Rights Watch report that highlighted that safety was not necessarily being adhered to in those arrangements.


But Nauru is possibly the best example. I am proud that this government released those people who had been left on Nauru for many, many years, rotting. We know the mental health effects of the coalition's approach in Nauru. But what we also know is that our arrangements in Malaysia are very different to what the former government set up in Nauru. The Malaysia agreement is about promoting regional processing of asylum claims and resettlement whilst treating people with dignity. It is about avoiding incarceration. This did not apply in Nauru. It is about providing access to appropriate housing, health care, education and employment. This did not happen in Nauru. It is about the participation of the UNHCR. This did not happen in Nauru. Instead, we have the coalition denigrating Malaysia.


I came across a young boy last week who is studying in Australia. He was deeply troubled with the way this debate is demonising his home country. He is concerned that this coalition is using Malaysia as a scapegoat, as it tries to continue to politicise the issue and demonise asylum seekers. The Malaysian government has made it clear that it is addressing its standing on human rights issues. I spent about a year and a half in my youth living in Malaysia. I did not see evidence of the sorts of things that Senator Cash was raising in question time today. No doubt there are circumstances where some inappropriate behaviour occurs. That can sometimes occur in any country, including Australia—we heard in question time today the example of Cornelia Rau. So I do not think we have the luxury of the approach the coalition is taking in this debate. (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (15:17):  I too rise to take note of answers given by Senator Carr to questions asked by Senators Abetz, Brandis and Cash. Senator Carr, with his usual bumbling sort of attitude, comes in here today and there is this sort of serial amnesia that the government now suffers from, conveniently forgetting—this is their modus operandi—what they promise before elections and what they do after elections. He was asked a question deliberately about what Kevin Rudd had said before the 2007 election. Minister Carr just conveniently wants to airbrush that out of history. But I would like to remind him of the sorts of promises that they made to the Australian public to con them into voting for them. The public did vote for them, and the Labor Party promised that they would do something. Back in 2007 they did not keep their promises, just as Prime Minister Gillard has not kept her promise about the carbon tax, but we will not go there today.


An article in the Australianof 23 November 2008 was headed, 'Kevin Rudd has taken a tough line on border security'. It said:




Mr Rudd said Labor would take asylum-seekers who had been rescued from leaky boats to Christmas Island, would turn back seaworthy vessels containing such people on the high seas, and would not lift the current intake of African refugees.





""You'd turn them back,"" he said
 …



He then mentioned an 'orderly immigration system' enforced by deterrence. The article continued:




You cannot have anything that is orderly if you allow people who do not have a lawful visa in this country to roam free,"" he said. ""That's why you need a detention system. I know that's politically contentious, but one follows from the other.





""Deterrence is effective through the detention system but also your preparedness to take appropriate action as the vessels approach Australian waters on the high seas.""



And, might I remind those on the opposite side, it was the Australian Labor Party that introduced mandatory detention into this country. Why do I know? Because as a lawyer with the Australian Government Solicitor's office I did my fair share of immigration work. So don't you come into this place, Senator Collins, and moralise about the coalition. You look back at your own history in relation to immigration matters. You look back at your first reading speeches and at your conduct on immigration over those years, and don't come into this place and moralise about the coalition.


Yes, the coalition, through the years, did stop the boats. Yes, we did have an orderly immigration process. And you ask those millions of people who have come to this country, who came in through the front door, how they feel about what is going on, about what has now become the chaos, the mess, the debacle that is this government's immigration and border protection system. You ask them about what happened after August 2008, under then Minister Evans. He comes in here pontificating and trying to dictate to us. He systematically started the dismantling of this system. He sat there in estimates and detailed a program change here, a program change there—no wonder the people smugglers rubbed their hands together: because they knew that they were well and truly back in business. What have the government done? They have effectively dismantled it, bit by bit. And what have we now seen? We have seen a cost blow-out of $3 billion. When the coalition were in government, it was a program that cost less than $100 million. That was under the Howard government. Just over three years ago, under the Rudd government, it cost more than $1 billion. You have had cost blow-outs.


I say to those opposite: you talk about people being in detention. That is the object of a temporary protection visa, because ultimately you have to give assurances to the Australian people that the people are who they say they are, and that is why it is vitally important that you have proper security. That is not a guarantee that I think this government can give the Australian public. (Time expired)

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:22):  Once again we have heard today in the commentary from the opposition and others in the coalition cheap political lines like 'virtual' and so on. Back before the last election, in 2010, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, used the same 'virtual' statements and cheap political statements like, 'We will stop the boats.' Close to the time of those sorts of comments and that campaign by the opposition starting, I had the opportunity of actually being on a boat. I was up there on the HMAS Bathurst, on a parliamentary Defence program. In fact, there was an opposition member from the House of Representatives, the member for Dickson, asking the same question of our Defence personnel: 'What will happen if we stop the boats?' Anyone could have worked out what the answer would be. The Defence personnel turned around and said: 'Well, if we stop the boats there will be mayhem. There will be refugees smashing holes into the hull, smashing the engine, doing anything—anything possible to be rescued.' And that is the issue with making those statements. That is the issue with having the policy of turning the boats around. They are going to turn them around to Indonesia, are they?


We have built a healthy relationship with the Indonesian government. I go back to about 18 months ago when the President of Indonesia came into this house and there was a joint sitting over there. He spoke about the changes that they are making to prosecute people smugglers. This is an example of the changes that have been occurring that the good relationship between the Australian government and the Indonesian government fosters. Yet, if we go sending boats back to Indonesia as the opposition proposes, no doubt that good, genuine relationship will dissipate forthwith. That is a main reason why we cannot go down a path of entertaining that sort of proposition.


If we go to the Nauru solution, which the opposition appear to be favouring—it appears to be their only opportunity of creating a solution to the refugee issues that we have in this country—history tells us that, of those refugees who went to Nauru, who in many cases were put in camps and allowed to rot in the sun in that terrible position, 95 per cent of them ended up in Australia or New Zealand. So we know as a result of history that that solution will not work.


The Malaysian outcome or agreement that we have been able to negotiate is the only position that we are able to entertain. It is a position that the opposition should be accepting with both hands because it provides a balance. It provides a balance of at least another 4,000 genuine refugees to come to our country, and I think that is a good move. It provides a balance where a future 4,000 refugees will come to this country to call Australia home. We cannot afford to allow this posturing and these political stunts of denying the opportunity for people like that to come to our country.


The UNHCR have also made it clear that the Nauru solution does not work. They have condemned it by saying it is just a dumping ground and a problem in a small Pacific island. When you go back and do your research on what occurred as a result of the Nauru Pacific island solution, you will ascertain that that is the case. That is what happened to those people.


I want to focus in closing on our good, hardworking Defence men and women who are involved in the Border Protection Command. I will be up there on Monday next week—as you know, Deputy Presi­dent—as Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and we will be meeting with them once again, as I did last year. I am sure they will agree with the committee—no doubt this subject might arise—that we cannot deny their health and safety in situations where there is trouble on the high seas. If we have policies like 'We will turn the boats back' or 'We will stop the boats,' we know the dangerous situation that those good men and women will be put in on the high seas as a result. That is why we cannot afford to allow the opposition to continue down the path of believing that that is the right alternative in dealing with our refugee problems. (Time expired)

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:27):  I am always amazed when I hear government senators get up and try and defend the indefensible. The fact is that history will record Labor's approach to asylum seekers coming to Australia over the past 10 years as one of the most hypocritical, most incon­sistent and most politically opportunistic gaggle of positions on a policy issue that has ever been seen in this country. Indeed, I will not be surprised if future political science courses devote a large chunk of their classes to the flip-flopping changes in position that the Labor Party has taken on this particular issue over the last 10 years.


Senator Collins spent most of her speech attacking the coalition on our policy, saying that we deliberately sought to demonise asylum seekers and that it was we who started that. That is not at all true. The demonising started with Labor when the boats started coming in the late 1990s. I believe, in fact, that it may even have been the now Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, who started that demonising, by attacking the Howard government over the boats that were coming and claiming that Labor would turn them back. Our approach, of course—



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator BUSHBY:
  That is a separate issue. Our approach was to fix the problem, so we put in place a suite of measures that were designed to actually stop the boats from coming and ensure that people had no incentive to hop on a leaky boat, risking their lives and the lives of their families by crossing the open seas on a journey to a country they had no surety they would ever reach.


Senator Collins also raised temporary protection visas, but she made no case against them whatsoever. She just damned them openly without explaining at all why she thought there was a problem with them or why they did not work. I have yet to hear from a senator on that side of the chamber any information at all about why temporary protection visas are not a valid approach to take in tackling this issue.


In relation to Nauru, Senator Collins said that arrangements in Malaysia were very different. The arrangements in Malaysia are very different. They will be very different, particularly for those people who are sent there compared with those who were sent to Nauru or who could be sent to Nauru. Those who end up in Malaysia will be subject to Malaysian justice. They will be subject to their rules, their laws and their ways of dealing with asylum seekers when they reach there. The fact is that Malaysia has laws that allow asylum seekers to be physically punished. There are nowhere near the controls that Australia had over their treatment when people in similar positions were sent to Nauru or to Papua New Guinea—control that was exercised directly at that time.


Senator Furner talked about the failings of turning around the boats, as if this were the crux of our policy. Indeed, he focused on the fact that turning around boats came with some risks. Indeed it does, but that is not the crux of our policy. The mainstays of our program have been proven to work—just look at the numbers. You just have to look at how many people were coming in the early 2000s. Yet two or three years later, after we had put in place our measures, they had slowed to a trickle and almost to a stop. The crux of our program is offshore processing on Nauru and in other nations that have signed up to the UNHCR convention, and the temporary protection visas. Turning around boats is something that we would do only on those very rare occasions when it is both safe and possible to do so. By definition, if it is safe and possible to do so, those issues raised by Senator Furner are irrelevant.


Labor's policies over this have flip-flopped, as I mentioned, all over the place over the last 10 years. They have gone from setting up onshore detention, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells mentioned—in fact the Keating government was the first govern­ment to set up mandatory detention—to attacking the former Howard government over the problem in the late 1990s. As I mentioned, Prime Minister Gillard played a key role in attacking us in regard to boats that were arriving and our lack of action over it. She told us how they would stop the boats and then totally opposed the measures which the Howard government implemented to do just that and which, contrary to Minister Carr's claims today, totally and demonstrably worked by turning the annual numbers around so absolutely that, by the time this government took over in 2007, there were only a handful of people left in detention and the boats had almost completely stopped arriving.


So what did they do then? Having achieved the treasury bench they wound back all measures implemented during the Howard years. It worked so well, with the consequence that we have now seen over 12,000 illegal arrivals and over 241 boats. (Time expired)

Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (15:40):  I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2011 is intended to implement various recommendations in report 419 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) following its inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997.


In its unanimous report, the JCPAA noted that there is a 'glaring gap' in accountability of Com­monwealth grants to states and territories and supported changes to the Auditor-General Act 1997 to enable the Auditor-General to access information and records relating to the use of Commonwealth funds under National Partnership payments and SPPs and auditing of that information under certain circumstances.


The JCPAA also recognised that there is an increasing use of contractors to implement government programs and services. While the JCPAA acknowledged that this practice has benefits for service delivery, it expressed concern that it has the potential to undermine Ministerial responsibility and Parliamentary oversight. The JCPAA wanted to see more accountability in this area and for the Auditor-General to have the power to audit external entities including contractors delivering government programs and services.


The bill was originally introduced by the Member for Lyne and Chair of the Committee, Mr Rob Oakeshott MP. The Member for Petrie and Deputy Chair of the JCPAA, Ms Yvette D'Ath MP moved amendments to the bill on 12 September 2011, which were agreed by the House of Representatives.


The bill, with one exception, implements the recommendations of the JCPAA report as intended by the Bill introduced by the Member for Lyne. That exception relates to the performance auditing arrangements for Government Business Enterprises.


The Auditor-General Act currently provides that GBEs can only be audited by the Auditor-General at the request of the JCPAA, the minister responsible for the GBE or the Finance Minister. The JCPAA report recommended that the Act should be amended to give Auditor-General the authority to initiate audits of GBEs.


Successive governments have taken the view that the Auditor-General should not have the ability to audit GBEs of his on motion. GBEs are subject to competitive pressures and disciplines that do not apply to other Commonwealth bodies and, to the greatest extent possible, they should be subject to the same audit arrangements as their competitors.


The Government considers that audits of GBEs should be requested by the Parliament in response to genuine public interest concerns about aspects of their operations, rather than as an incidental part of an annual work program. The JCPAA, which comprises members from across the political spectrum and can conduct hearings in private, is the appropriate body to consider whether a particular GBE should be audited.


Accordingly, the bill would allow the JCPAA alone to request an audit of a GBE by the Auditor-General. As is currently the case, the Auditor-General could ask the JCPAA to request an audit of a particular GBE.


The most important change that would flow from the implementation of the JCPAA' s recommendations will result in the Auditor-General having the power to 'follow the money'. That is, the Auditor-General would be able to undertake audits of Commonwealth partners—private sector and state and or territory entities that receive Australian Government funds to implement an Australian Government program.


The Auditor-General's powers are limited at present to an assessment of the way that Australian Government bodies implement government programs. This means that the Auditor-General is unable to assess the extent to which the individuals or entities that receive Australian Government funds achieve the purpose for which those funds were provided.


The amendments implement that unanimous recommendation of the JCPAA report that the Auditor-General be given the authority to undertake audits of Commonwealth partners, whether they are state or territory entities or other individuals or bodies.


The Bill as amended contains appropriate restrictions on the extent of these powers, particularly in relation to state and territory entities, and the Government anticipates that they will be used sparingly. For example, the Auditor-General will be able to assess the operations of a state or territory entity only after a request by the JCPAA or the responsible minister and only to the extent that they relate to achieving the purpose for which the funds were provided.


The provisions of this bill will ensure that the Auditor-General has the tools to respond to today's auditing challenges.


The remaining measures would make relatively minor changes to clarify the way that the Act operates. They would, for example, pro­vide clear authority for the Auditor-General to undertake assurance reviews and audits of perfor­mance indicators audits, which are currently carried out as audits by agreement under section 20 of the Act; and clarify that the Auditor-General's powers to require the production of documents that are the subject of legal professional privilege.


In conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the JCPAA for their report and the Member for Lyne, who originally introduced the Bill, for his cooperation in the development of the Government amendments to ensure that the amendments to the Auditor-General Act 1997 contained in this bill would operate as intended.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

(12 and 13 September 2011)



Senator Nick Xenophon,


You have shot the wounded. I am the priest whom you named in Parliament under privilege. You state your reason for doing so was the frustration you had with the lack of progress John Hepworth has in his false complaint about me to the Adelaide Archdiocese.


I was, and am, in no position to influence the timing and course of action in this matter by the Archdiocese. You have chosen to shame me publicly in order to address a matter which I have no way of influencing. Why?


I am also a victim of process. Hepworth wrote to Monsignor Cappo on 23 February 2011 (note this year)—to make a formal complaint against me. I received written notification of this complaint from the church lawyers on 3 March 2011.


For over forty years I have served with integrity and honour as a Catholic priest. I have been a parish priest, Director General of Navy Chaplains, for which service I received the award of Officer in the Order of Australia, a Vicar General in both the Military Ordinariate and Adelaide Dioceses—at 2121 last Tuesday night you irreparably smeared and denigrated my reputation. You have acted on the information of one person whom you state is credible. Time will give a different picture.


Despite your attack on my character, the people who know me whether they be family, parishioners, Navy personnel, priests, and friends around Australia, know I am incapable of perpetrating the false accusations made against me. I am innocent of these allegations which you used parliamentary privilege to name me. I have emails from Navy personnel whom I served with since 1972 affirming me as an honourable and trustworthy chaplain. Hardly the accolades an alleged serial rapist would receive.


This has not prevented those who have grudges against the church to send me hate mail. This has greatly disturbed the parish staff. You say you had a restless night—I have had many thanks to you.


I have not been charged with any offence, there is no police investigation, the Archbishop has not stood me down, I have not been interviewed by the Archbishop’s lawyers, I have a reputation of honesty and integrity. You did not even bother to find out about any matter relevant to this case except from the one source, John Hepworth. You refused the offers of the Archdiocese to give you a briefing. You never contacted me. You still went ahead to name and shame me.


This is all happening as I recover from a life-threatening illness and is not helping me to return to full health.


You have shot the wounded—you who proclaim to be an advocate of those who are hurting in our society.

I was, and am, in no position to influence the timing and course of action in this matter by the Archdiocese. You have chosen to shame me publicly in order to address a matter which I have no way of influencing. Why?


I am also a victim of process. Hepworth wrote to Monsignor Cappo on 23 February 2011 (note this year)—to make a formal complaint against me. I received written notification of this complaint from the church lawyers on 3 March 2011.


For over forty years I have served with integrity and honour as a Catholic priest. I have been a parish priest, Director General of Navy Chaplains, for which service I received the award of Officer in the Order of Australia, a Vicar General in both the Military Ordinariate and Adelaide Dioceses—at 2121 last Tuesday night you irreparably smeared and denigrated my reputation. You have acted on the information of one person whom you state is credible. Time will give a different picture.


Despite your attack on my character, the people who know me whether they be family, parishioners, Navy personnel, priests, and friends around Australia, know I am incapable of perpetrating the false accusations made against me. I am innocent of these allegations which you used parliamentary privilege to name me. I have emails from Navy personnel whom I served with since 1972 affirming me as an honourable and trustworthy chaplain. Hardly the accolades an alleged serial rapist would receive.


This has not prevented those who have grudges against the church to send me hate mail. This has greatly disturbed the parish staff. You say you had a restless night—I have had many thanks to you.


I have not been charged with any offence, there is no police investigation, the Archbishop has not stood me down, I have not been interviewed by the Archbishop’s lawyers, I have a reputation of honesty and integrity. You did not even bother to find out about any matter relevant to this case except from the one source, John Hepworth. You refused the offers of the Archdiocese to give you a briefing. You never contacted me. You still went ahead to name and shame me.


This is all happening as I recover from a life-threatening illness and is not helping me to return to full health.


You have shot the wounded—you who proclaim to be an advocate of those who are hurting in our society.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (15:44):  I present four government responses to committee reports as listed on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.


Leave granted. 




The documents read as follows—





GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO SENATE ECONOMICS COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO THE GROCERYCHOICE WEBSITE





Committee Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Auditor General investigate the tender process undertaken by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in relation to the data collection contract for the GROCERYchoice website.




Noted



The Auditor-General has discretion to exercise his powers and is not subject to direction in relation to whether or not a particular audit is to be conducted.  The Auditor General considered this matter and determined that further investigation was not warranted.




Committee Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission take more care in the future to monitor and assess the performance of contractors that undertake data collection on its behalf.




Noted



The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is an independent statutory authority.  The Government has confidence in the ACCC's ability to manage its contractor arrangements in accordance with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.




Committee Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the Government reveal its plans for an industry operated grocery price data website. 




Noted



The Government does not intend to mandate an industry-run website which compares grocery prices.


The Government notes that there has been an increase in the provision of online grocery price content by major supermarkets.  The Government welcomes this move and encourages industry to continue to improve access to accurate, up-to-date information to assist consumers to make better informed purchasing decisions.  




Committee Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Government note the unfair manner in which its contractual arrangements with CHOICE were prematurely terminated by the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, the Hon. Dr Craig Emerson MP, without affording CHOICE a right of reply, and ensure that such unprofessional and discourteous conduct does not occur again.




Not accepted



The Government met with all relevant parties, including CHOICE, prior to making its decision to terminate the Grocerychoice website.  Following these consultations, the Government determined that it was not feasible to implement the originally envisaged Grocerychoice proposal.




Committee Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that both the Government and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission note that the operation of the GROCERYchoice website was prejudicial and unfair to independent retailers.




Not accepted



The Grocerychoice website was designed to improve transparency in the grocery market and to help consumers locate the cheapest overall grocery prices and supermarket chain in their area. 


The selection of supermarkets for the Grocerychoice survey was generally restricted to those with a total floor area of greater than 1,000 square metres.  However, a small number of exceptions to this were required where a sufficient number of supermarkets of this size did not exist.  The survey was designed carefully to exclude 'express' or 'convenience' stores.




Committee Recommendation 6



Additionally and specifically, the committee recommends that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission apologise to Tasmanian Independent Retailers for unfairly comparing small independent retailers to major chain supermarkets in its price surveys for the GROCERYchoice website, thereby disadvantaging smaller operators and contributing to undeserved negative press in the Mercury on 7 August 2008. 




Noted



The ACCC is an independent statutory authority.  The Government trusts that the ACCC will make its own decisions with respect to this matter.




Committee Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigate any potential breaches of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to the role played by the Australian National Retailers Association in negotiations with CHOICE on the GROCERYchoice website. 




Noted



The ACCC is an independent statutory authority established under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA, previously the Trade Practices Act 1974).  The ACCC is tasked with the enforcement of the CCA including the prohibitions on anti-competitive conduct set out in Part IV of the CCA.  


The Minister is specifically prohibited by the CCA from giving the ACCC a direction regarding its performance or the exercise of its powers under the anti-competitive conduct provisions of the CCA.


Whether anti-competitive conduct concerns arise in the context of trade associations advocating on behalf of their members will depend on the facts of each case.  The Government understands that the ACCC has not identified any concerns under the competition provisions in the CCA with regard to the conduct of any party in relation to the Grocerychoice website.




Committee Recommendation 8



The committee recommends that the Government learn from this episode of waste and mismanagement and ensure that such inappropriate and careless spending does not occur again in the future, noting that now, more than ever, value for money for the taxpayer should be a top priority. 




Noted



The Government has confidence in the framework provided by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act), which establishes a positive and personal obligation on every agency Chief Executive to manage the affairs of their agency in a way that promotes the 'proper use' of Commonwealth resources.


Proper use is defined in section 44 of the FMA Act as the efficient, effective, economical and ethical use of Commonwealth resources that is not inconsistent with the policies of the Commonwealth.  Although the concepts of efficient and effective already encompassed the concept of economical, the Government inserted the term 'economical', with effect from 1 March 2011, to emphasise the requirement to avoid waste and increase the focus on the level of resources that the Commonwealth applies to achieve outcomes.




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 1



That the government improves competition in the groceries sector by requiring supermarkets to provide full price transparency to enable and empower consumers with pricing information before they shop, enabling greater entry to the market by independents and small retailers; and by addressing geographic price discrimination, predatory pricing and other anti competitive practices.




Noted



The Government is committed to encouraging competition in the groceries sector and has undertaken a range of measures to increase opportunities for entrants and promote competition.  To date, the Government has:


changed the foreign investment policy to extend the timeframe for the development of vacant commercial land;


clarified the predatory pricing provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA); 


provided information about the Australian retail grocery industry in international trade forums to attract new entrants into the Australian market; and


introduced a mandatory, nationally-consistent unit pricing regime to enable consumers to easily compare different brands or product sizes.  


In addition, on 16 June 2011, the Government introduced the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011.  This Bill includes proposed amendments to clarify the operation of the mergers and acquisitions provisions of the CCA in relation to 'creeping acquisitions'.  These amendments were previously introduced in 2010, but lapsed at the time of the 2010 Election.  


The Government is also working with the States and Territories, through the Council of Australian Governments, to ensure that any unnecessary or unjustifiable planning and zoning restrictions that protect existing businesses from new and innovative competitors are eliminated.  To assist in this process, in April 2010, the Government requested that the Productivity Commission undertake a study of the operations of the states and territories' planning and zoning systems.  The Productivity Commission released its report, Performance Benchmarking of Australian Business Regulation: Planning, Zoning and Development Assessments, on 16 May 2011.  The report identifies best practice approaches to support competition in land use markets.  


Further, the ACCC has announced agreements with major supermarket operators to phase out restrictive provisions in supermarket leases. Coles, Woolworths, ALDI, Franklins, SPAR, Foodworks, Metcash and Supabarn have all agreed with the ACCC that they will not include restrictive provisions in any new supermarket leases.  For existing supermarket leases, the supermarket operators have also agreed that they will not enforce any restrictive provisions beyond five years after the commencement of trading.


The Government notes that a prohibition on geographic price discrimination was considered and rejected by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics in its inquiry into the Trade Practices Amendment (Guaranteed Lowest Prices – Blacktown Amendment) Bill 2009, which proposed to amend the CCA. 




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 2



That the system of dealing with tenders by the ACCC be improved and more transparent given the curious and unsatisfactory explanation given for why Informed Sources was not awarded this tender on the basis of cost and its prior work with the ACCC.




Noted



The ACCC is an independent statutory authority.  The Government has confidence in the ACCC's ability to manage its contractor arrangements in accordance with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 3



That prior to any government-run or government funded price comparison website being established in the future, significant time be allocated towards planning, modelling and consultation so to ensure effectiveness, relevance and requirements of such a website.




Noted



The Government does not intend to re establish a government-run website which compares grocery prices.




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 4



That companies providing bids for government projects identify any potential conflict of interest and that they be required to provide detailed information on how confidentiality and integrity of the project will be adhered to. Further, that an ongoing audit of their work be carried out at random intervals throughout the project, regardless of whether an incident has first arisen to cause suspicion.




Noted



The Government is confident that the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Fraud Control Guidelines under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 provide agencies with the appropriate framework to effectively manage their contractor arrangements, including conflicts of interests.




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 5



That the Trade Practices Amendment (Guaranteed Lowest Prices – Blacktown Amendment) Bill 2009 is enacted, to deal effectively with the anti-competitive practice of geographic price discrimination. 




Noted



As noted in the Government's response to Senator Xenophon Recommendation 1, a prohibition on geographic price discrimination was considered and rejected by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics in its inquiry into the Trade Practices Amendment (Guaranteed Lowest Prices – Blacktown Amendment) Bill 2009.


 




Australian Government Response to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee Report:





Operations of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (First, Second and Final Reports)





September 2011





AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE INQUIRY INTO THE OPERATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ACT 1999 (CTH)



The Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts commenced an inquiry into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) in 2008.  The Inquiry produced two reports: the first report, tabled on 18 March 2009, covered the operation of the EPBC Act generally and the second report, tabled on 30 April 2009, covered the interaction between the EPBC Act and the Regional Forest Agreement Act 2002 (Cth).


On 13 March 2009, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the Hon Peter Garrett AM MP wrote to the independent reviewer of the EPBC Act,  Dr Allan Hawke and requested that Dr Hawke consider the findings and recommendations of the Senate Inquiry in his Independent Review of the EPBC Act.   


The recommendations of the Report of the Independent Review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the Review Report) have taken into account the recommendations of the Senate Inquiry. The Australian Government Response to the Senate Inquiry is based on the Australian Government Response to the Review Report.


The Australian Government Response to the Review Report has been released and can be found at:



http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/publications/epbc-review-govt-response.html



 







Senate Inquiry Recommendation







Australian Government Response









1. The committee recommends that the objects of the Act be amended to remove the words 'to provide for' from section 3(1)(a) and 3(1)(ca).







Not agreed





The Australian Government does not agree to amend the objects of the Act. The government view is that the objects of the EPBC Act are already sufficiently clear and that there is no need to change them at the present time. 





See also the response to Recommendations 1 and 3 of the Review Report.









2. The committee recommends that the appropriateness of a greenhouse trigger under the Act and the nature of any such trigger, should it be required, be carefully considered in light of the findings of the independent review and in the context of the government's overall response to climate change, in particular the CPRS.







Noted





See the government response to Recommendation 10 of the Review Report. 









3. The committee recommends that, having regard to the conclusions of the review of the National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation currently underway, and in light of advice from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, the government should consider including a land clearing trigger in the Act.







Noted





The Review Report, after careful consideration, did not recommend a land clearing trigger due to difficulties in defining significant impact and the existence of land clearance controls at state and territory level.  





The Australian Government agrees with the Review Report and does not support the inclusion of a land clearing trigger in the EPBC Act. The government notes that the EPBC Act already regulates land clearing which will have, has had or is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance (NES), for example where the vegetation proposed to be cleared is a significant area of habitat for a threatened species. The government proposes to include 'ecosystems of national significance' as a new matter of NES within the amended Act. This will further improve protection of native vegetation: see also the government response to Recommendation 8 of the Review Report.









4. The committee recommends that the government give urgent consideration to increasing the resources available to the department in the areas of assessment, monitoring, complaint investigation, compliance, auditing projects approved under Part 3, and enforcement action.







Noted





The Australian Government's response to Recommendation 62 of the Review Report states that it will explore options for recovering some or all of the costs of administering the Act, and that the pace and scale of implementation of the reform package will be directly determined by cost recovery. 





Appropriate cost recovery arrangements can more equitably share the costs of protecting the environment between the community and those who derive a private benefit and a social licence from an activity that is 
approved under the Act. Cost recovery will also allow environmental assessments and approvals to keep pace with Australia's growing economy.





The government will be undertaking a comprehensive consultation process on potential cost recovery arrangements in accordance with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines. This will directly inform a Cost Recovery Impact Statement to ensure that government is fully informed in taking a decision on potential new cost recovery arrangements, and on the subsequently determining the size and scale of the reform package.









5. The committee recommends that the department undertake regular evaluation of the long-term environmental outcomes of decisions made under the Act, and that the government ensure agency resources are adequate to undertake this new activity.







Agreed in principle





The Australian Government's response to the Review Report agrees to:





Further investigate a system for National Environmental Accounts (see the response to Recommendation 67)





Audit the outcomes of environmental approval (see the response to Recommendation 24); and





Establish a broad compliance and performance audit power (see the response to Recommendation 61).





Together, these initiatives will significantly increase the capacity of the department to evaluate outcomes. 









6. The committee recommends that the Independent Review of the EPBC Act and / or the ANAO examine the effect of existing bilateral agreements on the quality of environmental assessments of matters of national environmental significance.  The committee suggests 
that particular regard be given to the transparency of, public engagement in, and appeal rights in relation to assessments performed under a bilateral agreement, compared to the conditions that would have existed had the assessment been performed under the EPBC Act.







Noted





The findings of the Review Report support the continuation of bilateral agreements.  In its response to the Review Report, the Australian Government has committed to the development of national standards for environmental impact assessment and for accrediting decisions by states in relation to matters of national environmental significance. While these standards have yet to be developed, the government is committed to the principle of equivalent protection: that is, any State and Territory legislation that is accredited should deliver an equivalent level of environment protection and due process, to that which would otherwise apply under the EPBC Act. See also the government response to Recommendation 4 of the Review Report.









7. The committee recommends that the government review the interaction between the EPBC Act and the Fisheries Management Act in relation to the conservation of fish species and relevant assessment processes.







Agreed in principle





The Australian Government agrees to amend the EPBC Act to streamline the interaction between the fisheries assessment provisions in Parts 10, 13 and 13A.  The government will also improve the interaction between the EPBC Act and the Fisheries Management Act by linking the Commonwealth Fisheries Harvest Strategy Policy framework with the threatened species listing process for marine fish under the EPBC Act. The government will be undertaking a further review of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to address potential duplication with the EPBC Act. 









8. The committee recommends that the process for nomination and listing of threatened species or ecological communities be amended to improve transparency, rigour and timeliness. Changes that should be considered include:





Either requiring publication of the Scientific Committee's proposed priority assessment list or reducing ministerial 
discretion to revise the priority list under section 194K; and





Reducing the maximum period allowed for an assessment under section 194P(3).




 






Agreed In-Principle





In responding to the Review Report, the Australian Government has agreed to the establishment of a single list of nationally threatened species and ecological communities.  The Government will be working with state and territory governments to establish a harmonised listing process.





The Government supports increased transparency in the species listing processes and agrees to publicly release the advice of the new Biodiversity Scientific 
Advisory Committee (see response to Recommendation 44). 




 








9. The committee recommends that government policy regarding the use of 'offsets' for habitat conservation state that the use of offsets:





is a last resort;





must deliver a net environmental gain; and





should not be accepted as a mitigating mechanism in instances where other policies or legislation (such as state vegetation protection laws) are already protecting the habitat proposed for use as an offset.







Agreed in part





See the Australian Government's response to Recommendation 7 of the Review Report, which agrees to lead consideration by a suitable inter-jurisdictional forum of a national system or national standards to provide consistency across jurisdictions for biodiversity banking and the use of offsets.  The Government will release a policy on environmental offsets to provide greater certainty for business and improve environmental outcomes.









10. The committee recommends that consideration be given to expanding the scope for merits review in relation to ministerial decisions under the Act, particularly in relation to:





whether an action is a controlled action,





assessment decisions; and





decisions on whether a species or ecological community is to be listed under the Act.





The committee recommends that the independent review examine this possibility in the first instance, and that the process of consideration should 
include consultation with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.




 






Noted





The Australian Government regards controlled action, assessment decisions and listing decisions as inappropriate for merits review. 





The controlled action and assessment approach decisions are preliminary “filtering” decisions to determine whether the environmental impact assessment regime of the Act has been triggered, and if so, what level of assessment is appropriate.  The short statutory timeframes for making such decisions reflect the Parliament's desire for an efficient and timely process as set out in the Objects of the Act.  The government considers that there is no environmental benefit to be gained by merits review of these preliminary decisions and there is considerable risk of frustrating an efficient and timely process.





In reaching these conclusions the government notes that the Review Report stopped short of recommending a change.  Indeed, the Review Report drew attention to the fact that merits review of these decisions could slow down the process.  The Review Report also queried whether the nature of the controlled action decision makes it suitable for merits review.  The government agrees with both these points: see also the government responses to Recommendations 48, 49 and 50 of the Review Report.





The government also considers that decisions on whether to list a species or ecological community under the Act are inappropriate for merits review. As outlined in the government's response to Recommendation 15 of the Review Report, the listing process is based on an independent and rigorous scientific assessment by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. The government supports continuation of this process under the amended Act. 





The government agrees that there is scope to improve the transparency and quality of the decision-making process. This will be achieved through the implementation of the changes contained in the government's responses to Recommendations 44–46.





The government notes that the independent review process included consultation with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 










 







Senate Inquiry Recommendation







Australian Government Response









Recommendation 1, Second Report: 





The committee notes that the Minister for Environment has formally asked the Independent Review of the EPBC Act to consider the findings and recommendations of this inquiry (see letter 13 March 2009). Accordingly the committee recommends that the Independent Review consider the findings in this report and recommend proposals for reform that would ensure that RFAs, in respect of matters within the scope of Part 3 of the EPBC Act, deliver environmental protection outcomes, appeal rights, and enforcement mechanisms no weaker than if the EPBC Act directly applied.







Agreed-In-Part





The Australian Government notes that the Review Report considered the proposals of the second Senate Inquiry report.  See the Government's response to Recommendations 38 and 39 of the Review Report.










 




Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security





Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 8 - Australian Intelligence Agencies





Tabled 21 June 2010





Government’s Response to Committee’s Recommendations





Recommendation 1:  The Committee recommends that the Intelligence Services Act 2001 be amended to include AFP counter-terrorism elements in the list of organisations that the Committee reviews.



The Government does not support this recommendation. The Government has previously considered whether the PJCIS should extend its oversight to include Australian Federal Police (AFP) counter terrorism elements, and most recently advised the PJCIS in 2010 that the Government was not proposing to extend the mandate of the PJCIS to include oversight of the AFP’s counter terrorism functions. This is to avoid duplication with existing, extensive oversight mechanisms and to avoid placing an additional burden on the AFP requiring extra resources to meet PJCIS oversight requirements.


The AFP is not part of the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC) and, as a law enforcement agency (not a hybrid law enforcement and intelligence agency), is subject to different oversight mechanisms to the AIC. It is important that the PJCIS does not duplicate existing oversight mechanisms which already include a range of Parliamentary committees. The AFP is subject to statutory reporting on individual powers including telecommunications interception, controlled operations, control orders and surveillance devices. Significant external oversight of AFP activities is also provided by the legal system. In fact, oversight by the courts during prosecution and other processes is a key difference between the AFP and the AIC. 


Specific parliamentary oversight is provided by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which has the following functions concerning the AFP:


to monitor and to review the performance by the AFP of its functions;


to report to both Houses of the Parliament, with such comments as it thinks fit, upon any matter appertaining to the AFP or connected with the performance of its functions to which, in the opinion of the Committee, the attention of the Parliament should be directed;


to examine each annual report on the AFP and report to the Parliament on any matter appearing in, or arising out of, any such annual report;


to examine trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods and report to both Houses of the Parliament any change which the Committee thinks desirable to the functions, structure, powers and procedures of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) or the AFP; and


to inquire into any question in connection with its functions which is referred to it by either House of the Parliament, and to report to that House upon that question.


As well, the AFP’s Professional Standards area provides internal oversight and is responsible for all organisational professional standards matters. The Commonwealth Law Enforcement Ombuds­man maintains an oversight role in relation to conduct issues, public complaints and has the power to initiate investigations into AFP practices and procedures. Further, the Australian Com­mission for Law Enforcement Integrity is an independent and proactive agency established to detect and prevent serious and systemic corrup­tion by the AFP and the ACC. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM) will conduct independent reviews of Common­wealth counter-terrorism and national security legislation and provides another oversight mechanism. The PJCIS may refer a matter to the INSLM for it to consider as part of its functions. 




Recommendation 2:  The Committee recommends that the Government agree to amending the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to enable specific material which does not affect current operational activity to be provided to the Committee.  A small working group drawn from relevant departments, agencies and the Committee should be set up to prepare this amendment for consideration by the Government.



The Government does not support this recommendation. The current accountability framework supports the provision of candid and impartial advice to government. Expanding the role of the PJCIS by amending the Intelligence Services Act 2001, as proposed, would create ambiguity in accountability and oversight arrangements as well as duplication between the roles of the PJCIS and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS). The PJCIS and the IGIS are the two primary, and complementary, pillars of external accountability arrangements for the AIC.


The Government believes the existing division of labour between the Committee and IGIS remains sound and do not want to alter this longstanding and successful arrangement. The IGIS role is to ensure that the agencies act legally and with propriety, comply with ministerial guidelines and directives and respect human rights. IGIS provides independent assurance for the Prime Minister, senior ministers and Parlia­ment as to whether Australia's intelligence and security agencies act legally and with propriety by inspecting, inquiring into and reporting on their activities.


For more specific and operational issues, IGIS is well positioned to oversee agencies’ activities. The independence of the Office of the IGIS and the scope of its powers ensure that operational decisions, intelligence assessments and informa­tion to aid government decision making are not subject to public or partisan contention. The Government notes that the importance of the IGIS role is recognised in Recommendation 8, concerning the resources for that Office.


Under the current arrangements, the PJCIS notes that the AIC provides it with ‘significant and meaningful information’ to support the Committee’s review of the AIC’s administration and expenditure in the Government’s view. The current practices for briefing the PJCIS on delicate matters work well to facilitate this.




Recommendation 3:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Government monitor resources allocated to e-security to ensure they are adequate.



The Government supports this recommendation. The Government considers cyber security to be one of Australia’s top national security priorities, as recognised in the 2008 National Security Statement. Australia’s ever increasing dependence on information and communications technology means the Govern­ment must remain vigilant to emerging online threats. Cyber security threats pose a range of challenges to Australian Internet users, business and Government—and all systems connected to the Internet are potential targets. Australia’s national security, economic prosperity and social wellbeing are critically dependent upon the availability, integrity and confidentiality of a range of information and communications technology. 


Australia’s security and intelligence agencies have stated publicly that they are experiencing increasingly sophisticated attacks on systems in the public and private sectors. As the quantity and value of information has increased so too have the efforts of malicious actors. For example, ASIO's mandate includes working with domestic stakeholders in government and private enterprise to counter all aspects of foreign nation state espionage—including electronic espionage. ASIO has expressed concerns about the scale and reach of electronic espionage against Australian interests, both in government and commercial computer systems, as it presents resource challenges. 


The Government has allocated resources for cyber security across portfolios and agrees it would be prudent to keep this matter under review. Any proposals brought forward for additional funding would need to comply with the Budget Process and Operational Rules. A number of relevant mechanisms have been initiated since the release of the Committee’s Review. These mechanisms are intended to ensure adequate consideration is given to resources aspects, including distribution among relevant agencies:


The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) undertakes a Coordinated National Security Budget as part of the annual Budget cycle. This is informed annually by the Department of Finance and Deregulation’s National Security Funding Compendium, a self reporting stocktake of national security funding across the Commonwealth; and


In addition to these annual processes, PM&C is developing a Cyber White Paper, scheduled for release in mid-2012, which will outline how government, industry and the community can work together to address the challenges and risks that arise from greater digital engagement. The White Paper will consider the entire spectrum of cyber issues including consumer protection, cyber safety, cyber crime, cyber security and cyber defence. Part of the White Paper process will be an analysis of the current rate of effort and resources allocated to cyber-related activities, which the Government believes will further assist in fulfilling the requirements of this recommendation.




Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the medium and long term accom
­
modation requirements of those members of the Australian Intelligence Community pres
­
ently housed in multiple locations in Canberra. Where multiple locations for a single agency diminish operational effectiveness or effici
­
ency, consideration should be given to plan
­
ning alternative longer term accommodation at the one site.



The Government, in principle, supports this Recommendation, however, believes that many of the accommodation issues identified at the time of the report have now been resolved. This was achieved through the establishment of a dedicated ASIO building (due for completion in 2012), as well as provision for the leasing of a new building for ONA. 




Recommendation 5:  The Committee recommends that, should the proposal to amend the open access period of the Archives Act 1983 proceed, consideration should be given to special provisions for AIC documents to be exempted, on a case by case basis, from release at 20 years.



The Government notes this recommendation.


The ‘open access’ period in the Archives Act 1983 (Archives Act) has been amended since the release of the Committee’s Review by the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010.  These amendments reduced the open access period for most Commonwealth records from 30 years to 20 years.  While the amendments do not contain special provision for AIC documents, there are exemptions in the Archives Act available for sensitive information which warrants protection from public disclosure, including exemptions for information concerning security, defence and international relations and information communicated in confidence.  The changes to the open access period began on 1 January 2011 and will be phased in over a 10-year period. 


An Access Examination Working Group formed in 2008 has supported ongoing formal and informal consultation between the National Archives of Australia and agencies about the release of information concerning security, defence and international relations and information communicated in confidence.  The working group is chaired by the National Archives and its membership is made up of representatives from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of Defence, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police and security agencies.




Recommendation 6:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the potential adverse effects of the effi
­
ciency dividend on the Australian Intelligence Community having particular regard to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report The efficiency dividend and small agencies:  Size does matter.



The Government does not support this recommendation. The efficiency dividend is an integral part of the devolved financial management framework where agencies are provided with the flexibility and autonomy to spend the funds appropriated directly to them by the Parliament. Successive governments have used the efficiency dividend as an effective mechanism to secure public service efficiencies, thus allowing the Australian taxpayer to share in these gains. It also important to recognise the significant funding growth in the AIC over the last decade, which materially outweighs the size of the efficiency dividend for these agencies. 


In relation to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report ‘The efficiency dividend and small agencies:  Size does matter’, it should be noted that the Government did not agree to a blanket exemption for small agencies but, rather, stated that it continued to consider it appropriate that all Commonwealth entities continue to operate efficiently and make further productivity gains, irrespective of their size. It did accept that, from time to time, circumstances may arise in individual entities that magnify the impact of the efficiency dividend, and it concluded that such situations should be addressed individually on their merits by seeking additional funding through the budget process. 


The subsequent review ‘Report of the Review of the Measures of Agency Efficiency’, which was commissioned by the Government to examine the best way of promoting efficiency in government on a continuing basis, was released in April 2011. In its response to this review, the Government agreed to allow flexibility in the application of the efficiency dividend by enabling Portfolio Ministers to reallocate the efficiency dividend between agencies within their portfolio with effect from the 2011-12 Budget.




Recommendation 7:  The Committee recommends that the Intelligence Services Act 2001 be amended to include a provision requiring the ANAO to report to the Committee on its review of the AIC.



The Government does not support this recommendation. As the Committee will be aware, the Auditor-General Act 1997 sets out the responsibility of the Auditor-General to report to the Parliament. The Act also provides the Auditor-General with discretion in the conduct of his or her functions or powers (Section 8 of the Act refers). Successive Auditors-General have been responsive to requests by the Parliament and Parliamentary Committees, including to appear and discuss issues of importance to Committees. The Auditor-General supports the continuation of this practice. 


Against this background, the Auditor-General would prefer the current arrangements, which involve the Auditor-General responding to a request from the Committee, remain in place in lieu of a legislative approach, for which there is no direct precedent. The Government agrees with the Auditor-General’s view.




Recommendation 8:  The Committee recommends that, due to the increased activities of the Australian Intelligence Com
­
munity and the additional functions required of the IGIS, the budget of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security be increased. 



The Government does not support this recommendation. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Dr Vivienne Thom, has advised that the resources (including staff) currently available to her are sufficient to ensure that her Office can provide effective oversight of the activities of the AIC. She is able to prioritise and reallocate resources when inquiries arise.


The Inspector-General regularly reviews the resourcing of her office, especially as and when new inquiries are commenced. Supplementary funding may be requested if the Inspector General considers that any particular inquiry requires resources additional resources. Dr Thom has advised that, in her experience, when such supplementary funding is requested, the Government has made it available. For example, funding for the office was supplemented to the value of:


$434,000 for the conduct of the inquiry into the actions of actions of relevant Australian agencies in relation to the arrest and detention overseas of Mr Mamdouh Habib from 2001 to 2005, which commenced in January 2011; and


$40,000 for the conduct of the inquiry allegations of inappropriate vetting practices by the Defence Security Authority, which commenced in June 2011.


 


 




Joint Standing Committee on Treaties





Report 116:  Review into treaties tabled on 24 and 25 November 2010, 9 February and 1 March 2011; Treaties referred on 16 November 2010





Government Response





Recommendation 4



The Committee supports the Exchange of Letters implementing Amendments to Article 3, and to Annex G, of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) and recommends binding treaty action be taken.




Recommendation 5



The Committee recommends the Minister of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research report to the Committee on the measures implemented to address the impact of “duty drawback” on Australia's structured apparel sector under the amendments to Article 3 and to Annex G of ANZCERTA, and monitor the ongoing effects on the sector after 2012.


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (the Department) notes the Recommendations in Item 6 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) Report 116 concerning the Exchange of Letters Constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand to amend Article 3 of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, and Exchange of Letters Constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand to amend Annex G of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. 


The Department is pleased that JSCOT's Recommendation 4 of Item 6 supports the Exchange of Letters Constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand to amend Annex G of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) and recommends binding treaty action be taken.  Action to amend ANZCERTA is at an advanced stage.  The amendments will reduce the administrative burden on businesses, facilitate eligibility of duty-free entry of goods into both markets, and provide greater consistency between the ANZCERTA Rules of Origin and those of other trade agreements negotiated by Australia.  It will ensure ANZCERTA remains the benchmark for Australia's free trade agreements.


In relation to JSCOT's Recommendation 5 of Item 6, the Department notes that it is the principle agency responsible for implementing Australia's obligations as a signatory to ANZCERTA.  The Department notes that New Zealand and Australia both have duty drawback schemes.  The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Innovation) and the Treasury are the principle agencies responsible for policy oversight of Australia's Duty Drawback Scheme, which is administered by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs and Border Protection).  Duty drawback payments enable Australian exporters to obtain a refund of customs duty paid on imported goods where those goods will be treated, processed or incorporated in other goods for export; or are exported without being used or consumed while in Australia.  Innovation advises that Australian exporters are able to apply for duty refunds under duty drawback arrangements, including duty paid on imported inputs to goods exported to New Zealand under ANZCERTA.


The Department and Innovation have an ongoing commitment to monitoring the effects of ANZCERTA on all Australian industry and will continue to monitor the ongoing effects on Australia's structured apparel sector after 2012.  Innovation advises that successive Governments have demonstrated their commitment to an internationally competitive Australian Textile, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) industry.  The latest TCF innovation package is designed to provide incentives to promote innovation and associated investment to those sectors of the industry facing the greatest adjustment in the context of trade liberalisation.  It is expected that this investment in innovation will lead to the development of a sustainable and internationally competitive Australian TCF industry, by supporting the development of new products and processes, particularly at the high-tech, high-value end of the market.  Innovation continues to work with the TCF industry to facilitate the implementation of the TCF innovation package.  




Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that all future amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (MARPOL) be tabled in Parliament in sufficient time for the view of Parliament to be taken into consideration before the period for objections to the amendment ends.




Noted.



Most amendments to MARPOL enter into force automatically.  These amendments are usually technical in nature and are aimed at improving or formalising international standards.  There is no requirement for States Parties to MARPOL to ratify them or to otherwise do anything for the amendments to enter into force.  Amendments to MARPOL are usually adopted at meetings of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which are held three times in each biennium.  States Parties usually have a period of about 12 months following adoption during which time they can lodge objections to the amendments with IMO.  To date Australia has not seen the need to object to any amendments to MARPOL.  Australia has been involved in the work to develop the amendments.


The Department of Infrastructure and Transport (the Department) acknowledges that the amendments to MARPOL considered at the Committee's hearing on 25 March 2011 were tabled after the period during which Australia could lodge an objection to the amendments had passed.  The Department will endeavour to ensure that all amendments to MARPOL which are adopted at future MEPC meetings are tabled prior to the expiration of the period during which Australia could lodge an objection.




Recommendation 11



The Committee recommends that all future amendments to the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and International Finance Corporation Articles of Agreement be tabled in Parliament in sufficient time for the view of Parliament to be taken into consideration before the amendments come into force.


The Government accepts this recommendation.  The Government shares the Committee's desire to have amendments to these Acts considered by Parliament before they come into force.  As noted in the Committee's report, there was insufficient time for the current amendments to receive parliamentary consideration due to the voting schedule at the World Bank and the 2010 Federal Election.  As far as possible, future amendments will be provided to the Committee before they come into force.




Recommendation 14



The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General report to the Committee on any proposed amendments to the Commonwealth or State and Territory law in support of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.




Done.



The Attorney-General wrote to the Chair of JSCOT on 1 July 2011 reporting on the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, which contains the measures necessary for Australia's accession to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (15:44):  I present four government responses to committee reports as listed on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.


Leave granted. 




The documents read as follows—





GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO SENATE ECONOMICS COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO THE GROCERYCHOICE WEBSITE





Committee Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Auditor General investigate the tender process undertaken by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in relation to the data collection contract for the GROCERYchoice website.




Noted



The Auditor-General has discretion to exercise his powers and is not subject to direction in relation to whether or not a particular audit is to be conducted.  The Auditor General considered this matter and determined that further investigation was not warranted.




Committee Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission take more care in the future to monitor and assess the performance of contractors that undertake data collection on its behalf.




Noted



The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is an independent statutory authority.  The Government has confidence in the ACCC's ability to manage its contractor arrangements in accordance with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.




Committee Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the Government reveal its plans for an industry operated grocery price data website. 




Noted



The Government does not intend to mandate an industry-run website which compares grocery prices.


The Government notes that there has been an increase in the provision of online grocery price content by major supermarkets.  The Government welcomes this move and encourages industry to continue to improve access to accurate, up-to-date information to assist consumers to make better informed purchasing decisions.  




Committee Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Government note the unfair manner in which its contractual arrangements with CHOICE were prematurely terminated by the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, the Hon. Dr Craig Emerson MP, without affording CHOICE a right of reply, and ensure that such unprofessional and discourteous conduct does not occur again.




Not accepted



The Government met with all relevant parties, including CHOICE, prior to making its decision to terminate the Grocerychoice website.  Following these consultations, the Government determined that it was not feasible to implement the originally envisaged Grocerychoice proposal.




Committee Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that both the Government and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission note that the operation of the GROCERYchoice website was prejudicial and unfair to independent retailers.




Not accepted



The Grocerychoice website was designed to improve transparency in the grocery market and to help consumers locate the cheapest overall grocery prices and supermarket chain in their area. 


The selection of supermarkets for the Grocerychoice survey was generally restricted to those with a total floor area of greater than 1,000 square metres.  However, a small number of exceptions to this were required where a sufficient number of supermarkets of this size did not exist.  The survey was designed carefully to exclude 'express' or 'convenience' stores.




Committee Recommendation 6



Additionally and specifically, the committee recommends that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission apologise to Tasmanian Independent Retailers for unfairly comparing small independent retailers to major chain supermarkets in its price surveys for the GROCERYchoice website, thereby disadvantaging smaller operators and contributing to undeserved negative press in the Mercury on 7 August 2008. 




Noted



The ACCC is an independent statutory authority.  The Government trusts that the ACCC will make its own decisions with respect to this matter.




Committee Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigate any potential breaches of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to the role played by the Australian National Retailers Association in negotiations with CHOICE on the GROCERYchoice website. 




Noted



The ACCC is an independent statutory authority established under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA, previously the Trade Practices Act 1974).  The ACCC is tasked with the enforcement of the CCA including the prohibitions on anti-competitive conduct set out in Part IV of the CCA.  


The Minister is specifically prohibited by the CCA from giving the ACCC a direction regarding its performance or the exercise of its powers under the anti-competitive conduct provisions of the CCA.


Whether anti-competitive conduct concerns arise in the context of trade associations advocating on behalf of their members will depend on the facts of each case.  The Government understands that the ACCC has not identified any concerns under the competition provisions in the CCA with regard to the conduct of any party in relation to the Grocerychoice website.




Committee Recommendation 8



The committee recommends that the Government learn from this episode of waste and mismanagement and ensure that such inappropriate and careless spending does not occur again in the future, noting that now, more than ever, value for money for the taxpayer should be a top priority. 




Noted



The Government has confidence in the framework provided by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act), which establishes a positive and personal obligation on every agency Chief Executive to manage the affairs of their agency in a way that promotes the 'proper use' of Commonwealth resources.


Proper use is defined in section 44 of the FMA Act as the efficient, effective, economical and ethical use of Commonwealth resources that is not inconsistent with the policies of the Commonwealth.  Although the concepts of efficient and effective already encompassed the concept of economical, the Government inserted the term 'economical', with effect from 1 March 2011, to emphasise the requirement to avoid waste and increase the focus on the level of resources that the Commonwealth applies to achieve outcomes.




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 1



That the government improves competition in the groceries sector by requiring supermarkets to provide full price transparency to enable and empower consumers with pricing information before they shop, enabling greater entry to the market by independents and small retailers; and by addressing geographic price discrimination, predatory pricing and other anti competitive practices.




Noted



The Government is committed to encouraging competition in the groceries sector and has undertaken a range of measures to increase opportunities for entrants and promote competition.  To date, the Government has:


changed the foreign investment policy to extend the timeframe for the development of vacant commercial land;


clarified the predatory pricing provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA); 


provided information about the Australian retail grocery industry in international trade forums to attract new entrants into the Australian market; and


introduced a mandatory, nationally-consistent unit pricing regime to enable consumers to easily compare different brands or product sizes.  


In addition, on 16 June 2011, the Government introduced the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011.  This Bill includes proposed amendments to clarify the operation of the mergers and acquisitions provisions of the CCA in relation to 'creeping acquisitions'.  These amendments were previously introduced in 2010, but lapsed at the time of the 2010 Election.  


The Government is also working with the States and Territories, through the Council of Australian Governments, to ensure that any unnecessary or unjustifiable planning and zoning restrictions that protect existing businesses from new and innovative competitors are eliminated.  To assist in this process, in April 2010, the Government requested that the Productivity Commission undertake a study of the operations of the states and territories' planning and zoning systems.  The Productivity Commission released its report, Performance Benchmarking of Australian Business Regulation: Planning, Zoning and Development Assessments, on 16 May 2011.  The report identifies best practice approaches to support competition in land use markets.  


Further, the ACCC has announced agreements with major supermarket operators to phase out restrictive provisions in supermarket leases. Coles, Woolworths, ALDI, Franklins, SPAR, Foodworks, Metcash and Supabarn have all agreed with the ACCC that they will not include restrictive provisions in any new supermarket leases.  For existing supermarket leases, the supermarket operators have also agreed that they will not enforce any restrictive provisions beyond five years after the commencement of trading.


The Government notes that a prohibition on geographic price discrimination was considered and rejected by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics in its inquiry into the Trade Practices Amendment (Guaranteed Lowest Prices – Blacktown Amendment) Bill 2009, which proposed to amend the CCA. 




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 2



That the system of dealing with tenders by the ACCC be improved and more transparent given the curious and unsatisfactory explanation given for why Informed Sources was not awarded this tender on the basis of cost and its prior work with the ACCC.




Noted



The ACCC is an independent statutory authority.  The Government has confidence in the ACCC's ability to manage its contractor arrangements in accordance with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 3



That prior to any government-run or government funded price comparison website being established in the future, significant time be allocated towards planning, modelling and consultation so to ensure effectiveness, relevance and requirements of such a website.




Noted



The Government does not intend to re establish a government-run website which compares grocery prices.




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 4



That companies providing bids for government projects identify any potential conflict of interest and that they be required to provide detailed information on how confidentiality and integrity of the project will be adhered to. Further, that an ongoing audit of their work be carried out at random intervals throughout the project, regardless of whether an incident has first arisen to cause suspicion.




Noted



The Government is confident that the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Fraud Control Guidelines under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 provide agencies with the appropriate framework to effectively manage their contractor arrangements, including conflicts of interests.




Senator Xenophon Recommendation 5



That the Trade Practices Amendment (Guaranteed Lowest Prices – Blacktown Amendment) Bill 2009 is enacted, to deal effectively with the anti-competitive practice of geographic price discrimination. 




Noted



As noted in the Government's response to Senator Xenophon Recommendation 1, a prohibition on geographic price discrimination was considered and rejected by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics in its inquiry into the Trade Practices Amendment (Guaranteed Lowest Prices – Blacktown Amendment) Bill 2009.


 




Australian Government Response to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee Report:





Operations of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (First, Second and Final Reports)





September 2011





AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE INQUIRY INTO THE OPERATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ACT 1999 (CTH)



The Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts commenced an inquiry into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) in 2008.  The Inquiry produced two reports: the first report, tabled on 18 March 2009, covered the operation of the EPBC Act generally and the second report, tabled on 30 April 2009, covered the interaction between the EPBC Act and the Regional Forest Agreement Act 2002 (Cth).


On 13 March 2009, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the Hon Peter Garrett AM MP wrote to the independent reviewer of the EPBC Act,  Dr Allan Hawke and requested that Dr Hawke consider the findings and recommendations of the Senate Inquiry in his Independent Review of the EPBC Act.   


The recommendations of the Report of the Independent Review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the Review Report) have taken into account the recommendations of the Senate Inquiry. The Australian Government Response to the Senate Inquiry is based on the Australian Government Response to the Review Report.


The Australian Government Response to the Review Report has been released and can be found at:



http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/publications/epbc-review-govt-response.html



 







Senate Inquiry Recommendation







Australian Government Response









1. The committee recommends that the objects of the Act be amended to remove the words 'to provide for' from section 3(1)(a) and 3(1)(ca).







Not agreed





The Australian Government does not agree to amend the objects of the Act. The government view is that the objects of the EPBC Act are already sufficiently clear and that there is no need to change them at the present time. 





See also the response to Recommendations 1 and 3 of the Review Report.









2. The committee recommends that the appropriateness of a greenhouse trigger under the Act and the nature of any such trigger, should it be required, be carefully considered in light of the findings of the independent review and in the context of the government's overall response to climate change, in particular the CPRS.







Noted





See the government response to Recommendation 10 of the Review Report. 









3. The committee recommends that, having regard to the conclusions of the review of the National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation currently underway, and in light of advice from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, the government should consider including a land clearing trigger in the Act.







Noted





The Review Report, after careful consideration, did not recommend a land clearing trigger due to difficulties in defining significant impact and the existence of land clearance controls at state and territory level.  





The Australian Government agrees with the Review Report and does not support the inclusion of a land clearing trigger in the EPBC Act. The government notes that the EPBC Act already regulates land clearing which will have, has had or is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance (NES), for example where the vegetation proposed to be cleared is a significant area of habitat for a threatened species. The government proposes to include 'ecosystems of national significance' as a new matter of NES within the amended Act. This will further improve protection of native vegetation: see also the government response to Recommendation 8 of the Review Report.









4. The committee recommends that the government give urgent consideration to increasing the resources available to the department in the areas of assessment, monitoring, complaint investigation, compliance, auditing projects approved under Part 3, and enforcement action.







Noted





The Australian Government's response to Recommendation 62 of the Review Report states that it will explore options for recovering some or all of the costs of administering the Act, and that the pace and scale of implementation of the reform package will be directly determined by cost recovery. 





Appropriate cost recovery arrangements can more equitably share the costs of protecting the environment between the community and those who derive a private benefit and a social licence from an activity that is 
approved under the Act. Cost recovery will also allow environmental assessments and approvals to keep pace with Australia's growing economy.





The government will be undertaking a comprehensive consultation process on potential cost recovery arrangements in accordance with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines. This will directly inform a Cost Recovery Impact Statement to ensure that government is fully informed in taking a decision on potential new cost recovery arrangements, and on the subsequently determining the size and scale of the reform package.









5. The committee recommends that the department undertake regular evaluation of the long-term environmental outcomes of decisions made under the Act, and that the government ensure agency resources are adequate to undertake this new activity.







Agreed in principle





The Australian Government's response to the Review Report agrees to:





Further investigate a system for National Environmental Accounts (see the response to Recommendation 67)





Audit the outcomes of environmental approval (see the response to Recommendation 24); and





Establish a broad compliance and performance audit power (see the response to Recommendation 61).





Together, these initiatives will significantly increase the capacity of the department to evaluate outcomes. 









6. The committee recommends that the Independent Review of the EPBC Act and / or the ANAO examine the effect of existing bilateral agreements on the quality of environmental assessments of matters of national environmental significance.  The committee suggests 
that particular regard be given to the transparency of, public engagement in, and appeal rights in relation to assessments performed under a bilateral agreement, compared to the conditions that would have existed had the assessment been performed under the EPBC Act.







Noted





The findings of the Review Report support the continuation of bilateral agreements.  In its response to the Review Report, the Australian Government has committed to the development of national standards for environmental impact assessment and for accrediting decisions by states in relation to matters of national environmental significance. While these standards have yet to be developed, the government is committed to the principle of equivalent protection: that is, any State and Territory legislation that is accredited should deliver an equivalent level of environment protection and due process, to that which would otherwise apply under the EPBC Act. See also the government response to Recommendation 4 of the Review Report.









7. The committee recommends that the government review the interaction between the EPBC Act and the Fisheries Management Act in relation to the conservation of fish species and relevant assessment processes.







Agreed in principle





The Australian Government agrees to amend the EPBC Act to streamline the interaction between the fisheries assessment provisions in Parts 10, 13 and 13A.  The government will also improve the interaction between the EPBC Act and the Fisheries Management Act by linking the Commonwealth Fisheries Harvest Strategy Policy framework with the threatened species listing process for marine fish under the EPBC Act. The government will be undertaking a further review of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to address potential duplication with the EPBC Act. 









8. The committee recommends that the process for nomination and listing of threatened species or ecological communities be amended to improve transparency, rigour and timeliness. Changes that should be considered include:





Either requiring publication of the Scientific Committee's proposed priority assessment list or reducing ministerial 
discretion to revise the priority list under section 194K; and





Reducing the maximum period allowed for an assessment under section 194P(3).




 






Agreed In-Principle





In responding to the Review Report, the Australian Government has agreed to the establishment of a single list of nationally threatened species and ecological communities.  The Government will be working with state and territory governments to establish a harmonised listing process.





The Government supports increased transparency in the species listing processes and agrees to publicly release the advice of the new Biodiversity Scientific 
Advisory Committee (see response to Recommendation 44). 




 








9. The committee recommends that government policy regarding the use of 'offsets' for habitat conservation state that the use of offsets:





is a last resort;





must deliver a net environmental gain; and





should not be accepted as a mitigating mechanism in instances where other policies or legislation (such as state vegetation protection laws) are already protecting the habitat proposed for use as an offset.







Agreed in part





See the Australian Government's response to Recommendation 7 of the Review Report, which agrees to lead consideration by a suitable inter-jurisdictional forum of a national system or national standards to provide consistency across jurisdictions for biodiversity banking and the use of offsets.  The Government will release a policy on environmental offsets to provide greater certainty for business and improve environmental outcomes.









10. The committee recommends that consideration be given to expanding the scope for merits review in relation to ministerial decisions under the Act, particularly in relation to:





whether an action is a controlled action,





assessment decisions; and





decisions on whether a species or ecological community is to be listed under the Act.





The committee recommends that the independent review examine this possibility in the first instance, and that the process of consideration should 
include consultation with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.




 






Noted





The Australian Government regards controlled action, assessment decisions and listing decisions as inappropriate for merits review. 





The controlled action and assessment approach decisions are preliminary “filtering” decisions to determine whether the environmental impact assessment regime of the Act has been triggered, and if so, what level of assessment is appropriate.  The short statutory timeframes for making such decisions reflect the Parliament's desire for an efficient and timely process as set out in the Objects of the Act.  The government considers that there is no environmental benefit to be gained by merits review of these preliminary decisions and there is considerable risk of frustrating an efficient and timely process.





In reaching these conclusions the government notes that the Review Report stopped short of recommending a change.  Indeed, the Review Report drew attention to the fact that merits review of these decisions could slow down the process.  The Review Report also queried whether the nature of the controlled action decision makes it suitable for merits review.  The government agrees with both these points: see also the government responses to Recommendations 48, 49 and 50 of the Review Report.





The government also considers that decisions on whether to list a species or ecological community under the Act are inappropriate for merits review. As outlined in the government's response to Recommendation 15 of the Review Report, the listing process is based on an independent and rigorous scientific assessment by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. The government supports continuation of this process under the amended Act. 





The government agrees that there is scope to improve the transparency and quality of the decision-making process. This will be achieved through the implementation of the changes contained in the government's responses to Recommendations 44–46.





The government notes that the independent review process included consultation with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 










 







Senate Inquiry Recommendation







Australian Government Response









Recommendation 1, Second Report: 





The committee notes that the Minister for Environment has formally asked the Independent Review of the EPBC Act to consider the findings and recommendations of this inquiry (see letter 13 March 2009). Accordingly the committee recommends that the Independent Review consider the findings in this report and recommend proposals for reform that would ensure that RFAs, in respect of matters within the scope of Part 3 of the EPBC Act, deliver environmental protection outcomes, appeal rights, and enforcement mechanisms no weaker than if the EPBC Act directly applied.







Agreed-In-Part





The Australian Government notes that the Review Report considered the proposals of the second Senate Inquiry report.  See the Government's response to Recommendations 38 and 39 of the Review Report.










 




Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security





Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 8 - Australian Intelligence Agencies





Tabled 21 June 2010





Government’s Response to Committee’s Recommendations





Recommendation 1:  The Committee recommends that the Intelligence Services Act 2001 be amended to include AFP counter-terrorism elements in the list of organisations that the Committee reviews.



The Government does not support this recommendation. The Government has previously considered whether the PJCIS should extend its oversight to include Australian Federal Police (AFP) counter terrorism elements, and most recently advised the PJCIS in 2010 that the Government was not proposing to extend the mandate of the PJCIS to include oversight of the AFP’s counter terrorism functions. This is to avoid duplication with existing, extensive oversight mechanisms and to avoid placing an additional burden on the AFP requiring extra resources to meet PJCIS oversight requirements.


The AFP is not part of the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC) and, as a law enforcement agency (not a hybrid law enforcement and intelligence agency), is subject to different oversight mechanisms to the AIC. It is important that the PJCIS does not duplicate existing oversight mechanisms which already include a range of Parliamentary committees. The AFP is subject to statutory reporting on individual powers including telecommunications interception, controlled operations, control orders and surveillance devices. Significant external oversight of AFP activities is also provided by the legal system. In fact, oversight by the courts during prosecution and other processes is a key difference between the AFP and the AIC. 


Specific parliamentary oversight is provided by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which has the following functions concerning the AFP:


to monitor and to review the performance by the AFP of its functions;


to report to both Houses of the Parliament, with such comments as it thinks fit, upon any matter appertaining to the AFP or connected with the performance of its functions to which, in the opinion of the Committee, the attention of the Parliament should be directed;


to examine each annual report on the AFP and report to the Parliament on any matter appearing in, or arising out of, any such annual report;


to examine trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods and report to both Houses of the Parliament any change which the Committee thinks desirable to the functions, structure, powers and procedures of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) or the AFP; and


to inquire into any question in connection with its functions which is referred to it by either House of the Parliament, and to report to that House upon that question.


As well, the AFP’s Professional Standards area provides internal oversight and is responsible for all organisational professional standards matters. The Commonwealth Law Enforcement Ombuds­man maintains an oversight role in relation to conduct issues, public complaints and has the power to initiate investigations into AFP practices and procedures. Further, the Australian Com­mission for Law Enforcement Integrity is an independent and proactive agency established to detect and prevent serious and systemic corrup­tion by the AFP and the ACC. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM) will conduct independent reviews of Common­wealth counter-terrorism and national security legislation and provides another oversight mechanism. The PJCIS may refer a matter to the INSLM for it to consider as part of its functions. 




Recommendation 2:  The Committee recommends that the Government agree to amending the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to enable specific material which does not affect current operational activity to be provided to the Committee.  A small working group drawn from relevant departments, agencies and the Committee should be set up to prepare this amendment for consideration by the Government.



The Government does not support this recommendation. The current accountability framework supports the provision of candid and impartial advice to government. Expanding the role of the PJCIS by amending the Intelligence Services Act 2001, as proposed, would create ambiguity in accountability and oversight arrangements as well as duplication between the roles of the PJCIS and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS). The PJCIS and the IGIS are the two primary, and complementary, pillars of external accountability arrangements for the AIC.


The Government believes the existing division of labour between the Committee and IGIS remains sound and do not want to alter this longstanding and successful arrangement. The IGIS role is to ensure that the agencies act legally and with propriety, comply with ministerial guidelines and directives and respect human rights. IGIS provides independent assurance for the Prime Minister, senior ministers and Parlia­ment as to whether Australia's intelligence and security agencies act legally and with propriety by inspecting, inquiring into and reporting on their activities.


For more specific and operational issues, IGIS is well positioned to oversee agencies’ activities. The independence of the Office of the IGIS and the scope of its powers ensure that operational decisions, intelligence assessments and informa­tion to aid government decision making are not subject to public or partisan contention. The Government notes that the importance of the IGIS role is recognised in Recommendation 8, concerning the resources for that Office.


Under the current arrangements, the PJCIS notes that the AIC provides it with ‘significant and meaningful information’ to support the Committee’s review of the AIC’s administration and expenditure in the Government’s view. The current practices for briefing the PJCIS on delicate matters work well to facilitate this.




Recommendation 3:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Government monitor resources allocated to e-security to ensure they are adequate.



The Government supports this recommendation. The Government considers cyber security to be one of Australia’s top national security priorities, as recognised in the 2008 National Security Statement. Australia’s ever increasing dependence on information and communications technology means the Govern­ment must remain vigilant to emerging online threats. Cyber security threats pose a range of challenges to Australian Internet users, business and Government—and all systems connected to the Internet are potential targets. Australia’s national security, economic prosperity and social wellbeing are critically dependent upon the availability, integrity and confidentiality of a range of information and communications technology. 


Australia’s security and intelligence agencies have stated publicly that they are experiencing increasingly sophisticated attacks on systems in the public and private sectors. As the quantity and value of information has increased so too have the efforts of malicious actors. For example, ASIO's mandate includes working with domestic stakeholders in government and private enterprise to counter all aspects of foreign nation state espionage—including electronic espionage. ASIO has expressed concerns about the scale and reach of electronic espionage against Australian interests, both in government and commercial computer systems, as it presents resource challenges. 


The Government has allocated resources for cyber security across portfolios and agrees it would be prudent to keep this matter under review. Any proposals brought forward for additional funding would need to comply with the Budget Process and Operational Rules. A number of relevant mechanisms have been initiated since the release of the Committee’s Review. These mechanisms are intended to ensure adequate consideration is given to resources aspects, including distribution among relevant agencies:


The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) undertakes a Coordinated National Security Budget as part of the annual Budget cycle. This is informed annually by the Department of Finance and Deregulation’s National Security Funding Compendium, a self reporting stocktake of national security funding across the Commonwealth; and


In addition to these annual processes, PM&C is developing a Cyber White Paper, scheduled for release in mid-2012, which will outline how government, industry and the community can work together to address the challenges and risks that arise from greater digital engagement. The White Paper will consider the entire spectrum of cyber issues including consumer protection, cyber safety, cyber crime, cyber security and cyber defence. Part of the White Paper process will be an analysis of the current rate of effort and resources allocated to cyber-related activities, which the Government believes will further assist in fulfilling the requirements of this recommendation.




Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the medium and long term accom
­
modation requirements of those members of the Australian Intelligence Community pres
­
ently housed in multiple locations in Canberra. Where multiple locations for a single agency diminish operational effectiveness or effici
­
ency, consideration should be given to plan
­
ning alternative longer term accommodation at the one site.



The Government, in principle, supports this Recommendation, however, believes that many of the accommodation issues identified at the time of the report have now been resolved. This was achieved through the establishment of a dedicated ASIO building (due for completion in 2012), as well as provision for the leasing of a new building for ONA. 




Recommendation 5:  The Committee recommends that, should the proposal to amend the open access period of the Archives Act 1983 proceed, consideration should be given to special provisions for AIC documents to be exempted, on a case by case basis, from release at 20 years.



The Government notes this recommendation.


The ‘open access’ period in the Archives Act 1983 (Archives Act) has been amended since the release of the Committee’s Review by the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010.  These amendments reduced the open access period for most Commonwealth records from 30 years to 20 years.  While the amendments do not contain special provision for AIC documents, there are exemptions in the Archives Act available for sensitive information which warrants protection from public disclosure, including exemptions for information concerning security, defence and international relations and information communicated in confidence.  The changes to the open access period began on 1 January 2011 and will be phased in over a 10-year period. 


An Access Examination Working Group formed in 2008 has supported ongoing formal and informal consultation between the National Archives of Australia and agencies about the release of information concerning security, defence and international relations and information communicated in confidence.  The working group is chaired by the National Archives and its membership is made up of representatives from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of Defence, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police and security agencies.




Recommendation 6:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the potential adverse effects of the effi
­
ciency dividend on the Australian Intelligence Community having particular regard to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report The efficiency dividend and small agencies:  Size does matter.



The Government does not support this recommendation. The efficiency dividend is an integral part of the devolved financial management framework where agencies are provided with the flexibility and autonomy to spend the funds appropriated directly to them by the Parliament. Successive governments have used the efficiency dividend as an effective mechanism to secure public service efficiencies, thus allowing the Australian taxpayer to share in these gains. It also important to recognise the significant funding growth in the AIC over the last decade, which materially outweighs the size of the efficiency dividend for these agencies. 


In relation to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report ‘The efficiency dividend and small agencies:  Size does matter’, it should be noted that the Government did not agree to a blanket exemption for small agencies but, rather, stated that it continued to consider it appropriate that all Commonwealth entities continue to operate efficiently and make further productivity gains, irrespective of their size. It did accept that, from time to time, circumstances may arise in individual entities that magnify the impact of the efficiency dividend, and it concluded that such situations should be addressed individually on their merits by seeking additional funding through the budget process. 


The subsequent review ‘Report of the Review of the Measures of Agency Efficiency’, which was commissioned by the Government to examine the best way of promoting efficiency in government on a continuing basis, was released in April 2011. In its response to this review, the Government agreed to allow flexibility in the application of the efficiency dividend by enabling Portfolio Ministers to reallocate the efficiency dividend between agencies within their portfolio with effect from the 2011-12 Budget.




Recommendation 7:  The Committee recommends that the Intelligence Services Act 2001 be amended to include a provision requiring the ANAO to report to the Committee on its review of the AIC.



The Government does not support this recommendation. As the Committee will be aware, the Auditor-General Act 1997 sets out the responsibility of the Auditor-General to report to the Parliament. The Act also provides the Auditor-General with discretion in the conduct of his or her functions or powers (Section 8 of the Act refers). Successive Auditors-General have been responsive to requests by the Parliament and Parliamentary Committees, including to appear and discuss issues of importance to Committees. The Auditor-General supports the continuation of this practice. 


Against this background, the Auditor-General would prefer the current arrangements, which involve the Auditor-General responding to a request from the Committee, remain in place in lieu of a legislative approach, for which there is no direct precedent. The Government agrees with the Auditor-General’s view.




Recommendation 8:  The Committee recommends that, due to the increased activities of the Australian Intelligence Com
­
munity and the additional functions required of the IGIS, the budget of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security be increased. 



The Government does not support this recommendation. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Dr Vivienne Thom, has advised that the resources (including staff) currently available to her are sufficient to ensure that her Office can provide effective oversight of the activities of the AIC. She is able to prioritise and reallocate resources when inquiries arise.


The Inspector-General regularly reviews the resourcing of her office, especially as and when new inquiries are commenced. Supplementary funding may be requested if the Inspector General considers that any particular inquiry requires resources additional resources. Dr Thom has advised that, in her experience, when such supplementary funding is requested, the Government has made it available. For example, funding for the office was supplemented to the value of:


$434,000 for the conduct of the inquiry into the actions of actions of relevant Australian agencies in relation to the arrest and detention overseas of Mr Mamdouh Habib from 2001 to 2005, which commenced in January 2011; and


$40,000 for the conduct of the inquiry allegations of inappropriate vetting practices by the Defence Security Authority, which commenced in June 2011.


 


 




Joint Standing Committee on Treaties





Report 116:  Review into treaties tabled on 24 and 25 November 2010, 9 February and 1 March 2011; Treaties referred on 16 November 2010





Government Response





Recommendation 4



The Committee supports the Exchange of Letters implementing Amendments to Article 3, and to Annex G, of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) and recommends binding treaty action be taken.




Recommendation 5



The Committee recommends the Minister of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research report to the Committee on the measures implemented to address the impact of “duty drawback” on Australia's structured apparel sector under the amendments to Article 3 and to Annex G of ANZCERTA, and monitor the ongoing effects on the sector after 2012.


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (the Department) notes the Recommendations in Item 6 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) Report 116 concerning the Exchange of Letters Constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand to amend Article 3 of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, and Exchange of Letters Constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand to amend Annex G of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. 


The Department is pleased that JSCOT's Recommendation 4 of Item 6 supports the Exchange of Letters Constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand to amend Annex G of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) and recommends binding treaty action be taken.  Action to amend ANZCERTA is at an advanced stage.  The amendments will reduce the administrative burden on businesses, facilitate eligibility of duty-free entry of goods into both markets, and provide greater consistency between the ANZCERTA Rules of Origin and those of other trade agreements negotiated by Australia.  It will ensure ANZCERTA remains the benchmark for Australia's free trade agreements.


In relation to JSCOT's Recommendation 5 of Item 6, the Department notes that it is the principle agency responsible for implementing Australia's obligations as a signatory to ANZCERTA.  The Department notes that New Zealand and Australia both have duty drawback schemes.  The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Innovation) and the Treasury are the principle agencies responsible for policy oversight of Australia's Duty Drawback Scheme, which is administered by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs and Border Protection).  Duty drawback payments enable Australian exporters to obtain a refund of customs duty paid on imported goods where those goods will be treated, processed or incorporated in other goods for export; or are exported without being used or consumed while in Australia.  Innovation advises that Australian exporters are able to apply for duty refunds under duty drawback arrangements, including duty paid on imported inputs to goods exported to New Zealand under ANZCERTA.


The Department and Innovation have an ongoing commitment to monitoring the effects of ANZCERTA on all Australian industry and will continue to monitor the ongoing effects on Australia's structured apparel sector after 2012.  Innovation advises that successive Governments have demonstrated their commitment to an internationally competitive Australian Textile, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) industry.  The latest TCF innovation package is designed to provide incentives to promote innovation and associated investment to those sectors of the industry facing the greatest adjustment in the context of trade liberalisation.  It is expected that this investment in innovation will lead to the development of a sustainable and internationally competitive Australian TCF industry, by supporting the development of new products and processes, particularly at the high-tech, high-value end of the market.  Innovation continues to work with the TCF industry to facilitate the implementation of the TCF innovation package.  




Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that all future amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (MARPOL) be tabled in Parliament in sufficient time for the view of Parliament to be taken into consideration before the period for objections to the amendment ends.




Noted.



Most amendments to MARPOL enter into force automatically.  These amendments are usually technical in nature and are aimed at improving or formalising international standards.  There is no requirement for States Parties to MARPOL to ratify them or to otherwise do anything for the amendments to enter into force.  Amendments to MARPOL are usually adopted at meetings of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which are held three times in each biennium.  States Parties usually have a period of about 12 months following adoption during which time they can lodge objections to the amendments with IMO.  To date Australia has not seen the need to object to any amendments to MARPOL.  Australia has been involved in the work to develop the amendments.


The Department of Infrastructure and Transport (the Department) acknowledges that the amendments to MARPOL considered at the Committee's hearing on 25 March 2011 were tabled after the period during which Australia could lodge an objection to the amendments had passed.  The Department will endeavour to ensure that all amendments to MARPOL which are adopted at future MEPC meetings are tabled prior to the expiration of the period during which Australia could lodge an objection.




Recommendation 11



The Committee recommends that all future amendments to the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and International Finance Corporation Articles of Agreement be tabled in Parliament in sufficient time for the view of Parliament to be taken into consideration before the amendments come into force.


The Government accepts this recommendation.  The Government shares the Committee's desire to have amendments to these Acts considered by Parliament before they come into force.  As noted in the Committee's report, there was insufficient time for the current amendments to receive parliamentary consideration due to the voting schedule at the World Bank and the 2010 Federal Election.  As far as possible, future amendments will be provided to the Committee before they come into force.




Recommendation 14



The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General report to the Committee on any proposed amendments to the Commonwealth or State and Territory law in support of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.




Done.



The Attorney-General wrote to the Chair of JSCOT on 1 July 2011 reporting on the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, which contains the measures necessary for Australia's accession to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (15:50):  I introduced the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural land) Bill 2010 with my colleague Senator Milne, from the Australian Greens. I am very grateful for the work she has done with me on this bill. I am also grateful for the comments from my colleagues on both sides of the political fence, from both the government and the opposition, some of whom believe that we need significant reform in this area. I am hoping that that undercurrent for reform will eventually be reflected by legislative change in this field. 


Australian farmers produce everything from wheat to wool, from bananas to beef, from pineapples to poultry and from milk to maize. Agriculture and closely related sectors earn $155 billion a year, which represents a 12 per cent share of the nation's GDP. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the total area of agricultural land in Australia, as at 31 December last year, was 398 million hectares. But until the introduction of this bill, it was impossible to tell how much of Australia's agricultural land was owned by foreign entities. We now know that 11 per cent of Australia's agricultural land, some 45 million hectares, has some level of foreign ownership, with some 0.3 million hectares having an unknown ownership status. We also know that the state with the greatest proportion of land of foreign ownership is the Northern Territory, followed by South Australia. But I still cannot tell you what areas of land are owned by foreign entities or what sector they are relevant to. It is also not clear the extent to which either state owned enterprises or entities that have close links to state owned enterprises have ownership of our prime agricultural assets. There are a number of reasons why we simply do not know. Firstly, that data is not kept. Apparently it is not a function of the Foreign Investment Review Board to maintain this sort of information. How the Foreign Investment Review Board is supposed to assess investment proposals without this information I am not quite sure. And how the government is supposed to be able to identify policy reform needs without this insight is beyond me. Secondly, investments by foreign entities less than $231 million in value do not require an application to the Foreign Investment Review Board. That means that a business from, for example, the United Kingdom, China, India or Europe could buy a farm to the value of $230,999,000 and not be subject to review by the FIRB. If it is the United States it is over $1 billion by virtue of the free trade agreement. 


But $231 million can buy a lot of prime agricultural land. It is an extremely high threshold and what it means is that many foreign investments are made without the government ever being made aware of such an investment. We may well be selling off prime agricultural land with no way of knowing to whom and what the long-term national interest implications are of that. Indeed, a foreign business could buy a number of farms up to $231 million in a piecemeal fashion and the government would never know.


According to the media reports, the buy-up of Australian agricultural assets has become more aggressive since the global food shortage of 2008. In December last year Hong Kong based company Nexus bought a 4,060-acre property in rural Queensland for $25 million. Nexus also bought a 500-hectare property on the Sunshine Coast for $20 million last year. There have also been reports of Chinese companies with a question mark as to the extent of their involvement in or links with state owned enterprises in China acquiring dairy assets in Tasmania. A recent report named China, South Korea, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States as the buyers who have become most aggressive in their purchases. This is not a criticism of those countries at all. In fact, I think those countries are showing long-term vision for their own national interests in terms of security of global food supply. These countries are looking to protect their own food security and they cannot be faulted for that. But we have to acknowledge that our poor foreign investment requirements put our own agricultural industry at risk, particularly in the longer term. 


I should stress that foreign investment is by and large unambiguously a good thing for a small, open economy like Australia. It can provide a significant boost to our economy. But there must always be a focus on Australia's own agricultural security and long-term food security. For this there needs to be a way to monitor what foreign investments are being made to this unique and very important sector. This bill provides for that. It does not stop foreign investment in Australian agricultural land. All it does is lower the threshold from $231 million to enable greater awareness about who is buying what so that appropriate policy decisions can be made. That is a very important point that I must stress. This bill does not stop foreign investments in Australian agricultural land. What the bill does is ensure that foreign investments are properly assessed, information gathering is increased and transparency is improved, and that there must be a national interest test. 


This bill, which I introduced with my colleague Senator Milne from the Australian Greens, is extensively based on the Overseas Investment Act of 2005 from New Zealand. For a number of years there has been an Overseas Investment Office in New Zealand to oversee foreign investments. It is similar to the Foreign Investment Review Board here in Australia but, dare I admit it, Mr Deputy President, especially during rugby World Cup time, I think we have a lot to learn from our neighbours across the Tasman. It pains me to say that. Under the New Zealand regime a foreign investor requires approval from the government for an investment in rural land if it exceeds five hectares. New Zealand recognises that rural land is special and therefore any applications by foreign entities to purchase it need to be subject to serious consideration. There are even tighter restrictions if the land is near a conservation reserve or adjoins a foreshore. This bill mirrors the legislation which operates well and effectively in New Zealand. 


The evidence heard by the Economics Legislation Committee on this bill was quite instructive. The evidence from New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office indicates that they have national interest test criteria. That is something that this bill mirrors. In contrast, Australia's national interest tests are guidelines only. I think there is an issue there about the vagueness and the lack of transparency in the way the Foreign Investment Review Board currently does its work. That is not a criticism of the Foreign Investment Review Board per se but a criticism of the framework upon which it operates. Ms Toni Moyes, an analyst at the New Zealand Treasury, said during the inquiry hearing that the legislation is based on the guiding philosophy that foreign investment is welcome in New Zealand but it is also a privilege. Ms Moyes told the committee:


New Zealand has a long history of regulating investment in farmland, which reflects the traditional view in New Zealand that land ownership should not be concentrated in the hands of a few but should be able to be widely dispersed amongst the population.


The New Zealand model is robust, it is transparent and it is effective. Furthermore, the Overseas Investment Office provides extensive detail about all applications received, whether approved or not. Contrast that with what happens here with the Foreign Investment Review Board. That is why I welcome the inquiry by the Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee into the Foreign Investment Review Board. This bill does not seek to deter foreign investment; rather it simply aims to enable greater scrutiny against the benchmark of the national interest. We have a working model across the Tasman where it is effective. It should also be noted that the 200 applications a year in New Zealand are dealt with effectively and efficiently. They are dealt with in a way that is fair and on the rare occasions that there has been a judicial review of those applications the evidence given by the Overseas Investment Office is that those cases were largely dismissed; in other words, the Overseas Investment Office's decisions were upheld. 


As a result of the Senate committee inquiry it was noted that, given the difference in land size between Australian and New Zealand, five hectares is not an appropriate threshold. So an amendment to this bill has been circulated in consultation with my colleague Senator Milne. It will amend the bill so that the threshold is lowered from $231 million to $5 million. This is a monetary threshold rather than a spatial one. When the first Foreign Takeovers Act was introduced in 1975, the rural land threshold for scrutiny was $1 million 


I believe a lower threshold is important if Australia is to be truly able to make informed policy decisions about our agricultural future, and $5 million is an appropriate threshold. It is roughly in line with the original $1 million threshold, taking into account CPI increases and the like.


Farmland is not our only concern. International investors are becoming increasingly interested in the Australian water market. A recent ABS survey found that nine per cent of the water entitlements for agricultural purposes in Australia are owned by foreign businesses. But there is an issue about the nature of the survey. Whilst I welcome the survey and whilst it is an improvement on the level of information we have, I think there are some flaws in the survey. I emphasise that that is not a criticism of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They were constrained by the instructions given to them by government. For instance, the survey may tell us what percentage of land is owned by foreign interests or in which land foreign interests have a share. For instance, the study found that 24 per cent of the Northern Territory's agricultural land is either partly or wholly foreign owned. But it does not tell us what the value of that land is in terms of its agricultural output.


That defect is even more pronounced with water entitlements. There is a global figure that nine per cent of water entitlements have a foreign investment component, but we do not know what those water entitlements are. Are they, for instance, general-security water? If you look at the Murray-Darling Basin there is a huge difference between high-security water and general-security water. Owning one per cent of Australia's high-security water is much more significant than owning five or 10 per cent of general-security water or low-security water. There is a very big difference in that. These are issues that are of real concern.


The ownership of water has real potential to distort our water market. Water entitlements are not something to be played with. In Western Australia—and I note that Senator Bishop has an interest in this matter—31 per cent of water entitlements for agricultural purposes are partly or wholly foreign owned, which is the highest for any state in the Commonwealth. This is a very serious issue for farmers, who are only now coming out of the worst drought this country has ever seen.


This legislation will prevent us from selling off our backyard before we realise what we have done and it is too late. This bill will also put into legislation a national interest test based on the New Zealand model. The government currently uses guidelines around national security, competition and other government policies, the impact on the economy and the community, and character of the investor. But the test needs to go further. This bill sets out detailed criteria by which the Treasurer needs to consider applications for foreign investment. Applying these to potential investments in Australia will enable greater scrutiny to be applied. There are specific matters to consider such as whether the foreign investment will have an impact on competition, global security and market outcomes; whether it is likely to result in the creation of new job opportunities; whether Australia's economic interests are adequately safeguarded and promoted, including looking at issues of aggregation and vertical integration; and whether the acquisition will result in increased processing in Australia of Australia's primary products.


The fact is that we do not know enough about the current level of foreign investment in Australia, particularly in agricultural land, and we do not have a mechanism to monitor it. This bill will require the online publication of applications for interests in Australian agricultural land and for the status of these to be updated as the applications proceed. If the Kiwis can do it, why can't we? This process will give us the informa­tion we need about the current state of play so that we can be informed to make good policy decisions for the future.


Again, this bill is not about saying no to foreign investment. This bill is about improving transparency and increasing the information we have access to about who owns our backyard. It is about strengthening the process and allowing more scrutiny, rather than letting things go too far, when it is too late to do anything about it. This legislative framework works well in New Zealand and will significantly benefit this government's information about who owns what, where and why so that we can have a sensible, informed policy debate about this.


Wouldn't it be useful to know at the click of a button whether or not a particular company has already bought two dairy farms in one town and is planning to buy another two dairy farms, considering the impact that could have on the local market? Wouldn't it be good to enable the government to indentify that this behaviour might be having a serious impact on local Australian dairy producers? Quite simply, without this bill we will never have all the information we need to make informed policy decisions when it comes to Australia's agricultural sector.


This legislation is important. It is important to overhaul the current rules. It is important to lower the current absurd threshold of $231 million before the Foreign Investment Review Board can even begin to look at an investment. It is important to acknowledge that the recent ABS survey, whilst useful, begs more questions than it answers. That is why it is important and in the national interest, in the interests of our long-term food security, in the interests of our farmers and in the interests of preventing market distortions that this bill I introduced with my colleague Senator Milne be passed and supported by the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,31,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (16:05):  I rise to make some comments on the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010. Before turning to my more formal remarks, I just want to put on the record that twice over the past 24 hours I have taken the opportunity to read this report. It was drafted under the committee chairmanship of former Senator Hurley and the Senate Economics Legislation Committee secretariat. It is a most thorough report and it is well worth reading because it reduces to a small number of pages some of the difficult arguments that have been put around in this debate, notwithstanding the relatively small number of witnesses who chose to make a sub­mission and give evidence. It is a most thorough report and I commend it to those who are interested in this particular discussion.


One of the features of the independence of the Senate is, of course, that it provides an open forum for senators to publicly express concerns on any matter, which often would otherwise not be heard. It is a fact enabled by the lack of a government majority, and we in government and those in opposition must tolerate it. The downside of it is that many of those concerns essentially are minor and may have little merit. In fact, they may simply be a waste of time. Often we find that due to a lack of discipline and focus the Senate can become hostage to narrow and ill-informed acts of populism. So it is with this private members' bill, I must say at the outset.


It is very easy, especially for an Independent or an opposition party, to represent any narrow, sectoral view on the basis of no care and no responsibility. Yet, when the populist view is exposed to analysis, we see that it often fails the critical policy test. That is not to say that the interest represented by Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne, the sponsors of the bill, is not genuine or that the interest is not widely noted and widely supported. But the problem with populism is that it is rarely well informed of all the facts, the context or the broader considerations at a national level. So we are constantly bombarded with a load of ideas about what the government should do or should not do. That is the greatest asset, in one sense, of a democracy but also the major cause of conflict in political debate where so often fact and analysis is challenged.


We also know that the great majority of government legislation passes through this chamber unaltered. Few pieces of legislation stumble and, then, only for political reasons when opposition parties for their own interests judge that there is a significant advantage in pandering to a particular populist view, regardless of fact and analysis. The list of examples is endless, ranging from new railways—fast or slow—to turning the rivers westward or stopping Vegemite and Weet-Bix being sold to foreigners. We do understand that out there in the community there will always be some ill-founded fear of foreigners to be used in political manipulation, and governments fail this test simply because they regularly fail to sway that populist sentiment.


Opposition, however, are clearly not always that fickle, as evidenced by the bulk of legislation passed without objection. Their own long-held and researched policy position is often the same. This bill, however, is not in that class of policy, but Senator Xenophon will be able to return to his interest group and say he tried. I think his remarks foreshadowed further and different attempts. But having wasted our time he will claim his credit as well as a headline, which is the main game.


This bill seeks to seriously limit the amount of Australia's farmland which can be purchased by foreign investors. It seeks to completely change national policy and the rules which apply to all foreign investment, which have had longstanding, apolitical support. It proposes that any bid to buy interests in agricultural land of greater value than $5 million be subject to the application process of the Foreign Investment Review Board and the decision of the Treasurer. This is at least better than the original proposal to make the limit five hectares, as is the case, the report informs us, in New Zealand. Further, it requires that the Treasurer publish online the application of interest and update that information as the application proceeds. These arrangements are proposed to apply to both the acquisition of farm real estate and any interest in agricultural land, such as management rights, leases of more than five years and profit-sharing arrangements, which are common in the agricultural industry.


However, the bill, as I said in my introductory remarks, has been thoroughly examined by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and totally rejected. The committee applied the following questions: whether the current screening arrangements were inappropriate, whether there was advantage in retaining the inherent flexibility associated with a national interest test that is not overly prescriptive, how this fits within the existing screening arrange­ments for other investments in Australia and how this would impact on Australia's international obligations under Australia's various free trade agreements. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee concluded that it was essential that Australia remain a country that welcomes foreign investment, that it should continue to be an attractive place to invest, that any changes to foreign investment policy or legislation should be considered in this light and that the proposed national interest test applying only to agricultural land would effectively create two separate national interest tests. The committee continues to hold the view that the current regulatory framework for assessing investment proposals is adequate or indeed, from reading the text, more than adequate.


The committee also identified the need to maintain consistency with Australia's FTA and OECD obligations, freely entered into and repeatedly endorsed by appropriate committees of this parliament—that is, the commitments Australia has made to screening thresholds for business acquisi­tions in its free trade agreements with Singapore, Thailand, the United States and Chile and, when in force, the recently signed investment protocol with New Zealand. The changes in the bill to screening thresholds would violate our commitments under these free trade agreements. If Australia were to adopt the proposals contained in the bill before the chair, our trading partners would be allowed to retaliate. This could be in highly sensitive areas for Australia, including in agricultural sectors such as beef and others where we engage in large volumes of and receive large dollars for exports. The FIRB—the Foreign Investment Review Board—already screens foreign governments or government related entities that attempt to acquire rural land. This bill will not change that.


Having said all of that, let me supply some of the detail concerning foreign investment which underpins the committee's conclusion because the statistics that are publicly available and some of the additional materials that were supplied by Treasury to questions on notice are remarkable. Foreign investment is essential to Australia's continued economic growth and prosperity, including in the agriculture sector. In terms of the current debate and the matters raised by Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne, I think it is worth having a good look at where that investment goes.


Broadly speaking, about 30 per cent of FDI, foreign direct investment, goes to mining, around 20 per cent goes into manufacturing, 10 per cent flows to the wholesale and retail sectors, and around 15 per cent goes to the finance and insurance sectors. In 2010 dollars, these investments were worth around about $350 billion. The agricultural sector represents just 0.14 per cent of the total stock of foreign direct investment. To put it in another way, in 2010 it represented an investment of approximately $670 million out of $350 billion.  Of course, this is not the full picture of foreign investment in agriculture or, more latterly, agribusiness. But on the surface it does look like the agricultural industry is mostly Australian owned—in fact, Australian dominated; the figures in the report are well in excess of 98 per cent. 


So what are the known facts? Over 50 per cent of Australia's land area is used for agriculture. One-fifth of this area is attributed to the Murray-Darling Basin, which is responsible for almost 40 per cent of the value of agricultural production. Farmers produce more than 90 per cent of our domestic food supply. Australia exports approximately 60 per cent of its overall agricultural production volume and around about 75 per cent of its gross agricultural production value. On these figures, it is safe to assume that a great many rural and regional communities around Australia are reliant on agriculture and food production. But of course, there is more to agriculture than only farming. As well as primary producers there are wholesalers, processors and businesses that support food production. So, while farmers make up around 70 per cent of the sector, the value generated in revenue terms occurs amongst enterprises beyond the farm gate, where the value adding occurs, of course. As with other sectors, foreign investment makes a contribution. As with any investment, it provides opportunity and most importantly it provides jobs—large numbers of jobs. For that reason we should consider very carefully changes that discourage or make it difficult for investment dollars, FDI, to flow into this country. 


Senator Xenophon in his second reading speech mentioned media reports of the buy-up of Australia's agricultural assets becoming more aggressive since the global food shortage of 2008. Those same reports suggest there is growing community concern about the level of foreign investment in agricultural land. I do not doubt for one moment the sincerity of the media reports of many people's views. However, again I would caution against accepting that populism. 


There is no evidence the current law on foreign investment in Australia needs changing. We should not be pandering to simple xenophobia or disguised claims for protection. We have a market economy which farmers generally widely support, including of course the value of their land—and we had an instance of that discussion earlier today—and to which they have adjusted over recent decades of reform. In this discussion, we do need to look at both the big picture and the total picture. The government, in response to the requests for more information and accurate information, has commissioned comprehensive research of foreign investment in agriculture that looked at not only Australia's agriculture land but also, importantly, water entitlements and agribusiness. We have also asked the ABS and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, along with ABARES-BRS, to undertake a project that will give us a better picture, a more detailed picture, a fuller picture, an accurate picture, of the foreign investment landscape. 


That project, in response to concerns generated over the last 18 months, has four particular components: firstly, the role and history of foreign investment in the development of agriculture in Australia, including assessing the impact which foreign investment has had; secondly, the domestic and international factors driving foreign investment in Australian agriculture; thirdly, the various ownership structures of agribusiness firms for subsets of the Australian agriculture industry, including businesses such as meat processing, sugar refining, dairy marketing, and other high-profile sectors, and changes in those structures over time; and, fourthly, measures used in other countries for monitoring and regulation of foreign investment in agricultural land. We want to know, firstly, the role and history; secondly, factors which drive investment; thirdly, the various ownership structures present in the industries; and, finally, the value-adding that occurs in industries and changes in those structures over time. 


This important work commenced in November last year and, when completed, will inform our thinking in this area. While that is going on, the ABS Agricultural Land and Water Ownership Survey, ALWOS, has been completed. The data was released earlier this month. Surprisingly, despite media reports, the data shows that foreign ownership levels in Australia's agriculture sector are very modest. The overwhelming majority of Australia's agricultural businesses—99 per cent—are entirely Australian owned. In terms of agricultural land, 89 per cent is entirely Australian owned. As far as water entitlements are concerned, 91 per cent is in Australian hands. The results of this survey reinforce my view that this bill at this stage is simply unnecessary and not warranted by the available evidence. It does not make a sufficient case for change; although, as the government has conceded, we do need to learn more about the impact of foreign investment in the agricultural sector. 


The overwhelming impression I have—and one which has been informed by the economics report behind this bill, is that we should not yet take the easy solution of jumping to conclusions. This type of research has not been undertaken since 1984. So it is important that we get the facts straight about what is a very important debate and what one suspects is going to continue to be an important debate until the facts are researched, published and established in this area. As a country, we have traditionally been reliant on foreign capital to build and develop our businesses in all parts of the economy. It would be foolish indeed to ignore the significant risks for Australia in making changes such as these that could discourage or hinder foreign investment.


Foreign investment—it goes almost without saying, in my view—is critical to ensuring our continued economic growth and prosperity, including in the agricultural sector and the value-adding industries attached to that sector. Given the strategic importance of the agricultural sector is likely to increase in the future—and the level of demand and the level of investment that is coming in suggest that is the case—Australia's foreign investment policy settings need to be right.


This bill is pre-emptive. It does not address some serious issues that must be considered prior to any changes being made in this sector. We should also be mindful that foreign investment is only a minor matter—an important matter but nonetheless minor—in the broad policy sweep of primary production. It is a distraction with major implications for foreign investment policy and should be rejected. In due course, if this matter goes to a vote, the bill should also be rejected.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,31,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:24):  The coalition does not support the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010 introduced by Senators Xenophon and Milne. I say at the outset that, with the exception of the gratuitous attacks on the opposition, I agree with much of what Senator Bishop has just said. Foreign investment is very important for Australia—it has been in the past and will continue to be in the future. 


In terms of our economic development and our capacity to maximise our economic opportunities into the future, we are a large country with a lot of opportunities, we are sparsely populated and a lot of the important parts of our economy are capital intensive. Without being able to attract foreign investment we would not be able to properly develop all of the economic opportunities at our disposal. So I agree with much of what Senator Bishop has said. Where I disagree with him is that when public concerns are raised—and clearly in this whole area of foreign investment in agricultural land there is a level of public concern—to characterise an attempt to be responsive to those concerns as populism is, in my view, quite arrogant. One does not have to agree and one does not have to do what is asked by those sections of the community that express concern, but one should take those concerns seriously and one should constructively and positively engage in debate and not just dismiss any attempt to address those concerns as populism. 


The coalition is not unsympathetic to the underlying issues that this bill has raised. Foreign investment in agricultural land—in fact, foreign investment in general—is a legitimate issue of public policy debate. I say again: foreign investment is important. It has been important in our past and it will be in the future. The current legislative and regulatory framework is adequate to ensure that any national interest considerations are properly taken into account—and that is where I also agree with Senator Bishop. 


The report by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee—which was chaired by a former colleague Senator Annette Hurley and a great senator from Western Australia as deputy chair, Senator Alan Eggleston, whom I know Senator Bishop holds in very high regard—goes in some detail through all of the policy issues that are raised by this bill. Like Senator Bishop, I do commend this report to all senators as they are considering these issues.


The coalition takes these issues so seriously that we have established a working group to investigate options to strengthen the rules governing the sale of Australian agricultural land and agribusinesses to foreign entities. The working group is chaired by the Leader of the Nationals, the Hon. Warren Truss. Other members are senior shadow ministers Julie Bishop, Joe Hockey, John Cobb, Barnaby Joyce and Sophie Mirabella. The working group is currently in the process of examining the adequacy of policy settings and delivering positive outcomes for Australia from foreign investment. The coalition believes that foreign investment is integral to Australia's economic future; however, our policy in this area must ensure that foreign acquisition of farming land is undertaken in Australia's national interest and that the food security of our nation is maintained into the future.


The coalition, as I have mentioned, will not support this legislation. We will continue to go through our internal policy process, and we will not support any initiative like this until we have finalised those processes. The coalition, in November 2010, called on the government to commission the Aust­ralian Bureau of Statistics to compile data on the foreign ownership of agricultural land, because one of the issues that has come up in this debate is that there is a complete inadequacy of information and data in this area. According to figures released by the ABS on 9 September, as at 31 December 2010, 99 per cent of agricultural businesses in Australia were entirely Australian owned, 89 per cent of agricultural land was entirely Australian owned and 91 per cent of water entitlements for agricultural purposes were entirely Australian owned. 


It is important, as Senator Bishop observed, to have all of the facts before us as we are considering the issues around foreign acquisitions and foreign investment in agricultural land and other assets. All states showed high rates of Australian ownership of agricultural businesses, ranging from 99 per cent in Queensland to 96 per cent in Tasmania. So the problem is perhaps not as extensive as Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne might want us to believe. The state with the highest proportion of land held entirely by Australian owned businesses was Victoria, with 99 per cent of its 12 million hectares being Australian owned, while the Northern Territory had the lowest proportion, with 76 per cent of its 59 million hectares being Australian owned. According to the ABS, the survey results are broadly comparable with levels of foreign ownership collected in the agricultural census of 1983-84. So it would seem that, despite perceptions to the contrary, there has not been much movement in the level of foreign investment over the last 30 years. 


Again, it would seem that the issues are perhaps not as acute as Senators Xenophon and Milne might want us to believe. However, it is true to say that the statistics are probably only part of the story. In particular, even if 99 per cent of agri­businesses are wholly Australian owned, it would be good to know if the one per cent that are partly or wholly foreign owned are the largest agribusinesses, what their share is by volume, not just by number, and whether this foreign ownership is concentrated in any particular type or part of agriculture. Hence, more data is needed.


The coalition has called for more work to be done on establishing a public register of foreign ownership of agricultural land and agribusinesses. We are interested in getting more data on the public record about foreign ownership of land. This process must involve the states, who are responsible for land titles. This all goes to making sure that we make decisions on the facts and the figures in front of us, rather than merely on emotion. We cannot entirely ignore emotion—we cannot ignore any level of concern—but we need to respond to it properly. It should be noted that Queensland has had such a register for around 30 years. The opposition has called on the government to task the Productivity Commission with reviewing this whole issue. In particular, the Productivity Commission should consider whether the government needs to lower the threshold for notification to the Foreign Investment Review Board of rural land and agribusiness acquisitions and whether anything needs to be done to safeguard the nation's food security. These are matters that are covered in the bill, but we have concerns about the thresholds proposed and the codification of the national interest.


The bill seeks to impose a low spatial threshold of five hectares. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee report, which we have talked about, questioned the appropriateness of a spatial threshold. That the Treasurer could be called upon to make a determination of national interest on an area as small as five hectares would be unwieldy, to say the least. While it is good to see that Senators Xenophon and Milne have sought to remedy this, it does not go to our position on the bill. The proper level of threshold does require further consideration.


There is a proposal in this bill to codify the national interest test by defining issues that the Treasurer must consider. We take the view that this would actually constrain the Treasurer's discretion. Codification of this sort could also lead to an increase in litigation on matters of foreign investment. The Foreign Investment Review Board has recently begun publishing broad guidelines on some of the considerations used in determining national interest. But these remain non-prescriptive, providing guidance to applicants without constraining the necessary and appropriate discretion granted to the Treasurer under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeover Act 1975.


We think that the coalition's policy, through the working group and through the notice of motion that we have previously submitted, puts forward a more considered and comprehensive policy approach and will provide a better outcome. Senator Xenophon says he has the country's interests at heart, but there are some major areas which are not covered by this bill. For example, it does not address the impact of foreign ownership of agribusinesses, which we believe is a greater problem than the purchase of agricultural land. It does not provide the much-needed extra information, which is currently severely lacking, to make sure we can make informed decisions.


Land transfers are of course the responsibility of the states. Changes in this bill would require a major revamp of the state's databases at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars—that is a preliminary estimate. The states would of course resist these changes and expect the Commonwealth to pay up. There would be significant ongoing costs to assess every acquisition of over five hectares with some level of foreign ownership. It would require a large increase in the bureaucracy to make these assessments. If these costs were passed on to the market through fees they would add significantly to the cost of purchase.


It is true that, in these sorts of debate, we have to tread very carefully. While we have to recognise and be responsive to public concern, we also have to make sure that we have a responsible debate that is based on facts. There are significant national interest issues at stake. There is absolutely no way that we would ever be part of any push that would seek to limit foreign investment to the extent that is proposed in this legislation. Senator Bishop raised some valid points in relation to international commitments. In its report, the economics committee raised some serious concerns that this bill might be inconsistent with some of Australia's international trade agreements. I am refer in particular to evidence given by Mr Mahony, who expressed this concern:


One thing is that, while I am not an international trade lawyer, it seems to me that there are questions about whether or not this kind of legislation is at least in the spirit of our international obligations and relationships, particularly our evolving investment protocol with New Zealand.


That is kind of a technical matter. The import of that is not just a technical or legal one, which I am not that concerned about. Obviously my concern is with the effect on innovation in the region and the effect on agriculture and the Australian economy generally—its capacity to innovate.


There are various other concerns, of course. In answers to questions on notice, Treasury expanded on some of the requirements under Australia's free trade agreements. Australia has free trade agreements with ASEAN, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, the United States and Chile. Australia has made commitments relating to national treatment and its screening thresholds in relation to the business acquisitions in its free trade agreements with Singapore, Thailand, the United States, Chile and, when enforced, the recently signed investment protocol with New Zealand.


We also have OECD obligations. Again, Treasury expanded on how the changes proposed in this bill could impact on our obligations with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. As a member of the OECD, Australia is bound by the OECD Codes of Liberalisation of Capital Movements. The code seeks to promote open markets by providing a balanced framework for the gradual liberalisation of investment.


All these issues serve to bring the committee to the view that this bill may actually be in breach of national treatment obligations as part of Australia's free trade agreements. While there are some legitimate issues yet to be considered, we have to be very careful not to go beyond certain bounds. Ultimately, continuation of strong foreign investment in the Australian economy is in our national interest, subject to the appropriate national interest safeguards. There are well-established processes to assess the national interest. Let us consider very carefully how those processes can be improved, but let us not go beyond the line of what is responsible, and this bill is crossing the line.


I have touched on some of the provisions that we do not think meet the right-balance test, and there are others. This is not a piece of legislation that the coalition is in a position to support. In fact, we oppose it. In that sense, we share the views expressed by government senators who have participated in the debate so far. With those few words, I thank the Senate for its attention.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,31,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:40):  I rise this afternoon to address the new geopolitics of food, and that is precisely what this bill, the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010, is about. I am quite alarmed at the contribution of the government by way of Senator Bishop's remarks—accusing people who are very concerned about what is going on with the acquisition of agricultural land and water rights as being populist, as taking a narrow sectoral view, as being rarely well informed of the facts and as not confirming the facts and analysis. He even suggested that this is wasting the Senate's time.


Senator Bishop may wish to acquaint himself with some facts rather than maintaining the ideological position, which he outlined here today, of not wanting to actually address this and suggesting that we already have the facts. Oxfam released a report today saying that 'land grabs' are leaving poor families 'hungry and homeless'. The report says:


Around the world, including in Australia, we are observing a mad scramble for land. A growing global economy and population, climate change, food insecurity and changing diets are driving governments and investors to acquire land outside their own borders for future food supplies.


That describes what is going on internationally, and Oxfam is raising it because of massive land grabs, mainly through Africa and in the poorer developing countries.


Those land grabs are being carried out by countries that profoundly changed their position as a result of the food riots and scarcity in 2007 and 2008. As a result of the extreme weather events of climate change and as a result of peak oil and rising oil prices, as well as the displacement of agricultural food crops with biofuel crops, we had a situation of massive food inflation. As a result, countries like Russia, Argentina and Vietnam limited or banned the export of wheat and rice so as to be able to feed their own people. That left those countries that import food short of food. They had plenty of money, but they had no food. That is precisely what triggered the Arab spring. Actually, the riots in Tunisia started because people could not afford to buy food, because Russia had banned grain exports and those countries in the Middle East are major importers of food.


The result was that countries that have outgrown their own land and water resources—such as China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar—basically set out on a global land and water acquisition plan. That changed everything, because they intend to buy land and water from other countries from which to feed their own people at times of food insecurity. They will also send their own workers to those countries to produce the food and, if necessary, they will employ security forces to protect that food. For example, Pakistan has already advertised 400,000 hectares of land for sale, with a security force.


It is anticipated that we will be living on a planet that is suffering climate change, with a massive population increase. Countries now recognise that the trade system as it currently applies around the world is inappropriate. When we have food shortages as a result of extreme weather events, if countries then decide to ban exports of food then some countries will be unable to feed their own people. That is what I meant by the 'new geopolitics of food' when I stood up to speak. Australia has a big responsibility globally. We need to feed our own people but we also need to maximise our food production so that we control where that food can go—so we can put it onto the international market but also, if we choose to, we can direct it to humanitarian causes or we can respond to make sure that food is able to go where food is needed, not sell our land and water resources so that other countries, like Qatar, China, Saudi Arabia and so on, outsource food production for their own people using Australian land and water, and therefore take away from Australia's national security and sovereignty in terms of being able to make decisions about growing our own food and directing it onto international markets.


As to Senator Bishop saying that Senator Xenophon and I do not have the facts or analyses: the whole point of this bill is to get the facts—because, as Senator Xenophon said in his second reading speech, you cannot find out right now how much agricultural land and water is already in foreign ownership. That is something that the Greens highlighted at the last federal election. We called for a national food security plan for the protection of agri­cultural land, not only from foreign ownership but also from issues like encroachment from urban expansion. And we wanted to make sure, as I said this morning in relation to the expansion of coal seam gas, that we start protecting land for food production in Australia, because it is essential to us and to other countries.


That is where this bill is going. What it does is create a national interest test to be applied against proposed acquisitions of agricultural land. New Zealand has a national interest test for the acquisition of agricultural land. Is anyone saying that people in New Zealand are populists with narrow, sectoral views and are xenophobic or whatever? No, they are not. Everybody accepts that New Zealanders have a national interest test. When anyone applies to buy land in that country they have a five-hectare limit and then it is assessed if it is greater than that. What Senator Xenophon and I are saying is that, in the Australian context, if the application for land is worth more than $5 million then it should be assessed, there should be a national interest test applied. Secondly, we are saying that any interest in Australian agricultural land greater than $5 million be subject to an application to the Treasurer and that the Treasurer be required to publish online the applications of interest in Australian agricultural land and the status of the applications as they proceed. So it is not saying anybody cannot acquire land or water rights; it is saying: let's actually get the data and see what is going on.


As a result of the concerns that have been raised by the Greens, by Senator Xenophon and by many people in the rural community, the government was put under the hammer here to actually start going out to find out what is going on around Australia—and that is why, in November last year, the government asked the Bureau of Statistics to look this up, having not done it since the early 1980s. What a disgrace it is that no-one was keeping any record in Australia of that.


Senator Bishop went on to talk about national averages and so on, but let me put some facts on the table. What that ABS report said was that already 9.4 million hectares in the Northern Territory are more than 50 per cent foreign owned. I will say that again: 9.4 million hectares. In Western Australia 3.1 million hectares are already more than 50 per cent foreign owned. And what is of considerable concern to me is that a third of water licences in Western Australia are foreign owned. You have to say to yourself: we are getting into a situation here where we need to look to the future, look to the security of growing food here and exporting food.


Let me give you an example of why countries are buying up water rights and agricultural land. The Saudis, for example, used to produce most of their own wheat. But they have overused their underground aquifer; it is currently drying up. So the Saudi Arabian wheat production fell by two-thirds and by 2012 it is estimated that wheat production in Saudi Arabia will cease altogether. So this is a crisis for developing countries. And this is a crisis for poor people in developing countries because those countries are recognising that they are going to have to get food from somewhere. That is why I say it is a new geopolitics. Food is going to drive national security concerns in this century, and the sooner this parliament gets on top of that, and recognises that the current trade arrangements, the current rules, do not actually provide for equity and justice and fair allocation, the better. That is why Oxfam is out there today saying, 'Look what is going on in these developing countries; we in the developed world have a responsibility to stand up in the FAO and in other international forums and start talking about these issues.'


As to the accusation that the committee report suggests that what Senator Xenophon and I are doing somehow contravenes the free trade agreement: there is no evidence of that whatsoever in the report. It is a lovely thing to stand up and say it, but there is no evidence for it. What it says is:




The committee is concerned that the bill may be in breach of 'national treatment' obligations as part of Australia's Free Trade Agreements
 …



And then it goes on to talk about the threshold of five hectares. Senator Xenophon and I have changed the threshold of five hectares, so it no longer applies. Furthermore, it was the committee's view that it 'may' be in breach. It did not say it 'was' in breach, and there is no legal evidence to support the claim. So it is a view that it is in breach. If it is in breach in Australia, why isn't it in breach in New Zealand? Why is it that the New Zealanders can have a national interest test that applies perfectly well in New Zealand, and everybody accepts it there? It is clearly a national interest test and it does not contravene free trade agreements—and New Zealand is a party to exactly the same free trade agreements as we are. So I am very interested that that claim is being made. Also, as I indicated before, the general thrust of opposition in the committee's report is that further data gathering and research are required on foreign investment in the agricultural sector before any legislative policy changes are made. That is the whole point of the bill: to start actually getting the data by requiring that any interest in Australian land or water resources worth more than $5 million goes through this process and goes up online so that people can see what exactly is going on and so that there is a record of it.


As to the issue that we might end up with a national interest test that could be prescriptive and expose the Treasurer to judicial review, the evidence received by the committee in the case of New Zealand is that over the past five years there has been a judicial review of three decisions. In each case the decisions were upheld and in all cases third parties brought the proceedings. None of the proceedings related to a decision that was declined. So it seems to me that the New Zealand approach is working particularly well.


The next issue that was raised was that you cannot have two separate national interest tests—that somehow that is inappropriate. Well, no. Treasury said:


… the Bill also imports into the FATA an elevated degree of sensitivity for rural land which would appear to surpass that applying currently to the most significant of business proposals.


Yes, that is correct, because that is the point of the bill: to settle out separately a sensitivity for rural land, and rural land includes water resources. That is precisely why we are doing this.


To me, the issue here is that the world has changed, and unfortunately there does not seem to be a recognition in this Senate that climate change, extreme weather events and increased population pressures have altered the whole issue of food security globally. That is the fact of the matter. The trade agreements we have around the world do not reflect those changes, nor do they reflect the fact that it is foreign governments, in many cases, that are out there behind companies that purport to be independent or private sector but are actually the face of foreign governments, so it is in Australia's national interest to collect the data.


I will go to one particular example. This is in Victoria. A large investment in prime Western District farmland by the Qatar government has already occurred. Qatar based Hassad Food, which is the agricultural arm of the Qatar government, paid $35 million for more than 8,000 hectares of sheep-grazing and cropping land in Victoria's Western District. The deal includes five homesteads near Ararat and is believed to be one of the largest acquisitions of Victorian pastoral land in recent history—that is from June this year. Local stock and station agents estimate the Qatar government paid a premium of up to 20 per cent in order to secure the controversial deal.


That is the point. It is going to distort land prices in rural and regional areas because, when foreign governments decide they need to outsource food production somewhere else and will pay a premium to get that land and water, local growers will not be able to buy land. Local young people trying to get on the land will be suffering from inflated prices. We have already been through this with managed investment schemes doing precisely the same thing. It is a distortion of the market, and that has already occurred.


If you add to that a recognition that Qatar has only about 65,000 hectares of arable land, that shows why it is so keen to buy land elsewhere. That decision in Victoria this year follows its purchase last year of 2,630 hectares about 330 kilometres west of Melbourne, and the company already holds a $100 million portfolio including 6,800 hectares in New South Wales and a 125,000-hectare holding in Queensland's Clover Downs, which it paid $18.5 million for. So there are already really substantial holdings. The other thing that you are not seeing is where these companies which are the arms of foreign governments are coming and buying small lots of land. Individually they appear to be quite small, but you do not have a record across the country of what collectively or regionally is happening to land ownership.


I think it is in the national interest for Australians to know exactly what is going on but also to have in the back of their minds—it is far from xenophobic—Oxfam's concerns about land grabs globally and what it means for us in Australia to think that the most just and decent thing to do is to control our own land and water resources so that we can make sure that we maximise food production, make choices about where we grow food and put it onto the international market and are able to have control of that food. That is so that, where you have a food security crisis, you do not end up with large areas of land from which a whole lot of food is just directed back to a foreign government, essentially, leaving other vulnerable countries and vulnerable populations around the world starving.


This is why it is called the new geopolitics of food. It has now escalated to a national security issue. Right around the world, governments are thinking about this. New Zealand is one government sitting out there that has a perfectly reasonable system. Senator Xenophon and I are seeking to have this parliament move to just record data—to develop a national interest test and record data—and get the Treasurer to put that data up on the website. Then we can make decisions about whether we want to take further action to restrict or to change the current rules. But what we are proposing does not stop any foreign investment at this point; what it does is start to provide that information that the Australian community needs.


I say to Senator Bishop that he has made a very serious error and has demonstrated his own ignorance by suggesting that concerns such as this are populist and that they do not stand up to analysis. As Senator Xenophon and I are showing, they are forward-thinking concerns. We are anticipating the geopolitics of the next 50 years, influenced by climate change, population growth and peak oil, and what we are now seeing is a significant shift. We will have to put a lot more money not into armies and the military but into supporting people to adapt to climate change and increase productivity in agricultural land around the world so that we can feed people and avoid the conflicts which are inevitable unless we start to do as we are suggesting: look at the national interest and look at our own national sovereignty issues.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,31,1
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (17:00):  The Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill was presented by Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne in November last year. I notice that we have some young South Australians in the Senate gallery today who are here for a Young Labor conference. There is Dale Colbeck, who I do not think is any relation to Senator Colbeck, Guy Wilcock, Ben Rillo and Hannah MacLeod. Senator Xenophon, if I recall correctly, was a member of the Young Liberals at one time.




Senator Xenophon:
  We all make mistakes.




Senator FARRELL:
  Talking about mistakes, we have one right here—your bill. I guess we all learn things at university when we get involved in these organisations, but we hope not to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past and in particular not to repeat the mistakes made in this bill. Currently, the threshold figure to trigger an inquiry by the Foreign Investment Review Board is $231 million. According to Senator Xenophon, that figure is too high and he would like to reduce it to $5 million.




Senator Xenophon:
  The threshold for foreign ownership in China is $1.




Senator FARRELL:
  Are you saying we should adopt the Chinese system? I notice you appear on this occasion to simply have adopted the New Zealand system, although I think it was pointed out in the course of the Economics Legislation Committee proceedings that that was not an appropriate way to go and you have modified your claim to a dollar amount.




Senator Milne:
  You are being ridiculous.




Senator FARRELL:
  It is not being ridiculous, Senator Milne.




Senator Milne:
 We have not modified it to a dollar.




Senator FARRELL:
  No, Senator Xenophon was suggesting that we modify it to a dollar—




Senator Xenophon:
  I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Farrell has suggested that we modify the figure in the bill to $1 as a threshold. I simply pointed out to Senator Farrell that the figure in China appears to be in the order of $1.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  There is no point of order.




Senator Xenophon:
  He has misrepresented my position and I would be grateful if he could correct it.




Senator FARRELL:
  If I have incorrectly asserted that Senator Xenophon's proposal was to reduce the figure from $231 million to $1, I do withdraw that suggestion. I thought he was indicating that that was what China did, and Senator Milne appeared to suggest that I was proposing that to the Senate. But we have now clarified that point. 


A number of important statistics released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics make clear the situation with foreign ownership in Australia. Senator Cormann referred to these figures earlier, in his contribution to this debate. The first of those important figures is that 99 per cent of all agricultural businesses in Australia are entirely Australian owned. So we are dealing with this bill in circumstances where 99 per cent of all agricultural businesses in Australia are currently Australian owned. Only 0.6 per cent have greater than 50 per cent foreign ownership—




Senator Heffernan:
  That is a complete horseshit report. 




Senator FARRELL:
  That may be your view, Senator Heffernan—




Senator Heffernan:
  Someone has written the speech for you and you don't know what you're talking about..




Senator FARRELL:
  I do know what I am talking about. You may disagree, and you are free to disagree, and you may wish to support Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne, which you are entitled to do, but I think I am entitled to put the facts as I understand them on the table—and that is what I am proposing to do. I have indicated that the ABS reports that 99 per cent of agricultural businesses are currently entirely Australian owned, and only 0.6 per cent have greater than 50 per cent foreign ownership. More significantly, 88.6 per cent of agricultural land in Australia, by area, is entirely Australian owned. Also importantly, only 5.8 per cent of agricultural land in Australia was owned by businesses with more than 50 per cent foreign ownership.


So we are dealing with this piece of legislation that seeks to dramatically reduce the trigger point for foreign investment inquiries, but we have a set of statistics that I think make it very clear that the problem is not as great as Senator Xenophon is claiming. That is not to say we should not inquire into this issue. It is an issue that has been raised out there in the community and I am not saying we should not inquire into it. In fact there are inquiries into the issue and I think we should allow them to complete in due course before we take this bill any further.


As I said before, Senator Xenophon's original bill, which he introduced with Senator Milne, simply picked up holus-bolus the system that operated in New Zealand. There are many things that you might want to adopt from New Zealand, but I do not think their system of foreign investment is one of them. There are plenty of reasons to distinguish the Australian circumstances from those of New Zealand. One obvious one is the size. Simply because the New Zealanders chose to use the figure of $5 million as the trigger point, it does not automatically follow that Australia, which is much larger and has quite a different agricultural history to New Zealand, should adopt that same process. I have indicated that there was a Senate inquiry into this where they looked at all of these issues. I think what we can say about Senator Xenophon's bill is that it does jump to some conclusions. Until all of the inquiries that are currently going on are completed, I do not believe it is appropriate to proceed with this legislation.


Australia does rely very heavily on foreign investment. That has been the history and the pattern of economic development in this country. Senator Xenophon believes that we should reduce the threshold for consideration by the Foreign Investment Review Board but it is also possible that, if we were to go down this track and introduce this new cut-off point, it might have an impact on how other countries see the opportunity to invest in this country and might have an adverse impact on the way other countries view foreign investment. We do not want to do anything at this point in time that might discourage contemplation of foreign investment. We have seen what has happened around the world in the course of the global economic crisis. We have seen what has happened in the United States and what has happened in Europe with the levels of unemployment. When people are getting very jittery about the prospects of another recession around the world, this is not the time to be raising issues that potentially discourage foreign investment.


Any decision that we do take to change our foreign investment legislation should be based on evidence. That is the way to do it. I have already referred to what the Australian Bureau of Statistics has said are the circumstances with ownership at the moment. One of the things we are waiting for is a report that Senator Ludwig has requested. It is a report by both the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and ABARES, two very distinguished organisations. That report is due to be released by the end of the year. The purpose of that report is to deal with the role and the history of foreign ownership in the development of Australian agricultural land and the factors driving foreign investment in Australia. They are two very crucial and important issues to consider before you would even contemplate proceeding with legislation like this to dramatically change the trigger point for an inquiry into foreign investment. We have set up an inquiry. Senator Ludwig has chosen to do that. I think the most basic thing we ought to be doing is not proceeding with this legislation at this point in time but waiting for that report and seeing what it has to say.


There are a range of issues that I think we need to look at. I am sure that this inquiry that Senator Ludwig has set up will do that. Those issues include: are the current screening arrangements that are in place inappropriate? Are there advantages in retaining the inherent flexibility of the national interest test that is not overly prescriptive? How does this issue fit with the existing screening arrangements for other investments in Australia? The potential is that we end up with two systems of foreign investments, one in respect of the issues that are covered by this legislation—namely, agricultural land—and one in respect of all other investments in this country. If this legislation were to proceed and successfully pass the parliament with the support of Senator Heffernan, we would in fact have two sets of rules. There may be reasons why you would want to do that, but at this stage I think it would be indeed premature to suggest that we should proceed with this legislation without at least looking at what the impact of those two systems of financial regulation might be. Senator Milne was critical of the reference by my colleague Senator Bishop to the free trade agreements. We do have agreements in place. Those agreements have been struck with other countries based on our current foreign investment rules. We need to look at the impact that a change of the nature that Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne are proposing will have on any of the obligations that we have under our free trade agreements. 



Senator Heffernan interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Senator Heffernan, the reality is that the economic performance of this country has defied most of the other OECD countries. There are lots of reasons why you might say that has happened. One of them that we have just recently found out is that we have the world's best treasurer.




Senator Cash:
  You can't compare him with the Greek treasurer.




Senator FARRELL:
  Senator Cash, you may not like the fact that Mr Swan has been declared the world's best treasurer, but it is an indication of the things that have occurred in this country. We have not gone down the path of the conservatives. We tried to make the important decisions on behalf of this country that kept Australians in work at a time when we risked going into recession. You have only to look at what has happened in the United States and what is happening in Europe at the moment. Particularly in the United States, unemployment is continuing to be stubbornly high. Part of our ability to respond in the way we have and the recognition we now have as a country—and I do not think Mr Swan would say it is all his own work; he would want to give credit to—




Senator Heffernan:
  Peter Costello and Paul Keating.




Senator FARRELL:
  I would certainly give credit to Paul Keating. I agree with you there, Senator Heffernan. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Senator Farrell, can I have you raise your commentary through the chair, please.




Senator FARRELL:
  Thank you for that helpful reminder, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will make all of my remarks through the chair. It is a little difficult with this constant flow of interjections, and I appreciate some assistance in protecting me from Senator Heffernan. But I do agree with him. Paul Keating was a great Treasurer and he has something in common with Treasurer Swan, of course. They both won that international award. I could be wrong about this, but I cannot recall Mr Costello ever winning such an award. 




Senator Heffernan:
  He paid off the $90 billion of debt that Paul left us.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Heffernan!




Senator FARRELL:
  The Hawke-Keating government reformed the Australian economy that made all of the subsequent improvements to the Australian economy possible. If Keating and Hawke had not opened up the Australian economy, we would not be in the position we are in.



Senator Cash interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  I cannot stop him from interjecting.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I can.




Senator FARRELL:
  We have set up this report. We have gone off to investigate. I think Senator Xenophon should wait for that report to come down. There is no urgency about this issue. If he had a sensible approach to the issue, then he would wait for that report. That report will give us an indication about some of the factors that are currently driving foreign investment in this country. 


We know foreign investment under a Labor government is booming in this country. We know other countries want to come and invest in our country. They want to create jobs and they want to build infrastructure. So we know they really do appreciate that Australia is a worthwhile place to invest, but let us examine exactly why they are coming to this country. One of the other things that this report will investigate is the economic impact of foreign investment in Australian agricultural industries and agribusiness. It will review the extent to which similar countries monitor and/or regulate foreign investment in agricultural land. So all of these things are important to the future of Australia's investment climate and all of them should be looked at before we go any further with this bill.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (17:20):  It is a very rare occasion that I rise in this place and I have noticed that most speeches made in this place are valued by the time they take up rather than their content. Thank you for that great contribution in time there, Senator Farrell. I have two words prepared here as my notes. The Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010 has great merit in that we are talking about agricultural acquisition by foreign interests. It puts it on the notice board. I am chairing an inquiry which will report next year on what is going on. It needs to be put into context. We can no longer take for granted what we have taken for granted over many years. That is to do with the shrinking agricultural resources of the planet and the compounding population growth of the planet. To have the argument about how we manage that, we should get the bed stones down. By 2050, unless there is a global catastrophe of some sort, we are going to have nine billion people on the planet and, according to the science, 50 per cent of the world's population will be poor for water. All science has vagary, so obviously we will have to make allowance in any plan for that vagary. It is estimated that a billion people will be unable to feed themselves and 30 per cent of the productive land in Asia will have gone out of production. Two-thirds of the world's population will live in Asia.


The global food task will double by 2050 and 1.6 billion people on the planet could be displaced. Part of that displacement is already underway. Unless China engineers a water solution for the great northern plain, where 260 million people presently live—food production in that region uses water from the great northern aquifer—they will have to move. By 2050 the number living on the great northern plain will reach 400 million. China are engineering some water solutions. They are building a pipeline to move water which is over a thousand kilometres long, has 27 pipes laid side by side and is 4½ metres deep. They say if you have enough money, you can engineer anything. That is part of what they see as the solution. I guess one of the reasons they are hanging onto Tibet is that Tibet is a great water supply—it is more about that than anything else.


By 2070 the world will have 12 billion people, barring a catastrophe. China will have around 1.8 billion people. China is through the denial phase on their problem—unlike India that are still in denial and unlike Australia that do not even think about it. We only worry about where we are going to be in the paper tomorrow and at the next election. That prediction of 1.8 billion people in China will include a huge demographic of aged people. Based on their own estimations to feed their people, China have set aside 200 million hectares for prime agricultural production. You cannot buy land there. It is impossible to acquire freehold title in China if you are a foreigner—forget about it. But they know they have already lost 10 per cent in 10 years of that set aside agricultural production due to urbanisation and the problems of water. They are on the move globally to fix that problem as a sovereign solution to protect their sovereignty, control their destiny and control their food task. 


They are on the march on the continent of Africa. A further part of the human displacement by 2050 will be about 260 million people who live across the northern part of the continent of Africa, which will become a desert according to the science predictions. The south-west portion of Western Australia is going to fall into the same category, according to the same science. The Murray-Darling Basin has 23,400 gigalitres of mean run-off. I hear people slagging off in this chamber trying to make cheap political points about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Bad luck, folks, Mother Earth is the referee of all this. The science is telling us that Mother Earth could remove somewhere between 3,500 and 11,000 gigalitres from the Murray-Darling's run-off due to a two-degree increase in temperature. A 15 per cent decline in rainfall in the southern Murray-Darling Basin will relate to a decline in run-off of up to 35 per cent. In fact, the three years of snow previous to the last year did not actually melt, it evaporated. 


The science says that by 2050 we may have under a fortnight of snow in the Snowy Mountains. Thirty-eight per cent of the run-off from the Murray-Darling Basin comes from the two per cent of the landscape that is at the back of us here in Canberra—between here and northern Victoria. So what happens in that particular bit of the landscape quantifies what will happen to a lot of the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, if the science on the changing weather for Australia is 40 per cent right, in most years there will be zero allocation for general purpose water in the southern rivers of the Murray-Darling. 


These are all propositions, and here we are luxuriating in this chamber while trying to score political points on how to manage the Murray-Darling Basin. I do not have the time tonight to go into this because it takes me two hours to do the presentation on the planet's water and Australia's water, and what we should do about it. But we can actually fix the water problem by fixing the model for water entitlement. As the amount of water available falls, you do not have to have a sledgehammer that says, 'We're going to take between 3,500 and 7½ thousand gigalitres out of the system'—which would be the top of those variation years; you can have an entitlement system which we have now instead of a volumetric licence system. As the amount of water available in the system for that year falls disproportionately, the amount of water that has to go to the work and the freight of the river increases. You can actually model that, but no-one has bothered. They are too lazy. Every government of every persuasion, for all time, has buggered up the management of water.


The world is losing one per cent of its agricultural land every year for a number of reasons. Under the science that is predicted, some agricultural land that is unproductive now will come into production and that could include parts of the frozen continent to the north. It will certainly mean changed propositions in Northern Australia. You will have heard Stuart Blanch and Joey Ross and those people in recent days slagging the idea that somehow we can develop Northern Australia. If we are silly enough, as we appear to be, to say there are no development opportunities in other parts of Australia and the science is telling us there is going to be a decline in capacity in the south, and we all rest on our laurels, think of the past, retire to the coast, think agriculture is a mature industry and we only go to Coles, Woollies or Aldi, or wherever, to get our tucker because it is all there, we are dreaming. 


By 2050, the food task is going to double. We are going to have to use everything from GM science to smarter technology for water. In Australia, we have a perfect model for efficient water use in Carnarvon in Western Australia. I congratulate Judith Adams for being in the chamber. Carnarvon farmers are 40 times more efficient with their water use than the Ord. They are 20 times more efficient than the Murray-Darling Basin. In 2006-07, they produced $69 million of income from 8½ gigalitres of water—and some of that went to the town supply. Their pressurised root zone irrigation system is based on Spanish and Israeli technology. In the same year, the Ord in stage 1 used 345 gigalitres of water to produce the same income. In the same year, the Murray-Darling was 20 times less efficient. 


There is some efficiency that can be applied. That efficiency can be brought to bear in the Murray-Darling Basin. The episode with Cubby—and I think that is about to be fixed—was seriously inefficient. It was the model of a great idea built on the wrong scale in a river system, the Culgoa River, that has 1,200 gigalitres of mean annual flow and 845 per cent variability. They allowed them to build 1,500 gigalitres of on-farm storage, which is completely out of kilter with the capacity of the river system. That is just a little bit of detail on what agriculture is all about.


We produce 73 per cent of Australia's farm income on agriculture in the Murray-Darling basin, which has 6.2 per cent of Australia's run-off. The Timor catchment has 78,000 gigalitres of run-off, the Gulf catchment has 98,000 gigalitres of run-off and the north-east catchment in Queensland has 85,000 gigalitres of run-off—and here we are dreaming that we do not care who owns the place. If I have time I will come to the details of the farcical statistical evidence the ABS gave on ownership. It was a complete, drop-dead farce.


Here we are fantasising about locking up the north when we know that Bangladesh is half its size. Cape York Peninsula is 17½ million hectares. If you take out the coastal communities, there are approximately 14,000 people, 12,000 Indigenous, living in an area the size of Victoria. There are 800,000-odd feral pigs there, 20,000 to 30,000 untagged feral cattle and about 14 to 17 pastoral stations. The rest is either sit-down blackfella country—I can say that because they are all my mates; and I am a whitefella to them—or destined for World Heritage listing.


To his credit, Peter Beattie told me, when I was in the process of chairing the Traveston Dam inquiry—and, by the way, it was a shit of a site for a dam, and he knew it—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Senator Heffernan—




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I retract whatever it is you want me to retract.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You know what you said and I am asking you to retract it.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I retract it. I had better not say 'bugger'. It was a 'not a very nice' site. He said, 'Look, Bill, I've got to get the inner-city preferences'—this was two elections ago in Brisbane—'so I've done a deal with the Wilderness Society to enact the wild rivers legislation.' The wild rivers legislation locks up the first kilometre on either side of all those rivers all the way up Cape York Peninsula—17½ million hectares. The average annual wildfire there burns five million hectares. The biggest wildfire they have had burned 11 million hectares. It is a soft entry point into Australia for foot and mouth disease because of all those feral pigs. We are fantasising about locking it up. So the opportunity for Indigenous people up there will not be economic agricultural production for the first kilometre, which is just as good as any riverbed or floodplain down the Murrumbidgee. No, we are saying: 'What we want your opportunity to be perhaps is tourism. You can get your picture taken standing on a stone with a spear for the tourists.' That is what we are saying to our Indigenous people. And bear in mind that there are still approximately 7½ thousand kids in the Northern Territory who do not have a bloody high school to go to. What sort of a disgrace is that?


Go to Bangladesh and try to explain that to the people in Bangladesh. It is predicted that 1.6 billion people on the planet will be displaced by 2070. If the science is only 10 per cent right, that is 160 million people. Bangladesh has 160 million people who live in an area half the size of Cape York Peninsula. Fifty-seven rivers flow into Bangladesh, 54 of them out of India. India is mining the water that comes all the way along the Ganges—right down. India is still in denial. If the sea rises just under a metre and India continues to mine the groundwater which becomes the river water for Bangladesh, by 2050 those people are going to have to move because they are going to be inundated and lose their freshwater—and here we are fantasising about not developing anything in the north.


The CSIRO were not allowed to consider storing or damming water, but that was not because they could not do it. Better than anyone in this chamber, I understand the science of what is happening up there. The bulk of the water falls to the bottom of the catchment, unlike the catchments down here where the water falls to the top of the catchment. It is an event based thing, but you can recharge sandbed aquifers—the Gilbert River west of Georgetown was pegged out for irrigation in 1957.


We have all said: 'Oh, no, it's too hot to go up there. And it's too far away from the market.' Where's the best place to be on a hot day? In the cab of a tractor. It is better than the airconditioning in the house. Why do we think we are we too far from the market? Because we are looking in the wrong direction. Two-thirds of the world's population are just over the water. Two-thirds of the world's population are closer to Darwin than they are to Sydney.


So here we are thinking that somehow we are going to flog through with what we have got. No-one is listening to the science in this debate about agricultural land acquisition. We were briefed the other night by the ABS, and I took the trouble to ring them. As they will tell you, the game has changed. I have heard all these political speeches today—mostly prepared notes that someone else has written for them—but no-one is giving consideration to the seismic change that is occurring in the world through the loss of sovereignty through modern communication, transport, free trade agreements and all the rest of it. And that was my point to Senator Farrell on the free-trade agreements: we gave away a five per cent and a 15 per cent tariff in the American free-trade agreement and imposed a 45 per cent tariff. In 2004, when that was agreed to, we were at 67c to the US dollar. When it was enacted, in January 2005, we were at 70c. We now have a 45 per cent tariff against us on our terms of trade, yet we gave away a five per cent tariff. It is all stupid.


It is premature, this bill. I am sorry, Senator Xenophon, but it is premature. Let's get everyone educated as to what the problem is and let's have a strategic view in Australia of where we are going to be in 50 years time and in 80 years time. Let me give you some suggestions on that. There needs to be true definition of the difference between foreign sovereign acquisition—and the ABS will tell you this if you go and talk to them—and foreign capital. I do not care about foreign capital coming into agriculture because it has been coming in for yonks. Traditionally what happens with foreign capital is that they come in, invest, feel good about it and then strike the variability of our seasons and its impact on production. Next, all their directors want a bonus, overtime and all the rest of it and then they go broke and they pack up and leave. It always happens. They all do it. One of the great institutions of Australia, the family farm, keeps the job going because we do not pay ourselves overtime. 


Why shouldn't we be thinking, 'Let's sell our production into the doubling of the world food task by 2050 rather than sell our means of production'? I am sorry to have to use a note at this stage, but I will just quote ABARES talking about who owns the place. This is from the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill. First there are some comments from Alan Hill, the Director of Policy for the Western Australian Farmers Federation, then the report goes on:


ABARES also noted that there is currently no database of ownership of Australian agricultural land—


this is only a few weeks ago—


It informed the committee that Queensland is the only State that collects this type of information:


Senator HEFFERNAN—Firstly, would it be fair to say for your organisation—


this is ABARES; they advise the government—


that we really do not know who owns the agricultural land in Australia?


Mr Morris—Yes.


The ABS thing is a political cover. We were briefed on it.


You know what they did? They sent out 11,000 forms based on the ATO's ABN register of agricultural interests. They did not pick up Shenhua, who bought a big lump of country around their mine to shut all the cockies up. They did not pick up all the blind trusts through the Cayman Islands. They did not pick up the sovereign wealth funds where reporting is compulsory but not mandatory. Some of these sovereign funds have all sorts of blind operations. No, we do not know about the sovereign acquisitions. 


The greatest threat to Australia's sovereignty, as Mick Kelty pointed out a few years ago—no-one took any notice—is the effect of climate change and human displacement. The greatest threat now—and if you dig down into ABS, they will tell you—is the concept of sovereignty being displaced because of sovereign wealth funds. The sovereign wealth funds of some countries are acquiring the sovereign wealth of other countries—and excluding those countries from access to their own wealth. That is going to happen—places like China, to their credit, are aware of the future food problem they are facing and they are busily doing this. 


If you go back to the ABS thing, the database—guess what? They started with farms that had an income of $5,000. So farms with an income of only $5,000—that could be any of these toy farms around Canberra here—were included in the schedule as some sort of commercial agricultural production. You have to have income of between $30,000 and $50,000 to be able to get a GST return—$5,000 is meaningless. Yet, in the statistical database, the model includes anything that earns $5,000. This has the capacity to completely distort the figures. This is a phoney—I am sorry to have to say that, but it is—statistical, political tool. It is meaningless. Hopefully, when the inquiry that I am going to chair gets going, we will deal with the facts rather than the political fantasy involved behind protecting a government—whoever the government might be after the next election. 


I am interested, and all of Australia's farmers are interested, in where we are going to be in 50 or 80 years time. We do not want to leave the farm to a foreign interest if we can avoid it. But you cannot blame the cocky who wants to get out— (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:41):  I was quite enjoying Senator Heffernan's speech. I acknowledge that he is one of the few people in this parliament who has direct experience in this field. He also, I think, provides an important analysis that is largely lacking in what we get from the rest of the chamber. The only strong disagreement I had with Senator Heffernan's speech was with his faith that, if we go after the north, we will not simply make the same mistakes we have been making for 100 years. I think that difference is probably fairly well understood. 


The other thing that Senator Heffernan said was that this bill is premature. I thought what we just heard from Senator Heffernan was a ringing endorsement of exactly why this bill should be brought on today and I will be sorry to see him sitting on the other side of the chamber when we come to a vote, because, with a few exceptions such as Senator Heffernan, all we hear is the polar opposite point of view. We heard that polar opposite view from our Western Australian colleague Senator Mark Bishop a little bit earlier on in the debate. He just waved his hands and said: 'This is all good. Sell off the country as rapidly as possible with as little consideration, as little oversight, as possible.' That is, perhaps, a rather brutal paraphrasing of Senator Bishop. There was nothing in that speech at all that paid regard to the concerns that we are bringing to the table. We see it in the mismanagement of the mining boom under successive governments and we see it in the way foreign acquisitions of agricult­ural land in Australia are handled. 


I would like to congratulate Senators Milne and Xenophon for bringing this bill forward. It is not a barrier to free trade and it is not a barrier to foreign investment—that is not what we are proposing here. The bill seeks to implement some fairly common-sense changes to the legislative regime governing foreign acquisitions in this country—to strengthen protections of the national interest, to better define what we mean by that and to better equip legislators for decision making.


The major parties, apart from a few honourable exceptions, have not demon­strated any recognition at all of the challenges facing Australia with regard to investment by foreign entities or of the long-term problems that this parliament could face because other countries around the world are playing a longer game than us. The Chinese are playing a 100-year game. We are doing something completely different—we are governing in the interests of the next quarterly report or the next three-year electoral cycle. Other countries around the world are engaged in a deadly serious contest over resources, a contest to which Australia seems to simply insist on wearing a blindfold.


That is why it is important that we have the crossbenches, at least, putting some of these ideas into the public domain—there is precious little innovation coming from anywhere else. Foreign investment can have very positive economic effects, but with these come political consequences—they come with impacts on corporate governance, risks to competition and risks, perhaps most importantly, to food security. I think that each of these things should be strongly considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board before approvals for investments above a certain threshold are granted. Four per cent of our continent is considered good farming land and yet 45 million hectares of it has some level of foreign ownership. Eleven per cent of Australia's agricultural land has some level of foreign ownership and we cannot say where it is or what sectors it affects. One of the things that Senator Milne pointed out is that 31 per cent of Western Australia's water resources are foreign owned. I am simply raising something like that—a third of Western Australia's water resources, in the driest inhabited continent on the planet—to point out that perhaps we might want to introduce some kind of threshold test, some kind of mapping exercise, to work out who has bought it and where the ownership lies but we are accused of xenophobia. I find that counteraccusation absolutely offensive. This is not about xenophobia. It is about basic industry policy and good practice about knowing. If we are insisting on selling the farm, let us at least find out who we are selling it to.


The lack of information about the sectors affected is particularly problematic, because it opens up the possibility of a company or companies from one country completely dominating a particular section of Australian agriculture and cornering the market. Imagine if one foreign company or companies from one country owned, for example, all of Australia's banana plantations or all of Australia's orange groves. Without information about which farming land and what sectors of Australian agriculture are foreign owned, how can FIRB properly assess new investment proposals? How can we in this place and policy makers at all levels of government respond to growing foreign ownership without knowing where it is and what it entails? These are quite serious questions.


At the moment I think FIRB needs to monitor in particular a country's interest in specific sectors to make sure that various markets are not being cornered, to ensure that creeping acquisitions are not taking place which would quite negatively impact on our economy and on the ability of Australian companies to do business and employ Australians. According to Treasury, and this is something that I have spent a bit of time working on not necessarily just in the agricultural context, Australia's Foreign Investment Policy states:


The Government's approach to foreign investment policy is to encourage foreign investment consistent with community interests.


And:


The Government determines what is 'contrary to the national interest' by having regard to the widely held community concerns of Australians.


In 2008, the Treasurer released a set of six principles that are considered by FIRB in determining, on a case by case basis, whether particular investments by foreign governments and their agencies are consistent with Australia's 'national interest'. I will sketch what they are. FIRB needs to consider the following:


An investor's operations are independent from the relevant foreign government;


An investor is subject to and adheres to the law and observes common standards of business behaviour;


An investment may hinder competition or lead to undue concentration or control in the industry or sectors concerned;


An investment may impact on Australian Government revenue or other policies;


An investment may impact on Australia's national security; 


An investment may impact on the operations and directions of an Australian business, as well as its contribution to the Australian economy and broader community.


They are so broadly framed that I think they leave an awful lot to be desired and they need to be stricter and more explanation needs to be given to each criterion to ensure that a sharper assessment is made of what we mean by Australia's 'national interest', rather than having this ideological assumption that all investment from anywhere at all is good without considering the strategic implications or some of the strategic plans that other countries who take a longer view of things are obviously putting into play. 


Australian policy makers appear to have this innocent assumption that the market will provide and the market will look after us—and it will really won't. I think the guidelines should be incorporated into relevant legislation as to things like an investor's operations that are independent from the relevant foreign government. This is the issue that Senator Heffernan was speaking of: sovereign wealth funds or large industrial combines that are effectively owned and run by the Chinese government, to give just one example. They are playing a brand of capitalism different from what we play in Australia and from what we perhaps expect other countries to play.


The current threshold under which private foreign purchases of land in Australia need not be declared is an extraordinary $231 million. That is an enormous sum of money that can buy a vast amount of farming land. Until 1989 the threshold was $1 million. I know the cost of land has appreciated significantly since then, but not by 23,000 per cent. That has not been the increase. The threshold has, in fact, increased by 23,000 per cent if you take 1989 as your base year. That is an absurdly high threshold. It means we do not know what is going on. A foreign company or private citizen can purchase that much worth of farming land and then another and then another—ad nauseam—without the investments being declared or subject to a review by FIRB. So with these kinds of jigsaw acquisitions we are left in a position where enormous tracts of Australian farming land can be bought up.


Senator Milne pointed out, I think very strongly in her contribution to this debate, that this is not only an Australian problem necessarily; this is happening all over the world. Countries are looking just a little bit further down the kerb to see what food insecurity really means and are buying up farming land all over the world and essentially outsourcing their food-growing task. That is having serious implications on the food sovereignty of various countries around the world where access to decent food is simply not guaranteed. In Australia I think we do ourselves an enormous disservice by imagining that we should simply sit back and let this happen, as though we were some kind of Third World country with weak governance and no sense of strategy or industry policy. So I think one of the first things that we need is a lower cap on purchases not subject to declaration and review, to bring more of these acquisitions into question over some form of national interest test. We need data on foreign purchases of Australian farming land properly collated and retained and we need the weak guidelines to be strengthened and entrenched in law. New Zealand has a five-hectare threshold. Obviously, it is a smaller country but they have a five-hectare threshold and extensive data collation on foreign ownership of farm land. It has had no discernible detrimental impact on investment. That is the right thing for us to do now. It is the right thing to do for generations to come. This is not an anti-free-trade measure. This is a commonsense 'let's work out what's actually going on' measure. Our economic wellbeing and our food security absolutely depend on it.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:51):  I rise to speak against the private member's bill on foreign acquisitions of agricultural land sponsored by Senator Xenophon. From public discussion it is quite evident there are concerns from the community and, indeed, a level of apprehension about the level of foreign ownership and the level of foreign acquisitions of agricultural land. However, the government must remain responsible in their actions in dealing with this matter. As the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Bill Shorten, stated in the Weekend Australian on 10 September:


It is vital we protect the national interest and continue to strike the right balance between attracting foreign investment and ensuring agricultural and food security.


I think this is an eminently sensible view from the Assistant Treasurer and this is something that all Australians would like to see as the right outcome in regards to foreign acquisitions of agricultural land. That is why the government should not jump the gun in making significant changes without an adequate picture of the current impact of foreign investment in Australian agricultural land.


The push for regulation seems to be merely based on concerns and not on substantive data, obviously because of the limited data that has been available. The debate requires clear thinking for the government to get a full, historic and current picture of foreign investments in Australian agricultural land. It is greatly recognised that Australia has been able to benefit from foreign investments in all sectors of the economy, and making changes that potentially could discourage foreign investment would not be a smart move by any government. I know all Australians understand that foreign and domestic investment in Australia is vitally important to the economy. These investments support local jobs, economic growth and future prosperity. Any move that jumps the gun in this situation could lead to the discouragement of foreign investment and greatly impact on our already established free trade agreements.


That is why this government is taking this issue very seriously. We will continue to look into the issue meticulously so that we can better understand the situation at hand and have the adequate data needed to make any decisions necessary. The Labor government is committed to striking the balance that all Australians are seeking, which led the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation the Hon. Bill Shorten and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry the Hon. Joe Ludwig to commission the Australian Bureau of Statistics, along with the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and ABARES, to get a better picture of foreign investment in Australia's agriculture sector.


The Australian Bureau of Statistics research project was published on 9 September and showed that a very modest amount of Australia's agricultural industry is owned by foreign investors. The data was collected in March this year after the request was made in December last year. The results were quite surprising considering the level of perceived foreign or business ownership of agricultural land. The result of the publication showed that 99 per cent of agricultural businesses in Australia are entirely Australian owned. The other headline figure was that 89 per cent of agricultural land was entirely Australian owned and, finally, 91 per cent of water entitlements were also entirely Australian owned. The ABS issued a media release which said:


The businesses reporting they were not fully Australian owned may have been either partially or entirely foreign owned and, as such the survey provides information about business, land and water entitlements by the extent of their foreign ownership.


We can dive further into the statistics which showed that only 5.8 per cent of land was owned by foreign investors, while the other 5.5 per cent of land that was foreign owned came from a minority stake of investors having less than 50 per cent ownership. From a South Australian perspective 87.9 per cent of agricultural land is entirely Australian owned with only 0.7 per cent in foreign hands with more than a 50 per cent stake in ownership. The slightly higher levels of foreign investment in South Australia can be assumed to be investments in our sheep, beef and grain farms. The ABS later stated:


The survey results are broadly comparable with levels of foreign ownership of agricultural businesses and land collected in the Agricultural Census of 1983-84. The ABS has not previously collected data on foreign ownership of agricultural water entitlements.


Considering this is the first time a study like this has been conducted in over 20 years this information is going to be vital in the ongoing debate on this topic. Along with the other commissioned reports, it will provide the government with an adequate picture of foreign acquisitions which this bill fails to consider.


The Senate Economics Committee report also made mention of the lack of data suitable for policy making decisions. When discussing the change to the threshold the committee commented:


… the current data gathering and research project should be completed before any adjustment to the threshold is made. Following the reporting of better data, the Foreign Investment Review Board figure should then be reviewed to allow for an appropriate threshold.


There must also be strong consideration given to the fact that Australia's foreign investment screening regime has continued along the path of a strong pro-investment stance. It is my understanding that most proposals are dealt with and approved within the first 30 days.


The government's policies are reflected to balance our interests and must remain balanced under commitments to free trade agreements and obligations to our trading partners. This government will continue to remain committed to ensuring our national interests are protected. That is why the government is waiting for the report to be completed by ABARES and RIRDC before the end of the year. These reports will look into the history and drivers of foreign investment in agriculture, and will also look into the impacts, drivers, structures and regulation of ownership in agriculture. The government feels this is the right course of action to take, especially when looking at the current situation of foreign ownership of agricultural businesses and land. Only after receiving these reports can the government be sure that any changes made will be consistent with a balanced approach. We on this side of the chamber feel and reiterate that the bill is jumping the gun, so to speak, by not taking into consideration many issues.


The Senate Economics Committee report into this bill also had additional issues that need to be addressed, which I am sure will continue to be brought up by this side of the chamber. These include: whether the current screening arrangements are actually inappropriate; that there is a significant advantage in retaining the inherent flexibility associated with a national interest test that is not overly prescriptive; how does this fit within the existing screening arrangements for the other investments into Australia. Creating a separate framework that applies exclusively to foreign acquisitions of agricultural land will create complexity and confusion both for Australian farmers and foreign investors; how will this impact on Australia's international obligations under Australia's free trade agreements; and all significant private as well as—


Debate interrupted.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,31,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-09-22,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (15:50):  I introduced the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural land) Bill 2010 with my colleague Senator Milne, from the Australian Greens. I am very grateful for the work she has done with me on this bill. I am also grateful for the comments from my colleagues on both sides of the political fence, from both the government and the opposition, some of whom believe that we need significant reform in this area. I am hoping that that undercurrent for reform will eventually be reflected by legislative change in this field. 


Australian farmers produce everything from wheat to wool, from bananas to beef, from pineapples to poultry and from milk to maize. Agriculture and closely related sectors earn $155 billion a year, which represents a 12 per cent share of the nation's GDP. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the total area of agricultural land in Australia, as at 31 December last year, was 398 million hectares. But until the introduction of this bill, it was impossible to tell how much of Australia's agricultural land was owned by foreign entities. We now know that 11 per cent of Australia's agricultural land, some 45 million hectares, has some level of foreign ownership, with some 0.3 million hectares having an unknown ownership status. We also know that the state with the greatest proportion of land of foreign ownership is the Northern Territory, followed by South Australia. But I still cannot tell you what areas of land are owned by foreign entities or what sector they are relevant to. It is also not clear the extent to which either state owned enterprises or entities that have close links to state owned enterprises have ownership of our prime agricultural assets. There are a number of reasons why we simply do not know. Firstly, that data is not kept. Apparently it is not a function of the Foreign Investment Review Board to maintain this sort of information. How the Foreign Investment Review Board is supposed to assess investment proposals without this information I am not quite sure. And how the government is supposed to be able to identify policy reform needs without this insight is beyond me. Secondly, investments by foreign entities less than $231 million in value do not require an application to the Foreign Investment Review Board. That means that a business from, for example, the United Kingdom, China, India or Europe could buy a farm to the value of $230,999,000 and not be subject to review by the FIRB. If it is the United States it is over $1 billion by virtue of the free trade agreement. 


But $231 million can buy a lot of prime agricultural land. It is an extremely high threshold and what it means is that many foreign investments are made without the government ever being made aware of such an investment. We may well be selling off prime agricultural land with no way of knowing to whom and what the long-term national interest implications are of that. Indeed, a foreign business could buy a number of farms up to $231 million in a piecemeal fashion and the government would never know.


According to the media reports, the buy-up of Australian agricultural assets has become more aggressive since the global food shortage of 2008. In December last year Hong Kong based company Nexus bought a 4,060-acre property in rural Queensland for $25 million. Nexus also bought a 500-hectare property on the Sunshine Coast for $20 million last year. There have also been reports of Chinese companies with a question mark as to the extent of their involvement in or links with state owned enterprises in China acquiring dairy assets in Tasmania. A recent report named China, South Korea, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States as the buyers who have become most aggressive in their purchases. This is not a criticism of those countries at all. In fact, I think those countries are showing long-term vision for their own national interests in terms of security of global food supply. These countries are looking to protect their own food security and they cannot be faulted for that. But we have to acknowledge that our poor foreign investment requirements put our own agricultural industry at risk, particularly in the longer term. 


I should stress that foreign investment is by and large unambiguously a good thing for a small, open economy like Australia. It can provide a significant boost to our economy. But there must always be a focus on Australia's own agricultural security and long-term food security. For this there needs to be a way to monitor what foreign investments are being made to this unique and very important sector. This bill provides for that. It does not stop foreign investment in Australian agricultural land. All it does is lower the threshold from $231 million to enable greater awareness about who is buying what so that appropriate policy decisions can be made. That is a very important point that I must stress. This bill does not stop foreign investments in Australian agricultural land. What the bill does is ensure that foreign investments are properly assessed, information gathering is increased and transparency is improved, and that there must be a national interest test. 


This bill, which I introduced with my colleague Senator Milne from the Australian Greens, is extensively based on the Overseas Investment Act of 2005 from New Zealand. For a number of years there has been an Overseas Investment Office in New Zealand to oversee foreign investments. It is similar to the Foreign Investment Review Board here in Australia but, dare I admit it, Mr Deputy President, especially during rugby World Cup time, I think we have a lot to learn from our neighbours across the Tasman. It pains me to say that. Under the New Zealand regime a foreign investor requires approval from the government for an investment in rural land if it exceeds five hectares. New Zealand recognises that rural land is special and therefore any applications by foreign entities to purchase it need to be subject to serious consideration. There are even tighter restrictions if the land is near a conservation reserve or adjoins a foreshore. This bill mirrors the legislation which operates well and effectively in New Zealand. 


The evidence heard by the Economics Legislation Committee on this bill was quite instructive. The evidence from New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office indicates that they have national interest test criteria. That is something that this bill mirrors. In contrast, Australia's national interest tests are guidelines only. I think there is an issue there about the vagueness and the lack of transparency in the way the Foreign Investment Review Board currently does its work. That is not a criticism of the Foreign Investment Review Board per se but a criticism of the framework upon which it operates. Ms Toni Moyes, an analyst at the New Zealand Treasury, said during the inquiry hearing that the legislation is based on the guiding philosophy that foreign investment is welcome in New Zealand but it is also a privilege. Ms Moyes told the committee:


New Zealand has a long history of regulating investment in farmland, which reflects the traditional view in New Zealand that land ownership should not be concentrated in the hands of a few but should be able to be widely dispersed amongst the population.


The New Zealand model is robust, it is transparent and it is effective. Furthermore, the Overseas Investment Office provides extensive detail about all applications received, whether approved or not. Contrast that with what happens here with the Foreign Investment Review Board. That is why I welcome the inquiry by the Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee into the Foreign Investment Review Board. This bill does not seek to deter foreign investment; rather it simply aims to enable greater scrutiny against the benchmark of the national interest. We have a working model across the Tasman where it is effective. It should also be noted that the 200 applications a year in New Zealand are dealt with effectively and efficiently. They are dealt with in a way that is fair and on the rare occasions that there has been a judicial review of those applications the evidence given by the Overseas Investment Office is that those cases were largely dismissed; in other words, the Overseas Investment Office's decisions were upheld. 


As a result of the Senate committee inquiry it was noted that, given the difference in land size between Australian and New Zealand, five hectares is not an appropriate threshold. So an amendment to this bill has been circulated in consultation with my colleague Senator Milne. It will amend the bill so that the threshold is lowered from $231 million to $5 million. This is a monetary threshold rather than a spatial one. When the first Foreign Takeovers Act was introduced in 1975, the rural land threshold for scrutiny was $1 million 


I believe a lower threshold is important if Australia is to be truly able to make informed policy decisions about our agricultural future, and $5 million is an appropriate threshold. It is roughly in line with the original $1 million threshold, taking into account CPI increases and the like.


Farmland is not our only concern. International investors are becoming increasingly interested in the Australian water market. A recent ABS survey found that nine per cent of the water entitlements for agricultural purposes in Australia are owned by foreign businesses. But there is an issue about the nature of the survey. Whilst I welcome the survey and whilst it is an improvement on the level of information we have, I think there are some flaws in the survey. I emphasise that that is not a criticism of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They were constrained by the instructions given to them by government. For instance, the survey may tell us what percentage of land is owned by foreign interests or in which land foreign interests have a share. For instance, the study found that 24 per cent of the Northern Territory's agricultural land is either partly or wholly foreign owned. But it does not tell us what the value of that land is in terms of its agricultural output.


That defect is even more pronounced with water entitlements. There is a global figure that nine per cent of water entitlements have a foreign investment component, but we do not know what those water entitlements are. Are they, for instance, general-security water? If you look at the Murray-Darling Basin there is a huge difference between high-security water and general-security water. Owning one per cent of Australia's high-security water is much more significant than owning five or 10 per cent of general-security water or low-security water. There is a very big difference in that. These are issues that are of real concern.


The ownership of water has real potential to distort our water market. Water entitlements are not something to be played with. In Western Australia—and I note that Senator Bishop has an interest in this matter—31 per cent of water entitlements for agricultural purposes are partly or wholly foreign owned, which is the highest for any state in the Commonwealth. This is a very serious issue for farmers, who are only now coming out of the worst drought this country has ever seen.


This legislation will prevent us from selling off our backyard before we realise what we have done and it is too late. This bill will also put into legislation a national interest test based on the New Zealand model. The government currently uses guidelines around national security, competition and other government policies, the impact on the economy and the community, and character of the investor. But the test needs to go further. This bill sets out detailed criteria by which the Treasurer needs to consider applications for foreign investment. Applying these to potential investments in Australia will enable greater scrutiny to be applied. There are specific matters to consider such as whether the foreign investment will have an impact on competition, global security and market outcomes; whether it is likely to result in the creation of new job opportunities; whether Australia's economic interests are adequately safeguarded and promoted, including looking at issues of aggregation and vertical integration; and whether the acquisition will result in increased processing in Australia of Australia's primary products.


The fact is that we do not know enough about the current level of foreign investment in Australia, particularly in agricultural land, and we do not have a mechanism to monitor it. This bill will require the online publication of applications for interests in Australian agricultural land and for the status of these to be updated as the applications proceed. If the Kiwis can do it, why can't we? This process will give us the informa­tion we need about the current state of play so that we can be informed to make good policy decisions for the future.


Again, this bill is not about saying no to foreign investment. This bill is about improving transparency and increasing the information we have access to about who owns our backyard. It is about strengthening the process and allowing more scrutiny, rather than letting things go too far, when it is too late to do anything about it. This legislative framework works well in New Zealand and will significantly benefit this government's information about who owns what, where and why so that we can have a sensible, informed policy debate about this.


Wouldn't it be useful to know at the click of a button whether or not a particular company has already bought two dairy farms in one town and is planning to buy another two dairy farms, considering the impact that could have on the local market? Wouldn't it be good to enable the government to indentify that this behaviour might be having a serious impact on local Australian dairy producers? Quite simply, without this bill we will never have all the information we need to make informed policy decisions when it comes to Australia's agricultural sector.


This legislation is important. It is important to overhaul the current rules. It is important to lower the current absurd threshold of $231 million before the Foreign Investment Review Board can even begin to look at an investment. It is important to acknowledge that the recent ABS survey, whilst useful, begs more questions than it answers. That is why it is important and in the national interest, in the interests of our long-term food security, in the interests of our farmers and in the interests of preventing market distortions that this bill I introduced with my colleague Senator Milne be passed and supported by the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,31,2
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (16:05):  I rise to make some comments on the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010. Before turning to my more formal remarks, I just want to put on the record that twice over the past 24 hours I have taken the opportunity to read this report. It was drafted under the committee chairmanship of former Senator Hurley and the Senate Economics Legislation Committee secretariat. It is a most thorough report and it is well worth reading because it reduces to a small number of pages some of the difficult arguments that have been put around in this debate, notwithstanding the relatively small number of witnesses who chose to make a sub­mission and give evidence. It is a most thorough report and I commend it to those who are interested in this particular discussion.


One of the features of the independence of the Senate is, of course, that it provides an open forum for senators to publicly express concerns on any matter, which often would otherwise not be heard. It is a fact enabled by the lack of a government majority, and we in government and those in opposition must tolerate it. The downside of it is that many of those concerns essentially are minor and may have little merit. In fact, they may simply be a waste of time. Often we find that due to a lack of discipline and focus the Senate can become hostage to narrow and ill-informed acts of populism. So it is with this private members' bill, I must say at the outset.


It is very easy, especially for an Independent or an opposition party, to represent any narrow, sectoral view on the basis of no care and no responsibility. Yet, when the populist view is exposed to analysis, we see that it often fails the critical policy test. That is not to say that the interest represented by Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne, the sponsors of the bill, is not genuine or that the interest is not widely noted and widely supported. But the problem with populism is that it is rarely well informed of all the facts, the context or the broader considerations at a national level. So we are constantly bombarded with a load of ideas about what the government should do or should not do. That is the greatest asset, in one sense, of a democracy but also the major cause of conflict in political debate where so often fact and analysis is challenged.


We also know that the great majority of government legislation passes through this chamber unaltered. Few pieces of legislation stumble and, then, only for political reasons when opposition parties for their own interests judge that there is a significant advantage in pandering to a particular populist view, regardless of fact and analysis. The list of examples is endless, ranging from new railways—fast or slow—to turning the rivers westward or stopping Vegemite and Weet-Bix being sold to foreigners. We do understand that out there in the community there will always be some ill-founded fear of foreigners to be used in political manipulation, and governments fail this test simply because they regularly fail to sway that populist sentiment.


Opposition, however, are clearly not always that fickle, as evidenced by the bulk of legislation passed without objection. Their own long-held and researched policy position is often the same. This bill, however, is not in that class of policy, but Senator Xenophon will be able to return to his interest group and say he tried. I think his remarks foreshadowed further and different attempts. But having wasted our time he will claim his credit as well as a headline, which is the main game.


This bill seeks to seriously limit the amount of Australia's farmland which can be purchased by foreign investors. It seeks to completely change national policy and the rules which apply to all foreign investment, which have had longstanding, apolitical support. It proposes that any bid to buy interests in agricultural land of greater value than $5 million be subject to the application process of the Foreign Investment Review Board and the decision of the Treasurer. This is at least better than the original proposal to make the limit five hectares, as is the case, the report informs us, in New Zealand. Further, it requires that the Treasurer publish online the application of interest and update that information as the application proceeds. These arrangements are proposed to apply to both the acquisition of farm real estate and any interest in agricultural land, such as management rights, leases of more than five years and profit-sharing arrangements, which are common in the agricultural industry.


However, the bill, as I said in my introductory remarks, has been thoroughly examined by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and totally rejected. The committee applied the following questions: whether the current screening arrangements were inappropriate, whether there was advantage in retaining the inherent flexibility associated with a national interest test that is not overly prescriptive, how this fits within the existing screening arrange­ments for other investments in Australia and how this would impact on Australia's international obligations under Australia's various free trade agreements. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee concluded that it was essential that Australia remain a country that welcomes foreign investment, that it should continue to be an attractive place to invest, that any changes to foreign investment policy or legislation should be considered in this light and that the proposed national interest test applying only to agricultural land would effectively create two separate national interest tests. The committee continues to hold the view that the current regulatory framework for assessing investment proposals is adequate or indeed, from reading the text, more than adequate.


The committee also identified the need to maintain consistency with Australia's FTA and OECD obligations, freely entered into and repeatedly endorsed by appropriate committees of this parliament—that is, the commitments Australia has made to screening thresholds for business acquisi­tions in its free trade agreements with Singapore, Thailand, the United States and Chile and, when in force, the recently signed investment protocol with New Zealand. The changes in the bill to screening thresholds would violate our commitments under these free trade agreements. If Australia were to adopt the proposals contained in the bill before the chair, our trading partners would be allowed to retaliate. This could be in highly sensitive areas for Australia, including in agricultural sectors such as beef and others where we engage in large volumes of and receive large dollars for exports. The FIRB—the Foreign Investment Review Board—already screens foreign governments or government related entities that attempt to acquire rural land. This bill will not change that.


Having said all of that, let me supply some of the detail concerning foreign investment which underpins the committee's conclusion because the statistics that are publicly available and some of the additional materials that were supplied by Treasury to questions on notice are remarkable. Foreign investment is essential to Australia's continued economic growth and prosperity, including in the agriculture sector. In terms of the current debate and the matters raised by Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne, I think it is worth having a good look at where that investment goes.


Broadly speaking, about 30 per cent of FDI, foreign direct investment, goes to mining, around 20 per cent goes into manufacturing, 10 per cent flows to the wholesale and retail sectors, and around 15 per cent goes to the finance and insurance sectors. In 2010 dollars, these investments were worth around about $350 billion. The agricultural sector represents just 0.14 per cent of the total stock of foreign direct investment. To put it in another way, in 2010 it represented an investment of approximately $670 million out of $350 billion.  Of course, this is not the full picture of foreign investment in agriculture or, more latterly, agribusiness. But on the surface it does look like the agricultural industry is mostly Australian owned—in fact, Australian dominated; the figures in the report are well in excess of 98 per cent. 


So what are the known facts? Over 50 per cent of Australia's land area is used for agriculture. One-fifth of this area is attributed to the Murray-Darling Basin, which is responsible for almost 40 per cent of the value of agricultural production. Farmers produce more than 90 per cent of our domestic food supply. Australia exports approximately 60 per cent of its overall agricultural production volume and around about 75 per cent of its gross agricultural production value. On these figures, it is safe to assume that a great many rural and regional communities around Australia are reliant on agriculture and food production. But of course, there is more to agriculture than only farming. As well as primary producers there are wholesalers, processors and businesses that support food production. So, while farmers make up around 70 per cent of the sector, the value generated in revenue terms occurs amongst enterprises beyond the farm gate, where the value adding occurs, of course. As with other sectors, foreign investment makes a contribution. As with any investment, it provides opportunity and most importantly it provides jobs—large numbers of jobs. For that reason we should consider very carefully changes that discourage or make it difficult for investment dollars, FDI, to flow into this country. 


Senator Xenophon in his second reading speech mentioned media reports of the buy-up of Australia's agricultural assets becoming more aggressive since the global food shortage of 2008. Those same reports suggest there is growing community concern about the level of foreign investment in agricultural land. I do not doubt for one moment the sincerity of the media reports of many people's views. However, again I would caution against accepting that populism. 


There is no evidence the current law on foreign investment in Australia needs changing. We should not be pandering to simple xenophobia or disguised claims for protection. We have a market economy which farmers generally widely support, including of course the value of their land—and we had an instance of that discussion earlier today—and to which they have adjusted over recent decades of reform. In this discussion, we do need to look at both the big picture and the total picture. The government, in response to the requests for more information and accurate information, has commissioned comprehensive research of foreign investment in agriculture that looked at not only Australia's agriculture land but also, importantly, water entitlements and agribusiness. We have also asked the ABS and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, along with ABARES-BRS, to undertake a project that will give us a better picture, a more detailed picture, a fuller picture, an accurate picture, of the foreign investment landscape. 


That project, in response to concerns generated over the last 18 months, has four particular components: firstly, the role and history of foreign investment in the development of agriculture in Australia, including assessing the impact which foreign investment has had; secondly, the domestic and international factors driving foreign investment in Australian agriculture; thirdly, the various ownership structures of agribusiness firms for subsets of the Australian agriculture industry, including businesses such as meat processing, sugar refining, dairy marketing, and other high-profile sectors, and changes in those structures over time; and, fourthly, measures used in other countries for monitoring and regulation of foreign investment in agricultural land. We want to know, firstly, the role and history; secondly, factors which drive investment; thirdly, the various ownership structures present in the industries; and, finally, the value-adding that occurs in industries and changes in those structures over time. 


This important work commenced in November last year and, when completed, will inform our thinking in this area. While that is going on, the ABS Agricultural Land and Water Ownership Survey, ALWOS, has been completed. The data was released earlier this month. Surprisingly, despite media reports, the data shows that foreign ownership levels in Australia's agriculture sector are very modest. The overwhelming majority of Australia's agricultural businesses—99 per cent—are entirely Australian owned. In terms of agricultural land, 89 per cent is entirely Australian owned. As far as water entitlements are concerned, 91 per cent is in Australian hands. The results of this survey reinforce my view that this bill at this stage is simply unnecessary and not warranted by the available evidence. It does not make a sufficient case for change; although, as the government has conceded, we do need to learn more about the impact of foreign investment in the agricultural sector. 


The overwhelming impression I have—and one which has been informed by the economics report behind this bill, is that we should not yet take the easy solution of jumping to conclusions. This type of research has not been undertaken since 1984. So it is important that we get the facts straight about what is a very important debate and what one suspects is going to continue to be an important debate until the facts are researched, published and established in this area. As a country, we have traditionally been reliant on foreign capital to build and develop our businesses in all parts of the economy. It would be foolish indeed to ignore the significant risks for Australia in making changes such as these that could discourage or hinder foreign investment.


Foreign investment—it goes almost without saying, in my view—is critical to ensuring our continued economic growth and prosperity, including in the agricultural sector and the value-adding industries attached to that sector. Given the strategic importance of the agricultural sector is likely to increase in the future—and the level of demand and the level of investment that is coming in suggest that is the case—Australia's foreign investment policy settings need to be right.


This bill is pre-emptive. It does not address some serious issues that must be considered prior to any changes being made in this sector. We should also be mindful that foreign investment is only a minor matter—an important matter but nonetheless minor—in the broad policy sweep of primary production. It is a distraction with major implications for foreign investment policy and should be rejected. In due course, if this matter goes to a vote, the bill should also be rejected.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:24):  The coalition does not support the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010 introduced by Senators Xenophon and Milne. I say at the outset that, with the exception of the gratuitous attacks on the opposition, I agree with much of what Senator Bishop has just said. Foreign investment is very important for Australia—it has been in the past and will continue to be in the future. 


In terms of our economic development and our capacity to maximise our economic opportunities into the future, we are a large country with a lot of opportunities, we are sparsely populated and a lot of the important parts of our economy are capital intensive. Without being able to attract foreign investment we would not be able to properly develop all of the economic opportunities at our disposal. So I agree with much of what Senator Bishop has said. Where I disagree with him is that when public concerns are raised—and clearly in this whole area of foreign investment in agricultural land there is a level of public concern—to characterise an attempt to be responsive to those concerns as populism is, in my view, quite arrogant. One does not have to agree and one does not have to do what is asked by those sections of the community that express concern, but one should take those concerns seriously and one should constructively and positively engage in debate and not just dismiss any attempt to address those concerns as populism. 


The coalition is not unsympathetic to the underlying issues that this bill has raised. Foreign investment in agricultural land—in fact, foreign investment in general—is a legitimate issue of public policy debate. I say again: foreign investment is important. It has been important in our past and it will be in the future. The current legislative and regulatory framework is adequate to ensure that any national interest considerations are properly taken into account—and that is where I also agree with Senator Bishop. 


The report by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee—which was chaired by a former colleague Senator Annette Hurley and a great senator from Western Australia as deputy chair, Senator Alan Eggleston, whom I know Senator Bishop holds in very high regard—goes in some detail through all of the policy issues that are raised by this bill. Like Senator Bishop, I do commend this report to all senators as they are considering these issues.


The coalition takes these issues so seriously that we have established a working group to investigate options to strengthen the rules governing the sale of Australian agricultural land and agribusinesses to foreign entities. The working group is chaired by the Leader of the Nationals, the Hon. Warren Truss. Other members are senior shadow ministers Julie Bishop, Joe Hockey, John Cobb, Barnaby Joyce and Sophie Mirabella. The working group is currently in the process of examining the adequacy of policy settings and delivering positive outcomes for Australia from foreign investment. The coalition believes that foreign investment is integral to Australia's economic future; however, our policy in this area must ensure that foreign acquisition of farming land is undertaken in Australia's national interest and that the food security of our nation is maintained into the future.


The coalition, as I have mentioned, will not support this legislation. We will continue to go through our internal policy process, and we will not support any initiative like this until we have finalised those processes. The coalition, in November 2010, called on the government to commission the Aust­ralian Bureau of Statistics to compile data on the foreign ownership of agricultural land, because one of the issues that has come up in this debate is that there is a complete inadequacy of information and data in this area. According to figures released by the ABS on 9 September, as at 31 December 2010, 99 per cent of agricultural businesses in Australia were entirely Australian owned, 89 per cent of agricultural land was entirely Australian owned and 91 per cent of water entitlements for agricultural purposes were entirely Australian owned. 


It is important, as Senator Bishop observed, to have all of the facts before us as we are considering the issues around foreign acquisitions and foreign investment in agricultural land and other assets. All states showed high rates of Australian ownership of agricultural businesses, ranging from 99 per cent in Queensland to 96 per cent in Tasmania. So the problem is perhaps not as extensive as Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne might want us to believe. The state with the highest proportion of land held entirely by Australian owned businesses was Victoria, with 99 per cent of its 12 million hectares being Australian owned, while the Northern Territory had the lowest proportion, with 76 per cent of its 59 million hectares being Australian owned. According to the ABS, the survey results are broadly comparable with levels of foreign ownership collected in the agricultural census of 1983-84. So it would seem that, despite perceptions to the contrary, there has not been much movement in the level of foreign investment over the last 30 years. 


Again, it would seem that the issues are perhaps not as acute as Senators Xenophon and Milne might want us to believe. However, it is true to say that the statistics are probably only part of the story. In particular, even if 99 per cent of agri­businesses are wholly Australian owned, it would be good to know if the one per cent that are partly or wholly foreign owned are the largest agribusinesses, what their share is by volume, not just by number, and whether this foreign ownership is concentrated in any particular type or part of agriculture. Hence, more data is needed.


The coalition has called for more work to be done on establishing a public register of foreign ownership of agricultural land and agribusinesses. We are interested in getting more data on the public record about foreign ownership of land. This process must involve the states, who are responsible for land titles. This all goes to making sure that we make decisions on the facts and the figures in front of us, rather than merely on emotion. We cannot entirely ignore emotion—we cannot ignore any level of concern—but we need to respond to it properly. It should be noted that Queensland has had such a register for around 30 years. The opposition has called on the government to task the Productivity Commission with reviewing this whole issue. In particular, the Productivity Commission should consider whether the government needs to lower the threshold for notification to the Foreign Investment Review Board of rural land and agribusiness acquisitions and whether anything needs to be done to safeguard the nation's food security. These are matters that are covered in the bill, but we have concerns about the thresholds proposed and the codification of the national interest.


The bill seeks to impose a low spatial threshold of five hectares. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee report, which we have talked about, questioned the appropriateness of a spatial threshold. That the Treasurer could be called upon to make a determination of national interest on an area as small as five hectares would be unwieldy, to say the least. While it is good to see that Senators Xenophon and Milne have sought to remedy this, it does not go to our position on the bill. The proper level of threshold does require further consideration.


There is a proposal in this bill to codify the national interest test by defining issues that the Treasurer must consider. We take the view that this would actually constrain the Treasurer's discretion. Codification of this sort could also lead to an increase in litigation on matters of foreign investment. The Foreign Investment Review Board has recently begun publishing broad guidelines on some of the considerations used in determining national interest. But these remain non-prescriptive, providing guidance to applicants without constraining the necessary and appropriate discretion granted to the Treasurer under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeover Act 1975.


We think that the coalition's policy, through the working group and through the notice of motion that we have previously submitted, puts forward a more considered and comprehensive policy approach and will provide a better outcome. Senator Xenophon says he has the country's interests at heart, but there are some major areas which are not covered by this bill. For example, it does not address the impact of foreign ownership of agribusinesses, which we believe is a greater problem than the purchase of agricultural land. It does not provide the much-needed extra information, which is currently severely lacking, to make sure we can make informed decisions.


Land transfers are of course the responsibility of the states. Changes in this bill would require a major revamp of the state's databases at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars—that is a preliminary estimate. The states would of course resist these changes and expect the Commonwealth to pay up. There would be significant ongoing costs to assess every acquisition of over five hectares with some level of foreign ownership. It would require a large increase in the bureaucracy to make these assessments. If these costs were passed on to the market through fees they would add significantly to the cost of purchase.


It is true that, in these sorts of debate, we have to tread very carefully. While we have to recognise and be responsive to public concern, we also have to make sure that we have a responsible debate that is based on facts. There are significant national interest issues at stake. There is absolutely no way that we would ever be part of any push that would seek to limit foreign investment to the extent that is proposed in this legislation. Senator Bishop raised some valid points in relation to international commitments. In its report, the economics committee raised some serious concerns that this bill might be inconsistent with some of Australia's international trade agreements. I am refer in particular to evidence given by Mr Mahony, who expressed this concern:


One thing is that, while I am not an international trade lawyer, it seems to me that there are questions about whether or not this kind of legislation is at least in the spirit of our international obligations and relationships, particularly our evolving investment protocol with New Zealand.


That is kind of a technical matter. The import of that is not just a technical or legal one, which I am not that concerned about. Obviously my concern is with the effect on innovation in the region and the effect on agriculture and the Australian economy generally—its capacity to innovate.


There are various other concerns, of course. In answers to questions on notice, Treasury expanded on some of the requirements under Australia's free trade agreements. Australia has free trade agreements with ASEAN, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, the United States and Chile. Australia has made commitments relating to national treatment and its screening thresholds in relation to the business acquisitions in its free trade agreements with Singapore, Thailand, the United States, Chile and, when enforced, the recently signed investment protocol with New Zealand.


We also have OECD obligations. Again, Treasury expanded on how the changes proposed in this bill could impact on our obligations with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. As a member of the OECD, Australia is bound by the OECD Codes of Liberalisation of Capital Movements. The code seeks to promote open markets by providing a balanced framework for the gradual liberalisation of investment.


All these issues serve to bring the committee to the view that this bill may actually be in breach of national treatment obligations as part of Australia's free trade agreements. While there are some legitimate issues yet to be considered, we have to be very careful not to go beyond certain bounds. Ultimately, continuation of strong foreign investment in the Australian economy is in our national interest, subject to the appropriate national interest safeguards. There are well-established processes to assess the national interest. Let us consider very carefully how those processes can be improved, but let us not go beyond the line of what is responsible, and this bill is crossing the line.


I have touched on some of the provisions that we do not think meet the right-balance test, and there are others. This is not a piece of legislation that the coalition is in a position to support. In fact, we oppose it. In that sense, we share the views expressed by government senators who have participated in the debate so far. With those few words, I thank the Senate for its attention.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:40):  I rise this afternoon to address the new geopolitics of food, and that is precisely what this bill, the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010, is about. I am quite alarmed at the contribution of the government by way of Senator Bishop's remarks—accusing people who are very concerned about what is going on with the acquisition of agricultural land and water rights as being populist, as taking a narrow sectoral view, as being rarely well informed of the facts and as not confirming the facts and analysis. He even suggested that this is wasting the Senate's time.


Senator Bishop may wish to acquaint himself with some facts rather than maintaining the ideological position, which he outlined here today, of not wanting to actually address this and suggesting that we already have the facts. Oxfam released a report today saying that 'land grabs' are leaving poor families 'hungry and homeless'. The report says:


Around the world, including in Australia, we are observing a mad scramble for land. A growing global economy and population, climate change, food insecurity and changing diets are driving governments and investors to acquire land outside their own borders for future food supplies.


That describes what is going on internationally, and Oxfam is raising it because of massive land grabs, mainly through Africa and in the poorer developing countries.


Those land grabs are being carried out by countries that profoundly changed their position as a result of the food riots and scarcity in 2007 and 2008. As a result of the extreme weather events of climate change and as a result of peak oil and rising oil prices, as well as the displacement of agricultural food crops with biofuel crops, we had a situation of massive food inflation. As a result, countries like Russia, Argentina and Vietnam limited or banned the export of wheat and rice so as to be able to feed their own people. That left those countries that import food short of food. They had plenty of money, but they had no food. That is precisely what triggered the Arab spring. Actually, the riots in Tunisia started because people could not afford to buy food, because Russia had banned grain exports and those countries in the Middle East are major importers of food.


The result was that countries that have outgrown their own land and water resources—such as China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar—basically set out on a global land and water acquisition plan. That changed everything, because they intend to buy land and water from other countries from which to feed their own people at times of food insecurity. They will also send their own workers to those countries to produce the food and, if necessary, they will employ security forces to protect that food. For example, Pakistan has already advertised 400,000 hectares of land for sale, with a security force.


It is anticipated that we will be living on a planet that is suffering climate change, with a massive population increase. Countries now recognise that the trade system as it currently applies around the world is inappropriate. When we have food shortages as a result of extreme weather events, if countries then decide to ban exports of food then some countries will be unable to feed their own people. That is what I meant by the 'new geopolitics of food' when I stood up to speak. Australia has a big responsibility globally. We need to feed our own people but we also need to maximise our food production so that we control where that food can go—so we can put it onto the international market but also, if we choose to, we can direct it to humanitarian causes or we can respond to make sure that food is able to go where food is needed, not sell our land and water resources so that other countries, like Qatar, China, Saudi Arabia and so on, outsource food production for their own people using Australian land and water, and therefore take away from Australia's national security and sovereignty in terms of being able to make decisions about growing our own food and directing it onto international markets.


As to Senator Bishop saying that Senator Xenophon and I do not have the facts or analyses: the whole point of this bill is to get the facts—because, as Senator Xenophon said in his second reading speech, you cannot find out right now how much agricultural land and water is already in foreign ownership. That is something that the Greens highlighted at the last federal election. We called for a national food security plan for the protection of agri­cultural land, not only from foreign ownership but also from issues like encroachment from urban expansion. And we wanted to make sure, as I said this morning in relation to the expansion of coal seam gas, that we start protecting land for food production in Australia, because it is essential to us and to other countries.


That is where this bill is going. What it does is create a national interest test to be applied against proposed acquisitions of agricultural land. New Zealand has a national interest test for the acquisition of agricultural land. Is anyone saying that people in New Zealand are populists with narrow, sectoral views and are xenophobic or whatever? No, they are not. Everybody accepts that New Zealanders have a national interest test. When anyone applies to buy land in that country they have a five-hectare limit and then it is assessed if it is greater than that. What Senator Xenophon and I are saying is that, in the Australian context, if the application for land is worth more than $5 million then it should be assessed, there should be a national interest test applied. Secondly, we are saying that any interest in Australian agricultural land greater than $5 million be subject to an application to the Treasurer and that the Treasurer be required to publish online the applications of interest in Australian agricultural land and the status of the applications as they proceed. So it is not saying anybody cannot acquire land or water rights; it is saying: let's actually get the data and see what is going on.


As a result of the concerns that have been raised by the Greens, by Senator Xenophon and by many people in the rural community, the government was put under the hammer here to actually start going out to find out what is going on around Australia—and that is why, in November last year, the government asked the Bureau of Statistics to look this up, having not done it since the early 1980s. What a disgrace it is that no-one was keeping any record in Australia of that.


Senator Bishop went on to talk about national averages and so on, but let me put some facts on the table. What that ABS report said was that already 9.4 million hectares in the Northern Territory are more than 50 per cent foreign owned. I will say that again: 9.4 million hectares. In Western Australia 3.1 million hectares are already more than 50 per cent foreign owned. And what is of considerable concern to me is that a third of water licences in Western Australia are foreign owned. You have to say to yourself: we are getting into a situation here where we need to look to the future, look to the security of growing food here and exporting food.


Let me give you an example of why countries are buying up water rights and agricultural land. The Saudis, for example, used to produce most of their own wheat. But they have overused their underground aquifer; it is currently drying up. So the Saudi Arabian wheat production fell by two-thirds and by 2012 it is estimated that wheat production in Saudi Arabia will cease altogether. So this is a crisis for developing countries. And this is a crisis for poor people in developing countries because those countries are recognising that they are going to have to get food from somewhere. That is why I say it is a new geopolitics. Food is going to drive national security concerns in this century, and the sooner this parliament gets on top of that, and recognises that the current trade arrangements, the current rules, do not actually provide for equity and justice and fair allocation, the better. That is why Oxfam is out there today saying, 'Look what is going on in these developing countries; we in the developed world have a responsibility to stand up in the FAO and in other international forums and start talking about these issues.'


As to the accusation that the committee report suggests that what Senator Xenophon and I are doing somehow contravenes the free trade agreement: there is no evidence of that whatsoever in the report. It is a lovely thing to stand up and say it, but there is no evidence for it. What it says is:




The committee is concerned that the bill may be in breach of 'national treatment' obligations as part of Australia's Free Trade Agreements
 …



And then it goes on to talk about the threshold of five hectares. Senator Xenophon and I have changed the threshold of five hectares, so it no longer applies. Furthermore, it was the committee's view that it 'may' be in breach. It did not say it 'was' in breach, and there is no legal evidence to support the claim. So it is a view that it is in breach. If it is in breach in Australia, why isn't it in breach in New Zealand? Why is it that the New Zealanders can have a national interest test that applies perfectly well in New Zealand, and everybody accepts it there? It is clearly a national interest test and it does not contravene free trade agreements—and New Zealand is a party to exactly the same free trade agreements as we are. So I am very interested that that claim is being made. Also, as I indicated before, the general thrust of opposition in the committee's report is that further data gathering and research are required on foreign investment in the agricultural sector before any legislative policy changes are made. That is the whole point of the bill: to start actually getting the data by requiring that any interest in Australian land or water resources worth more than $5 million goes through this process and goes up online so that people can see what exactly is going on and so that there is a record of it.


As to the issue that we might end up with a national interest test that could be prescriptive and expose the Treasurer to judicial review, the evidence received by the committee in the case of New Zealand is that over the past five years there has been a judicial review of three decisions. In each case the decisions were upheld and in all cases third parties brought the proceedings. None of the proceedings related to a decision that was declined. So it seems to me that the New Zealand approach is working particularly well.


The next issue that was raised was that you cannot have two separate national interest tests—that somehow that is inappropriate. Well, no. Treasury said:


… the Bill also imports into the FATA an elevated degree of sensitivity for rural land which would appear to surpass that applying currently to the most significant of business proposals.


Yes, that is correct, because that is the point of the bill: to settle out separately a sensitivity for rural land, and rural land includes water resources. That is precisely why we are doing this.


To me, the issue here is that the world has changed, and unfortunately there does not seem to be a recognition in this Senate that climate change, extreme weather events and increased population pressures have altered the whole issue of food security globally. That is the fact of the matter. The trade agreements we have around the world do not reflect those changes, nor do they reflect the fact that it is foreign governments, in many cases, that are out there behind companies that purport to be independent or private sector but are actually the face of foreign governments, so it is in Australia's national interest to collect the data.


I will go to one particular example. This is in Victoria. A large investment in prime Western District farmland by the Qatar government has already occurred. Qatar based Hassad Food, which is the agricultural arm of the Qatar government, paid $35 million for more than 8,000 hectares of sheep-grazing and cropping land in Victoria's Western District. The deal includes five homesteads near Ararat and is believed to be one of the largest acquisitions of Victorian pastoral land in recent history—that is from June this year. Local stock and station agents estimate the Qatar government paid a premium of up to 20 per cent in order to secure the controversial deal.


That is the point. It is going to distort land prices in rural and regional areas because, when foreign governments decide they need to outsource food production somewhere else and will pay a premium to get that land and water, local growers will not be able to buy land. Local young people trying to get on the land will be suffering from inflated prices. We have already been through this with managed investment schemes doing precisely the same thing. It is a distortion of the market, and that has already occurred.


If you add to that a recognition that Qatar has only about 65,000 hectares of arable land, that shows why it is so keen to buy land elsewhere. That decision in Victoria this year follows its purchase last year of 2,630 hectares about 330 kilometres west of Melbourne, and the company already holds a $100 million portfolio including 6,800 hectares in New South Wales and a 125,000-hectare holding in Queensland's Clover Downs, which it paid $18.5 million for. So there are already really substantial holdings. The other thing that you are not seeing is where these companies which are the arms of foreign governments are coming and buying small lots of land. Individually they appear to be quite small, but you do not have a record across the country of what collectively or regionally is happening to land ownership.


I think it is in the national interest for Australians to know exactly what is going on but also to have in the back of their minds—it is far from xenophobic—Oxfam's concerns about land grabs globally and what it means for us in Australia to think that the most just and decent thing to do is to control our own land and water resources so that we can make sure that we maximise food production, make choices about where we grow food and put it onto the international market and are able to have control of that food. That is so that, where you have a food security crisis, you do not end up with large areas of land from which a whole lot of food is just directed back to a foreign government, essentially, leaving other vulnerable countries and vulnerable populations around the world starving.


This is why it is called the new geopolitics of food. It has now escalated to a national security issue. Right around the world, governments are thinking about this. New Zealand is one government sitting out there that has a perfectly reasonable system. Senator Xenophon and I are seeking to have this parliament move to just record data—to develop a national interest test and record data—and get the Treasurer to put that data up on the website. Then we can make decisions about whether we want to take further action to restrict or to change the current rules. But what we are proposing does not stop any foreign investment at this point; what it does is start to provide that information that the Australian community needs.


I say to Senator Bishop that he has made a very serious error and has demonstrated his own ignorance by suggesting that concerns such as this are populist and that they do not stand up to analysis. As Senator Xenophon and I are showing, they are forward-thinking concerns. We are anticipating the geopolitics of the next 50 years, influenced by climate change, population growth and peak oil, and what we are now seeing is a significant shift. We will have to put a lot more money not into armies and the military but into supporting people to adapt to climate change and increase productivity in agricultural land around the world so that we can feed people and avoid the conflicts which are inevitable unless we start to do as we are suggesting: look at the national interest and look at our own national sovereignty issues.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (17:00):  The Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill was presented by Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne in November last year. I notice that we have some young South Australians in the Senate gallery today who are here for a Young Labor conference. There is Dale Colbeck, who I do not think is any relation to Senator Colbeck, Guy Wilcock, Ben Rillo and Hannah MacLeod. Senator Xenophon, if I recall correctly, was a member of the Young Liberals at one time.




Senator Xenophon:
  We all make mistakes.




Senator FARRELL:
  Talking about mistakes, we have one right here—your bill. I guess we all learn things at university when we get involved in these organisations, but we hope not to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past and in particular not to repeat the mistakes made in this bill. Currently, the threshold figure to trigger an inquiry by the Foreign Investment Review Board is $231 million. According to Senator Xenophon, that figure is too high and he would like to reduce it to $5 million.




Senator Xenophon:
  The threshold for foreign ownership in China is $1.




Senator FARRELL:
  Are you saying we should adopt the Chinese system? I notice you appear on this occasion to simply have adopted the New Zealand system, although I think it was pointed out in the course of the Economics Legislation Committee proceedings that that was not an appropriate way to go and you have modified your claim to a dollar amount.




Senator Milne:
  You are being ridiculous.




Senator FARRELL:
  It is not being ridiculous, Senator Milne.




Senator Milne:
 We have not modified it to a dollar.




Senator FARRELL:
  No, Senator Xenophon was suggesting that we modify it to a dollar—




Senator Xenophon:
  I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Farrell has suggested that we modify the figure in the bill to $1 as a threshold. I simply pointed out to Senator Farrell that the figure in China appears to be in the order of $1.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  There is no point of order.




Senator Xenophon:
  He has misrepresented my position and I would be grateful if he could correct it.




Senator FARRELL:
  If I have incorrectly asserted that Senator Xenophon's proposal was to reduce the figure from $231 million to $1, I do withdraw that suggestion. I thought he was indicating that that was what China did, and Senator Milne appeared to suggest that I was proposing that to the Senate. But we have now clarified that point. 


A number of important statistics released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics make clear the situation with foreign ownership in Australia. Senator Cormann referred to these figures earlier, in his contribution to this debate. The first of those important figures is that 99 per cent of all agricultural businesses in Australia are entirely Australian owned. So we are dealing with this bill in circumstances where 99 per cent of all agricultural businesses in Australia are currently Australian owned. Only 0.6 per cent have greater than 50 per cent foreign ownership—




Senator Heffernan:
  That is a complete horseshit report. 




Senator FARRELL:
  That may be your view, Senator Heffernan—




Senator Heffernan:
  Someone has written the speech for you and you don't know what you're talking about..




Senator FARRELL:
  I do know what I am talking about. You may disagree, and you are free to disagree, and you may wish to support Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne, which you are entitled to do, but I think I am entitled to put the facts as I understand them on the table—and that is what I am proposing to do. I have indicated that the ABS reports that 99 per cent of agricultural businesses are currently entirely Australian owned, and only 0.6 per cent have greater than 50 per cent foreign ownership. More significantly, 88.6 per cent of agricultural land in Australia, by area, is entirely Australian owned. Also importantly, only 5.8 per cent of agricultural land in Australia was owned by businesses with more than 50 per cent foreign ownership.


So we are dealing with this piece of legislation that seeks to dramatically reduce the trigger point for foreign investment inquiries, but we have a set of statistics that I think make it very clear that the problem is not as great as Senator Xenophon is claiming. That is not to say we should not inquire into this issue. It is an issue that has been raised out there in the community and I am not saying we should not inquire into it. In fact there are inquiries into the issue and I think we should allow them to complete in due course before we take this bill any further.


As I said before, Senator Xenophon's original bill, which he introduced with Senator Milne, simply picked up holus-bolus the system that operated in New Zealand. There are many things that you might want to adopt from New Zealand, but I do not think their system of foreign investment is one of them. There are plenty of reasons to distinguish the Australian circumstances from those of New Zealand. One obvious one is the size. Simply because the New Zealanders chose to use the figure of $5 million as the trigger point, it does not automatically follow that Australia, which is much larger and has quite a different agricultural history to New Zealand, should adopt that same process. I have indicated that there was a Senate inquiry into this where they looked at all of these issues. I think what we can say about Senator Xenophon's bill is that it does jump to some conclusions. Until all of the inquiries that are currently going on are completed, I do not believe it is appropriate to proceed with this legislation.


Australia does rely very heavily on foreign investment. That has been the history and the pattern of economic development in this country. Senator Xenophon believes that we should reduce the threshold for consideration by the Foreign Investment Review Board but it is also possible that, if we were to go down this track and introduce this new cut-off point, it might have an impact on how other countries see the opportunity to invest in this country and might have an adverse impact on the way other countries view foreign investment. We do not want to do anything at this point in time that might discourage contemplation of foreign investment. We have seen what has happened around the world in the course of the global economic crisis. We have seen what has happened in the United States and what has happened in Europe with the levels of unemployment. When people are getting very jittery about the prospects of another recession around the world, this is not the time to be raising issues that potentially discourage foreign investment.


Any decision that we do take to change our foreign investment legislation should be based on evidence. That is the way to do it. I have already referred to what the Australian Bureau of Statistics has said are the circumstances with ownership at the moment. One of the things we are waiting for is a report that Senator Ludwig has requested. It is a report by both the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and ABARES, two very distinguished organisations. That report is due to be released by the end of the year. The purpose of that report is to deal with the role and the history of foreign ownership in the development of Australian agricultural land and the factors driving foreign investment in Australia. They are two very crucial and important issues to consider before you would even contemplate proceeding with legislation like this to dramatically change the trigger point for an inquiry into foreign investment. We have set up an inquiry. Senator Ludwig has chosen to do that. I think the most basic thing we ought to be doing is not proceeding with this legislation at this point in time but waiting for that report and seeing what it has to say.


There are a range of issues that I think we need to look at. I am sure that this inquiry that Senator Ludwig has set up will do that. Those issues include: are the current screening arrangements that are in place inappropriate? Are there advantages in retaining the inherent flexibility of the national interest test that is not overly prescriptive? How does this issue fit with the existing screening arrangements for other investments in Australia? The potential is that we end up with two systems of foreign investments, one in respect of the issues that are covered by this legislation—namely, agricultural land—and one in respect of all other investments in this country. If this legislation were to proceed and successfully pass the parliament with the support of Senator Heffernan, we would in fact have two sets of rules. There may be reasons why you would want to do that, but at this stage I think it would be indeed premature to suggest that we should proceed with this legislation without at least looking at what the impact of those two systems of financial regulation might be. Senator Milne was critical of the reference by my colleague Senator Bishop to the free trade agreements. We do have agreements in place. Those agreements have been struck with other countries based on our current foreign investment rules. We need to look at the impact that a change of the nature that Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne are proposing will have on any of the obligations that we have under our free trade agreements. 



Senator Heffernan interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Senator Heffernan, the reality is that the economic performance of this country has defied most of the other OECD countries. There are lots of reasons why you might say that has happened. One of them that we have just recently found out is that we have the world's best treasurer.




Senator Cash:
  You can't compare him with the Greek treasurer.




Senator FARRELL:
  Senator Cash, you may not like the fact that Mr Swan has been declared the world's best treasurer, but it is an indication of the things that have occurred in this country. We have not gone down the path of the conservatives. We tried to make the important decisions on behalf of this country that kept Australians in work at a time when we risked going into recession. You have only to look at what has happened in the United States and what is happening in Europe at the moment. Particularly in the United States, unemployment is continuing to be stubbornly high. Part of our ability to respond in the way we have and the recognition we now have as a country—and I do not think Mr Swan would say it is all his own work; he would want to give credit to—




Senator Heffernan:
  Peter Costello and Paul Keating.




Senator FARRELL:
  I would certainly give credit to Paul Keating. I agree with you there, Senator Heffernan. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Senator Farrell, can I have you raise your commentary through the chair, please.




Senator FARRELL:
  Thank you for that helpful reminder, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will make all of my remarks through the chair. It is a little difficult with this constant flow of interjections, and I appreciate some assistance in protecting me from Senator Heffernan. But I do agree with him. Paul Keating was a great Treasurer and he has something in common with Treasurer Swan, of course. They both won that international award. I could be wrong about this, but I cannot recall Mr Costello ever winning such an award. 




Senator Heffernan:
  He paid off the $90 billion of debt that Paul left us.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Heffernan!




Senator FARRELL:
  The Hawke-Keating government reformed the Australian economy that made all of the subsequent improvements to the Australian economy possible. If Keating and Hawke had not opened up the Australian economy, we would not be in the position we are in.



Senator Cash interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  I cannot stop him from interjecting.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I can.




Senator FARRELL:
  We have set up this report. We have gone off to investigate. I think Senator Xenophon should wait for that report to come down. There is no urgency about this issue. If he had a sensible approach to the issue, then he would wait for that report. That report will give us an indication about some of the factors that are currently driving foreign investment in this country. 


We know foreign investment under a Labor government is booming in this country. We know other countries want to come and invest in our country. They want to create jobs and they want to build infrastructure. So we know they really do appreciate that Australia is a worthwhile place to invest, but let us examine exactly why they are coming to this country. One of the other things that this report will investigate is the economic impact of foreign investment in Australian agricultural industries and agribusiness. It will review the extent to which similar countries monitor and/or regulate foreign investment in agricultural land. So all of these things are important to the future of Australia's investment climate and all of them should be looked at before we go any further with this bill.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (17:20):  It is a very rare occasion that I rise in this place and I have noticed that most speeches made in this place are valued by the time they take up rather than their content. Thank you for that great contribution in time there, Senator Farrell. I have two words prepared here as my notes. The Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agricultural Land) Bill 2010 has great merit in that we are talking about agricultural acquisition by foreign interests. It puts it on the notice board. I am chairing an inquiry which will report next year on what is going on. It needs to be put into context. We can no longer take for granted what we have taken for granted over many years. That is to do with the shrinking agricultural resources of the planet and the compounding population growth of the planet. To have the argument about how we manage that, we should get the bed stones down. By 2050, unless there is a global catastrophe of some sort, we are going to have nine billion people on the planet and, according to the science, 50 per cent of the world's population will be poor for water. All science has vagary, so obviously we will have to make allowance in any plan for that vagary. It is estimated that a billion people will be unable to feed themselves and 30 per cent of the productive land in Asia will have gone out of production. Two-thirds of the world's population will live in Asia.


The global food task will double by 2050 and 1.6 billion people on the planet could be displaced. Part of that displacement is already underway. Unless China engineers a water solution for the great northern plain, where 260 million people presently live—food production in that region uses water from the great northern aquifer—they will have to move. By 2050 the number living on the great northern plain will reach 400 million. China are engineering some water solutions. They are building a pipeline to move water which is over a thousand kilometres long, has 27 pipes laid side by side and is 4½ metres deep. They say if you have enough money, you can engineer anything. That is part of what they see as the solution. I guess one of the reasons they are hanging onto Tibet is that Tibet is a great water supply—it is more about that than anything else.


By 2070 the world will have 12 billion people, barring a catastrophe. China will have around 1.8 billion people. China is through the denial phase on their problem—unlike India that are still in denial and unlike Australia that do not even think about it. We only worry about where we are going to be in the paper tomorrow and at the next election. That prediction of 1.8 billion people in China will include a huge demographic of aged people. Based on their own estimations to feed their people, China have set aside 200 million hectares for prime agricultural production. You cannot buy land there. It is impossible to acquire freehold title in China if you are a foreigner—forget about it. But they know they have already lost 10 per cent in 10 years of that set aside agricultural production due to urbanisation and the problems of water. They are on the move globally to fix that problem as a sovereign solution to protect their sovereignty, control their destiny and control their food task. 


They are on the march on the continent of Africa. A further part of the human displacement by 2050 will be about 260 million people who live across the northern part of the continent of Africa, which will become a desert according to the science predictions. The south-west portion of Western Australia is going to fall into the same category, according to the same science. The Murray-Darling Basin has 23,400 gigalitres of mean run-off. I hear people slagging off in this chamber trying to make cheap political points about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Bad luck, folks, Mother Earth is the referee of all this. The science is telling us that Mother Earth could remove somewhere between 3,500 and 11,000 gigalitres from the Murray-Darling's run-off due to a two-degree increase in temperature. A 15 per cent decline in rainfall in the southern Murray-Darling Basin will relate to a decline in run-off of up to 35 per cent. In fact, the three years of snow previous to the last year did not actually melt, it evaporated. 


The science says that by 2050 we may have under a fortnight of snow in the Snowy Mountains. Thirty-eight per cent of the run-off from the Murray-Darling Basin comes from the two per cent of the landscape that is at the back of us here in Canberra—between here and northern Victoria. So what happens in that particular bit of the landscape quantifies what will happen to a lot of the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, if the science on the changing weather for Australia is 40 per cent right, in most years there will be zero allocation for general purpose water in the southern rivers of the Murray-Darling. 


These are all propositions, and here we are luxuriating in this chamber while trying to score political points on how to manage the Murray-Darling Basin. I do not have the time tonight to go into this because it takes me two hours to do the presentation on the planet's water and Australia's water, and what we should do about it. But we can actually fix the water problem by fixing the model for water entitlement. As the amount of water available falls, you do not have to have a sledgehammer that says, 'We're going to take between 3,500 and 7½ thousand gigalitres out of the system'—which would be the top of those variation years; you can have an entitlement system which we have now instead of a volumetric licence system. As the amount of water available in the system for that year falls disproportionately, the amount of water that has to go to the work and the freight of the river increases. You can actually model that, but no-one has bothered. They are too lazy. Every government of every persuasion, for all time, has buggered up the management of water.


The world is losing one per cent of its agricultural land every year for a number of reasons. Under the science that is predicted, some agricultural land that is unproductive now will come into production and that could include parts of the frozen continent to the north. It will certainly mean changed propositions in Northern Australia. You will have heard Stuart Blanch and Joey Ross and those people in recent days slagging the idea that somehow we can develop Northern Australia. If we are silly enough, as we appear to be, to say there are no development opportunities in other parts of Australia and the science is telling us there is going to be a decline in capacity in the south, and we all rest on our laurels, think of the past, retire to the coast, think agriculture is a mature industry and we only go to Coles, Woollies or Aldi, or wherever, to get our tucker because it is all there, we are dreaming. 


By 2050, the food task is going to double. We are going to have to use everything from GM science to smarter technology for water. In Australia, we have a perfect model for efficient water use in Carnarvon in Western Australia. I congratulate Judith Adams for being in the chamber. Carnarvon farmers are 40 times more efficient with their water use than the Ord. They are 20 times more efficient than the Murray-Darling Basin. In 2006-07, they produced $69 million of income from 8½ gigalitres of water—and some of that went to the town supply. Their pressurised root zone irrigation system is based on Spanish and Israeli technology. In the same year, the Ord in stage 1 used 345 gigalitres of water to produce the same income. In the same year, the Murray-Darling was 20 times less efficient. 


There is some efficiency that can be applied. That efficiency can be brought to bear in the Murray-Darling Basin. The episode with Cubby—and I think that is about to be fixed—was seriously inefficient. It was the model of a great idea built on the wrong scale in a river system, the Culgoa River, that has 1,200 gigalitres of mean annual flow and 845 per cent variability. They allowed them to build 1,500 gigalitres of on-farm storage, which is completely out of kilter with the capacity of the river system. That is just a little bit of detail on what agriculture is all about.


We produce 73 per cent of Australia's farm income on agriculture in the Murray-Darling basin, which has 6.2 per cent of Australia's run-off. The Timor catchment has 78,000 gigalitres of run-off, the Gulf catchment has 98,000 gigalitres of run-off and the north-east catchment in Queensland has 85,000 gigalitres of run-off—and here we are dreaming that we do not care who owns the place. If I have time I will come to the details of the farcical statistical evidence the ABS gave on ownership. It was a complete, drop-dead farce.


Here we are fantasising about locking up the north when we know that Bangladesh is half its size. Cape York Peninsula is 17½ million hectares. If you take out the coastal communities, there are approximately 14,000 people, 12,000 Indigenous, living in an area the size of Victoria. There are 800,000-odd feral pigs there, 20,000 to 30,000 untagged feral cattle and about 14 to 17 pastoral stations. The rest is either sit-down blackfella country—I can say that because they are all my mates; and I am a whitefella to them—or destined for World Heritage listing.


To his credit, Peter Beattie told me, when I was in the process of chairing the Traveston Dam inquiry—and, by the way, it was a shit of a site for a dam, and he knew it—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Senator Heffernan—




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I retract whatever it is you want me to retract.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You know what you said and I am asking you to retract it.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I retract it. I had better not say 'bugger'. It was a 'not a very nice' site. He said, 'Look, Bill, I've got to get the inner-city preferences'—this was two elections ago in Brisbane—'so I've done a deal with the Wilderness Society to enact the wild rivers legislation.' The wild rivers legislation locks up the first kilometre on either side of all those rivers all the way up Cape York Peninsula—17½ million hectares. The average annual wildfire there burns five million hectares. The biggest wildfire they have had burned 11 million hectares. It is a soft entry point into Australia for foot and mouth disease because of all those feral pigs. We are fantasising about locking it up. So the opportunity for Indigenous people up there will not be economic agricultural production for the first kilometre, which is just as good as any riverbed or floodplain down the Murrumbidgee. No, we are saying: 'What we want your opportunity to be perhaps is tourism. You can get your picture taken standing on a stone with a spear for the tourists.' That is what we are saying to our Indigenous people. And bear in mind that there are still approximately 7½ thousand kids in the Northern Territory who do not have a bloody high school to go to. What sort of a disgrace is that?


Go to Bangladesh and try to explain that to the people in Bangladesh. It is predicted that 1.6 billion people on the planet will be displaced by 2070. If the science is only 10 per cent right, that is 160 million people. Bangladesh has 160 million people who live in an area half the size of Cape York Peninsula. Fifty-seven rivers flow into Bangladesh, 54 of them out of India. India is mining the water that comes all the way along the Ganges—right down. India is still in denial. If the sea rises just under a metre and India continues to mine the groundwater which becomes the river water for Bangladesh, by 2050 those people are going to have to move because they are going to be inundated and lose their freshwater—and here we are fantasising about not developing anything in the north.


The CSIRO were not allowed to consider storing or damming water, but that was not because they could not do it. Better than anyone in this chamber, I understand the science of what is happening up there. The bulk of the water falls to the bottom of the catchment, unlike the catchments down here where the water falls to the top of the catchment. It is an event based thing, but you can recharge sandbed aquifers—the Gilbert River west of Georgetown was pegged out for irrigation in 1957.


We have all said: 'Oh, no, it's too hot to go up there. And it's too far away from the market.' Where's the best place to be on a hot day? In the cab of a tractor. It is better than the airconditioning in the house. Why do we think we are we too far from the market? Because we are looking in the wrong direction. Two-thirds of the world's population are just over the water. Two-thirds of the world's population are closer to Darwin than they are to Sydney.


So here we are thinking that somehow we are going to flog through with what we have got. No-one is listening to the science in this debate about agricultural land acquisition. We were briefed the other night by the ABS, and I took the trouble to ring them. As they will tell you, the game has changed. I have heard all these political speeches today—mostly prepared notes that someone else has written for them—but no-one is giving consideration to the seismic change that is occurring in the world through the loss of sovereignty through modern communication, transport, free trade agreements and all the rest of it. And that was my point to Senator Farrell on the free-trade agreements: we gave away a five per cent and a 15 per cent tariff in the American free-trade agreement and imposed a 45 per cent tariff. In 2004, when that was agreed to, we were at 67c to the US dollar. When it was enacted, in January 2005, we were at 70c. We now have a 45 per cent tariff against us on our terms of trade, yet we gave away a five per cent tariff. It is all stupid.


It is premature, this bill. I am sorry, Senator Xenophon, but it is premature. Let's get everyone educated as to what the problem is and let's have a strategic view in Australia of where we are going to be in 50 years time and in 80 years time. Let me give you some suggestions on that. There needs to be true definition of the difference between foreign sovereign acquisition—and the ABS will tell you this if you go and talk to them—and foreign capital. I do not care about foreign capital coming into agriculture because it has been coming in for yonks. Traditionally what happens with foreign capital is that they come in, invest, feel good about it and then strike the variability of our seasons and its impact on production. Next, all their directors want a bonus, overtime and all the rest of it and then they go broke and they pack up and leave. It always happens. They all do it. One of the great institutions of Australia, the family farm, keeps the job going because we do not pay ourselves overtime. 


Why shouldn't we be thinking, 'Let's sell our production into the doubling of the world food task by 2050 rather than sell our means of production'? I am sorry to have to use a note at this stage, but I will just quote ABARES talking about who owns the place. This is from the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill. First there are some comments from Alan Hill, the Director of Policy for the Western Australian Farmers Federation, then the report goes on:


ABARES also noted that there is currently no database of ownership of Australian agricultural land—


this is only a few weeks ago—


It informed the committee that Queensland is the only State that collects this type of information:


Senator HEFFERNAN—Firstly, would it be fair to say for your organisation—


this is ABARES; they advise the government—


that we really do not know who owns the agricultural land in Australia?


Mr Morris—Yes.


The ABS thing is a political cover. We were briefed on it.


You know what they did? They sent out 11,000 forms based on the ATO's ABN register of agricultural interests. They did not pick up Shenhua, who bought a big lump of country around their mine to shut all the cockies up. They did not pick up all the blind trusts through the Cayman Islands. They did not pick up the sovereign wealth funds where reporting is compulsory but not mandatory. Some of these sovereign funds have all sorts of blind operations. No, we do not know about the sovereign acquisitions. 


The greatest threat to Australia's sovereignty, as Mick Kelty pointed out a few years ago—no-one took any notice—is the effect of climate change and human displacement. The greatest threat now—and if you dig down into ABS, they will tell you—is the concept of sovereignty being displaced because of sovereign wealth funds. The sovereign wealth funds of some countries are acquiring the sovereign wealth of other countries—and excluding those countries from access to their own wealth. That is going to happen—places like China, to their credit, are aware of the future food problem they are facing and they are busily doing this. 


If you go back to the ABS thing, the database—guess what? They started with farms that had an income of $5,000. So farms with an income of only $5,000—that could be any of these toy farms around Canberra here—were included in the schedule as some sort of commercial agricultural production. You have to have income of between $30,000 and $50,000 to be able to get a GST return—$5,000 is meaningless. Yet, in the statistical database, the model includes anything that earns $5,000. This has the capacity to completely distort the figures. This is a phoney—I am sorry to have to say that, but it is—statistical, political tool. It is meaningless. Hopefully, when the inquiry that I am going to chair gets going, we will deal with the facts rather than the political fantasy involved behind protecting a government—whoever the government might be after the next election. 


I am interested, and all of Australia's farmers are interested, in where we are going to be in 50 or 80 years time. We do not want to leave the farm to a foreign interest if we can avoid it. But you cannot blame the cocky who wants to get out— (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-09-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:41):  I was quite enjoying Senator Heffernan's speech. I acknowledge that he is one of the few people in this parliament who has direct experience in this field. He also, I think, provides an important analysis that is largely lacking in what we get from the rest of the chamber. The only strong disagreement I had with Senator Heffernan's speech was with his faith that, if we go after the north, we will not simply make the same mistakes we have been making for 100 years. I think that difference is probably fairly well understood. 


The other thing that Senator Heffernan said was that this bill is premature. I thought what we just heard from Senator Heffernan was a ringing endorsement of exactly why this bill should be brought on today and I will be sorry to see him sitting on the other side of the chamber when we come to a vote, because, with a few exceptions such as Senator Heffernan, all we hear is the polar opposite point of view. We heard that polar opposite view from our Western Australian colleague Senator Mark Bishop a little bit earlier on in the debate. He just waved his hands and said: 'This is all good. Sell off the country as rapidly as possible with as little consideration, as little oversight, as possible.' That is, perhaps, a rather brutal paraphrasing of Senator Bishop. There was nothing in that speech at all that paid regard to the concerns that we are bringing to the table. We see it in the mismanagement of the mining boom under successive governments and we see it in the way foreign acquisitions of agricult­ural land in Australia are handled. 


I would like to congratulate Senators Milne and Xenophon for bringing this bill forward. It is not a barrier to free trade and it is not a barrier to foreign investment—that is not what we are proposing here. The bill seeks to implement some fairly common-sense changes to the legislative regime governing foreign acquisitions in this country—to strengthen protections of the national interest, to better define what we mean by that and to better equip legislators for decision making.


The major parties, apart from a few honourable exceptions, have not demon­strated any recognition at all of the challenges facing Australia with regard to investment by foreign entities or of the long-term problems that this parliament could face because other countries around the world are playing a longer game than us. The Chinese are playing a 100-year game. We are doing something completely different—we are governing in the interests of the next quarterly report or the next three-year electoral cycle. Other countries around the world are engaged in a deadly serious contest over resources, a contest to which Australia seems to simply insist on wearing a blindfold.


That is why it is important that we have the crossbenches, at least, putting some of these ideas into the public domain—there is precious little innovation coming from anywhere else. Foreign investment can have very positive economic effects, but with these come political consequences—they come with impacts on corporate governance, risks to competition and risks, perhaps most importantly, to food security. I think that each of these things should be strongly considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board before approvals for investments above a certain threshold are granted. Four per cent of our continent is considered good farming land and yet 45 million hectares of it has some level of foreign ownership. Eleven per cent of Australia's agricultural land has some level of foreign ownership and we cannot say where it is or what sectors it affects. One of the things that Senator Milne pointed out is that 31 per cent of Western Australia's water resources are foreign owned. I am simply raising something like that—a third of Western Australia's water resources, in the driest inhabited continent on the planet—to point out that perhaps we might want to introduce some kind of threshold test, some kind of mapping exercise, to work out who has bought it and where the ownership lies but we are accused of xenophobia. I find that counteraccusation absolutely offensive. This is not about xenophobia. It is about basic industry policy and good practice about knowing. If we are insisting on selling the farm, let us at least find out who we are selling it to.


The lack of information about the sectors affected is particularly problematic, because it opens up the possibility of a company or companies from one country completely dominating a particular section of Australian agriculture and cornering the market. Imagine if one foreign company or companies from one country owned, for example, all of Australia's banana plantations or all of Australia's orange groves. Without information about which farming land and what sectors of Australian agriculture are foreign owned, how can FIRB properly assess new investment proposals? How can we in this place and policy makers at all levels of government respond to growing foreign ownership without knowing where it is and what it entails? These are quite serious questions.


At the moment I think FIRB needs to monitor in particular a country's interest in specific sectors to make sure that various markets are not being cornered, to ensure that creeping acquisitions are not taking place which would quite negatively impact on our economy and on the ability of Australian companies to do business and employ Australians. According to Treasury, and this is something that I have spent a bit of time working on not necessarily just in the agricultural context, Australia's Foreign Investment Policy states:


The Government's approach to foreign investment policy is to encourage foreign investment consistent with community interests.


And:


The Government determines what is 'contrary to the national interest' by having regard to the widely held community concerns of Australians.


In 2008, the Treasurer released a set of six principles that are considered by FIRB in determining, on a case by case basis, whether particular investments by foreign governments and their agencies are consistent with Australia's 'national interest'. I will sketch what they are. FIRB needs to consider the following:


An investor's operations are independent from the relevant foreign government;


An investor is subject to and adheres to the law and observes common standards of business behaviour;


An investment may hinder competition or lead to undue concentration or control in the industry or sectors concerned;


An investment may impact on Australian Government revenue or other policies;


An investment may impact on Australia's national security; 


An investment may impact on the operations and directions of an Australian business, as well as its contribution to the Australian economy and broader community.


They are so broadly framed that I think they leave an awful lot to be desired and they need to be stricter and more explanation needs to be given to each criterion to ensure that a sharper assessment is made of what we mean by Australia's 'national interest', rather than having this ideological assumption that all investment from anywhere at all is good without considering the strategic implications or some of the strategic plans that other countries who take a longer view of things are obviously putting into play. 


Australian policy makers appear to have this innocent assumption that the market will provide and the market will look after us—and it will really won't. I think the guidelines should be incorporated into relevant legislation as to things like an investor's operations that are independent from the relevant foreign government. This is the issue that Senator Heffernan was speaking of: sovereign wealth funds or large industrial combines that are effectively owned and run by the Chinese government, to give just one example. They are playing a brand of capitalism different from what we play in Australia and from what we perhaps expect other countries to play.


The current threshold under which private foreign purchases of land in Australia need not be declared is an extraordinary $231 million. That is an enormous sum of money that can buy a vast amount of farming land. Until 1989 the threshold was $1 million. I know the cost of land has appreciated significantly since then, but not by 23,000 per cent. That has not been the increase. The threshold has, in fact, increased by 23,000 per cent if you take 1989 as your base year. That is an absurdly high threshold. It means we do not know what is going on. A foreign company or private citizen can purchase that much worth of farming land and then another and then another—ad nauseam—without the investments being declared or subject to a review by FIRB. So with these kinds of jigsaw acquisitions we are left in a position where enormous tracts of Australian farming land can be bought up.


Senator Milne pointed out, I think very strongly in her contribution to this debate, that this is not only an Australian problem necessarily; this is happening all over the world. Countries are looking just a little bit further down the kerb to see what food insecurity really means and are buying up farming land all over the world and essentially outsourcing their food-growing task. That is having serious implications on the food sovereignty of various countries around the world where access to decent food is simply not guaranteed. In Australia I think we do ourselves an enormous disservice by imagining that we should simply sit back and let this happen, as though we were some kind of Third World country with weak governance and no sense of strategy or industry policy. So I think one of the first things that we need is a lower cap on purchases not subject to declaration and review, to bring more of these acquisitions into question over some form of national interest test. We need data on foreign purchases of Australian farming land properly collated and retained and we need the weak guidelines to be strengthened and entrenched in law. New Zealand has a five-hectare threshold. Obviously, it is a smaller country but they have a five-hectare threshold and extensive data collation on foreign ownership of farm land. It has had no discernible detrimental impact on investment. That is the right thing for us to do now. It is the right thing to do for generations to come. This is not an anti-free-trade measure. This is a commonsense 'let's work out what's actually going on' measure. Our economic wellbeing and our food security absolutely depend on it.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2011-09-22,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:51):  I rise to speak against the private member's bill on foreign acquisitions of agricultural land sponsored by Senator Xenophon. From public discussion it is quite evident there are concerns from the community and, indeed, a level of apprehension about the level of foreign ownership and the level of foreign acquisitions of agricultural land. However, the government must remain responsible in their actions in dealing with this matter. As the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Bill Shorten, stated in the Weekend Australian on 10 September:


It is vital we protect the national interest and continue to strike the right balance between attracting foreign investment and ensuring agricultural and food security.


I think this is an eminently sensible view from the Assistant Treasurer and this is something that all Australians would like to see as the right outcome in regards to foreign acquisitions of agricultural land. That is why the government should not jump the gun in making significant changes without an adequate picture of the current impact of foreign investment in Australian agricultural land.


The push for regulation seems to be merely based on concerns and not on substantive data, obviously because of the limited data that has been available. The debate requires clear thinking for the government to get a full, historic and current picture of foreign investments in Australian agricultural land. It is greatly recognised that Australia has been able to benefit from foreign investments in all sectors of the economy, and making changes that potentially could discourage foreign investment would not be a smart move by any government. I know all Australians understand that foreign and domestic investment in Australia is vitally important to the economy. These investments support local jobs, economic growth and future prosperity. Any move that jumps the gun in this situation could lead to the discouragement of foreign investment and greatly impact on our already established free trade agreements.


That is why this government is taking this issue very seriously. We will continue to look into the issue meticulously so that we can better understand the situation at hand and have the adequate data needed to make any decisions necessary. The Labor government is committed to striking the balance that all Australians are seeking, which led the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation the Hon. Bill Shorten and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry the Hon. Joe Ludwig to commission the Australian Bureau of Statistics, along with the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and ABARES, to get a better picture of foreign investment in Australia's agriculture sector.


The Australian Bureau of Statistics research project was published on 9 September and showed that a very modest amount of Australia's agricultural industry is owned by foreign investors. The data was collected in March this year after the request was made in December last year. The results were quite surprising considering the level of perceived foreign or business ownership of agricultural land. The result of the publication showed that 99 per cent of agricultural businesses in Australia are entirely Australian owned. The other headline figure was that 89 per cent of agricultural land was entirely Australian owned and, finally, 91 per cent of water entitlements were also entirely Australian owned. The ABS issued a media release which said:


The businesses reporting they were not fully Australian owned may have been either partially or entirely foreign owned and, as such the survey provides information about business, land and water entitlements by the extent of their foreign ownership.


We can dive further into the statistics which showed that only 5.8 per cent of land was owned by foreign investors, while the other 5.5 per cent of land that was foreign owned came from a minority stake of investors having less than 50 per cent ownership. From a South Australian perspective 87.9 per cent of agricultural land is entirely Australian owned with only 0.7 per cent in foreign hands with more than a 50 per cent stake in ownership. The slightly higher levels of foreign investment in South Australia can be assumed to be investments in our sheep, beef and grain farms. The ABS later stated:


The survey results are broadly comparable with levels of foreign ownership of agricultural businesses and land collected in the Agricultural Census of 1983-84. The ABS has not previously collected data on foreign ownership of agricultural water entitlements.


Considering this is the first time a study like this has been conducted in over 20 years this information is going to be vital in the ongoing debate on this topic. Along with the other commissioned reports, it will provide the government with an adequate picture of foreign acquisitions which this bill fails to consider.


The Senate Economics Committee report also made mention of the lack of data suitable for policy making decisions. When discussing the change to the threshold the committee commented:


… the current data gathering and research project should be completed before any adjustment to the threshold is made. Following the reporting of better data, the Foreign Investment Review Board figure should then be reviewed to allow for an appropriate threshold.


There must also be strong consideration given to the fact that Australia's foreign investment screening regime has continued along the path of a strong pro-investment stance. It is my understanding that most proposals are dealt with and approved within the first 30 days.


The government's policies are reflected to balance our interests and must remain balanced under commitments to free trade agreements and obligations to our trading partners. This government will continue to remain committed to ensuring our national interests are protected. That is why the government is waiting for the report to be completed by ABARES and RIRDC before the end of the year. These reports will look into the history and drivers of foreign investment in agriculture, and will also look into the impacts, drivers, structures and regulation of ownership in agriculture. The government feels this is the right course of action to take, especially when looking at the current situation of foreign ownership of agricultural businesses and land. Only after receiving these reports can the government be sure that any changes made will be consistent with a balanced approach. We on this side of the chamber feel and reiterate that the bill is jumping the gun, so to speak, by not taking into consideration many issues.


The Senate Economics Committee report into this bill also had additional issues that need to be addressed, which I am sure will continue to be brought up by this side of the chamber. These include: whether the current screening arrangements are actually inappropriate; that there is a significant advantage in retaining the inherent flexibility associated with a national interest test that is not overly prescriptive; how does this fit within the existing screening arrangements for the other investments into Australia. Creating a separate framework that applies exclusively to foreign acquisitions of agricultural land will create complexity and confusion both for Australian farmers and foreign investors; how will this impact on Australia's international obligations under Australia's free trade agreements; and all significant private as well as—

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (18:00):  Just to remind the chamber, this is a biannual report that is given to the parliament from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry recording numbers of cattle, sheep, buffalos and camels that are moved by sea and recording both survivals and mortalities. I remind the chamber that the mortality rate for the six-month period for the cattle that were exported from Australia by ship was 0.1 per cent, one in 1,000 animals. For sheep, it was 0.6 of one per cent, an improvement in fact on previous years and very much below the sorts of levels that would otherwise cause there to be any inquiries. 


People often ask what the mortality levels are for animals that remain at home on the farm. I would like to place on record that the figure for adult sheep and cattle in this country is two to three per cent and the figure for lambs and calves—younger animals—is somewhere between 10 and 15 per cent. The statistics show, very validly, that the mortality levels are incredibly low for stock which are moved by sea.


Interestingly, in my own experience and certainly in that of others, the actual gross weight of the consignment goes up during shipping because, in nearly all instances, adult sheep and cattle maintain body weight but younger animals, particularly, gain bodyweight. So the end customer actually gets more than 100 per cent of what they purchased.


The few minutes available to me enable me to actually reflect on the difficulty we are seeing in the north of Australia this year following the suspension of the live cattle trade. Estimates given to recent Senate inquiries are that somewhere between 80,000 and 160,000 cattle will now not leave Northern Australia. That number will be determined by, firstly, the onset of the wet season, at which time cattle very often cannot be moved off stations because the roads are not bitumen and, secondly, the capacity to get stock onto ships. It then raises the question: if those 80,000 to 160,000 cattle which normally would have gone up to the Indonesian market do not go, we are then faced with the prospect, unfortunately, of overstocking on the rangelands. This crop that would normally have gone or those that have gone are last year's calves. Their mothers are in the middle of calving or, in many instances, have now finished calving this year so, effectively, the animals that did not go will be competing with their mothers and their younger siblings, this year's calf crop, on the rangelands this year. 


Those are problems we will have to face for a couple of reasons. Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, you would know from your own experience in the Territory that there have been insufficient funds for many of the pastoralists to actually buy diesel fuel, needed for pumps that operate bores that supply water to stock. The second reason that we learnt of in one of the Senate inquiries was that the pastoralists, for example, did not have sufficient funds to purchase tarpaulins to cover the hay which would be used for supplementary feeding. So, as soon as the wet season starts, that hay will be spoilt and will be of no value.


This debate is, in some ways, relevant to the discussion we have just concluded on the Foreign Acquisitions Amendment (Agri­cultural Land) Bill 2010, because we are now seeing throughout the north of Australia that the average value of livestock has actually gone down by some 20 to 30 per cent, depending on whether they are steers or heifers. The actual value of the stock for the pastoralists has gone down. Added to that, nearly all of the land held across the north of Australia is leasehold land, not privately owned or titled land, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin. Therefore, we are facing a scenario in which the pastoralists have less equity in their stock and in their share of the land. This, unfortunately, opens up the entire market to overseas buyers to buy up both the unexpired portions of the leased stations and the cattle themselves at discounted prices. Much of the discussion earlier this afternoon was devoted to owned land or titled land, freehold land, in the south of Australia. We have heard discussion on the relevant merits or otherwise of the ABS statistics. A lot more work needs to be done on those. But here we have actually opened up the market for overseas buyers to come in and buy these properties and the stock at discounted prices. (Time expired)

Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (18:09):  I will continue my remarks on this report. Just to put it into context, obviously this is a bill which has been brought on to focus not only Australia but the rest of the world—it is the first time it has been dealt with by a parliament in the way it has in the Australian parliament—on the 35 years of flawed interpretation of patent law which is being acknowledged in the American court system and is now working its way up through that system. It will cost not only public health dearly with lack of research because of the monopolisation but also the future capacity of governments to fund public health. 


The Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee said:


The committee considers that the goals underpinning the national competition policy are well served by a patent policy that rigorously distinguishes between discoveries that advance our understanding of the nature, structure and properties of matter and the inventions that apply this understanding to useful products and processes, and obviously commercialisation. Within such a policy only the latter should qualify for patent protection. 


That is generally acknowledged by most people. There are one or two that do not and one or two who argue that the isolation of a gene makes it patentable, but of course there is no material difference between the gene in isolation and the gene in situ. The committee also said:


The distinction is vitally important not only to the people of Australia and the scientists who work and strive to help develop new diagnostics, medicines, therapeutics and hopefully cures but to the integrity of Australia's patents system. As the US said on the issue, the extent to which basic discoveries in genetics have been patented is a question of great importance to the national economy, to medical science and to the public health. 


And so it is to the Australian economy, to Australian science and the health of Australian people. It is only by chance that Australian women are not today facing the crisis facing women in the United States. Let me read a little from an article published last month in the New York Times:


In 2006, Professor King and colleagues published a paper showing that Myriad's test, known as the Comprehensive BRACAnalysis, actually failed to detect a significant number of genetic alterations in the two genes. 


Myriad then developed a test for these alterations. 


It did not fix the patent test it had.


But instead of incorporating it into its main product—


which cost $4,000 for the test because of the monopoly—


it offered it as a supplemental test at a price of $700. Many insurers do not pay for it, and therefore many women do not get it. 


Myriad's data shows that for Latina women in particular, 20 per cent of all mutations found are detectable only by the supplemental test. 


""The comprehensive testing they are advertising is not really comprehensive,"" said Ellen T. Matloff, director of cancer genetic counselling at Yale, who is also a plaintiff in the patent lawsuit. ""This would not happen in a competitive market. It simply would be unacceptable.""


More than 200 doctors, genetic counsellors and other health care professionals have signed an open letter to Myriad urging it to incorporate the supplemental testing into the main test. 


Kathleen Maxian says that if that had been done earlier, she might not be fighting for her life against ovarian cancer. 


Her sister developed breast cancer at age 40 about five years ago, but tested negative for mutations on Myriad's main test. She was not offered the supplemental test. 


Two years ago, Ms Maxian developed ovarian cancer. It turned out that both she and her sister had genetic alterations that were detectable only by the supplemental test. 


""If my sister had had that test and had gotten a positive result, I would have gone to a genetic counsellor and have been tested,"" said Ms Maxian, who is 49 and lives in Pendleton, NY, near Buffalo. She would then have had the option of having her ovaries removed to avoid getting ovarian cancer. 


""I don’t want to see this happen to anyone else,"" she said. ""Women should have this test.""


Before I sit, I implore you to read and study the dissenting report and to remember that the Australian patent system is not there for the benefit of sectoral interests which have deep pockets and have armies of lawyers and patent attorneys only too willing to look after their own interest. Rather it is there, if this is to be of any relevance in the 21st century, to balance the rights and interests of all Australians.


I will point out to the chamber what happened when Gene Technologies Ltd first got the licence for Australia, just as an instance of this particular patenting problem. Clearly bankers, lawyers, IP Australia and the industry do not want anyone to draw the line between what you can patent on the inventive side and what you cannot patent on the discovery side. It is a 'don't ask, don't tell' sort of a proposition. The federal Department of Health and Ageing agrees with what we are saying, that we have got to learn to draw this line. But the department of industry says, 'No, let's keep going—we are all going to get a big quid out of this.' When I rang the CEO of Genetic Technologies before we kicked this debate off—and I am eternally grateful to this parliament and to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, for letting us have this debate—he said to me, 'Bill, why are you doing this?' and I said, 'Because we should not have a patent on discoveries.' He said, 'We have offered our licence to Australia as a gift to the people of Australia, but you have just given a litigation lever to every public laboratory in Australia, putting them on notice to desist from testing for BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations and surrender all their data to the laboratory in Melbourne, as a monopoly.' He then said, 'That is a good thing for Australia. Lucky that we discovered that Myriad in America was breaching one of our patents and as part of the legal settlement they allowed us to do the testing under this licence in Australia. Otherwise we would have had to send all the samples back to America to be tested, as Japan has to do.' He also said, 'But we are going broke and we have got to call up all our capacity to earn money, so we are putting them all on notice that they have to surrender all their testing to us.' This is in a situation where the law clearly states that you can patent an invention that is unique, has a commercial purpose and has an inventive step. It clearly states that discovery work cannot be patented.


What we have done—and I have got truckloads of patents in my office if anyone wants to see them—is include the gene in the patent. All these patents would still be valid under what is proposed in this bill. All the inventive work would still be patented and commercialised, but the gene would be taken out so that someone else—say, Senator Chris Back's laboratory—could get access and would be able to do research without having to go to the phoney political solution, which is an exemption for research. In the case of the BRCA 2 test, which is a flawed test, what a hide Myriad America has, not to fix a flawed patented test that is proven to be not working but to include an extra test you have to go through to see if the flawed test did not pick you up. What a disgrace that is.


The department of industry are now arguing that you will get a licence to do experimental work. But if I hold the licence and I give Senator Chris Back's laboratory an exemption to do the research and his laboratory is smarter than mine and beats me to the prize for the inventive step and the commercialisation, he can come back to me and say, 'Now, Bill, can I have an exemption so that I can commercialise the thing, including the gene that you hold the patent for?' If I say yes, what does that say about the patent system? Why have I got the patent in the first place if I am going to give it away? If I say no he makes the point that the exclusivity and the monopoly and cartel thinking in all this is absolutely adding billions of dollars to public health. One patent alone cost $1.9 billion in licence fees because it included the gene, besides the inventive work.


My absolute plea to the Australian parliament and to everyone in the Australian parliament is to look at the facts in all their starkness and have the courage to say: 'Well, for 35 years the US government said to the US courts, ""We have made a mistake on the interpretation of patent law. Let's fix it so that we can fund public health in the future and look after the human race.""'

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-09-22,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (18:18):  I rise to speak on this matter as my colleague Senator Heffernan has—and I would never deal with his laboratory in such a desultory way, I can assure him! I think it goes to an absolutely critically important point, and that is that naturally occurring biological features or phenomena, such as genes or anything of that nature, should not be patentable. They are not an invention; they are a discovery, and I think it is absolutely critical that we go back to basics in this particular regard.


People will say, 'Well, where is the incentive for medical research?' We know that it is horrifically expensive, we know it is time consuming and we know that the proportion of chemicals tested that ever actually come to fruition is very low. But I want to make one point particularly strongly, in support of the comments made by the previous speaker, and that is that in the inventive side there is plenty of scope. I say again that the isolation of a gene, a gene sequence, chromosomes or whatever of themselves should not be patentable, because they are merely the discovery of a naturally occurring phenomenon. But the difference arises here: if a research organisation, a company, a group of researchers, a university or whoever were to modify that gene sequence, were to add value to it, were to establish a test to which those genes could be subjected to establish whether or not a member of a family, a person, an animal, a plant or whatever may have genes that are defective, of course that does constitute invention. It constitutes adding of value. It constitutes something upon which protection should be afforded to the research organisation or company.


Going further, if that group were to develop a vaccine that would allow for the control or even the prevention of that disease, it is patently obvious that it should be patentable, but not the original gene sequence itself. If that company, university, group or individual were to go to the expense of developing pharmaceuticals for the purpose of treating a disease that may arise as a result of those gene sequences, again you can see the logic of that. Surely that is where we as lawmakers should be directing our efforts here in Australia. Also, we should be encouraging those overseas, as indeed we are seeing in the United States and Japan and other jurisdictions, where they have come to realise that patents were handed out far too easily for what were actually discoveries of natural phenomena.


I do not want to speak for much longer on this, except to reflect on how far we have now come from the early days of medical research, where there was tremendous sharing of information. One can go back to Pierre and Marie Curie, when they first looked at and came to discover microscopic organisms. They were, of course, the subject of derision amongst the scientific community. But imagine if in those days they had gone and put a patent on the discovery of bacteria. Where would we be? Think of Fleming and his co-workers and the discovery of penicillin. The only reason it was discovered was that an agar plate was left out over the weekend. When Monday morning came along there was this unusual looking growth on it. They said, 'What is it? Let's throw it out. No, let's not throw it out; let's examine it.' The end result of that, of course, was the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin because someone discovered a bare area within all of the moss that was growing. That bare area was the substrate of that antibiotic. Let us imagine for a moment that, instead of sharing that with the world's scientific and medical community, Fleming and his co-workers had said, 'The best thing we can do here is put a patent on this and make sure that nobody else gets access to it.' If we go to polio and its vaccines, we are now so close to eradicating that in this world, including through the oral vaccine—the so-called Sabin vaccine.


My concern is for protecting the goodwill of the past that had such a profound effect on human health and in getting on top of so many of those infectious diseases that killed so many people in the world. I remind people again that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 killed more people than died during the course of the First World War from military related activity. So we must surely protect that and ensure that we do not move away from that international goodwill that has always existed, that international goodwill that has allowed the sharing of information around the world to allow scientific peers in other places of the world to replicate and validate the work done by other scientists for the good of humanity, whether in human disease, animal disease, plant disease or whatever. We are facing a crisis. The last thing we need is a sense of protectionism.


But, at the same time, I recognise, as everybody must, that the cost of research is horrifically expensive. The proportion of pharmaceuticals that ever get to the market and yield a return for their developers is very small. Whilst we must accept the commercial reality, we must continue to encourage research and researchers. We should not ever get to the stage where naturally occurring phenomena—genes, gene sequences, chromosomes et cetera—are the subject of a patent on behalf of any person because they or someone associated with them happened to discover it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

What we have done—and I have got truckloads of patents in my office if anyone wants to see them—is include the gene in the patent. All these patents would still be valid under what is proposed in this bill. All the inventive work would still be patented and commercialised, but the gene would be taken out so that someone else—say, Senator Chris Back's laboratory—could get access and would be able to do research without having to go to the phoney political solution, which is an exemption for research. In the case of the BRCA 2 test, which is a flawed test, what a hide Myriad America has, not to fix a flawed patented test that is proven to be not working but to include an extra test you have to go through to see if the flawed test did not pick you up. What a disgrace that is.


The department of industry are now arguing that you will get a licence to do experimental work. But if I hold the licence and I give Senator Chris Back's laboratory an exemption to do the research and his laboratory is smarter than mine and beats me to the prize for the inventive step and the commercialisation, he can come back to me and say, 'Now, Bill, can I have an exemption so that I can commercialise the thing, including the gene that you hold the patent for?' If I say yes, what does that say about the patent system? Why have I got the patent in the first place if I am going to give it away? If I say no he makes the point that the exclusivity and the monopoly and cartel thinking in all this is absolutely adding billions of dollars to public health. One patent alone cost $1.9 billion in licence fees because it included the gene, besides the inventive work.


My absolute plea to the Australian parliament and to everyone in the Australian parliament is to look at the facts in all their starkness and have the courage to say: 'Well, for 35 years the US government said to the US courts, ""We have made a mistake on the interpretation of patent law. Let's fix it so that we can fund public health in the future and look after the human race.""'

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (18:18):  I rise to speak on this matter as my colleague Senator Heffernan has—and I would never deal with his laboratory in such a desultory way, I can assure him! I think it goes to an absolutely critically important point, and that is that naturally occurring biological features or phenomena, such as genes or anything of that nature, should not be patentable. They are not an invention; they are a discovery, and I think it is absolutely critical that we go back to basics in this particular regard.


People will say, 'Well, where is the incentive for medical research?' We know that it is horrifically expensive, we know it is time consuming and we know that the proportion of chemicals tested that ever actually come to fruition is very low. But I want to make one point particularly strongly, in support of the comments made by the previous speaker, and that is that in the inventive side there is plenty of scope. I say again that the isolation of a gene, a gene sequence, chromosomes or whatever of themselves should not be patentable, because they are merely the discovery of a naturally occurring phenomenon. But the difference arises here: if a research organisation, a company, a group of researchers, a university or whoever were to modify that gene sequence, were to add value to it, were to establish a test to which those genes could be subjected to establish whether or not a member of a family, a person, an animal, a plant or whatever may have genes that are defective, of course that does constitute invention. It constitutes adding of value. It constitutes something upon which protection should be afforded to the research organisation or company.


Going further, if that group were to develop a vaccine that would allow for the control or even the prevention of that disease, it is patently obvious that it should be patentable, but not the original gene sequence itself. If that company, university, group or individual were to go to the expense of developing pharmaceuticals for the purpose of treating a disease that may arise as a result of those gene sequences, again you can see the logic of that. Surely that is where we as lawmakers should be directing our efforts here in Australia. Also, we should be encouraging those overseas, as indeed we are seeing in the United States and Japan and other jurisdictions, where they have come to realise that patents were handed out far too easily for what were actually discoveries of natural phenomena.


I do not want to speak for much longer on this, except to reflect on how far we have now come from the early days of medical research, where there was tremendous sharing of information. One can go back to Pierre and Marie Curie, when they first looked at and came to discover microscopic organisms. They were, of course, the subject of derision amongst the scientific community. But imagine if in those days they had gone and put a patent on the discovery of bacteria. Where would we be? Think of Fleming and his co-workers and the discovery of penicillin. The only reason it was discovered was that an agar plate was left out over the weekend. When Monday morning came along there was this unusual looking growth on it. They said, 'What is it? Let's throw it out. No, let's not throw it out; let's examine it.' The end result of that, of course, was the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin because someone discovered a bare area within all of the moss that was growing. That bare area was the substrate of that antibiotic. Let us imagine for a moment that, instead of sharing that with the world's scientific and medical community, Fleming and his co-workers had said, 'The best thing we can do here is put a patent on this and make sure that nobody else gets access to it.' If we go to polio and its vaccines, we are now so close to eradicating that in this world, including through the oral vaccine—the so-called Sabin vaccine.


My concern is for protecting the goodwill of the past that had such a profound effect on human health and in getting on top of so many of those infectious diseases that killed so many people in the world. I remind people again that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 killed more people than died during the course of the First World War from military related activity. So we must surely protect that and ensure that we do not move away from that international goodwill that has always existed, that international goodwill that has allowed the sharing of information around the world to allow scientific peers in other places of the world to replicate and validate the work done by other scientists for the good of humanity, whether in human disease, animal disease, plant disease or whatever. We are facing a crisis. The last thing we need is a sense of protectionism.


But, at the same time, I recognise, as everybody must, that the cost of research is horrifically expensive. The proportion of pharmaceuticals that ever get to the market and yield a return for their developers is very small. Whilst we must accept the commercial reality, we must continue to encourage research and researchers. We should not ever get to the stage where naturally occurring phenomena—genes, gene sequences, chromosomes et cetera—are the subject of a patent on behalf of any person because they or someone associated with them happened to discover it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (18:36):  This evening I would like to speak about the work of the LBW Trust. Anyone with a cursory knowledge of cricket knows that LBW stands for leg before wicket. While the LBW Trust has been established by cricket lovers and is doing great work in cricket-playing developing countries, as far as the LBW Trust is concerned the letters LBW stand for Learning for a Better World. The LBW Trust was established in 2006. Its mission statement says: 


Our aim is to assist poor students from cricket-playing countries to complete their tertiary education. Our hope is that these young men and women will play their part in the upliftment of their countries. 


Many international cricketers who have toured the subcontinent or Africa have become aware of and concerned about the more limited educational opportunities that students from nations such as India, Pakistan and Zimbabwe have. And we are all aware of the importance of education in achieving positive change in the lives of individuals and communities.


It was John F. Kennedy who said:


Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. … The human mind is our fundamental resource.


The LBW Trust believes education is the way to a better future, not just for the young people the trust sponsors but also for their families and the communities that they live in. The trust plays its part by supporting students in developing countries who otherwise would not have the opportunity of receiving tertiary education. It is worthy of note that the LBW Trust is unusual in that it has no operating expenses or overheads whatsoever; it is run entirely by volunteers, and the money it raises goes directly to help educate the students it supports.


The trust is currently supporting 261 students, and it acts in partnership with local NGOs in those countries where it operates: Uganda, India, Pakistan and South Africa. Students supported by the trust study everything from bricklaying and motor mechanics to teaching, nursing and the law. LBW Trust supported students in South Africa come mainly from Zimbabwe. There are many success stories to tell, including one student who is now doing postgraduate work in Canada. A number of LBW students have returned to work in Zimbabwe. One is starting a small farm, another is working in cricket and yet another is involved in a chicken business. Currently, the LBW Trust has scholars at Durham University and Oklahoma university, and two of its students have qualified as lawyers.


In Pakistan, the trust is assisting the students of Namal College—set up by Pakistani cricketing great Imran Khan—where particular emphasis is given to supporting the tertiary education of girls. The LBW Trust has also collaborated with the Sustainable Peace and Development Organisation, known to some as SPADO, to further the education in Peshawar of five young women who come from the troubled Swat valley in Pakistan. In Pakistan, the LBW Trust is helping to educate, in total, over 25 students—most of them girls.


In Uganda, the trust is working with an impressive Australian based NGO called One Village, set up by a young woman from Adelaide called Nikki Lovell. There it is helping to educate 25 young men and women. In India, the LBW Trust has about 150 students, a majority of them girls, and it is working through two NGOs: Prerana Nurture Merit and the Vikash Educational and Charitable Trust. These students come from desperately poor family backgrounds, and an education is essential for them to have any real chance of building a better life.


The trust's board boasts an impressive batting order of corporate players, major accounting firm partners, solicitors, journalists, trainers and farmers. They include Malcolm Alder, Tom Bowes, Mike Coward, Ron Holmes, Harley Medcalf, Kelsey Munro, Lyn O'Brien, Peter Strain, David Vaux and the indefatigable chairman of the trust, Mr Darshak Mehta, who has been such a driving force behind its work.


The patrons of the organisation also have a few runs on the board. Three of the trust's patrons have 25,455 test match runs between them: the former Australian captains Greg Chappell and Adam Gilchrist, and the current Indian test batsman Rahul Dravid—the second highest run scorer in test cricket history. Other patrons include Sir William Deane, Malcolm Fraser, General Peter Cosgrove, Ian MacFarlane, Rodney Cavalier, Basil Sellers, Malcolm Speed and Maurice Newman. I am a former director of the trust but I too now have the honour of serving as a patron.


It is important also to acknowledge that, at annual dinners and other LBW Trust events, a number of noted Australian and inter­national cricket captains have volunteered their time and support: Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell, Steve Waugh, Bill Lawry, Adam Gilchrist, David Gower, Sir Ian Botham and Sir Richard Hadlee. Theirs has been a most generous and important contribution to the work of the LBW Trust.


Cricket is a game played by rich nations and poor nations. It is a game where kids from Indian slums or Caribbean ghettos can play alongside against those from immeasurably more privileged backgrounds, those who have had all of the advantages and opportunities we in Australia sometimes take for granted. Through the work of the LBW Trust, Australians, and particularly Aust­ralian cricket lovers, can play their part in helping others in much less fortunate circumstances achieve their potential. Tonight, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate all those who have worked so hard to establish the LBW Trust, who have been so committed to seeing its important work around the world become a reality.
