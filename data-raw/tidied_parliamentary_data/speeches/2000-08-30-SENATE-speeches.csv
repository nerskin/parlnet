"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-08-30,"—This is the third chance I have had to address the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000. I have been interrupted on previous occasions because I have run out of time. However, let me use the remaining two minutes that it appears are left to me to make this point: the opposition have moved two amendments to the second reading, and I do commend them to this chamber. The first amendment is of course referring to the slowness with which the government has acted—and the confusion which has charac-terised its actions—on dealing with fuel substitution. One of the witnesses to the inquiry into this bill reported that the cost to revenue per annum is in the order of $300 million. One only needs to think about what the alternative socially valuable uses of $300 million would be in our community to see what a crime it is not to move to staunch a revenue drain of that order. It is therefore appropriate that this chamber record our views on the government not acting prom-ptly and thus allowing the revenue to run down in this manner. 
My other amendment refers to the current public concern manifested in the media—but most strongly felt in the Australian community—that petrol prices are out of control, that this government has options open to it to alleviate the pain of motorists, that there is now excessive taxation at the bowser and that the government has open to it measures that it could take to relieve that weight on the community. Bear in mind that higher petrol prices exhibit themselves in higher prices everywhere, adding to higher inflation, and the inflation level is what is used to adjust the excise. So when you have higher prices you end up getting higher excise as well, and this is an upwardly sustaining spiral.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-30,"—The Democrats share the concerns of the government and the opposition about the substitution of lower excise petroleum products for transport fuels. The Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000 seeks to address this practice as a matter of urgency. Besides the fact that not gathering revenue which should be gathered means that there is lower funding available for schools, hospitals and other services, the practice of substituting fuels for on-road use has the potential to damage vehicle engines and put consumers at risk. It also advantages those who run these corrupt practices versus those who do not in the business of supply-ing petroleum products.
The Democrats are broadly supportive of the measures contained in the bill but believe that more needs to be done if we are to address the issue of fuel substitution in a comprehensive and effective manner. Specifically, the Democrats support the mea-sure contained in the bill to replace current references to specific petroleum product categories with a generic definition of `petroleum product'. That is a reform which we think is overdue and in fact is a very intelligent one.
The change will not affect the way excise is levied or the amount payable. However, it will enable the government and the ATO to act more swiftly to close off a taxation loophole when they become aware that it is being exploited. The Democrats also support the measures in the bill that will assist the government in effectively prosecuting offenders under the act. This includes the elimination of the need to prove an owner-ship trail of fuel back to original suppliers in order to prosecute an offence. Other measures will enable evidentiary certi-ficates to be admissible in court in the same way that they are admissible in prosecutions for trading in narcotic drugs. In relation to the tracing of the suppliers of fuel, the Senate hearings into the matter were particularly illuminating. To enable those who evade tax to do so they need to be very significantly resourced. We discovered that they have large tankers, that they have access to large fuel tank supplies and that they can be relatively easily identified. I think the point is that the exercise of catching these people needs to be pursued with greater vigour.
We have concerns that the ATO are presently not fulfilling the role of having a physical presence in the industry and are taking a more hands-off approach which is, therefore, insufficient to inhibit these rackets. I contrast the ATO's activities in this area with the activities they intend on the tobacco side, where they are going to have very much a hands-on role. Considering the level of revenue that the ATO gain from fuel excise, the act of ensuring compliance needs to be taken far more seriously. In our view, this obviously means ensuring that the ATO have the resources to and can conduct an adequate level of testing. This includes testing fuel for substitution and also looking at how they can address the practice of people avoiding excise by delivering the petrol at a high temperature. The problem we face, as the ATO and others clearly outlined to us in the hearing, is that there is some inconsistency and contradiction around who should be responsible for testing and whether it is a state or an ATO function. That needs to be resolved otherwise we will never properly get on top of this thing. 
To improve compliance, legislated fuel standards are needed, in our view. Currently it is difficult or virtually impossible for the state fair trading bodies to make a case on fuel substitution because the current fuel standard is too broad and has no legislative legs. The Australian Democrats have the belief that substitution rackets will not stop unless those who are involved are left with less space to move. Simply placing markers in the fuel and lifting excise on all products is insufficient to stop the current substitution rackets. We strongly support the develop-ment of a legally binding standard governing the content of petrol. Without this, it will always be difficult to prosecute substitution activities through trade practices legislation. 
The Australian Institute of Petroleum have supported the need for a legislated fuel stan-dard. Other bodies have commented on the difficulties of prosecuting fuel substitution offenders without a standard. We think, therefore, that those bodies which are expert in these areas should combine to make a recommendation for a standard which is capable of being legislatively applied. Professor Allan Fels, the Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Com-mission, commented on the issue at a recent parliamentary committee hearing, when he said:
We ran a case a few years ago on fuel substitution where we thought it was occurring illegally. It was a very, very difficult case to win. We had to prove in court that the fuel was no good. In the end it was not possible to prove it. It might sound simple, but I am afraid it is quite the opposite.
That quote comes from the draft transcript of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry and public hearing into the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999 and multisite franchising of 15 March 2000. He made the point—and I think we should pay attention to it—that it is not an issue as to whether the fuel is good or not; it is an issue as to whether it is of the correct legislated standard. That legislated standard has to be attacked from the point of view of what it means in terms of revenue consequences. The purpose of a legislated standard is threefold: firstly, to provide proper fuel for the running of very sophisticated engines; secondly, to ensure that, from an environmental perspective, the fuel is as least harmful as possible; and, thirdly—and, from the point of view of the ATO, perhaps most importantly—to provide a base for the proper generation of excise revenues. That is why, in my view, we need to attend to the legislated standard.
I want now, in my very brief remarks in this second reading debate, to turn to Senator Cook's second reading amendment. He asks in item (a):
... that the Senate condemns the Government for its failure to take any responsibility for sky rocketing petrol prices ...
I am not sure that they have failed to take any responsibility. They have recognised and acknowledged that, if petrol is at 80c and the GST is at 10 per cent, the GST impost will be 8c. If petrol is at $1, at 10 per cent the GST impost rises to 10c. It is a simple mathematical equation to see that a rise in petrol price does generate additional GST revenue, and the government have accepted that. What the government have also said, however, is that the principal responsibility for skyrocketing petrol prices lies with the OPEC increases: the price has moved from $US11 a barrel to $US33 a barrel, and the forecast is $US50 a barrel. Frankly, the government should act as strongly as it can in the international arena to try to persuade OPEC to bring its prices down, but that is a different matter from condemning the government for its failure to take any responsibility at all for skyrocketing petrol prices. The second part of the amendment reads: 
... condemns the Prime Minister for promising that petrol prices would not rise as a result of the GST when he had no intention of keeping this promise ...
The Democrats think the Prime Minister was seemingly foolish to make a promise which sounded like he could hold petrol prices down. Petrol prices will go up and down according to the vagaries of the market. What we have been most concerned with is that we believe there should be up to 1½c per litre off the price and the government should have honoured its original promise, but that would not make a vast difference to the price rising as a result of OPEC price increases. Nevertheless, there is the point there that, if you make a promise, you should keep it, and the Democrats are strongly of the opinion that there is up to 1½c a litre of broken promise in that price.
The third aspect put in the amendment by the Labor Party is a very political one. It notes:
... the total failure of the National Party to ensure that the country-city fuel price differential did not get worse as a result of the GST.
That positions the National Party as clearly a country party and not a city party. It also says that their prime obligation in government is to fight for the country and that the specific government commitment was that the country-city fuel price differential would not get worse as a result of the GST. The fact is that the country-city fuel price differential has got worse. The difference, however, is not primarily a result of the GST. The difference is primarily a result of the pricing policies of the oil companies, the wholesalers and the retailers, based on the prices they receive which they deliver.
So, in all, whilst we have some sympathy with some elements of this amendment, we think it is framed for a political purpose—that may seem an odd thing to say in the Senate, because most things are framed for a political purpose. If its language had been a little more moderate and a little more sensitive to the realities of the situation, we would have taken a different view, but we think we should oppose it.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM EXCISE AMENDMENT (MEASURES TO ADDRESS EVASION) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-08-30,"—Before I get to the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000 itself, I would like to take a couple of minutes to deal with some matters that Senator Murray raised at the end of his contribution—in particular, when he was addressing our amendment which was moved by Senator Cook. I would like to point out to the Senate and to Senator Murray that the issue is not that the government recognises that petrol prices have increased and are hurting people; the issue is that the government made, and the Democrats supported, a promise that the GST would not add to the cost of fuel—not world oil prices and not the excise, but the GST. That is the bottom line. Senator Murray, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, the GST has added significantly to the cost of petrol. Nobody can deny that world crude oil prices affect the retail cost of petrol. That has been the case forever, but the government and the Democrats promised the Australian people that the GST would not add to the cost of petrol. 
For the information of the Senate and Senator Murray, I would just like to say that, if we had no GST today—that is, if we only had the excise applying to petrol—the tax take on petrol would be about 44.8c per litre. I think that is relevant today, because I actually got this information on Monday. What has happened is that at a particular point in time the government reduced the excise on fuel by 6.7c a litre. The other smokescreen being promoted by the government about world oil prices is that at the time the government set its strike rate the crude oil price was in the order of $US32 and something per barrel—I just cannot remember the specific figure. The strike rate was taken, if my memory serves me correctly, from 99.9c per litre. 
—I notice Senator Crane walking out the door making some comment. It is a pity he does not come in here and represent the people of Western Australia, particularly those out in the rural areas of Western Australia. Even his own state government is screaming about the GST impact on the price of fuel at the pump for motorists. 
This issue is very important for rural and regional areas of Australia, because the GST is having an even greater impact in the rural areas of this country. I noticed that the price in one country area was around $1.06 a litre. If you look at the price differential between the country and city where you had, say, fuel at Broken Hill for $1.06 a litre and fuel in Sydney for $1 a litre, you see that the GST impact is much greater for the country and it is adding to the price differential between city and country prices. There is no doubt about that. I am not quite sure how the government can claim that that is not the case.
The tax take on petrol before the introduction of the GST was 44.8c per litre. If you reduce the excise on fuel by 6.7c per litre, the tax take will be 38.1c per litre. If you add the GST on a strike rate of $1.06, you will find that the price differential will be something like 5c a litre. That is what the sums add up to. That is the problem confronting the people in the country, let alone the people in the city. If the price of petrol is anything above $1, the impact of the GST is nearly 3c a litre. The Democrats have continually tried to defend the government because they are part of this problem. They helped create it. They accepted what the government said, as did the Australian public. They accepted a promise, a commitment from the Prime Minister, who loves to be known as honest John Howard. 
With regard to the overall problem, of course we are moving a second reading amendment. Why wouldn't we? Our responsibility in this place is to ensure that the government keeps the commitments it has made over and over again. Even as recently as 23 August, the Treasurer said in an interview on the Today program that the GST did not add anything to the pump price. I challenge the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer or any member of the government, the National Party—whose members seem to have disappeared into the ether, along with the promise that the GST would not add anything to the price of petrol—and the Democrats to stand up in parliament and explain how the GST has not contributed to the pump price of petrol, because it has.
The Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000 that we have before us, which has finally made its way into this chamber—it has been coming for nearly two or three years, from memory—is not going to address the problem. Nevertheless, the scope of the bill is confined to the Commonwealth's testing for the presence of the marker in fuel. Legislative changes in January 1998 required a chemical marker to be added by manufacturers, who are licensed for excise purposes, to fuels attracting a concessional rate. The use of the marker was to enhance detection in instances where fuels which attracted reduced or no excise were blended with, or substituted for, petrol which attracted the full excise. 
The bill introduces amendments to seven acts; namely, the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act 1988, the Excise Act 1901, the Excise Tariff Act 1901, the Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997, the Fuel Misuse (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997, the Fuel Sale (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997, and the Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Act 1997. The bill will amend the first six acts to replace references to specific excise tariff items with generic descriptions. This means that the excise tariff may be amended quickly to discourage substitution of various products for higher excise fuel. The bill will amend the Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Act 1997 to improve the ability of the government to prosecute those that are undertaking the practice of fuel substitution. This is done by changing the definition of `fuel' to cover a broader range of products, allowing the use of evidentiary certificates to facilitate prosecutions for fuel substitution offences, and removing the requirement for the ATO to show that the alleged illegally blended fuel has entered into home consumption. 
They are interesting objectives, but let us look at the case of toluene. I referred to the increase in toluene imports during the debate on the customs and excise tariff amendment bills. Most of the toluene used in fuel substitution is imported, and I find it amazing that Customs thought the increase in toluene imports was due to a lot more house painting going on today than there was yesterday. They did not pay too much attention to the volume of imports. That is why, despite the intent, the objectives, of the legislation, I am concerned about how we are going to make this work if we do not have the people on the ground and we do not have a strategy for the application of the measures. 
Again, let me refer to the increase in toluene imports. In 1989 toluene imports consisted of only 394,127 litres. In 1998 it was 13.9 million litres. But it did not stop there. The substituters were well and truly into the racket here. By 1999 imports went up to 20.9 million litres. For January alone this year, it was 6.5 million litres. But no bells rang for anybody in Customs or the Taxation Office. They just thought the increase in toluene imports meant more house painting. I find that quite amazing. It was a known fact to Customs and the Taxation Office—if it was not, it ought to have been—that the domestic paint industry was primarily supplied, as is evidenced by these figures, from domestic manufacturers of toluene. Shell Oil was probably the only refiner of toluene. It essentially provided all the toluene that was needed for the domestic market. I cannot understand how imports could increase from 394,000 litres to 20 million litres—and 6.5 million litres in one month—and nobody switched on. That raises some serious questions as to how effective these amendments to address petroleum excise evasion will be.
In evidence to the committee, Liberty Oil raised the substitution issues with the department and the minister some 18 months ago. Liberty Oil sent a letter to Senator Kemp on 22 June 1999, enclosing a copy of a letter to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Vanstone, raising their concerns associated with just the toluene problem in fuel substitution. Yet little or no action was taken. I hope when the minister gets up he will address some of these issues, and I hope they will be addressed when we go into the committee stage of this bill. Frankly, there would seem to be little point in us passing further measures to combat excise evasion and fuel substitution if the ones that we already have are not working because people are not doing anything about them.
Not only have the government foisted the problem of the high cost of fuel upon the Australian public, they have been allowing a major substitution problem to continue. It is one that is not only detrimental to the environment but is having, and has had, a significant impact on the motor vehicles that people drive. As motorists, when we buy our fuel some of us might buy Shell or BP and be very much name brand specific; but I buy it at the nearest fuel station whenever the fuel tank is empty, and I often consider the price. I noticed a very interesting trick that one service station was running in my home state. Given that the price of leaded and unleaded fuel was over $1.03 a litre, it had only the price of diesel on the price board, which was 99.9c per litre. I could not read the word `diesel'. The price board had `99.9c per litre' up there, and I thought this is good—cheap fuel. I drove in, got out, put the nozzle in the car and then looked at the bowser—it was $1.03.
—Get Felsie on the job!
—Yes. Not only have the government foisted upon the Australian public a GST cost impost of at least 3c a litre—and I heard someone say yesterday that in some parts of the country petrol was $1.33, so that is probably about an 8c a litre cost impost from the GST alone; they have allowed this substitution racket to go on, and it is still going on. It is a major problem, and it has the potential to cost motorists as a result of damage to the engines of their cars. The point I was making with regard to buying fuel is that, unless you know specifically where you buy that fuel, you cannot make a claim for damages. I think that was pointed out by Senator Murray. 
One of the problems associated with this is that there is really no specific specification for fuel. This is another matter that the government will have to address. If you are going to have measures with regard to evasion of excise and fuel substitution, then you will have to tighten up the specification for fuel. It is too broad. The evidence that was heard by the committee when it dealt with this bill clearly went to some of those problems. The Victorians, who have been conducting some tests, clearly showed the problems associated from both a jurisdictional point of view and specification point of view. They showed that current specification simply does not work. Whilst we will be supporting this bill and moving second reading amendments, the government has to address the problems associated with these matters. If specification is not tightened up or an appropriate specification not developed for fuel, it could be taken to court and argued that substitution is taking place. There is too much flexibility in the various products that are used to make up unleaded fuel. It has to be tightened up.
Finally, can I say that, despite the attempt by the Democrats to avoid having an inquiry into petrol prices and the price differential, particularly between the rural and city areas of this country, it will happen. There is already a reference before the Senate economics committee, and it has an obligation as part of that reference to check that. So we will check those things, and we will come back in here and report to this parliament on things that the Democrats are denying the Australian public.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM EXCISE AMENDMENT (MEASURES TO ADDRESS EVASION) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-08-30,"—It is not bad enough that petrol pump prices are now well over $1 a litre in most areas of Australia: it is a disgrace that consumers cannot be guaranteed that what they are paying for is actually 100 per cent petrol. Labor, as has already been said, is not opposed to the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000. In fact, it is a positive sign that this government is finally doing something about fuel substitution. Since it began to tackle this problem, the government has dropped the ball at each and every opportunity. It seems that, as the government moves to close a loophole, another one is soon opened up by those intent on illegal fuel substitution and excise evasion. This has not happened because the government is unable to fix the problem but is due to the unwillingness of the government to do so. The consequences have been higher maintenance costs for vehicles, for those unfortunate enough to be purchasing the polluted fuels, and a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars to the taxpayer in unpaid excise.
Petroleum substitution is one of the most dangerous of illegal practices and generally has two serious outcomes. Firstly, it can cause great damage to motor vehicles that use the substitute fuel; secondly, it severely undermines public confidence to the extent that people in Australia are unsure of whether the fuel is safe and is what they are paying for. The Commonwealth government has a responsibility to ensure the quality and safety of fuel on behalf of consumers. So far this government has taken several different approaches, but none have worked. In 1998 Minister Truss promised that the government's measures would stamp out fuel substitution, but it is clear that it is still continuing today. What has occurred since then is that unscrupulous operators have exploited the difference between the rates of fuels by mixing and substituting fuels. This is done by mixing non-transport fuels carrying a lower excise or no excise at all with excisable transport fuels, such as petrol.
This become clear in the recent Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. In evidence given by Liberty Oil Pty Ltd to this inquiry, it was established that the practice of fuel substitution was continuing unabated. Liberty Oil had made several complaints to both the Australian Tax Office and the Australian Customs Service, through Minister Vanstone, about evidence of fuel substitution. The government was extremely tardy in dealing with their complaints. During this inquiry I asked in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee both the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs Service about who had responsibility for carrying out the govern-ment's wishes and ensuring that consumers were not harmed by fuel substitution. Mr Jackson from the Australian Taxation Office said: 
Our legislation does not empower us to deal with the quality of fuel. If people want to mix half a litre of water with half a litre of petrol and say that is petrol and, if they pay the excise on it, they have paid the excise.
So, as far as the tax office was concerned, as long as they got the money they did not care what was in the tank. As long as the money was paid, what was in the tank was irrelevant. Mr Burns from the Australian Customs Service said in response to the same question:
I think the point is that it was a responsibility of either other Commonwealth agencies or state governments.
What became abundantly clear to me was that no-one was willing to take responsibility for the problem. Both of the two responsible government authorities were passing the buck. Another concern was that the Australian Taxation Office was adamant that fuel testing was a low priority, in their view, and would achieve little. They believed that the solution would be found through pursuit of excise on the relevant products. In my view, this is a weak response to this problem.
It is bad enough that fuel substitution is taking place; what is much worse is that little or nothing is being done about it. Both agencies complained that they did not have the power to carry out Minister Truss's instructions of 1998. There was nothing they could do about stamping out these dangerous practices, because they did not have the power. In 1998 the Taxation Office and Customs lacked either the capacity or the will to implement the wishes of the government. Instead of them taking action that was crucial at that time, we saw Assistant Treasurer Kemp attempting to evade responsibility for this issue and blaming it on the states. Minister Kemp was content to explain away the problem as being a state issue, with the federal government bearing no responsibility for the issue. It was one of the double acts that we are getting used to from this government. Minister Truss announces that the government is cracking down on fuel substitution and that operators will face penalties of up to $50,000 if they are caught in fuel substitution rorts. At the same time, Minister Kemp is denying that fuel substitution is a federal government concern and stating that it is a state government issue.
Since then, the government has changed its tune and has now realised that something needs to be done, otherwise fuel substitution will continue. Additional problems have arisen, due to the shifting of responsibility for fuel substitution testing between the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Taxation Office. In fact, since 12 July last year, when the tax office took over total control of fuel substitution from Customs, we found during the Economics Legislation Committee inquiry that a total of only 42 sites have been tested. Of those 42 testings, a total of eight instances of fuel substitution were discovered. This is confirmation that substitution is continuing. The Australian Taxation Office admitted that 20 per cent of the sites it has tested had tested positive for fuel substitution.
Compare that meagre number of 42 sites tested with the actions of Customs when they had responsibility for this in the previous year. Their annual report for 1998-99 reported that they had visited 551 test sites and had found 52 positive instances of fuel substitution. Again, during its period of responsibility, Customs detected a very serious level of fuel substitution. What did the government do about these results? It did nothing at all. Upon discovering this level of fuel substitution and transferring responsibility to the tax office, it reduced the number of tests. After the transfer of responsibility, the tax office had tested only 42 sites since 12 July last year. This is a 90 per cent reduction in the level of testing.
The real problem with fuel substitution is that the government is much more concerned with the implementation of the GST. It seems that any issue that was not GST related, however important it was, was overlooked or regarded as unimportant by this government. There is now an incredible and growing list of problems with this unfair GST and, to complement it, a growing list of unresolved problems that the government has failed to take action on, because of its preoccupation with the implementation of the GST. 
In the latest Senate Economics Committee inquiry into this bill, evidence given highlighted a range of issues that the government has failed to address. The most important of those issues was the broad range of support from operators for a national fuel standard. Fuel excise evasion, according to the evidence, is still occurring, and there are many different forms, including changing the temperature of petrol as well as substitution. The difficulty in prosecuting operators for fuel substitution was outlined by the Director of Consumer and Business Affairs Victoria when he stated:
The problem for us in achieving a successful prosecution of a retailer of contaminated fuel is that there is no mandatory standard for what actually constitutes petrol, so it is difficult for us to show that the consumer was misled about the fact that they were purchasing petrol because, whether or not the petrol is of a high standard, it is probably still petrol. Because there is no standard that has to be met, it becomes quite difficult for a successful prosecution to occur.
The evidence from both the industry and state government agencies clearly supported a national standard and a national approach to the whole petrol issue. A common problem is that petrol is manufactured in one state and delivered in another, making state government prosecutions difficult. 
Evidence was also raised about a 10-point plan developed by New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria at the Ministerial Council of Consumer Affairs to address the problems and coordinate a national solution. CBA Victoria described it as follows:
The 10-point plan was not just about fuel substitution, it was about fuel pricing generally, so there were a number of things that we wanted the ministerial council to urge the Commonwealth to take action on, and there was quite a bit of discussion about these points.
The evidence indicated that the Commonwealth government did not support this 10-point plan, and it is now off the agenda at least until next year. These initiatives, although outside the scope of this bill, should be immediately pursued by the government. 
Labor, in the minority report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, has noted these issues and recommended that there needs to be a federally based solution. It noted that:
The technical obstacles to testing against a possible national fuel standard are very considerable. This issue is also outside the scope of this Bill, which is confined to the Commonwealth's testing for the presence of the marker in fuel. Despite these difficulties, the idea of a national standard for fuel received wide support by witnesses and it would therefore be worth developing such a standard.
This bill aims to amend a number of acts, including the Excise Tariff Act, to provide some more lasting measures to combat fuel substitution. The definition of `fuel' will be changed to cover a broader range of products and remove the requirement for the Taxation Office to show that allegedly illegally blended fuel has entered into home consumption. This bill only goes part of the way to solving the excise evasion issue, but it is a step forward. This was accepted by all the participants, who viewed this bill as a positive development but not a final solution. The problem it seems, up to now, is more an unwillingness or unpreparedness to act rather than there being a legal barrier. If consumers are to regain confidence that the fuel they buy is not adulterated but safe, and if the government is to recapture the hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue that it is losing each year to fuel substitution, the government needs to act now and to act quickly.
The Australian Institute of Petroleum, for example, said:
These practices are now so widespread that the loss, in terms of government excise revenue evaded is many millions of dollars a month. Moreover, these practices are depressing wholesale and retail margins for diesel and petrol, and so threatening the financial viability of our marketing member companies and their resellers.
In a letter dated 16 June to Senator Vanstone, the Customs minister, Liberty Oil outlines a loss of excise duty in excess of $300 million annually and goes on to say: 
I would like to bring to your attention the well-known and widespread ongoing excise avoidance practice within the oil industry that continues to flourish and which remains unhindered. This practice appears to be immune from any action that may be taken by any of your departments. As a consequence, huge losses of revenue are now being sustained by both your government and by legitimate business operators who to date have not received the full benefit of any protection whatsoever from this illegal practice.
Over the past 12 months, Liberty Oil also wrote to the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, in similar terms. There is no excuse—no excuse at all—that the government did not know that fuel substitution was going on. The Australian Labor Party will not oppose this legislation that deals with fuel substitution. The statements made by Minister Truss in 1998 concerning this issue were correct: fuel substitution is a highly dangerous and unacceptable practice, and it is the responsibility of the federal government to stop it. The coalition government has not shown that it has the ability to handle this issue. It has left a legacy of consumer concern and has allowed taxpayers to be ripped off by hundreds of millions of dollars. On every count so far, the coalition government has failed. I have now addressed the issues that were raised in respect of fuel substitution.
I just want to draw attention to a document I received yesterday—and I think probably all senators would have received it—which goes to the issue of the amendment that was moved by the opposition in the second reading stage of this bill. It goes to the issues that have been argued in this parliament in respect of petrol pricing and the impact of the GST on the pump price of petrol. I think it is worth while reading into the record some of the material that is contained in the document. The document is from the Australian Automobile Association and is headed `Petrol Prices: Answers'. It states:
Has excise gone down under the GST?
Pre GST the Commonwealth collected excise of 44.2 cents per litre for itself and the States and Territories. It retained 36 cents and passed 8.2 cents to the States and Territories. Under the new tax system the States and Territories receive the GST instead of the 8.2 cents excise. The Commonwealth now retains excise of 37.5 cents per litre (plus 0.64 indexation in August) and the GST is 9.1 cents per litre (based on $1 per litre retail) instead of the 8.2 cents of the old state and territory excise. No matter how it's dressed up, if motorists were paying the same amount of tax on petrol today as they were paying on 30 June 2000, petrol would be 3 cents per litre cheaper.
The second question they ask is:
Is it true that the Commonwealth does not benefit from higher GST because of higher petrol prices—that the States get all the GST?
That is another claim made by this government in the past couple of days. The document goes on to say:
The States do get all of the GST but for the first few years GST revenue falls short of pre-GST revenue. The Commonwealth has agreed to top up that revenue shortfall. Because the GST on petrol is higher than expected and the states will therefore get more GST, the Commonwealth top up will be less than forecast in the Budget. The bottom line is the Commonwealth will be better off by an amount equal to the extra GST from higher petrol prices—about $140 million above budget estimates based on current petrol prices.
It goes on to say:
Can the Government afford to freeze excise?
The higher the world oil price the more tax the government collects under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT). The Budget papers state that it is levied at the rate of 40% of the taxable profit from an offshore petroleum project (except the NW Shelf project which is dealt with separately). Because of world parity pricing this effectively means 40% on the difference between the $10 per barrel cost of recovery and the world oil price.
The 2000/01 Budget revenue estimate of $1.28 billion is based on a price of around US$16 per barrel. The current world oil price, however, is over US$30 per barrel. The windfall to the Government is difficult to estimate accurately but is likely to be well in excess of $500 million and if world prices remain high, could be well over $1 billion. Presumably Treasury has modelling available that shows the likely windfall more accurately.
The Government can easily use some of this windfall to freeze excise in February when the GST inflationary spike will increase petrol prices by between 2 and 3 cents per litre. This freeze is estimated to cost around $200 million and when taken from the windfall, would not impact on the budget bottom line. 
If the increases are caused by higher world oil prices what can the Government really do about it?
The Government can do something. It can freeze or reduce excise. The fact is Australian motorists now pay 47 cents in tax per litre of petrol (based on a retail price of $1 per litre). If Australians paid the same level of tax as Americans do, the price of petrol in Australia would drop instantly from $1.00 per litre to 63 cents per litre.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-08-30,"—We are currently discussing the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000. The purpose of this bill is to combat what is known as fuel substitution. Fuel substitution represents a significant loss of revenue to the Commonwealth from excise taxes raised on petroleum products. It is interesting to note that in 1997 the federal government first introduced a number of bills aiming to stamp out the practice known as fuel substitution. They cited both revenue and consumer protection reasons for doing so. The Labor Party supported them on that occasion.
The Australian Taxation Office have said that they are responsible not for the quality of fuel but for ensuring that the correct excise is paid. This statement from the Taxation Office is in conflict with Minister Truss's second reading speech on the fuel substitution legislation in 1997. I would urge the Australian Taxation Office to pay much closer attention to this matter. Of course, we had the initial legislation in 1997. It is now August of the year 2000 and we are still dealing with legislation relating to fuel substitution. We should be concerned about fuel substitution.
If we look at page 5.6 of Budget Paper No. 1, the estimated excise on petroleum products and crude oil going to the Commonwealth government, the federal Liberal-National Party government, in 1999-2000 was $11.419 billion. In the year 2000-01, it is estimated to be $12.968 billion—an increase of $1½ billion in revenue to the Commonwealth government from fuel excise. That is an increase of 13.6 per cent. It is interesting to note that the total revenue collected from excise duties in the year 2000-01 is estimated to be $19.779 billion, which is in excess of the revenue collected from other indirect taxes, primarily the wholesale sales tax in its last year of operation.
In this context, I turn to the criticisms of the wholesale sales tax—which has been replaced by the GST—made in the government document known as the `ANTS' document. The criticisms made of the wholesale sales tax on pages 72 and 73 of that document include the statement that the wholesale sales tax gives scope for avoidance, and the document explains how wholesale sales tax can be avoided. It also says that taxing business inputs and exports makes business less competitive. It says on page 72:
While the wholesale sales tax exempts many items for use in the manufacture of other goods (for example, raw materials), it does not provide an exemption for goods used in service activities, such as trucks used in road transport. As a result, the wholesale sales tax paid on goods bought by service industries is passed on to goods producers who buy those services.
More than half of wholesale sales tax revenue is raised on goods used as inputs to one type of business or another. The hidden tax burden also makes Australian business less competitive against imports.
It notes that excise duty on diesel fuels imposes a heavy cost on business, partic-ularly those in rural areas that rely heavily on road transport. These are some of the criticisms made of the wholesale sales tax. But, if they are true of the wholesale sales tax, they are true of fuel excise—in fact, they are more valid in respect of fuel excise. Yet the Commonwealth, the Liberal-National party, chose not to replace or get rid of excise duties—and, particularly, excise duties on petroleum products and crude oil. When you look at the revenue implications, it is quite obvious why it chose not to do that. What is also quite obvious and quite dishonest of the Liberal-National party government is that, in maintaining the excise on fuel—including the GST component, which, although offset to some extent, is not offset effectively—the excise duty is indexed to the consumer price movements, to increases in prices. Increases in prices, the CPI, contain what is known as the GST `spike'. The GST leads to an increase in inflation. So the government gains a windfall as a result of the GST through the application of the consumer price index. It is no wonder that the government is anxious to protect the revenue it collects from excise duties on petroleum products and crude oil. It is no wonder the Liberal-National party chose not to abolish excise duties and particular excise duties on petroleum products and crude oil—because of the revenue it raises. It chose to get rid of the wholesale sales tax rather than excise duties. 
The increase in petroleum product prices has a significant impact in rural and regional Australia for three fundamental reasons. Firstly, as I hope we all know, petrol prices in rural and regional Australia are higher than in the major urban centres. People in places such as Sydney and Melbourne, where petrol prices are now touching a dollar a litre or more, have just had this issue hit home to them. But people in rural and regional Australia, including my home state of Tasmania, have had to suffer these high petrol prices for some months. Secondly, petrol usage in rural and regional Australia is greater than in urban areas. It is greater for two reasons: people drive longer distances and there is less public transport available, if there is any public transport available at all. A third and very important issue is that incomes in rural and regional Australia are lower than in urban Australia, particularly Sydney and Melbourne. For these three reasons, petrol prices are particularly sensitive in rural and regional Australia.
I was talking only yesterday to a well-known resident of a town on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Mr Alan Beams, who gave me the latest petrol prices in Latrobe. Petrol there is $1.04 per litre for unleaded fuel and $1.09 per litre for leaded fuel. He also informed me that, on Flinders Island, it is $1.27 per litre. I thank Mr Beams for that information. If we look at the so-called savings in the government's own ANTS package in respect of final income, after the implementation of the GST—bearing in mind this was before higher interest rates and before higher petrol prices—the government claims that a single income earner earning $75,000 a year gets a 7.3 per cent cut in their overall tax burden. That is worth $68.55 a week. If you earn $30,000 a year, the net tax cut is 1.7 per cent, or $7.78 per week. So, if you are a low income earner, by the time you take into account increases in interest rates and petrol prices, there is not much of the $7.78 of the single income earner earning $30,000 a year left. Take the example of a single income earner with two children. If they are on $75,000 a year, they receive an income tax cut of 12.5 per cent. They are allegedly better off by $121.70 a week. A person on $25,000 a year, however, in the same circumstances, receives a cut of 3.9 per cent, or $21.83. That is before increases in interest rates and increases in petrol prices. This provides a stark contrast and is an example of the dramatic erosion of the government's income tax cuts, for lower income earners particularly, as a result of both interest rate increases and petrol price increases. This particularly hurts people in rural and regional Australia.
I would also like to mention, as an important aside on gas prices, information I received from a pensioner who lives in Devonport, Mr Rankin, known as `Irish' to his friends. In Tasmania, pensioners, particularly the elderly, have been replacing oil heaters with gas. Mr Rankin sent me a copy of the invoice for one container of LP gas. Apparently, one container of LP gas usually takes four to six weeks to consume. The price, including GST—because gas is not exempt from the GST—of that container of gas is now $75.90, including $6.90 GST. Three or four months ago, the price of this container of gas was $53. It has gone from $53 to $75.90 in three to four months. This is another example of the erosion of the so-called benefits for elderly Australians, particularly in my home state of Tasmania, where for obvious reasons gas consumption for heating purposes is much higher in winter. That is an important aside. 
Let me come back to the issue of fuel excise. Three reasons have been advanced for higher fuel prices in Australia: firstly, higher world oil prices—obviously a major contributor; secondly, the lower value of the Australian dollar; and, thirdly, the GST. I would like to spend a little time on the lower value of the Australian dollar. There has been little analysis of this either in a political context or in the economic journals in this country. The lower value of the Australian dollar obviously means we pay more for imports, we pay more for oil and therefore we pay more for petrol. Senator Kemp alluded to this in response to a question earlier in the week. Why is the Australian dollar lower in value? In part it is because of the US dollar and the strength of the US economy. Alan Wood, economics editor of the Australian, wrote a quite incisive article about this earlier in the week. He pointed out that it is because our national debt continues to rise and our national savings continue to decline, and he is right. This government has to take at least some of the responsibility for the increase in national debt and the lower levels of national savings, therefore for the decline in the Australian dollar, therefore for the increase in the cost of importing petroleum products and therefore for the increase in petrol prices.
The issue of the goods and services tax has been well canvassed by my colleagues. We know the Liberal-National party has shortchanged the Australian public in respect of GST compensation on fuel by about 3c a litre. That is having a significant impact right around Australia, and it is a greater figure in rural and regional Australia. My colleagues have touched on that. It is an important issue because of the commitment the Liberal-National party gave in the lead-up to the last election. Let me quote the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, in an address to the nation on 13 August 1998. He said:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
The Treasurer, Mr Costello, on 7 September 1998, said:
The Government's proposed New Tax System will not lead to any increase in petrol prices.
On 6 September 1998, Liberal campaign headquarters circulated a note that said:
There will be no increase in the price of petrol as a result of the GST.
These were claims made by the Liberal-National party about petrol prices in the lead-up to the last election, which we now know are not true. Senator Kemp and the Liberal-National party do not need to take my word for it; the Australian Democrats acknowledge that the Liberal-National party has misled the Australian community on this issue.
Interestingly, we do not even have to take the Australian Democrats' word for it; we just have to look through the public comments made by the members of the Liberal-National party in recent times. It is no wonder that the National Party are sensitive about petrol prices—for obvious reasons. They claim to represent people who live in rural and regional Australia. We have had a variety of comments; we had comments from a member in the other place, Ms Hull. The city and country price gap has now been narrowed and, extraordinarily, city prices are about where country prices have been for so long. If you freeze the excise, it is still not going to bring down petrol prices. What it will do is stop them rising any further, but we are not going to get any benefits. We have had Ms Hull, and we have had a parliamentary secretary, Mr Entsch—I do not know what happened to cabinet solidarity; he has not been sacked—criticising the indexation of the fuel excise against the CPI. Ms Bailey, Mr Lindsay, Mr Wakelin and, in this place, Senator Chapman have been criticising fuel excise and the way it has been indexed. National Party members have been quite prominent in their criticism of the continued indexation of the fuel excise against the consumer price index—quite rightly, because of the GST impact on prices. That will add another 1½c to 2c to the price of petrol in this country. Quite rightly, the National Party have been particularly vocal in their criticism, but what have they done about it? As with a lot of other issues, the National Party have complained in the media and have complained to the Prime Minister and to the Treasurer, Mr Costello. They have taken up the issue in the party room. Apparently, yesterday 15 speakers joined the debate in the government party room amid concerns over rising petrol prices and allegations of a tax windfall. Many of those 15 speakers were from the National Party. But at the end of the day— 
—There won't be many of those left.
—And there will be even fewer after the next election. What has the National Party managed to achieve? It has achieved support for the introduction of the GST. We have ended up with higher petrol prices in rural and regional areas particularly, and the National Party has called for the ending of indexation. It has also called for the hypothecation of a greater proportion of the revenue from petrol excise for roads and has achieved absolutely nothing. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, have rejected the complaints of the National Party. What is the sense in people in rural and regional Australia electing National Party members and senators to the parliament if their complaints are totally ignored? They are totally ignored. Once again the economic interests of the Liberal Party, the dominant partner in the coalition, have absolutely crushed the interests of the National Party, which is supposedly representing rural and regional Australia. Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, knows all about this. He works hand in hand with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in rebutting and rejecting the complaints of National Party members and he does it very well. I give Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, full credit for crushing the National Party time and time again in its complaints about fuel prices in this country. I give him that tribute. He does it very effectively.
—Even Kempy can beat them.
—Even Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, can head off the complaints of the National Party. The Prime Minister has claimed that if the indexation of fuel excise is cut out we will have a lower surplus and that will put increased pressure on interest rates. Effectively, he is admitting that the income tax cuts that were delivered, particularly for high income earners, were too generous. I have outlined that the income tax cuts for high income earners were indeed too generous. Why did he deliver that at the expense of higher fuel prices for rural and regional Australia?

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-08-30,"—In speaking to the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000 this morning, I want to highlight a number of aspects related to petroleum and fuel, in particular the dangerous practice of fuel substitution in this country. It has taken this government quite a number of months to come to grips with, deal with and, finally, present this legislation. The Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Act of 1997 will be amended to improve the ability of the government to prosecute those who are involved in the practice of fuel substitution. This will be done by changing the definition of `fuel' to cover a broader range of products and removing the requirement for the Taxation Office to show that allegedly illegally blended fuel has entered into home consumption. Apart from the many safety issues involved, which have been canvassed, excise evasion has cost this country millions of dollars. It has cost at least $100 million. The tax office admits to $100 million, but the figure is probably much higher. All in all, this legislation represents a clear example that the government has failed on fuel substitution. We know that there has been a disagreement between the Taxation Office and the Customs office over who is finally responsible for ensuring consumers are not harmed by fuel substitution. In a speech given in the House our member, Mr Kelvin Thomson, outlined the antics that have gone on before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, when Senator George Campbell asked both the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs Service who had responsibility for carrying out the government's wishes and ensuring that consumers were not harmed by the fuel substitution. Mr Jackson from the tax office said:
Our legislation does not empower us to deal with the quality of fuel. If people want to mix half a litre of water with half a litre of petrol and say that is petrol and, if they pay the excise on it, they have paid the excise. 
They have paid the excise. That is all that the tax office is concerned about. In response to the same question, Mr Burns from the Australian Customs Office said:
I think the point is that it was not Customs responsibility but it was a responsibility of either other Commonwealth agencies or the state governments.
So we have had some confusion between the Taxation Office and the Customs office. Earlier this year, in response to a number of questions to Senator Kemp about the use of trucks that have been outfitted by the Customs office to go around and check on the fuel substitution, he admitted that he was not quite aware where these trucks were and what they were doing these days. The government have also been changing their mind. Compare when Minister Truss introduced the legislation and said, `We're cracking down on fuel substitution,' with when Senator Kemp said, `No, this is really now a states problem'. The government have dropped the ball on allowing fuel substituters to get away with these very dangerous activities. The government have had people within the industry screaming at them to do something about the problem of fuel substitution for years, so why has it taken this government so long to try and clean up the problem—and will this bill in fact attempt to do that? Is it because of the GST? Is it because the poor Taxation Office, which now has the responsibility for this, has been so preoccupied with trying to get the GST up and running and regulated and issuing rulings that it has not had time to turn its attention to this important issue? One would think that that is probably the case. We support this legislation and we want the government to adopt a strong anti fuel substitution position. It is about time they took this action.
While I am on the subject of fuel, I want to turn my attention today to consider the government's current inaction on the fuel crisis facing Australians right across this country, particularly in the Northern Territory. I have to say at the outset that I am not surprised at the Democrat position yesterday in not supporting an inquiry into what is happening with fuel prices. It is very rare to see a Democrat cross the border into the Northern Territory. In fact I think the only time they ever come to the Northern Territory is to work on parliamentary committees. They have no presence in the Territory. They barely run any candidates in any election we have up there, so they would not be concerned with or care about what is happening with petrol price increases in the Northern Territory. Let me quote from yesterday's paper. On the very day in the Senate that we were talking about petrol prices and the need for a fuel inquiry the Northern Territory News ran the headline, `Petrol rip-off: NT tax highest.' The Democrats do not care—they do not care because they do not have a presence in the Northern Territory—but it seems as if this government does not care either. This is just another example of people in rural and regional Australia being dropped off the back of the truck.
Like elsewhere in Australia, the Territory's petrol prices have been increasing steadily over the last few months, aided by the GST, OPEC and a weakening of the Australian dollar. In his speech prior to mine, I think my colleague Senator Sherry outlined quite well the effect of the combination of world prices, our increasing debt and low national savings, and the falling rate of the Australian dollar. But already high prices have become even higher. Petrol prices in the Northern Territory now range from about $1.04 a litre in the Darwin metropolitan area and $1.09 a litre in Darwin rural areas up to $1.12 a litre in Alice Springs. But if you take a 15-minute flying trip north of Darwin to Bathurst Island, you will be paying $1.60 a litre for fuel.
What are the Howard government doing about these increases? Nothing—they are doing absolutely nothing. They sit here wringing their hands, wondering how to deal with the latest round of discontent from backbenchers, who admitted this week that there is a windfall. I am going to take you in a moment to a transcript of comments by my colleague Senator Tambling, who admits that there is a windfall for this government with the current prices in fuel. But the government look for other causes to blame: they are ready to blame the Australian Automobile Association, world prices or even the retailers themselves, but they are not ready to tell the truth and face the consequences and the reality of the impact of their policies. 
Let us have a look at the impact the GST has had on petrol, which this government is in denial about. Senator Grant Tambling, I noticed, had to pay up on a bet in Darwin the other week because he was wrong about this matter. Prior to the introduction of the GST, he said to a radio announcer up there that the GST would not—but then I think he changed his mind and started to use the words `should not'; so it went from `would not' to `should not' on whatever day Senator Tambling felt like using whichever word—or should not increase the price of petrol. He was wrong. Last Monday week he was forced to give Fred McCue his carton of green cans and pay up on his bet because he was wrong, and he had to admit that publicly on radio. Of course Senator Tambling blamed everybody else except this government. He chose to blame even the poor little old retailers in the Northern Territory who are struggling to cope under this government's policies. But, at the end of the day, he had to pay up.
Let us have a look at this government's promise. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and other ministers promised that the GST would not increase the price of petrol or increase the tax take on petrol. A number of quotes categorically prove this. On 13 August 1998, in an address to the nation, Prime Minister John Howard said:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
Not `should not', not `maybe won't' and not `possibly that will not be the case'. He said that the GST `will not' increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist. On 7 September the Treasurer, Mr Costello, said:
The Government's proposed New Tax System will not lead to any increase in petrol prices.
Again, the same words: `will not'. There are not any inferences there. Clearly there can be no doubt that someone would be able to understand exactly the meaning of those words. On 6 September 1998 the Liberal Party campaign headquarters circulated a note that said:
There will be no increase in the price of petrol as a result of the GST.
In relation to the tax take, Mr Costello, in parliament on 25 November 1999, said:
... when you equalise out the tax arrangements, you get the same amount of revenue anyway. The excise comes down and the 10 per cent goes back up.
So it is a simple mathematical sum here. He continued:
It is the same amount of tax. It just depends on whether you are taking it in a form of excise or whether you are taking it in the form of the GST.
If we have a look at that very simple mathematical sum, we see the problem was that the amount of excise that was to be taken off each litre of fuel did not equal the amount of GST that was put back on. If you have a look at every litre of petrol bought in regional Australia today, you will see the Northern Territory is going to contribute significantly to this. Every litre of petrol does produce a windfall for the Howard government, and it has come about as a result of the GST. Even yesterday in question time the Deputy Prime Minister and National Party leader, John Anderson, either did not know or did not care when the example of his own electorate was used. When John Howard introduced the new tax system on 1 July, he cut the petrol excise by 6.7c a litre. I have said in this chamber time and time again that that amount of excise was based on the retail pump price in Sydney, and we have never, ever in the Territory had petrol prices equivalent to the retail pump price in Sydney. We have always paid far in excess of that.
A calculation based on the retail pump price in Sydney was never, ever going to help the reduction of fuel prices in the Northern Territory—6.7c a litre, and then of course you add a 10 per cent GST. So where unleaded petrol is selling for about $1.06 per litre, that means an extra 30c a litre in tax. So 6.7c less in excise; 9.7c more in GST. You can apply the same calculation at every petrol station throughout regional Australia. This is a 3c a litre tax, based on $1.06 at the bowser. This is the windfall that John Howard pretends does not exist. This is the increase in petrol prices that has come about directly as a result of the GST.  
Lauchlan McIntosh from the Australian Automobile Association has admitted this. When interviewed by John Laws, Mr McIntosh said:
[T]he Prime Minister and the Government deliberately increased the Commonwealth excise by 1½ cents a litre ...
John Laws asked:
Can the GST be blamed for any of the rises?
Lauchlan McIntosh's reply was:
Oh, there's no doubt. At least 1½ cents a litre from the excise, and, of course, because the price is higher, the GST component is higher.
In fact, the GST has increased petrol tax in a number of ways. The level of excise reduction on petrol when the GST was introduced was too low, by 1.5c a litre. That is in the capital cities, let alone in Alice Springs, Darwin or Bathurst Island. The GST was pushing up inflation for the six months before 1 July, primarily through increased costs of housing insurance, motoring insurance, and house building and renovation. The indexation increase on 1 August 2000, which reflected inflation over the period, has led to a further 0.7c per litre in petrol tax. With the market price being around $1 per litre, there is around a further 1c of GST being charged, relative to the Prime Minister's strike price of 90c. So we have had a lot of evidence that in fact we do have petrol price increases as a result of the GST.
The crucial thing about all of this is that the Prime Minister has misled the Australian people about the impact of the GST on petrol. It is a very serious allegation, but I think people out there—the Australian public—are quite angry about this fact. There has been a number of articles written in Northern Territory newspapers in which motorists and people who have been interviewed are saying exactly that—people have said that they used to spend $28 to fill up their car; they now spend $28 and it fills up only half of their tank. There was a taxi owner-operator who said that they really think the effect of the GST will be felt when they pay the tax after three months. A lady said that before the GST she used to work two casual jobs, and now she has to work three. This is the impact it is having on rural and regional Australia—an impact that this government refuses to actually recognise or do anything about. Petrol prices were about 89c a litre in Darwin. As I have said, we are now looking at upwards of $1.04.
Prior to the last election, when the issue of the GST and prices were being debated, we had the Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister come to the Northern Territory and tell people that fuel prices would fall. People in the Territory are waiting for that day. Since then all they have seen is a government that misleads them and petrol prices being further increased at the bowser. We then had the Northern Territory Chief Minister, who is now president of the Liberal Party, be more specific. He told Territorians back at the last federal election that he thought fuel prices would in fact fall by 7c a litre. He seems to have an amazing crystal ball that no-one else on the government side has. However, petrol prices have increased despite these way-out predictions from members of the government. The federal government is now feeling the heat, as it should.
Contrary to what the government has claimed, the GST has increased the price of fuel. The OPEC increases in the price of crude, the lower Australian dollar and of course the government's excise may be contributing factors but they are not the only factors. And we know it is not the individual service station operators who should be singled out for harsh treatment. We have seen what their margin is in all of this.
With the introduction of the GST the federal government decided to cut the fuel excise by 6.7c. The oil companies were supposed to absorb the cost of 1.5c a litre, which they have been either unable or unwilling to do. This is based on a fuel price of 73c a litre. This story is not much consolation to Territorians. Darwin has the most expensive fuel prices of any capital city in Australia. Outside Darwin, the price of fuel in the Territory is exorbitant—over $1.60 a litre in places. The Prime Minister has promised that there would be no net increase in the government's effective tax take. This is a promise that has clearly been broken. Excises are the only taxes tied to inflation. This is a tax on top of a tax.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-08-30,"—I rise to support the excellent second reading amendment, moved by Senator Cook, to the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000.
—I will bow to your experience, Senator, on that matter. I am being distracted by the minister, who is not in his place.
 (Senator Calvert)—Minister, the inter-jections are disorderly, as you know.
—The fact of the matter is that the issue of petrol prices is a vexed one, and historically has extensively occupied various parliaments of this country. There is good reason for that. The Managing Director of ANOP Research Services, Rod Cameron, is, one would have to say, a highly respected political analyst. In my view, he has no peer when it comes to picking the political mood of the community. In March this year Mr Cameron addressed a gathering of petroleum and automotive industry executives. His address was titled `Petrol, the GST and Motorists'. Rod Cameron told his audience that earlier ANOP research for the Australian Automobile Association showed that petrol prices were always a slumbering issue in Australia. He said that more recent research undertaken towards the end of 1999 showed that the issue of petrol prices was well and truly wide awake. He said that petrol prices were on the political agenda `big time', and that they were a much bigger issue for regional motorists. Mr Cameron concluded:
The result is that petrol excise is one of the biggest political hot-buttons in the country.
The government was also well aware of the potential problem of tax induced petrol prices back in August 1998. The Prime Minister—in an address to the nation, no less—said on 13 August 1998:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
That is the Prime Minister, on the record, in an address to the nation. Let us have no evasion about `should not'. He said:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
In September 1998, his Treasurer, Mr Costello, told us:
The government's proposed New Tax System will not lead to any increase in petrol prices.
Both Mr Howard and Mr Costello were keen to keep the real impact of the new tax system on petrol prices away from the public eye as long as possible. But the real impact of the tax policies of Mr Howard and Mr Costello are now out there for all to see. They are plastered on many of the service stations in the country. I must say that in the city that I live in, Launceston, most of the service stations do not put up a petrol price. It has gone over $1 for unleaded and leaded fuel. You know when you drive past a petrol station that is not exhibiting a price that you are likely to be looking at 102.9c for unleaded petrol—if you are lucky. But there are many stations that still exhibit a price, and it is enough to make many motorists draw breath as they drive past. Not only are motorists confronted with these prices as they drive along but also they are plastered all over the front of every newspaper and broadcast on every radio and television station around the nation.
The Australian Automobile Association released data on 15 August indicating that the price of petrol rose in 102 of the 108 locations surveyed between June and July. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support that claim. For example—you will be well aware of this, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert—the front page of the Hobart Mercury on 3 July was headed: `Petrol Hits $1'. The article referred to prices in some areas of Hobart reaching close to $1.02 for unleaded petrol. It has gone up since then. At that time increases of up to 4c occurred. The page 1 lead in the Burnie Advocate on 26 July was: `Fuel Over A Dollar. Don't blame us, says retailer'. The Lismore paper, the Northern Star, led on page 1 on 18 August with the screaming headline: `Why Such A Difference? Petrol hits $1 a litre in bush'. On 4 July, the Bendigo Advertiser led with: `GST fuels anger'. It was surprising then to see that the Northern Times from Kerang in Victoria—the minister's state—in its 8 August issue seemed to take a different tack. The headline stated, `Main concern. GST not to blame for petrol prices'. But, then, guess whose by-line is on the story: that of Dr Sharman Stone, federal member for Murray. You need to go inside the paper to get the real story in the Northern Times. 
—Wait, Minister. The best is yet to come. On the bottom of page 1, the reader is invited to go to pages 6 and 7 to read about what the paper describes as the `Great petrol price fiasco'. On pages 6 and 7 there are articles by the General Manager of the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association; Mr David Cumming, the Government and Corporate Affairs Manager of RACV; and Mr David Purchase, Executive Director of the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce. I want to draw on what those gentlemen said. For example, David Cumming said:
The Federal Government under the guise of the GST, has increased its take from 35.8 cents per litre to 37.481 cpl. On top of this, the GST is added at the pump. 
The promise that petrol prices would not rise due to the GST was not delivered, with petrol prices increasing across the nation. Once again, motorists are being used as a cash cow. 
In fact the federal petrol tax (excise) is budgeted to rise 13.6 percent to $12.9 billion this financial year.
Later he said:
And, of course, the higher the federal tax, the higher the GST.
He went on:
The Government's attempts to shift blame to the oil companies for the price increase just highlights how flawed its policies on petrol tax reform have been from the beginning.
That is from Mr David Cumming, Government and Corporate Affairs Manager of the RACV. David Purchase, the Executive Director of the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, could hardly be said to be a prominent supporter of the Labor Party or its policies; in fact, he is pretty closely aligned to the other side of the chamber. What did he say? He said:
Already record high petrol prices have jumped again with the Federal Government increasing the excise on petrol only a few weeks after trimming it. 
The biannual `tax on tax' increase by the Federal Government happened on August 1 with a rise of 0.7 cents per litre. 
With the introduction of the GST, the Federal Government cut its excise `take' on petrol by 6.7 cpl so that `petrol prices would not have to rise'. Now only a few weeks later, the Federal Government is increasing its excise on petrol again. 
They cut their excise but grab back 10 percent at retail then tax the excise. It's a joke but it is not funny.
What is the opinion of some of the citizens of Kerang as published in the paper? Mr Kevin Sambrooks is quoted as saying: 
The taxes are far too high! The government is getting plenty out of the same group of people all the time. 
Des Hunt said:
They are shocking. 
Vannessa Giorgio said:
It's too expensive for the old, the young and those who aren't working.
This is from the paper that has on its front page the member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone, saying `GST not to blame for petrol prices'. The paper was happy to give her the front page but then happy to shoot her down absolutely with the real stories published inside under the heading `The great petrol price fiasco'.
Mr Howard's GST has forced up the price of petrol for a number of reasons. Firstly, the level of excise reduction when the GST was introduced was too low by 1.5c a litre. With petrol at 90c a litre, the government's own figures show excise duty and the GST would lift its tax take from 44.137c a litre to 45.681c a litre; hence the increase of 1.5c. The GST will cost motorists 8.2c a litre on that 90c figure, but the government has cut excise by only 6.7c.  
Further, it should be said that the GST pushed up inflation for the six months leading up to 1 July, primarily through increased costs in housing insurance, motor vehicle insurance, and house building and renovation. It should also be said that there were price rises in anticipation of the problems that might have been faced with rising prices from 1 July, so some of those price increases were factored into the CPI increase for the six months leading up to 1 July. As a result, the indexation increase in August led to a further 0.7c per litre increase in the price of petrol. And now that the price of petrol is around $1 a litre, a further 1c of GST is being charged relative to the Prime Minister's strike price of 90c a litre. This means a further 3c a litre of additional tax due to the GST since 1 July.
But the government is just getting warmed up in what is a revenue raising spree at the expense of motorists—particularly motorists in regional Australia. The main price impact from the GST will be in the September quarter of this year. Mr Costello's budget papers estimate that inflation will reach a peak of 6.75 per cent in that quarter. I think that is a very conservative number, but this figure—whatever it is—will flow through to higher petrol prices in February next year when petrol excise is indexed again for inflation.
The Australian Automobile Association estimates that this will add around a further 2c per litre in tax. This indexation will then have GST on top of it, yielding a further increase of 0.2c per litre. So revenue to the government from petrol and diesel taxes is estimated to increase by well over $1 billion per year—that is, $1 billion per year more tax directly as a result of the GST. The government, however, wants to blame the oil companies for the 1.5c a litre increase in the tax take that Mr Howard imposed on Australian motorists on 1 July. Mr Howard has said that it is the oil companies that should make up the difference from the alleged cost savings. But while Mr Howard has been running that line, his Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, has been saying just the opposite. Mr Hockey has given the oil companies the green light to increase petrol prices. He said on 28 June that the ACCC could tick off on price increases if it was unable to identify cost savings by the oil companies. 
Not only have Australian motorists, especially those in regional areas, copped it from the GST on petrol, but also farmers have to pay more tax for diesel. Let me remind the Senate what Mr Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, told the parliament at the end of May last year. He said:
The diesel fuel rebate will be kept in full ... All diesel used off-road by primary producers stays excise free.
From 1 July, Mr Howard, Mr Costello and Mr Anderson started collecting 37.481c in excise on every litre of diesel fuel used by Australian farmers. The rebate is set at 35.695c per litre, leaving the government with a nice little profit of 1.786c on every litre of diesel used on farms. On behalf of Australian farmers, perhaps I should say thank you to Mr Anderson. 
Regional areas are also being hit. Small independent trucking companies are being hit hard by increasing diesel fuel prices. Diesel fuel prices have increased by 34c since the government announced its diesel fuel rebate scheme. That is an increase of 45 per cent, and it has well and truly wiped out the rebate of 24c a litre. Increased transport costs mean increased living costs, and that means a GST on a bigger number.
Mr Gary Wright operates a cartage business, G.L. & S.F. Wright, in Penguin in our state, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert. His business is based about 1½ hours from where I live. He was recently quoted in the press as saying that some operators in the Tasmanian freight industry were even looking at charging their own customers a fuel excise to more easily pass on and identify the rising costs. Gary said that, in the past, price increases occurred every 12 to 18 months and said, `But now you've got to look at them every couple of months.' Things are getting very grim very quickly.
When Mr Howard was pushed by his own backbench to commit the windfall financial gain that he and Mr Costello were about to enjoy from petrol tax to rural roads, he refused. The Prime Minister said that it would be irresponsible to speculate on the impact of rising petrol prices on the budget with another 10 months of the financial year to go. Anyway, he said that it was all the fault of the oil production countries and they do not sit on the front bench of the government. The Prime Minister has also blamed a falling Australian dollar for higher fuel prices. He also argues that any move to cut the level of excise on fuel could force up interest rates and that soaring petrol prices could blow a multimillion dollar hole in the budget. Mr Costello has told us that we need to pay more for petrol to pay for pension increases. 
I agree with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that petrol price rises are worse than they need to be because the government has broken its promise on the GST. That is the bottom line in this debate. While the Prime Minister and the Treasurer blame everyone other than the government for this economic disaster that we now see playing out in regional Australia and while the Prime Minister and the Treasurer claim that any change to the current tax regime on fuel will force up interest rates, blow out the deficit, cut pensions and bring plague and pestilence to all the world, one thing is certain: the fuel tax regime that the government has in place will ensure nothing less than a vicious upward spiral in living costs in regional Australia and a downward spiral in regional living standards.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM EXCISE AMENDMENT (MEASURES TO ADDRESS EVASION) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-08-30,"—I rise in this debate to make a contribution on this most important issue—that is, the absence of any government policy to deal with the huge increases in fuel prices that are occurring in this country. The Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000 is an attempt to deal with one specific problem; namely, evasion. Whilst the government has introduced this legislation, it singularly fails to tackle what is a crisis throughout Australia—the crisis of ever increasing petrol prices, a crisis which is affecting people in the cities and in rural and regional Australia. A little later in my remarks I want to talk about the devastating impact that this government's failure to act is having on rural and regional Australia.
I want to commence my contribution by referring to history. Prime Minister Howard is a student of history, apparently—in fact, he is a devotee of history. He believes that nothing would be better for Australia than going back to the great halcyon days, as he thinks they were, of Menzies and that era. If you are going to rely upon history, as the Prime Minister does, then you should remember that sometimes your own words will come back to haunt you. Let me quote the Prime Minister in 1986 when he was the Leader of the Opposition. He said: 
There appears to be no end to the occasions on which the Government intends to deceive the Australian public on the question of fuel pricing. We must remember that when we talk about the price of fuel in Australia we are talking about something that affects every single sector of the Australian community. It is fair enough to say that whether one lives in the cities, the provincial areas or the bush, the price of fuel is of enormous daily importance. For example, the use of the family motor car is one of the most regular methods of ordinary pleasure taken by low income families in Australia and it passes strange that a government that historically has prided itself on representing the cause of low income families in Australia should be shaping up to cheat that very section of the Australian community ... 
What prophetic words. The Prime Minister, who at that time was the Leader of the Opposition, found it appropriate to get stuck into the then Labor government over the issue of fuel prices. This is a Prime Minister who, when he came to office in 1996, said that it was not appropriate to just blame everything on international economic factors. `You cannot do that; as the national government, you have to carry some of the responsibility yourself for what occurs in the economy in this country.' And Prime Minister Howard said that he was going to stand up for the battlers. He made promise after promise to the battlers of Australia, both in the cities and the bush.
—And they voted for him. 
—And they did vote for him, Senator McGauran, you are correct. After 13 years of Labor government and after great benefits brought on during those years, they were nevertheless, in the natural political cycle, looking for a change. In 1996, they were prepared to put their faith and trust in Mr Howard because they thought, `Let's give him a go.' Particularly, they gave him a go because he stood before the Australian people and he made promises such as, `No Australian will be worse off under my government. Nobody will lose any wages, entitlements or conditions of employment.' He would not touch Medicare; he would protect Medicare. He would not increase taxes. He would not bring in any tax surcharges, and so on. Most important of all, he said that he would never ever bring in a GST. These were all solemn core promises that this Prime Minister made, and he has broken each one of them. It is the height of hypocrisy for somebody to stand up year after year, make promises and then continue to break them. He is continuing to do that.
We know that this government, when it brought in the GST, on a number of occasions stated that fuel prices would not increase under the GST. In fact, this government promised that not only would they not increase but they would decrease. On 1 September 1998, Mark Vaile, then Minister for Transport and Regional Development, put out a news release which said that fuel would be cheaper under the coalition:
The Coalition is delivering tax cuts for everyone—and lowering fuel prices.
Further on in his press release he said:
What's more—the Coalition will continue to promote competition to further reduce petrol prices in the bush.
Again, on 7 September 1998:
“Petrol prices for motorists in regional and rural Australia will not rise with GST as we are reducing the excise (tax) on petrol by an equivalent amount to offset the impact of the GST to zero,” the Federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mark Vaile. said today.
The words `will not rise with GST' were italicised to give them emphasis. Mr Vaile was going to great pains to say that, under this government, there would be no increase in petrol prices following the introduction of the GST and that prices would be held down because of competition. He said:
... petrol prices will fall by 7 cents a litre.
The most ironic comment that Mr Vaile must have made during his then short career in the ministry was:
Cheaper fuel and less tax is good news for the people of regional and rural Australia.
Mr Howard and Mr Vaile have not kept their promises. They have clearly and utterly broken them. Yet now they seek to put all of the blame for the current situation of the petrol prices in this country on international factors. These are the same conservative representatives that, when the world oil crisis occurred back in 1974 when the price of oil, from my recollection, went up by around 400 per cent almost overnight due to OPEC decisions, the Liberal opposition said, `The Whitlam government cannot blame international factors; you have to take responsibility for this yourself.' But of course, as we know, when the Liberal government get into power, suddenly the rules of the game change. It is no longer their responsibility. I am sad to say that it is. The people out there know it, and they are going to deliver the message to you in spades at the next election, just as they have been delivering the message to you at each of the state elections and by-elections that have occurred over the last couple of years.
Mr Howard was actually right in 1986. For the average working man and woman in this country—the battler—particularly for the people in rural and regional Australia, the price of petrol is of fundamental importance to their standard of living. Whilst the government can wax lyrical about what it has done with respect to the diesel fuel rebate, it forgets that many people living in rural and regional Australia, as well as in the cities, do not rely upon diesel fuel. Every day they rely on petrol, whether it is to run their small business, transport their kids to school or themselves to work, or do the shopping. 
I want particularly to go to the situation in rural and regional Australia. The situation is, as we know, that the price of petrol at the pump in rural and regional Australia is always more expensive than in the city. Indeed, the differential that exists can sometimes be as high as 20c a litre. You only have to get in a car and drive out from the inner city of Sydney either up the north coast or out west and you will pretty quickly find that fact out. There has always been this historical differential between the pump prices, but what has happened since the introduction of the GST is that, because of the percentage application on that price, the differential has grown. As the price of petrol continues to rise, the differential becomes greater and greater. People in the bush suffer more and more, comparatively, from rising fuel prices than do their fellow Australians in the cities. Of course, they have a further disadvantage. For instance, they have to place more reliance on the motor vehicle. Why? Because they do not have access to the same transport systems, such as suburban rail or bus systems; they actually have to use their motor vehicles more often—whether it is, as I said, to get the children to school in the mornings or to get themselves to work. They invariably have to drive longer distances to do those things, as we know.
Senators who have been involved in committees, both Senate and joint committees, looking at the impact of a whole range of issues on rural Australia, such as the situation in the retailing sector, realise that people living in country areas often have to travel 40, 50 or 60 kilometres one way just to get to the supermarket to do their weekly grocery shopping. So not only are they facing higher prices through the GST but they are facing higher costs and, increasingly, comparatively higher costs than are their fellow Australians in the cities, through the increases in petrol prices. But this government's response is, `Well, you are getting the benefits of the tax cuts under the GST.' Go out to the bush; go out to those country towns. I invite Senator McGauran, who, as a lone representative of rural Victoria from the National Party, is sitting in this chamber—one of the few left—to go out to some of those rural areas and talk to the people, whether they be on the land or in the towns, and ask them how much these tax cuts are worth. They are not worth anything.
—I am talking to them all the time.
—These people are not earning incomes like you and I are, Senator McGauran, whereby you can benefit significantly from the recent tax cuts. They are in those income brackets where the income tax cuts are pretty well negligible and have been more than outstripped by the increase in prices and the increase in the cost of services. As we know, relying heavily, as they do, on contracting services in the bush—whether that be from electricians or plumbers—their costs are greater again because of increased petrol prices feeding into the costs of those small businesses. All the time it is compounding. What is really making it worse is not just the impact of the GST, for which they do not get any real offset in tax cuts to compensate, but also the significant increases in petrol prices, which are compounding that problem daily for these people. I am getting calls all the time from people living in my duty electorates asking, `When is this government going to do something about petrol prices?' The government claims it has got all the answers and that it is running an economy which is bubbling along quite smoothly. Yet people out there know that this is a terrible crisis facing them.
If you actually have a look at some of the figures before and after the GST on petrol prices, you will see what I mean. Prior to the GST, the price for petrol in cents per litre in Lismore, in the seat of Page, was 87.9c. According to the figures I have been given today, it is now retailing at 95.9c. I do not think Mr Causley will be terribly happy with that figure—an 8c per litre increase. The increased tax that this government has taken from that increase is 2.67c.
Come a little further down the coast to Grafton, on the border between Page and Cowper. Fortunately, Garry Nehl does not have to worry about this any more, because he is retiring at the next election. But I would not want to be the candidate for the National Party trying to hang on to the seat of Cowper in this situation. What has happened to the price petrol in Grafton? It has gone up by 8c per litre from 88.9c per litre to 96.9c per litre since the introduction of the GST. Again, the increase in the tax take for the government is 2.7c per litre. Over 25 per cent of that price increase at the petrol pump has gone back to the government in terms of the increase in the tax. I return to where I started, to what Mr Howard had to say back in 1986 when he was Leader of the Opposition: 
There appears to be no end to the occasions on which the Government intends to deceive the Australian public on the question of fuel pricing.
How right he is. What a damning statement of the performance of his own government—a statement which correctly indicates what this government is really about and puts the lie to those untruths that were promulgated by Mr Vaile and Mr Howard and others that the price of petrol would not increase but rather would actually reduce following the GST.
We have never denied that international oil prices have an influence. That has always been the case, and we know that and we said that in government when we were affected by such things. As I said, one can remember back to 1974 and the oil shock then. We have never denied it and we do not deny it now. But what this government cannot deny is that it has markedly contributed to a worsening position for Australian motorists by feeding in, on top of that situation in the international environment, the GST and the increased tax take that this government is ripping out of the motorists of Australia. They are not going to forget it, they are not going to thank you for it and they are going to give you the clearest message at the next election.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM EXCISE AMENDMENT (MEASURES TO ADDRESS EVASION) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-08-30,"—The bill we are debating is the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000. Anyone listening to the second reading debate on this bill would have noted how rarely any of the Labor Party speakers dealt with anything that was actually before the chamber. In fact, the Labor Party speakers traversed a wide range of issues, very few of which, as I have said, related to this bill.
However, I will make a number of observations about the remarks of the Labor Party speakers. They chose to comment on fuel prices and put their argument—as it was put yesterday—that the rise in fuel prices is, in part, due to taxes, and they have argued further that there is a windfall coming as a result of this rise. We have listened carefully to their remarks, but what we have not found out is: what is Labor Party policy on this? If the Labor Party believe that there is a windfall to come—and I think the Prime Minister has answered this question very effectively in the other place—and if they also believe that one of the current problems is the tax structure, one would think that Labor Party speakers would have proposed some solution. Do the Labor Party propose to change the GST treatment of fuel? No, not one spokesperson from the Labor Party had any views on that. Do they propose to cut the excise on fuel? No, there was not one proposal on that particular matter. A number of Labor Party senators spoke about the effects of indexation on petrol prices. Do they propose to change the indexation arrangements relating to fuel? No.
So what we have, I believe, is another total fraud by the Labor Party. The Labor Party, Mr Acting Deputy President McKier-nan, as you would well know, decided that somehow they were going to `surf into victory' on the GST and that, therefore, they did not require any other policies. Do you remember that? The old surfing into office on the GST collapsed on 1 July—as indeed did Labor Party support, according to the many surveys taken. And now the community is quite rightly worried about the Labor Party's roll-back. I am sorry to mention the `r' word, but I have been provoked.
We are seeing a similar fraud by the Labor Party in relation to fuel. The Labor Party well know that the increase in fuel prices is as a result of trends on world markets; they well know that. But of course they endeavour to run a populist line in trying to blame tax changes for the rise in fuel prices. If the position of the Labor Party is that they believe that to be true, one would think they would be proposing some changes in fuel taxes—but they are not. The worst question you can ask a Labor senator—and, undoubtedly, some of them spoke about their discussions with various people—is: what do the Labor Party propose to do? There then follows a dead, ringing silence. 
So I think the community is quite right in assuming that the Labor Party are again indulging in a political fraud. They are trying to pretend something to the public but, when tested on it—when the question is posed to them: if you believe the tax structure has promoted the rise in fuel prices, what do you propose to do to change this tax structure?—there is dead silence; the Labor Party propose to do nothing. In fact, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be well aware that, when Labor were in office, one of the changes they made regularly was to fuel excise; they regularly increased the excise on fuel. The excise on fuel rose from around 5c a litre when the Labor Party came into office and ended up at 34c a litre—a six-fold rise over the period of the Labor government. The Labor Party brought in the indexation of excise. So it is not surprising perhaps that there is no proposal from the Labor Party to change that.
But a number of other comments made by Labor spokespeople are, I think, a little bit worrying. Both Senator Sherry and Senator Forshaw sneered at the tax cuts—they sneered at $12 billion in tax cuts. It is our view that the Labor Party, to finance their big spending program in their policies, will take back the tax cuts which were delivered to the Australian public on 1 July. According to Senator Sherry, these tax cuts are worth nothing—and, effectively, the same words were used by Senator Forshaw. Senator Forshaw believes that $12 billion worth of tax cuts are worth nothing. I think that provides the hint to the public of just where Labor priorities will lie. Mr Beazley has been asked some 30 times, someone counted up, to guarantee the tax cuts.
—Senator Forshaw, I know you are sensitive on this issue, but all you had to do in your speech—and the Labor Party has had plenty of time to do it—was guarantee the tax cuts which this government delivered to the Australian public on 1 July. You sneered at them. They were after all only $12 billion, but Senator Forshaw sneered at that. When Mr Beazley is asked whether he guarantees the tax cuts, he refuses to answer.
In contrast to what Senator Forshaw said in his speech, I believe that the public well understand that the rise in fuel prices is due to the rise in prices on world markets. Prices have risen in Australian dollar terms from some $17 a barrel in February last year to around $55 a barrel currently. People well understand that this explains the rise in petrol prices that we are all experiencing. This government is concerned about these price rises and is doing what any responsible government should do—that is, to make its views known and, in conjunction with the US and other countries that are similarly affected by the rise in petrol prices, to put pressure on the OPEC producers.
It is total fraud for the Labor Party to pretend that it is tax changes which have led to the rise in petrol prices. As I said, if they believe that is the case, what do the Labor Party propose to do about it? The Labor Party solution, as was revealed by one of the great political thinkers of the modern era, Senator Peter Cook, is to have a review. I said it was the 31st review into the fuel industry. I was corrected by Senator Ellison, who said it was the 49th review. With his perception for great public policy initiatives, Senator Cook, having explained that it was all due to the tax changes, did not actually propose that any changes be made to the tax arrangements on fuel. He thought another review would solve the problem. Of course, that is total nonsense. Not surprisingly, Senator Cook was comprehensively defeated on that issue in the Senate last night.
Let me now return to the detail of the bill. The amendments proposed in the bill improve the government's ability to address excise evasion occurring through fuel substitution. As I pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, the bill facilitates prosecutions for fuel substitution offences by removing some of the technical difficulties with the legislation, and I think that is a very important aspect of this bill. This bill also ensures that a broader range of imported products that can be used in fuel substitution activities, such as imported chemical grade toluene, are covered by this legislation. The record keeping provisions of the fuel substitution legislation are also extended to cover these products. This is an important bill. I welcome the fact that all parties to this debate have agreed that this bill should proceed, and I trust it will proceed without amendment. Apart from the foolish second reading amendment which has been proposed by Senator Cook, we are not aware of any amendments. 
One of the issues that was raised—and Senator Murphy spoke at some length on what I think was an incorrect argument—is that the government have been slow to act in relation to fuel substitution issues. Let me deal with this matter. The government have acted decisively to address the practice of excise evasion through fuel substitution. The government implemented revised excise arrangements, which took effect from mid-November 1999, that removed from the excise tariff and fuel section of the customs tariff certain products that were being abused. Combined with administrative action by the Australian Taxation Office, the access of excise evaders to fuels that are at the highest risk of substitution for excise paid has been cut off. We have also brought forward the present bill, which passed in the other place on 31 May 2000. This bill will strengthen the existing petroleum market regime. The government have changed the regulations to remove the incentive to blend methanol with petrol after reports that blends of methanol may have detrimental effects on both engines and air quality. This change took effect on 28 July this year.
The government has implemented measures, applying from 10 March 2000, to take away the ability to import toluene for evasion by imposing an excise equivalent duty on toluene in the customs tariff. Let me make it clear that the government and the Taxation Office take compliance seriously. Should other innovative ways to evade or avoid petroleum excise crop up, these will be addressed in a way which protects legitimate users. I am sure Senator Murphy has a copy of the press release that was put out by the tax commissioner headed `Claims of inaction on excise evasion and fuel substitution simply untrue'. This is a statement from the Taxation Office by the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael Carmody. This is what he said:
Claims that the Tax Office has failed to act on complaints made 18 months ago of fuel substitution and excise evasion are simply untrue. The Tax Office only took responsibility for excise operations a little over 12 months ago ...
All complaints about excise evasion and related fuel substitution involving solvents and other products have been dealt with by the Tax Office. Not only that, they have been dealt with decisively and in a way that kills off abuse.
Complaints of fuel substitution involving abuse of lower excised petrol and diesel, heating oil and solvents were raised with us in mid 1999. Previous attempts to deal with this through the use of special chemical markers and testing involving a fleet of trucks had, in our assessment, proved ineffective. As a result the government implemented a systemic solution recommended by us involving revised excise tariff arrangements with effect from mid November 1999. That immediately closed off the excise evasion practices then in place. This included the use of domestically produced solvents.
I will not read the full text, but it seems to me that Senator Murphy would have been well advised to read what the commissioner said on this matter.
—Sorry, Minister, I missed that.
—This is a very serious issue, and the government takes the issue seriously.
—It is. And you're in diabolical trouble.
—All I can say is: not according to the opinion polls. The Labor Party, with its massive internal divisions at present—
—Why were so many Labor speakers brought on to speak on this bill? The short answer is: you are still trying to work out the deal on the Queensland land rights issue. That is why. Your party is hopelessly divided over that key issue, which is coming before the chamber later today. The Labor Queensland senators are in an uproar. 
—Don't ever accuse us of not responding to the bill!
—I know I am responding to the interjection from you, Senator Murphy, but I think you should clean up your own house first. There is big trouble in the Labor stable, let me assure you, on a wide range of issues. Perhaps later in the day I might, with you, run through all those massive Labor divisions.
—Senator Murphy has now gone back to petrol pricing issues, which have nothing to do with this bill. Senator Murphy, if you believe what you have argued, we will be pressing you on what the Labor Party propose to do. It is a fair question. As you fell over yourselves and comprehensively made complete dopes of yourselves on the GST debate, equally, when the Australian public wake up to the Labor Party fraud in this debate, you will suffer a similar fate.
—It is going to be very interesting. Are we managing to detect the Labor Party policy? Senator Murphy, we do know there was an attempt by a Labor Party state treasurer, Dr David Crean, to remove the subsidy from fuel. He was found out. He was nailed by the Commonwealth Treasurer—not by any Labor Tasmanian senator.
—How do you know?
—I will correct myself if I am wrong, but did Senator O'Brien make any press statement when Dr David Crean attempted to remove a state government subsidy arrangement on fuel? Did Senator Shayne Murphy make any press statement on that?
—I am listening. Senator Shayne Murphy and Senator O'Brien were jumping up and down here, but did they make any statement attacking Dr David Crean, the Labor Party state treasurer, when he attempted to remove a subsidy?
—If you did, I would be very happy to hear it, but I do not think you did, Senator O'Brien. The trouble with you is that you never rate on the radar. The reason you never rate on the radar is that you never stand for anything. You ask a lot of questions. You jumped up and down for six months about the GST, and suddenly on 1 July Senator O'Brien becomes a supporter of the GST. No wonder you are treated with contempt by your own people.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The minister just made a statement that is totally incorrect. I did put out a statement, for your information, Minister, with regard to the state government.
 (Senator McKiernan)—That is not a point of order, Senator Murphy. Minister Kemp, in speaking on the bill, I would appreciate it if you would keep your remarks to the bill.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I said that I would correct myself if I was wrong, but I trust the press statement was attacking Dr David Crean?
—It was attacking the state government and the Treasury.
—Before I make any further comment, I had better see the whole statement from you, Senator Murphy.
—Senator Conroy, given the trouble the Victorian Labor Party are in, I would not butt into this conversation if I were you. Your president, Mr Greg Sword, is not too pleased with you, Senator Conroy, and he is dead right not to be pleased with you. The government will not be supporting the second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook. The amendment has nothing to do with the bill before the chamber, and we will not be supporting it.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Cook's) be agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM EXCISE AMENDMENT (MEASURES TO ADDRESS EVASION) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2000-08-30,"—I want to raise as a matter of public interest today an issue fundamental to Australia's ability to participate in the World Trade Organisation—that is, our capacity to engage the dispute settlement system. Writing recently in the Australian Financial Review, the Minister for Trade, the Hon. Mark Vaile, recognised that there is an urgent need to increase understanding of the WTO dispute processes among Australian industry. Others have recommended a new statutory specialist legal agency to conduct WTO disputes. The foreshadowed demonstrations at next week's World Economic Forum in Melbourne will no doubt prompt further comment on how Australia fares in the new global trading system—what are our rights and what are our obligations? On any view, this is a subject ripe for discussion. 
In January this year, with the assistance and encouragement of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I visited Washington and Brussels to examine the use of the WTO dispute settlement system by the United States and the European Union to see if there are lessons we could learn from their aggressive advocacy that has seen Australia on the receiving end of some pretty controversial cases—such as Howe leather, imported pig meat, Canadian salmon imports and, most recently, the United States ban on imports of Australian lamb. As a result of this visit and a recent visit to a legislators' conference in Taiwan where I contributed a paper on Taiwan, Australia and the WTO, I was recently asked by DFAT to open two WTO dispute settlement seminars held in Parramatta and Sydney. The aim of these seminars was to inform and educate legal practitioners and other business people about the practical implementation and use of the WTO dispute settlement system. It is important for producers, exporters, industry representatives, financiers, legal advisers and government representatives to understand the dispute settlement system in order for us to effectively participate in the WTO.
The rules based framework of the WTO agreements covers more than $100 billion worth of Australia's goods and services exports annually. Exports provide more than one in five Australian jobs; over half of Australian exports are generated in rural and regional Australia; and they account for a third of our work force. Put simply, Australia's future economic prosperity is inextricably linked to our export success and our ability to get access to new and emerging markets. Whether Australia continues to be a successful exporting nation depends in no small measure upon how well it participates in the WTO system.
Since 1995, Australia has gained access for more than 130 new products in more than 80 countries, spanning traditional bulk commodity exports to newer products in information technology, intellectual property and the services sector. In short, Australia has a vital interest in maintaining and building the global trading system, and the key to this is understanding the rules governing international trade and the dispute settlement system. There is a need to raise the level of awareness in the business community of the way the rules work and the way in which they can help to develop new business. Whilst Australia has undeniably had net gains from its participation in the WTO system, it has also been on the receiving end, as I said, of some much publicised adverse decisions. These cases have been pursued by both skilful and aggressive use of the dispute settlement system rules by other member countries.
The impact of these decisions has led to strident criticism of the rules in some quarters and in the media. While some of the criticism is justified, it is worth noting that the rules also provided Australia—and they provide the same for other member countries—with the opportunity, for example, to take on the United States over its unjustifiable import restrictions on Australian lamb and, most recently, the Republic of Korea over restrictions on imports of beef, where Australia had some success. Prior to the WTO mechanisms, there was virtually no legally enforceable way available under the previous GATT pro-cedures to challenge unwarranted safe-guard measures that are nothing short of protectionism. 
These cases merely serve to illustrate the importance to both government and industry of thoroughly understanding the rules, whether these rules are used defensively or proactively. As the rules have an impact on all cross-border transactions between member countries—from agriculture to pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, intel-lectual property, financial services and government procurement—both government and business ignore at their peril existing and future effects of the WTO rules in making strategic investment and policy planning decisions.
Recognising Australia's interest in the WTO's dispute settlement system, last year the government established within DFAT a Dispute Investigation and Enforcement Section to play an active role in the investigation and handling of disputes. There are, however, a number of questions as to whether Australia's efforts can be improved and even enhanced by the greater awareness and involvement of industry peak bodies, financiers, experts and advisers in identifying non-complying conduct by trading partners and bringing forward potential cases. Observations at close hand of how other countries use the dispute settlement system indicate that significant commercial advantages can be gained by both the participation in and strategic use of the dispute settlement system by governments to ensure compliance with WTO agreements. We are talking here about a partnership between government and business. The question is: how can industry participation be facilitated and how can the system be properly resourced? 
The United States is undoubtedly the most prolific and aggressive user of the WTO dispute settlement system. For that reason, it is worth examining the approach of the United States to advocacy in the WTO. The basic set-up is that both the commerce department and the United States trade representative, the USTR, share responsibility for monitoring and compliance of trade agreements. The commerce department, through country market access officers and industry sector experts, identify problems in the foreign implementation of United States trade agreements. United States companies also report when they are not receiving benefits due to them under trade agreements. Aggressive compliance advocacy is used short of dispute settlement wherever possible. The Trade Compliance Centre coordinates these activities to identify potential breaches. Private resources, particularly exporters at the coalface, are a critical part of this strategy. A trade compliance hotline ensures easy and inexpensive access to report breaches. 
The Trade Compliance Centre also has an important function in providing information to American companies about how to use trade agreements and how to identify and report any difficulties with market access. Where compliance fails, the United States trade representative assumes control of dispute settlement and enforcement. The WTO has become the preferred forum for asserting United States trade rights simply because it works so well. Indeed, I suspect that is what a lot of other interests, such as environmental groups and some labour groups, see as the use of the rules. Additionally, special domestic trade laws in the United States give enforcement responsibility to the USTR and provide effective tools for securing compliance through the dispute settlement system. 
The WTO dispute settlement system has simply proved invaluable in achieving tangible gains for American companies and workers and has succeeded as a deterrent to their trading partners who know that it is ready and available to the US if they do not fulfil their obligations. Having such a well-developed system has meant that the United States has been successful in reaching rapid resolution of complaints and early settlement while also achieving benefits from fully litigating carefully chosen cases to enforce US rights. 
The input from the United States legal profession, I think, is worth noting. It is proactive, and effectively underwrites the success of WTO advocacy, being financed by interested companies and associations. This input has proved extremely beneficial to the United States handling of WTO disputes, particularly in intensive fact based cases where the US relies on industry to gather and compile the evidentiary bases for the complaint and to share assessments of the legal arguments. In the European Union, the commission advised that, as a general rule, it does not outsource case management. However, the commission does contract outside consultants, mainly legal academics or other experts, to undertake special projects such as a recent study on the workings and implications of the United States Foreign Sales Corporation Act.
Larger law firms that I visited advised through their representatives that they were able to link their practice in antidumping countervailing cases to underpin the development of WTO dispute handling expertise. It has become a policy in all their main practice areas to make a special effort to identify potential WTO issues and to educate clients about the WTO. They organise special training sessions for their staff to which they invite WTO secretariat members. I suppose we can only wait for the first professional negligence case where advice about the WTO has been wrong, inadequate or indeed missing.  
Canada, on the other hand, outsources WTO case management to the private sector on appropriate occasions with private lawyers arguing WTO cases for the Canadian government. Moreover, Canada has been disposed to employ the very best lawyers available, irrespective of nationality, which has been used to good effect. In fact, an Australian trade lawyer—I hate to say—was retained by Canada on some aspects of the salmon case. Brazil, lacking in-house expertise, routinely outsources WTO work. Small developing countries have little choice but to outsource, and some trade lawyer contacts listed developing countries or representing NGO interests as the source of their WTO practice development.
Just to give you an idea of how the United States is prepared to use the WTO rules to force their trade agenda, let me run through a few instances which give some indication of their recent priorities, either current or recently passed. The United States has threatened to take action against Argentina, Brazil and India concerning their failure to enforce intellectual property rights and open access to markets. Somewhat paradoxically it has refrained from taking retaliatory action against Japan and China over what is in the vicinity of $100 billion worth of deficits or to take on the European Union in its annual review of trade abuses. Who said the WTO is not political? Reassuringly, Australia has been dropped from a United States `watch list' on intellectual property rights enforcement, after it popped up for the first time last year. 
The United States is also having a go at Brazil over its intellectual property regime and its textile pricing. It is putting pressure on the Philippines over local content requirements in its domestic car market. The United States has taken action to push United States interests in the Indian car market and has also threatened action against Denmark if it does not enforce intellectual property laws more stringently. It is also targeting Romania over clothing, poultry and spirits. The list goes on and on. It has also foreshadowed that some action may be taken against the European Union's continuing subsidies to Airbus Industries, as a rival to Boeing; access to Japan's glass market and public works; and barriers to entry to South Korea's pharmaceutical and car markets. Mexico is also on the watch list because of imports. 
That is not to say that the United States has not been on the receiving end of some decisions. The Foreign Sales Corporation case is the case in point that has attracted most attention. It shows that we do need to be well and truly aware of how we can use the WTO system, particularly the dispute settlement system, to enforce our rights. The starting point is to raise awareness of the huge potential gains from using the rules as an instrument not only to defend our position but also to free up trade. Quite simply, the WTO has transformed the international trading system. We do need to understand the rules so that we can play the trade bullies at their own game—that is, by the rules.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>World Trade Organisation: Dispute Settlement System</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-08-30,"—My question is to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister confirm that the next indexation of fuel excise, due in February next year, will be abnormal in that the CPI will reflect the inflationary spike caused by the GST? Is it true that this is likely to add around 2c to 3c per litre to the price of petrol? Can he explain why the ever growing number of government backbenchers calling for a freeze on fuel excise indexation are, in the words of the Prime Minister, naive and irresponsible? Is the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also naive and irresponsible in calling on the government to consider using a discounted CPI measure for the indexation—one that is not distorted by the GST's impact on inflation?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-08-30,"—I ask a supplementary question, Madam Deputy President. I ask the minister: where is that fairness in jacking up the government excise on petrol in response to an abnormal CPI increase caused entirely by your GST?
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! The level of noise on both sides of the chamber is not tolerable.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-30,"—Since coming to office in 1996 the coalition has not increased petrol excise; it has of course continued the usual indexation in line with the CPI. Compare that with the record of the previous Labor government: when Labor came to office, petrol excise was 6.155c per litre; when it left office, excise was 34.183c per litre—an increase of 28c per litre or over 550 per cent. That was the Labor record in relation to excise.
—Order on my left! Senator Cook, can I have some order and less noise in the chamber.
—I will provide some more information for Senator Cook in particular. Labor introduced excise indexation in August 1983. That is worth remembering—Labor introduced excise indexation. Of course as indexation is linked to the CPI, petrol excise increased far more under Labor— with an average of 5.2 per cent inflation between 1983 and 1996—than it has under the coalition, with an average of 1.4 per cent inflation between 1996 and 2000. So Labor bring in indexation with CPI and, as a result of inflation being higher under Labor—a high expenditure government, with high taxes and high interest rates—the rate of increase is higher than under the coalition government. Since coming to office, the coalition has not increased petrol excise; it has continued only the indexation with CPI. So what are the Labor Party on about? I would have thought that the Labor Party would be embarrassed about raising this matter, because their record was appalling. In contrast to the coalition not increasing petrol excise, Labor increased it by 7.5c per litre as a discretionary budget measure while in office—5c being announced in their 1993 tax hike budget. Labor's 1993 petrol tax hike raised them an extra $5.2 billion—for Senator Cook's benefit—or $3.55 million per day. That is what Labor did with a voluntary hike in excise duty.
—Order, Senator Cook!
—Well will he answer the question.
—Senator Cook, will you please come to order. Senator Hill has the call—that means that you should not be talking for the whole time he is.
—Despite rising world oil prices, and because this is a government that constrains tax, Australia still has the fourth lowest petrol prices amongst the industrial-ised countries of the OECD. A contest is always between two sides. In this case it is between a low tax government, the Howard government, and a high tax alternative, the Labor Party, based on its 13 years in office.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-30,"—I am sorry that Senator Campbell did understand the answer, so I will repeat it for his benefit. It was the Labor Party that introduced indexation. The Labor Party also voluntarily added extra taxes on petrol. This government has not increased the indexation; it has only been indexation in relation to CPI. The real contrast is that, when Labor came to office, petrol excise was 6.1c per litre; when they left office, it was 34.1c per litre. That is what the Australian people ought to think about. Yet even with that record the Labor Party seek to alarm the Australian people today. It is just a political hoax. Their record is appalling. This is a low tax government, and we are proud of it.

Dear Minister
I refer to the Defence (Prohibited Words and Letters) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 41.
The Committee notes that new subregulation 4(2), which is inserted by item 3 of the Schedule to these Regulations, provides the Minister with the discretion to grant permission to use a phrase, word or letter with or without conditions. The exercise of this discretion does not appear to be subject to external merits review (or, indeed, any review at all).  The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether such review would be appropriate.  If so, the Committee notes that the exercise of the Minister's discretion to consent to the use of a phrase, word or group of letters, in existing subregulation 4(1), is also not subject to any form of review, and that some form of external merits review may be appropriate.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 19 June 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.
Yours sincerely

Thank you for your letter of 13 April 2000 relating to the absence of external merit review for parts of the Defence (Prohibited Words And Letters) Amendment Regulations 2000.
I note that subregulation 4(1) of the Regulations has never been subject to external merit review. As a consequence, a decision was taken to follow this stance with new subregulation 4(2). However, in light of your concerns, this issue is being given fresh consideration, to ensure that this stance is the most appropriate in the circumstances. I will write to you again when I have further information.

Dear Senator Coonan
I write further to my reply of 6 June 2000 to your letter of 13 April 2000 relating to the absence of external merits review in relation to parts of the Defence (Prohibited Words and Letters) Regulations 2000.
As I foreshadowed in my letter, subregulation 4(1) of the Regulations has never been subject to external review. I have consulted with relevant operational areas within the Department of Defence who consider Defence is uniquely placed to determine whether words or phrases should be prohibited and that the status quo in this matter should remain; that there are appropriate informal review mechanisms in place. You may care to note that there has been no recorded instance where a problem has arisen.
However, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, this matter has been referred to the Administrative Review Council for consideration. I will keep you informed of the developments in relation to this matter.
Yours sincerely

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-08-30,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion and at the request of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Lees, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 620.
Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, I believe that this matter is urgent and ought to be dealt with today by the Senate. I am sure you would be aware, having been through the processes of the anti-genocide inquiry as I have, that there is a very serious circumstance surrounding the presence in Australia of Mr Konrad Kalejs who, contrary to popular perception, has been found guilty of war crimes in both Canada and America. He was also of a mind to leave Britain at a time when he was under scrutiny for war crimes in that country and of course ended up in Australia and is now living in Melbourne.
This motion simply is to ensure that, if Mr Kalejs should present himself to an Australian airport or seaport, the Senate is empowered through Customs officers or empowers Customs officers to effectively confiscate his passport such that he cannot leave the country. Why would this be the case? It is the case because we understand that Mr Kalejs is shortly, hopefully, to be sought extradition of by Latvia, where we hope he will return to Riga and be properly investigated for the considerable allegations surrounding his war crime activities in Latvia during World War II.
We know also from his past behaviour that there is every chance that he may seek to leave Australia prior to that happening. I know that outside this place there are some people who believe that this motion is not in order or is beyond the power of the Senate. The reality is that no court has ever adjudicated on this matter, so it is at best mere speculation—a case of who has the better legal opinion. The government has been wrong before in both the Mabo and Wik cases. The Commonwealth unsuccessfully argued for the non-existence of native title—how wrong they were! It is clear under section 6A of the Passports Act 1938:
An Australian passport remains always the property of the Commonwealth.
The assertion made by some that a proper purpose test should be made out before return to order is complied with is neither current Senate practice nor current political reality. I also understand that both Senator Vanstone and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, have received advice from their own departmental officials which says that the motion is entirely within order and that the Senate has the power to take this course of action.
Australian governments have consistently failed to adequately investigate and prosecute people who stand accused of the murder of children, unarmed civilians, Jews, gypsies, political detainees, homosexuals and others. The reality is that Mr Kalejs is free to evade justice again by jumping on a plane and leaving this country at any time so that he can avoid proper investigation and potential prosecution in Latvia. That is clearly unacceptable. Throughout much of this debate as it has occurred in Australia, Senator Vanstone has been at pains to try to mislead the public and Holocaust survivors with the view that Mr Kalejs is only an `accused' person and that he has been only accused of wrongdoing. That is wrong. The US Court of Appeals found that Mr Kalejs had been `a key officer in a unit that killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians'. On 1 November 1988, Judge Petrone of the US Immigration Court found the Australian criminal standard of proof was beyond reasonable doubt, although it was a civil defence. His judgment stated:
[Mr Kalejs] actions on the Eastern Front in 1942, his role at Salaspils and Sauriesi camps and his participation at Porkhov and Skuano in 1943 were under the leadership of the Arajs Kommando in association with the Nazi military and civil authorities responsible for the occupation of Latvia. The incarceration, forced labour and brutal treatment of jews and political prisoners at Salaspils, Sauriesi and Porkhov, the killing of civilians at the front and the execution of gypsies were acts of persecution because of race, religion, national origin or political opinion. The respondent assisted and participated in this persecution. Therefore I find that the respondent is deportable under section 241(a)(19) of the act as charged. 
In other words, he was deportable for crimes against humanity and the heinous crime of genocide. Even Senator Vanstone's colleague Senator Helen Coonan said on 15 August 1997:

This is an opportunity to ensure that Mr Kalejs does not leave Australia prior to any potential and thorough investigation into his activities during World War II and to ensure that Latvia has every opportunity for extradition so that that can take place.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-08-30,"—I state that the government will not be supporting this motion. We think it is an extraordinary use of the Senate's powers. I think it would certainly ensure that anyone who sought to portray it as such would be successful in saying this was a purely politically based action. I do not think the Senate should sit as a jury in this matter. As I said, we do believe that this impinges on executive power or judicial power or both. Although Senator Greig's motives are clearly beyond reproach, I do not think it was necessary for him to make any sort of reflection on the minister's views on this matter. I think Senator Greig's motives are clearly beyond reproach, but this action is entirely inappropriate and we will not be supporting the suspension.",SENATE,"<title>KALEJS, MR KONRAD</title>",<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,13,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-08-30,"—The opposition will not be supporting this suspension. We do not support the motion. I do not propose to deal with the reasons for that, because that is not the debate we are having now; we are having a debate about whether there should be a suspension. I remind Senator Greig that his colleague Senator Woodley has 13 motions to be dealt with this afternoon. A list of 14 people seeking to speak on those motions has just arrived on my desk. Yet Senator Greig seeks to have us debate a motion which, properly debated, could take the rest of today. Senator Greig and his party have to make a decision as to what their priorities are. It is not our view, given that the disallowance motions must be debated today, that we should suspend to allow this motion to be debated when it clearly will be lost.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-08-30,"—Today marks the first anniversary of the East Timor independence vote. This time one year ago was a harrowing time for the East Timorese people, who lost their homes, their livelihoods and, in many cases, their loved ones. This time one year ago Australia was shocked and appalled by the senseless violence taking place right on our doorstep. This time one year ago was a tragic day, for the events which took place on that day and those that followed would change East Timor forever. Ironically, what should have been a day for celebration for the East Timorese independence campaign instead degenerated into bloodshed and destruction.
One year on, the persecution of the East Timorese people—the killings, the forced removals and the other acts of violence—may have stopped, but for many the nightmare goes on. Uncertainty about the future and a lack of even the most basic infrastructure has hampered development in so many areas. I said at the time that it was important we did not lose sight of the human face of the East Timor conflict and the lasting impact that those momentous events of 30 August would have on the East Timorese people. Australians had, and still have, a responsibility in terms of helping the new East Timor nation develop its commercial sector, health infrastructure and education systems. It is a responsibility that we will have for many years into the future.
Australia's involvement in the East Timor peacekeeping operation has been ongoing. As I speak there are more than 1,500 Australian Defence Force members still deployed in East Timor, with another 80 Australian personnel remaining in East Timor as part of the United Nations civilian police. Currently Australia has a spending commitment of more than $25 million for its UNTAET police presence in 2000-01, a level it will maintain for the next four years. Australia's Defence Force spending in East Timor is much more substantial: more than $948 million in the current financial year.
The efforts of ADF and Australian Federal Police personnel has been valiant. They have already faced great difficulties, and security in the region, particularly along the western border, is still of grave concern to the federal government. Crucial to the resolution of underlying tensions in this region and the disarmament of militia groups is the cooperation of the Indonesian government. The Australian government is continuing its dialogue with its Indonesian counterparts to defray conflict in this area. Keeping this intransigency in check is the main short-term goal of the government. Helping to rebuild the nation is the much bigger task facing Australia in the longer term.
The rampant vandalism and destruction which plummeted East Timor into ruin was compounded by the departure of the many Indonesians who had administrated the local government, justice and health systems, as well as much of the local commercial activity. In virtually every area of infrastructure there is work to be done at the most basic level—most importantly in education, health and welfare, and in the development of strategies to stimulate the local economy.
Australian assistance via AusAID totalled $81 million in the 1999-2000 financial year. AusAID has proposed spending of $40 million for 2000-01, including various amounts on education, health, agricultural and rural development, water supply, governance, and humanitarian assistance. In the next four years AusAID will commit a total of $150 million. There are many other areas for which international donors have promised $870 million to rebuild East Timor. I sincerely hope this money is forthcoming. Frankly, I am cynical about this commitment, and I want to see it on the ground where it is needed. AusAID has helped the UNTAET effort too, through the trust fund, to the order of $27 million in cash and in-kind assistance.
We need to take into account also the important input of private Australian companies to the reconstruction effort. Australian firms are involved in the reconstruction. Harvey Norman has opened a franchise in Dili. About 200 Australian firms are registered as suppliers and contractors in road and bridge repair, electricity, telecommunications, shipping, security, and hotels and restaurants. There are transport groups operating, and Qantas plans to open air services between Dili and Darwin. The Darwin based airline Air North currently has a monopoly on the Dili to Darwin services. Yet, for all the optimism inherent in this commercial activity, some Australian companies are concerned that their efforts are threatened by a UN administration which they claim is often incompetent, colonialist and patronising. These issues need to be addressed in the longer term. UNTAET, for example, had a budget of $US350 million for the 1999-2000 year; yet it spent only $US225 million of that to May this year. Has UNTAET allocated the almost $US125 million left over? Its proposed budget for 2000-01 supposedly is $US584 million. How will that money be spent? But, perhaps more importantly, is there a guarantee that this source of funding will continue? It is most important to the community. 
We need to see that basic services are switched on through practical support for education and the provision of seeds, tools, clean water and housing and roofing kits. We need to be vigilant to ensure that UN money is best utilised in this area. Some of the initiatives being taken by UNTAET and other international aid organisations in rejuvenating East Timor are important. There is the World Bank process of reconstruction to ease unemployment pressures where US government relief has been involved. The numbers of people employed are very important. UNTAET is planning to undertake its own capital investment projects using funds from the trust fund and from the World Bank. There is also the rebuilding of markets and other places throughout the area. These are signs of hope. International aid coming into East Timor will help stimulate local growth. For example, nine Timorese companies have been selected by the UN Office for Project Services to tender for the rehabilitation of a prison administration office, a court and a prosecutor's office in Baucau.	Another 13 Timorese companies have been invited to tender for the construction of a court, a prosecutor's house, an education store and an employment service centre in Dili.
Yet there is much still to be done, and I expect Northern Territorians, who were instrumental in the provision of a safe haven in Darwin after the 30 August ballot, will give a big hand in that. It is now up to us to ensure that the good works are carried on; that the UNTAET administration—which I admit has faced difficult conditions—is held to account for its spending. Already, it has restored security, stabilised the humanitarian situation and commenced reconstruction, making good progress in building the foundations of governance, a judiciary, a central finance sector and a police service. Just as Australia must provide a guiding hand to help East Timor on its way to independence and ensure that appropriate leaders are installed in government, it is vital that the good work by outside organisations is maintained. The road ahead is a challenging one, particularly for the local East Timorese people, but it is one that, with continued international engagement and scrutiny, will see the birth of a new chapter in East Timor's history.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>East Timor: Independence</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-30," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 10 May 2000:
With reference to genetically-engineered crops:
(1) Are precise details of the location of such crops available; if so, where; if not, why not.
(2) Why has the Tasmanian Government received no reply to its request to have no genetically engineered crops planted in the state.
(3) Why is there no `opt-out' clause in the proposed legislation on genetically engineered crops for states wishing not to allow genetically engineered crops for states wishing not to allow genetically-engineered crops.
(4) Will indicative labelling be required of all foodstuffs containing genetically-engineered materials; if not, at what level of genetically-engineered contamination will labelling be required.
(5) Does the Government support local government having power to determine whether genetically-engineered crops be allowed.
(6) Is there a premium on the sale of organic foods in Australia and from Australia for export; if so, what is the approximate percentage on sale price of that premium.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Organisms: Crop Locations</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,23,1,question
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-08-30,"—The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) Precise details of the locations of trial crops of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are not made available under current administrative arrangements because there are legal restrictions on disclosure of information and there is no specific legal provision allowing such disclosure.  This is one of the reasons that new legislation is necessary.
With no legislation in place, the information is protected by certain rules and considerations.  These considerations include that:
. the Commonwealth must comply with requirements of the Privacy Act 1988, including the Information Privacy Principles;
. the Commonwealth may be under a duty of confidence arising under the general law in relation to the information;
. release of the information may disclose trade secrets, or otherwise adversely impact on the business operations of an entity; and
. release of the information may impact on the Interim Office of the Gene Technology Regulator's (IOGTR) ability to obtain accurate information and, as a result, adversely affect its oversight of the current administrative system.
Nevertheless, the name of a contact officer in the organisation which is undertaking the field trial may be provided, and the decision on whether to release information on the precise locations then rests with the organisation.
Under the proposed new legislative system, the Gene Technology Regulator (GTR) will treat all information provided to it as publicly available information, unless a proponent can demonstrate that the information should be treated as confidential commercial information (for example, trade secrets).  And even in these latter instances, the legislation still provides the GTR with the capacity to release the information if he or she believes that it is in the public interest to do so.
(2) It is wrong to suggest that the Tasmanian Government has not been fully briefed on whether or not a prohibition on GMOs can be implemented in Tasmania.  
Tasmanian officials from the Department of Primary Industry and Energy have been working for over five years with other States and Territories, as well as the Commonwealth, to develop a national regulatory framework for GMOs.  This work has been underway since that time because no jurisdiction, including Tasmania, had jurisdictions specific legislation that controlled GMOs.
All jurisdictions are committed to the introduction of a national uniform regulatory controls for GMOs. 
In May last year, the Minister for Health and Aged Care was given responsibility for drawing this protracted work to a close, as efforts to date had failed to result in agreement amongst jurisdictions, or in draft legislation.  Between May 1999 and February 2000, significant progress was made on this framework, with officials from all jurisdictions agreeing the detail of legislation (although Tasmania continued to call for an explicit `opt-out' to be included in the Commonwealth component of the scheme.  This matter is addressed in response to Question 3) in February this year.  
The new legislation is on track to be fully implemented by 3 January 2001.
In the context of this work, Tasmanian officials are fully aware that under the legislation: 
. All GMOs in Australia would in broad terms be prohibited, unless the risks resulting from the genetic modification had been assessed, and the GMO and dealing licensed by an independent regulator;
. Tasmania, like all States and Territories and any interested party in the community, would have two separate opportunities, for each GMO application to highlight specific concerns about the risks of that GMO to the Tasmanian environment or the health and safety of the Tasmanian community;
. Any GMO that presented a risk to the environment or to human health that could not be managed would remain prohibited;
. That the legislation focuses on environment and human health because of community concerns that any reference to trade issues would result in trade considerations overriding the protection of the environment and human health;
. That concerns which are broader than environment risks and human health risks can be dealt with under the legislation, but must be agreed by majority vote of all Ministers on the Ministerial Council and be expressed as a Policy Principle under the legislation;
. Having extensively covered all environmental and health concerns, an explicit opt-out provision based on other grounds (such as trade considerations) cannot be included in the Commonwealth Bill as discussed at Question 3.
The Tasmanian Government therefore has full access to information on why, in the absence of any Tasmanian or Commonwealth legislation at this point in time, GMOs cannot be prohibited in Tasmania.
This information has been reiterated in correspondence from the Secretary of the Gene Technology Advisory Committee (GMAC) to the Hon David Llewellyn MP, Minister for Primary Industry, Water and Energy in Tasmania on 1 June 2000 and correspondence from the Parliamentary Secretary to Mr Llewellyn on 4 June 2000.
(3) The Government's policy position is that there are a range of potential risks associated with providing for an opt out provision in the legislation, including risks in relation to Australia's international obligations.
(4) The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council is currently scheduled to consider the labelling of genetically modified food by the end of July.
(5) Yes, within the parameters of response to question 3.
(6) While the new regulatory system is responsible for identifying and managing the human health and environmental risks posed by, or as a result of, genetically modified organisms, inquiries to relevant portfolios would indicate that there is not a standard premium for organic foods; it is a question for the individual manufacturer or retailer.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Organisms: Crop Locations</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,23,1,answer
