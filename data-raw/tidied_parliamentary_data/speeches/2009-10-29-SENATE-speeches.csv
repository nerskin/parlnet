—I am pleased to support Senator Fielding’s motion with the additional term of reference inserted and welcome his interest in the disturbing practice of workplace injury management and rehabilitation at Australia Post. Australia Post has come under increasing criticism from the community and has had many individual cases raised by the relevant union, the CEPU, about the way the organisation manages the claims in cases of sick and injured employees who have sustained work related injuries. Labor has long been concerned that, through various measures taken by Australia Post management including the use of facility nominated doctors, employees’ rights to workers compensation entitlements and workplace rehabilitation are being undermined. Indeed, Labor acknowledged this at our most recent national conference and resolved to implement this very inquiry. It is good to see that Senator Fielding is such an avid reader of Labor policy documents and the Hansard of previous budget estimates hearings. It makes a nice change to the dirt-digging, fear and smear driven policy void of those opposite.
Chapter 11 of our policy document New ways of governing for a stronger democracy contains a resolution that the federal government undertake an independent inquiry into these alarming circumstances. Since coming to this place I along with other Labor senators and the minister have raised this matter regularly with Australia Post through the process of estimates. I have become aware of apparently legitimate compensation claims being denied on the recommendation of the facility nominated doctors, allegations of sick and injured workers having their symptoms questioned or ignored by Australia Post managers and of harassment by management following workplace injuries. I am concerned about the incentives that the facility nominated doctors process gives Australia Post management. One of the matters I believe this inquiry should look at is the interplay between salary bonus policies and achieving low lost-time injury markers. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-10-29,"—To allow the apology to the forgotten Australians to be tabled, I move:
That, on Monday, 16 November 2009, the hours of meeting shall be noon to 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,8,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-29,"—by leave—I wish to, by way of clarification, ask if the minister can enlighten the chamber with some more detail. We had contact at 9.20 this morning in the leader’s office indicating some detail about the apology being given in the Great Hall, which we certainly support. We need to understand why the Senate is being asked to sit from 12 noon instead of 12.30. What is taking place in the Senate chamber? Senator Ludwig a few moments ago, whilst the chamber was active, indicated to me that there will be a statement tabled in the Senate. If we could understand why it is required to do that at 12 instead of 12.30, that would be appreciated. We are very supportive of the apology, but we just want to know the mechanics, the process and why the Senate needs to start half an hour earlier. If we can do this by exchange in the chamber, Mr President, I would appreciate that.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,8,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-10-29,"—by leave—The House of Reps is starting at noon and I have similarly sought for the Senate to start at noon. These are sensitive issues and there are also discussions that are ongoing with the relevant interested groups. All of the detail is not public because it has not been finalised, as I understand it. I ask the Senate to take on an understanding role in this respect. I understand that the House has sought to sit from noon. We could follow likewise so that we can allow those negotiations to be concluded and dealt with in a sensitive way. It is not the in-tention of this government to deal with work during that time.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-29,"—by leave—In the spirit of our frank discussion across the chamber, I would like to further interrogate the minister. What I understand from the minister is that this is a contingency measure in case the Senate chamber is needed to be active from 12 noon in relation to the apology. That is seeking, in real terms, an additional half an hour of Senate sitting time. If the minister can guarantee that we are not facilitating additional government business by a backdoor method, I will accept his word on that. In addition to that, could he amend his motion to include the adjournment debate from the normal time? It is not explicit in the motion. It says, ‘The hours of meeting shall be noon to 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm’; the adjournment should be proposed then at 9.50. I seek a response as to whether the adjournment debate will still continue for the normal 40-minute period.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,8,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-29,"—by leave—I will deal with the last matter first. That is the standard way the orders are written. Of course the adjournment is proposed from 9.50 pm, as is always the case on that particular day, and that is the way it has always been reflected in the past. I can indicate that the matter of seeking to start at 12 noon to synchronise with the House of Representatives is about allowing time for that particular matter I raised earlier to be dealt with in a sensitive way and to allow discussions to continue. This is the last day that we can put in place arrangements for that to occur. If the time is not needed then we will talk to you about what we might usefully use the time for.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,8,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-29,"—by leave—I trust this will be my last contribution on  this. On that basis, the coalition will support that provision. We are clearly on the record, since May of this year, indicating that the government has not allocated enough sitting weeks, early enough, for us to plan. We do not want to facilitate additional hours for the government. We are not going to cover up for their mismanagement of not extending hours. This is a significant issue and, for that purpose only, the coalition will support the additional half-hour of sitting.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-10-29,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 31 March 2010:
a reconsideration of the committee’s findings in relation to Australia’s Mandatory Last Resort Home Warranty Insurance Scheme, in light of:
the 2008 Federal Ombudsman’s report that demonstrated that last resort home warranty insurance is the worst performing insurance in the nation,
the Essential Services Commission’s review of the Victorian Domestic Insurance Scheme which demonstrates that there is virtually no benefit to anyone other than the insurers and their brokers of this insurance product,
evidence to these inquiries which demonstrate that the Senate’s conclusions were based on information now shown to be wrong, including the fact that the Senate estimated that less than 10 per cent of builders provided securities whereas 44 per cent of those in Victoria have done so since 2002,
the lack of competition in the market which is now down to three insurers, and
the questionable legality of the deeds of indemnity, bank guarantees and securities demanded by insurers as a condition of eligibility for warranty insurance;
any reforms which may lead to appropriate consumer and builder protection and improved housing affordability; and
any related matters.
I am at a loss to understand why the government and opposition, as has been indicated to me by both of them, will not support this motion of reference back to the Senate Economics References Committee for a one-day hearing to reconvene the inquiry we held in order to review the evidence and the conclusions the committee made previously. I find it extraordinary because of what I am now going to put on the record. Something is about to happen, and when it happens I do not want to hear from the government or any member of the coalition that they did not know it was going to happen. I do not want to see them wring their hands. We are aware that by the end of November, CGU insurers and, by the end of December, Lumley Insurance will have withdrawn from the market for builders warranty insurance. That means that by the end of December, 25 to 30 per cent of Australia’s builders are going to be in dire straits.
Those builders are going to be in dire straits because the law says there has to be mandatory last resort home warranty insurance. The law says it has to be in place or they cannot build. But they will not be able to adhere to the law because they have no more securities to offer. They have already provided securities to Vero and QBE insurers, who were the only two major players left in the market. The builders already have securities with them. They have no more to offer, so they will not be able to build. They will either go broke or have to build illegally. Twenty-five to 30 per cent of Australia’s builders are going to be in this position by the end of the year and both the government and the coalition know it but will not act on it.
What is going on here? There have been 38 inquiries into last resort home warranty insurance since 2002 and every one of them hears the same evidence. Parliamentary inquiries, one after the other, have been told that this insurance product is worthless. Tasmania has finally abolished it and that is a good thing. Every one of these inquiries hears that the best way of managing this is the Queensland system. Everybody knows that, and yet every time these committees report they are immediately swayed by the Housing Industry Association and by Vero Insurance and suddenly they go to water. It is time we heard why governments go to water so profoundly in the face of lobbying from these insurance companies.
So I want this inquiry reconvened because at the end of the year builders are going to be in dire straits and either will be forced into noncompliance with the law or will go broke. The other reason why it is critical we deal with it is that I believe the evidence given to the committee was either misleading or misleading by omission. We had a lot of allegations about just how profitable this insurance is to the insurers and what a worthless product it is to the consumers. We heard that over and over again. But along came the insurance companies saying, ‘No, no, that is not the case.’ Since the Senate economics committee reported on this, we have had the Victorian Essential Services Commission report. That report used New South Wales builders warranty insurance templates and, on page 36 of the report, it is stated that the total number of claims paid between 2002 and 2008 was only 273. In that six-year period the total payout to consumers was only $9 million or thereabouts. But the total payout from premiums received each quarter from December 2005 to June 2008 was $10½ million. In other words, the insurance companies have taken more in three months than the total paid out over the full six years.
That is a good business to be in, isn’t it. You earn more in three months than you pay out in six years. But it was not just the Essential Services Commission report that has come out since the Senate report. We have also had the insurance ombudsman’s report, and it makes very clear that evidence being given by organisations like the Builders Collective of Australia was true and that evidence being given by the insurance companies was not. In the ombudsman’s report, in terms of commercial lines of insurance, it states that the highest rate of rejected claims, running at 45 per cent, was found in relation to builders warranty. If you have a look at the others, you find that it is a very small number. So look at the profitability and look at the number of claims that have been rejected and ask yourself: why is this product mandatory?
I simply do not understand it because, as we know, it has not been used. It has not been used when there have been collapses such as the Beechwood collapse in New South Wales and the Gumleaf Construction collapse in Victoria. If it is effective in providing redress when you have major collapses, why was it bypassed in those cases? The government has argued previously that it has to be mandatory. My argument is that if it was worth anything then people would go and source this insurance product. In the end, even the HIA was embarrassed into saying that they thought it would be all right if this product were made voluntary. But no, the government insists that it remains a mandatory product.
I think we have to look at who is benefiting. The overwhelming beneficiaries are Vero Insurance and QBE, with Vero being the dominant player in the market. There have been 38 inquiries which, time after time, keep coming up with recommendations that benefit this particular insurance company. I ask the government to explain when they stand up to respond to this what the level is of Australian Labor Party investment in Suncorp-Metway, which owns Vero Insurance. I think the community has a right to know the answer to that question. Builders around Australia are asking that question. Consumer groups—Choice magazine—quite rightly called this junk insurance. At least the Tasmanian government found it to be worthless and abolished it. We should be moving to a much better regime of consumer protection than this offers, but it is rolled every time. I simply do not understand why, when clear evidence is presented, governments cannot reach the obvious conclusions. In the last Senate inquiry, there was sufficient evidence to suggest that the recommendations ought to have been that we should have a national approach to this issue of protecting consumers in the face of shoddy building or builders becoming insolvent, dying, disappearing and so on, that we should move to a system based on the Queensland model of home warranty insurance and that the federal government should oversee the design of the scheme and have it implemented through the COAG process. We should have adopted a time frame for that to happen so that the new scheme would come into operation as soon as possible. That has not happened. We do not have a national approach. And guess what has happened: we now have yet more inquiries announced with, as I see in media reports, a new inquiry being announced in Victoria. That was announced on 17 September this year as a result of the Victorian Essential Services Commission report.
The first thing that should happen is that the federal government should immediately move to abolish this, come up with a uniform scheme and have it delivered through COAG. Secondly, we should be making sure that the product which exists at the moment is not mandatory. If it is any good, it will be supported voluntarily. Thirdly, we should make sure that any form of home warranty insurance is included in the National Claims and Policies Database so that there is transparency about the performance of the insurance product. Fourthly, we should make sure that, if any loopholes remain in Commonwealth regulation or legislation, such that home warranty insurance is exempted in any way from oversight by APRA, the ACCC or ASIC, that legislation or regulation should be amended immediately to close the loophole.
The last time the Senate Economics References Committee inquired into this issue, it heard evidence from insurers which seemed to contradict other evidence that they were making great profits and that they had a poor-performing insurance product. Now, however, with the insurance industry ombudsman’s report making it perfectly clear it is the worst-performing product in the nation—45 per cent of claims rejected—and with the Victorian Essential Services Commission report showing that, each quarter, these insurers are making more than they have paid out in the whole period, you really have to ask, ‘Is the Senate going to stand for people coming before it who know all this and who, when they are asked, keep quiet about it in order that their product at the expense of builders continues to be supported by being kept mandatory?’
Going back to the issue of builders, we have a situation now with securities and indemnities. This was brought up in the last inquiry. The way that the insurance companies were requiring builders to provide unlimited bank guarantees and various kinds of deeds of indemnity that lock in builders and preclude them from being able to change insurers was made very clear. You have to ask, ‘How is it possible that you can offer an insurance product and then require the person seeking insurance to put up some surety against it?’ That is virtually asking the person seeking the insurance to become the reinsurer. I cannot believe that is legal. It has got to the point now where builders are so desperate and worried about what is going to happen to them by the end of the year that they have gone to court to try to establish whether it has been legal for these insurance companies to require them to put up securities and deeds of indemnity such that they are now stuck in a situation where they cannot meet the law and are likely to go broke because they have been forced to reinsure.
These insurance companies are taking virtually no risk here. They get the premium. They have the reinsurance capacity so that, if anything goes wrong, they can get it back from the builders concerned. How fair is that? When you take out any other form of insurance, the insurance company does not come back and require you to put your house up as surety against that insurance. The premium reflects the level of risk. That is what you do for life insurance, house insurance, car insurance or anything else. If you are an at-risk applicant for insurance, you will pay a premium.
As we said when we talked in this place about sea level rise around the coast, the issue is—as I have warned for years—that there will come a point, and there already is a point, when insurance companies will say that if you are at risk or have damage as a result of an action of the sea, you are not covered. That is why thousands of people around Australia are not covered by the insurance that they think they have got. This matter has been referred to the Law Reform Commission, because as damage starts to occur to houses around the coast and people find that they are not insured, they are going to find themselves in a position where they do not have the money to even demolish the house they have got—let alone get the insurance to build a new one.
The other situation is that local governments are giving out planning permission to build in areas that are vulnerable. Ultimately, insurers will not pay and the only option people will have is to sue the local council for allowing them build in the first place. I ask: why is it that these insurance companies have been able to force builders to be the reinsurers to guarantee maximum profits to Vero—which is owned by Suncorp Metway? Suncorp Metway has a substantial investment from the Labor Party. I am really looking forward to hearing the government telling us how much the ALP have got invested in this company. I will be delighted to hear if they no longer have an investment in that company. That will clear up one issue that I have in relation to findings that are always coming down from governments from one end of the country to the other.
I simply cannot understand why this parliament would not agree to reconvene the inquiry for a one-day hearing, given what I have just said about builders being in dire straits by Christmas, with 30 per cent of them forced into noncompliance and having to go to court to test the legality of whether the insurance companies actually can force them to become reinsurers. The inquiry would not have to take a whole lot more evidence but, firstly, review the evidence that was given by the insurance companies to see whether their evidence in relation to the percentage of claims that were rejected was true; secondly, look at the profitability, because the claims they made certainly do not match what the insurance ombudsman or the Victorian Essential Services Commission have had to say. I just want to have that evidence examined to see whether it was true or whether the Senate committee was misled.
The inquiry should then review the conclusions that the Senate committee reached, which were weak and did nothing to assist the consumer or the builders in this particular circumstance. It should also revisit the issue of whether the product should be mandatory or not. If the federal parliament could move to at least remove the mandatory nature of this product in the next month or two, that would stop these 30 per cent of builders from being forced into a position of noncompliance with the law, while we get things sorted out. That could be done in the course of a single day. That is not a lot for a Senate committee to do. It is about reconvening, examining those issues, getting rid of the mandatory nature of it and  checking that this particular insurance product is not exempt from oversight by these financial oversight bodies. It is critical that the committee be able to look at it, because it is not until you get reports from bodies like the Essential Services Commission and the ombudsman that you actually find out what is going on with this product. Once we get rid of the mandatory nature, then we can move quickly into next year to start looking for a harmonised system of consumer protection across Australia. Getting rid of it in the short term would help the 25 to 30 per cent of builders who are in trouble right now.
I am not asking for a comprehensive inquiry. We have had the inquiry. I am asking for an assessment of whether evidence given to the inquiry was true, whether the conclusions were valid, whether the claims being made now are true—that 25 to 30 per cent of builders are going to be noncompliant by Christmas because CGU and Lumley, plus the one other that is in the market, will have withdrawn and we will be left with only Vero and QBE, and those builders will be unable to get security.
We have had a lot of talk in this place about how people support small business. Oh yes, they support small business. If you do not support this reference you are not supporting small business in Australia; you are undermining it. Many of these builders are small to medium sized builders, and many of the companies that are contracted to them are also small to medium sized contracted businesses. You are putting the whole construction industry at risk by not re-examining this. This is not just my assertion; this is factual. This is also the claim of the insurance industry ombudsman and the Essential Services Commission from Victoria. Reject it if you choose to, but understand the ramifications. When this happens at Christmas time, come out and admit that you are the people who knowingly allowed it to happen. I urge the Senate to reconsider.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-10-29,"—The government is aware of concerns about builders home warranty insurance and sympathises with the frustration that has caused some consumers and builders to make representations. The Senate Standing Committee on Economics recently held an inquiry into builders home warranty insurance, and that inquiry did hear all of the concerns that Senator Milne has raised this morning. We understand that the government is considering its response to the Senate inquiry into the mandatory last resort home warranty insurance scheme and will table its response soon.
The Senate inquiry reported on 13 November last year. Its main recommendation was that COAG and the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs pursue a nationally harmonised scheme of consumer protection in domestic building. That recommendation is already in place as a result of the inquiry last year.
In the meantime the government gained the agreement of the states and territories at the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs meeting in May this year to review consumer protection measures in the building industry, following the Commonwealth placing it on the meeting agenda. That ministerial council noted the findings of the Senate inquiry’s report, and it has already agreed to refer this matter to the Standing Committee of Officials of Consumer Affairs to consider as part of the review of the harmonisation of conduct provisions for the national licensing system. Establishment of a national trade licensing system is identified as a priority within the national partnership agreement to deliver a seamless national economy between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. This agreement forms part of the broader Council of Australian Governments reform agenda. Additionally, the ministerial council has agreed to place builders home warranty insurance on its strategic agenda.
State and territory governments are responsible for regulating builders home warranty insurance. Senator Milne asked for the Economics References Committee to do a one-day hearing and then, as she said, get rid off it in the short term; but that is not a possibility. The Commonwealth does not have responsibility. The economics committee certainly does not have responsibility for those laws and regulations, and it is unable to put such a thing in place before Christmas. Having the Senate committee revisit its inquiry in which all of these issues were raised will not produce Senator Milne’s desired action before Christmas.
Action has already been undertaken by the government to have this reviewed by the state governments, who are, after all, responsible for laws and regulations in this area. Therefore, the ministerial council is the most appropriate body to pursue the issues further, as it includes representatives of state and territory governments. This process will enable insurance arrangements to be considered in conjunction with broader aspects of the building industry, including licensing requirements and dispute resolution mechanisms. The Senate inquiry included those two issues specifically as something that had to be considered in conjunction with insurance. The government considers it is essential that insurance be considered in this broader context as well.
The government is also closely monitoring developments following the recent decisions of both Lumley General and CGU Insurance Ltd to withdraw from the home warranty insurance market. In its role of monitoring the implementation of the General Insurance Code of Practice, the Financial Ombudsman Service published statistics provided by insurers about insurance claims, including builders warranty claims. As part of the process of responding to the Senate inquiry, the government is considering options to address issues associated with the lack of access for homeowners to effective dispute resolution schemes, as well as a lack of homeowner understanding about the product. So the government has put in place motions.
Senator Milne raised questions about the Labor Party’s role in Suncorp. I have no knowledge of Labor Party involvement in Suncorp. But I would point out that it was a Tasmanian Labor government that abolished mandatory home warranty insurance. The Queensland government—and, as I understand it, Suncorp is based in Queensland—runs its own very good government insurance warranty. We had no complaints from either South Australia or Western Australia. This is principally an issue for Victoria and New South Wales governments. Our Senate inquiry found that the New South Wales government is undertaking significant reform in this area. As chair of the economics committee during the inquiry, I did not see that there was any basis to suspect that there was any Labor government involvement in Suncorp.
So, as chair of the economics committee, I see no benefit in doing an additional inquiry, whether it is one day or 10 days. The frustrations were in evidence. We understood the frustrations. We understood the issues. We made strong recommendations, which the government has commenced dealing with. I think that there would be no benefit—beyond what the government is doing—in pursuing another inquiry. I think it would be basically a waste of time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-29,"—I indicate my support for Senator Milne’s motion. I think it is a very worthy motion and it deserves support. I would like to discuss both the merits and the issue of process as well.
In relation to the merits of having another inquiry, I would like to say a few things. Senator Hurley says that the Commonwealth does not have responsibility for home warranty insurance—and that is correct. The Commonwealth does not have responsibility for home warranty insurance at this time. But what is clear from the High Court’s decision in Work Choices is that the sphere of Commonwealth power and the extent to which the Commonwealth can be involved in issues previously thought to be the purview or the jurisdiction of the states is quite extensive by virtue of using the corporations powers, and other powers in the Constitution. I think that, if the Commonwealth wants to have responsibility in relation to this very important issue, it ought to. I believe that in terms of state schemes there has not been a seamless national approach to home warranty insurance. It has been a mishmash and a fiasco in terms of the way it has operated in various states. I note the move of the Tasmanian government to abolish the scheme, to go it alone, in a sense, with respect to this.
I think it is relevant to take into account the whole issue of what has occurred in the last 12 months since the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics into home warranty insurance. There have been developments. The 2008 federal Ombudsman’s report demonstrated that home warranty insurance is the worst performing insurance in the nation. The recent review of the Essential Services Commission in Victoria demonstrated that this scheme is fundamentally flawed. An article from insurancenews.com.au of 21 September this year states:
The Victorian Essential Services Commission has released the latest report into the controversial privatised last resort system, which once again reveals a massive disparity between the number of claims submitted and those paid by insurers.
The Victorian report reveals insurers have accepted just 273 claims from 1363 received between 2002-08, for a total outlay of $10.23 million. It’s a profitable line of business, with insurers earning around $7 million in premium each quarter.
—It’s outrageous.
—Senator Milne says, ‘Outrageous,’ and she is absolutely right. That is price gouging. Not only are you being ripped off on price but also you are being ripped off on service in terms of what is being covered by this form of insurance. The article in insurancenews.com.au goes on to say:
Judging by the report, the product is clearly failing to meet consumer expectations. That’s having a negative effect on the industry via a stream of critical reports in the daily media.
Madam Acting Deputy President Hurley, it was not so long ago that we were both in the South Australian parliament when HIH collapsed. I remember that I was involved with a group of HIH victims dealing with their frustration with the system. The then Liberal government eventually moved to provide support for those families, but it was a very difficult time for them. The delay caused a lot of angst and a lot of heartache for those people while they were waiting to see whether they were covered.
I think it indicates that we need a national, seamless scheme with consistency of purpose and consistency of service—a scheme that actually does what it is meant to do in terms of home warranty insurance. I believe there is a lot of merit in Senator Milne’s motion on the whole issue of the process. I note, Madam Acting Deputy President, in your role as Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, you quite rightly pointed out that a comprehensive report was prepared last year and I commend the committee on the work done. I was not that involved in it—I think it was in my first few months as a member of the committee—but things have changed since that time. There have been a number of developments that indicate a need for a further review of this matter and I believe, as does Senator Milne, that we can deal with this in the course of the day. I know how busy both the Economics References Committee and the Economics Legislation Committee are, but I have confidence that we can build on the work done previously to review the recent developments and that we can at least push the agenda forward. There are many consumers around the country who have been affected by a building company collapsing and, by their having to go through the trauma of trying to claim through a very inadequately administered scheme, some good can come out of the Senate committee process.
I urge my colleagues in the coalition to consider supporting this motion. It might involve an extra day’s hearing to advance the debate. I think it is inevitable there will eventually be a national scheme for home warranty insurance. When you consider the figures and what the Victorian Essential Services Commission said about the extraordinary profits made—the gouging, as Senator Milne says, and I agree with her—these are way out of kilter with anything that the insurance industry is making from general insurance. This shows there is something wrong. I am not against people making a decent profit from their businesses, but this goes beyond that. It is a case of price gouging; it is a case of very poor service. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Milne’s motion. I also urge Senator Milne, in the event that it is defeated today, to keep pushing this issue because I think reform is needed. I also believe the Economics References Committee can play a useful role in advancing an informed debate in relation to the reforms that are needed for this industry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-10-29,"—I take it that the coalition is not even going to speak to this motion. It is very interesting that members of the coalition are not going to speak because it is they who run around saying they support small business. So let them explain to the builders, their suppliers and companies in November and December this year why they refused to bring this matter to a head in a time frame that would have allowed the federal government to take some action to save builders from being put in a position of building in a non-compliant way under the law or else going broke.
I want to address some of the issues that people have raised. I heard the Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, Senator Hurley, saying that the matter has been referred to the standing committee of officials at COAG and that it is now on its strategic agenda. I am sure that the builders around Australia are enormously relieved to know it is on the strategic agenda! Things are on that strategic agenda for a decade and never get beyond the strategic agenda. COAG is the biggest black hole for inaction. If you want to make sure nothing happens, then you leave it to COAG, but if the Commonwealth decides to drive something at COAG it can do it.
It is a question of political will. If it is left to the states nothing will happen. The Commonwealth needs to drive it. Of course, it needs to be done through COAG and the ministerial council, because that is the mechanism through which the federal government relates to the states. But it should be driven by the Commonwealth and there should be the political will to do it. To say it is not possible for anything to be done before Christmas is saying that it is not possible to save 25 per cent to 30 per cent of Australia’s builders from being in dire circumstances before Christmas. This is the national parliament. This is what we are supposed to be doing. We are supposed to be looking out for the interests of people.
We have Tasmanian dairy farmers in complete chaos because of what National Foods has done. The Commonwealth has no direct power to do anything about that, yet everyone is quite rightly rushing around trying to do something. You would expect parliamentarians to support people who are in dire straits. So why isn’t the government prepared to put its shoulder to the wheel and help builders right now when it has the power to do something about it by driving it through COAG and the ministerial council? I have heard it said that the government is closely monitoring the situation with Lumley Insurance and CGU pulling out. What does ‘closely monitoring the situation’ mean? Who is closely monitoring the situation? To what end is it monitoring the situation? What is being done to assess the fact that the securities that have already been offered cannot be transferred? That is the issue for these builders, because when those two companies pull out there will be no more securities to provide because the ones that have already been provided to Vero, QBE and other companies are not transferable. What are they supposed to do?
What is the government doing? It says it is monitoring the situation. The minister did not tell me what that means. It is like in Oliver Twist: ‘I am monitoring the situation.’ Very good. I am glad they are monitoring the situation! But what is monitoring of the situation actually doing about the situation? This is the sort of thing that people in the community cannot stand: bureaucratic gobbledygook for monitoring a situation. I hope Senator Abetz can tell me what monitoring the situation means since he is not prepared to support the builders on this occasion. I would like him to tell us why he is so comfortable about the fact that the federal government is monitoring the situation. Very good. Let us see what the builders think the government’s close monitoring of the situation is doing.
The New South Wales government is about to engage in significant reform. Nobody could seriously believe that the New South Wales government is capable of engaging in significant reform, and I cannot believe the coalition would think the New South Wales government was capable of engaging in significant reform. It needs to significantly reform itself before it can significantly reform anything else in the New South Wales economy. Frankly, people have lost all confidence in the New South Wales government being able to administer things in a way that is not in many ways questionable. Whilst we have the New South Wales government reviewing the situation—no doubt, closely monitoring the situation, again; no doubt, looking into it, again, being yet another government of mirrors looking into things—we have the Commonwealth, the chair of the Senate estimates committee and of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and the federal parliament saying that there is no benefit in an additional inquiry, that it would be a waste of time.
I hope every builder in Australia knows that as far as the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party are concerned it is a waste of time to consider the fact that 25 to 30 per cent of Australia’s builders are going to either be carrying on their businesses illegally by Christmas or be out of business by Christmas, and the fact that they have to raise money to go to court in order to try and get some judgment about whether these companies can force them to be their own reinsurers. This is a ludicrous situation and it just cannot be allowed to continue. I really am appalled that we have a situation where the federal parliament is prepared to abrogate its responsibilities in this regard to a group of people who are the backbone of the government’s stimulus package. All this money is being spent on building and construction around the country, supposedly to keep people in work, in the face of the global financial crisis and we have a ridiculous, last resort, mandatory home warranty insurance scheme putting people out of work. This is a classic case of the government failing to look at the consequences of its action: pouring money in and then letting builders build illegally. That is the situation we have at the moment. Worse still, it is forcing them to put up their own deeds of indemnity and their own bank guarantees to get insurance so that they continue to carry on their businesses.
I thank Senator Xenophon for his support for recognising what is clearly in the figures from the Essential Services Commission of Victoria and the insurance ombudsman, which pointed out that this is a very, very poor insurance product—45 per cent of claims rejected—and that what is going on with these insurance companies is price gouging. There is no-one who could justify the fact that the total value of the claims between 2002 and 2008 was $10.23 million yet at the same time the average premium income was $6.9 million a quarter since December 2005. How can you possibly justify that? So few claims have been paid out. In the course of the inquiry we discovered the reason for that. It is very difficult to prove that a builder has become insolvent and the insurance company just says, ‘No, they remain solvent.’ Then you have to take another legal route to try and prove anything to the contrary.
This is a disaster for Australian builders and for communities, and we desperately need a standardised system around Australia of consumer protection. Tasmania started the ball rolling. This should be a two-stage process. Instead of just monitoring the situation, the government should be moving now to call an emergency meeting to make sure we abandon the mandatory nature of this before Christmas, so that the builders can build legally and then, instead of putting it on the strategic agenda for some consideration years down the track, move rapidly to get it quickly onto the national radar so that we can roll out a system similar to the one in place in Queensland.
I want to express my thanks to Senator Xenophon and my disgust at the government and the coalition for their lack of care and responsibility for builders in Australia—
—Consumers.
—Yes, builders and consumers. I congratulate the Builders Collective and the work they have been doing for years and years to bring to the attention of the parliament the reality of what is going on with this junk insurance. The community already knows it because consumers are suffering. Choice called it junk insurance, quite rightly. Tasmania responded and the rest of the country is lagging behind in response. I really urge the coalition to reconsider its position, because I can see chaos in the building industry ensuing by Christmas. I do not know when the Builders Collective court case will get into court. But why should a consumer advocacy group have to get to the situation of taking this matter of whether reinsurance is legal to court in order to continue their business?
For the life of me, I cannot understand why a parliament is so careless about such a significant group of people, a significant number of businesses and the whole consumer public when it comes to the issue of constructing your own home. For most families who get to the point of building their own home it is the major asset in their life. It is a failure of leadership by the Australian parliament to be so careless about this consideration in reassessing the validity of these schemes, the price gouging of companies like Vero and the failure of this insurance product.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2009-10-29,"—There is no doubt that home warranty insurance is a very serious matter in which there is room for a great deal of improvement. The facts of the matter are that there are different regimes around this country and consumers, except in Queensland and the ACT, in fact get very little protection from their home warranty insurance even though they think it means that if something goes wrong with the construction of their building then they will be indemnified and the necessary repairs will be made.
As Senator Milne said, I think, there have been 38 inquiries into this matter. So one must conclude that all the relevant facts are known about this issue of home warranty insurance and how inadequate it is in, as I said, all places except perhaps Queensland and the ACT. There are certainly a lot of issues of consumer protection that need to be addressed. However, the coalition does not believe that a further hearing will lead to more relevant or substantially different knowledge about the state of affairs in home warranty insurance than what has already been revealed through the very long inquiry into this matter by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics.
The coalition believes that the time has come for the question of home warranty insurance to be referred to COAG so that common legislation can be developed which will apply across Australia and give protection to people building homes across this country. I think that, Senator Milne, is what we should do from this point on. There should be a common agreement to refer this to COAG for the COAG process to come up with, as I said, legislation which would apply across the country and provide adequate protection to people building houses anywhere in Australia.
There is no doubt that Senator Milne is quite right: it is a scandal that home warranty insurance has the flaws that it does. Home warranty insurance is in fact quite fraudulent. People are taken in by it and consumers are put at risk. But it is not really a federal matter; it is a matter for the states, and the best outcome would be to refer this to COAG for the COAG process to deal with it.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Milne’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-10-29,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 31 March 2010:
a reconsideration of the committee’s findings in relation to Australia’s Mandatory Last Resort Home Warranty Insurance Scheme, in light of:
the 2008 Federal Ombudsman’s report that demonstrated that last resort home warranty insurance is the worst performing insurance in the nation,
the Essential Services Commission’s review of the Victorian Domestic Insurance Scheme which demonstrates that there is virtually no benefit to anyone other than the insurers and their brokers of this insurance product,
evidence to these inquiries which demonstrate that the Senate’s conclusions were based on information now shown to be wrong, including the fact that the Senate estimated that less than 10 per cent of builders provided securities whereas 44 per cent of those in Victoria have done so since 2002,
the lack of competition in the market which is now down to three insurers, and
the questionable legality of the deeds of indemnity, bank guarantees and securities demanded by insurers as a condition of eligibility for warranty insurance;
any reforms which may lead to appropriate consumer and builder protection and improved housing affordability; and
any related matters.
I am at a loss to understand why the government and opposition, as has been indicated to me by both of them, will not support this motion of reference back to the Senate Economics References Committee for a one-day hearing to reconvene the inquiry we held in order to review the evidence and the conclusions the committee made previously. I find it extraordinary because of what I am now going to put on the record. Something is about to happen, and when it happens I do not want to hear from the government or any member of the coalition that they did not know it was going to happen. I do not want to see them wring their hands. We are aware that by the end of November, CGU insurers and, by the end of December, Lumley Insurance will have withdrawn from the market for builders warranty insurance. That means that by the end of December, 25 to 30 per cent of Australia’s builders are going to be in dire straits.
Those builders are going to be in dire straits because the law says there has to be mandatory last resort home warranty insurance. The law says it has to be in place or they cannot build. But they will not be able to adhere to the law because they have no more securities to offer. They have already provided securities to Vero and QBE insurers, who were the only two major players left in the market. The builders already have securities with them. They have no more to offer, so they will not be able to build. They will either go broke or have to build illegally. Twenty-five to 30 per cent of Australia’s builders are going to be in this position by the end of the year and both the government and the coalition know it but will not act on it.
What is going on here? There have been 38 inquiries into last resort home warranty insurance since 2002 and every one of them hears the same evidence. Parliamentary inquiries, one after the other, have been told that this insurance product is worthless. Tasmania has finally abolished it and that is a good thing. Every one of these inquiries hears that the best way of managing this is the Queensland system. Everybody knows that, and yet every time these committees report they are immediately swayed by the Housing Industry Association and by Vero Insurance and suddenly they go to water. It is time we heard why governments go to water so profoundly in the face of lobbying from these insurance companies.
So I want this inquiry reconvened because at the end of the year builders are going to be in dire straits and either will be forced into noncompliance with the law or will go broke. The other reason why it is critical we deal with it is that I believe the evidence given to the committee was either misleading or misleading by omission. We had a lot of allegations about just how profitable this insurance is to the insurers and what a worthless product it is to the consumers. We heard that over and over again. But along came the insurance companies saying, ‘No, no, that is not the case.’ Since the Senate economics committee reported on this, we have had the Victorian Essential Services Commission report. That report used New South Wales builders warranty insurance templates and, on page 36 of the report, it is stated that the total number of claims paid between 2002 and 2008 was only 273. In that six-year period the total payout to consumers was only $9 million or thereabouts. But the total payout from premiums received each quarter from December 2005 to June 2008 was $10½ million. In other words, the insurance companies have taken more in three months than the total paid out over the full six years.
That is a good business to be in, isn’t it. You earn more in three months than you pay out in six years. But it was not just the Essential Services Commission report that has come out since the Senate report. We have also had the insurance ombudsman’s report, and it makes very clear that evidence being given by organisations like the Builders Collective of Australia was true and that evidence being given by the insurance companies was not. In the ombudsman’s report, in terms of commercial lines of insurance, it states that the highest rate of rejected claims, running at 45 per cent, was found in relation to builders warranty. If you have a look at the others, you find that it is a very small number. So look at the profitability and look at the number of claims that have been rejected and ask yourself: why is this product mandatory?
I simply do not understand it because, as we know, it has not been used. It has not been used when there have been collapses such as the Beechwood collapse in New South Wales and the Gumleaf Construction collapse in Victoria. If it is effective in providing redress when you have major collapses, why was it bypassed in those cases? The government has argued previously that it has to be mandatory. My argument is that if it was worth anything then people would go and source this insurance product. In the end, even the HIA was embarrassed into saying that they thought it would be all right if this product were made voluntary. But no, the government insists that it remains a mandatory product.
I think we have to look at who is benefiting. The overwhelming beneficiaries are Vero Insurance and QBE, with Vero being the dominant player in the market. There have been 38 inquiries which, time after time, keep coming up with recommendations that benefit this particular insurance company. I ask the government to explain when they stand up to respond to this what the level is of Australian Labor Party investment in Suncorp-Metway, which owns Vero Insurance. I think the community has a right to know the answer to that question. Builders around Australia are asking that question. Consumer groups—Choice magazine—quite rightly called this junk insurance. At least the Tasmanian government found it to be worthless and abolished it. We should be moving to a much better regime of consumer protection than this offers, but it is rolled every time. I simply do not understand why, when clear evidence is presented, governments cannot reach the obvious conclusions. In the last Senate inquiry, there was sufficient evidence to suggest that the recommendations ought to have been that we should have a national approach to this issue of protecting consumers in the face of shoddy building or builders becoming insolvent, dying, disappearing and so on, that we should move to a system based on the Queensland model of home warranty insurance and that the federal government should oversee the design of the scheme and have it implemented through the COAG process. We should have adopted a time frame for that to happen so that the new scheme would come into operation as soon as possible. That has not happened. We do not have a national approach. And guess what has happened: we now have yet more inquiries announced with, as I see in media reports, a new inquiry being announced in Victoria. That was announced on 17 September this year as a result of the Victorian Essential Services Commission report.
The first thing that should happen is that the federal government should immediately move to abolish this, come up with a uniform scheme and have it delivered through COAG. Secondly, we should be making sure that the product which exists at the moment is not mandatory. If it is any good, it will be supported voluntarily. Thirdly, we should make sure that any form of home warranty insurance is included in the National Claims and Policies Database so that there is transparency about the performance of the insurance product. Fourthly, we should make sure that, if any loopholes remain in Commonwealth regulation or legislation, such that home warranty insurance is exempted in any way from oversight by APRA, the ACCC or ASIC, that legislation or regulation should be amended immediately to close the loophole.
The last time the Senate Economics References Committee inquired into this issue, it heard evidence from insurers which seemed to contradict other evidence that they were making great profits and that they had a poor-performing insurance product. Now, however, with the insurance industry ombudsman’s report making it perfectly clear it is the worst-performing product in the nation—45 per cent of claims rejected—and with the Victorian Essential Services Commission report showing that, each quarter, these insurers are making more than they have paid out in the whole period, you really have to ask, ‘Is the Senate going to stand for people coming before it who know all this and who, when they are asked, keep quiet about it in order that their product at the expense of builders continues to be supported by being kept mandatory?’
Going back to the issue of builders, we have a situation now with securities and indemnities. This was brought up in the last inquiry. The way that the insurance companies were requiring builders to provide unlimited bank guarantees and various kinds of deeds of indemnity that lock in builders and preclude them from being able to change insurers was made very clear. You have to ask, ‘How is it possible that you can offer an insurance product and then require the person seeking insurance to put up some surety against it?’ That is virtually asking the person seeking the insurance to become the reinsurer. I cannot believe that is legal. It has got to the point now where builders are so desperate and worried about what is going to happen to them by the end of the year that they have gone to court to try to establish whether it has been legal for these insurance companies to require them to put up securities and deeds of indemnity such that they are now stuck in a situation where they cannot meet the law and are likely to go broke because they have been forced to reinsure.
These insurance companies are taking virtually no risk here. They get the premium. They have the reinsurance capacity so that, if anything goes wrong, they can get it back from the builders concerned. How fair is that? When you take out any other form of insurance, the insurance company does not come back and require you to put your house up as surety against that insurance. The premium reflects the level of risk. That is what you do for life insurance, house insurance, car insurance or anything else. If you are an at-risk applicant for insurance, you will pay a premium.
As we said when we talked in this place about sea level rise around the coast, the issue is—as I have warned for years—that there will come a point, and there already is a point, when insurance companies will say that if you are at risk or have damage as a result of an action of the sea, you are not covered. That is why thousands of people around Australia are not covered by the insurance that they think they have got. This matter has been referred to the Law Reform Commission, because as damage starts to occur to houses around the coast and people find that they are not insured, they are going to find themselves in a position where they do not have the money to even demolish the house they have got—let alone get the insurance to build a new one.
The other situation is that local governments are giving out planning permission to build in areas that are vulnerable. Ultimately, insurers will not pay and the only option people will have is to sue the local council for allowing them build in the first place. I ask: why is it that these insurance companies have been able to force builders to be the reinsurers to guarantee maximum profits to Vero—which is owned by Suncorp Metway? Suncorp Metway has a substantial investment from the Labor Party. I am really looking forward to hearing the government telling us how much the ALP have got invested in this company. I will be delighted to hear if they no longer have an investment in that company. That will clear up one issue that I have in relation to findings that are always coming down from governments from one end of the country to the other.
I simply cannot understand why this parliament would not agree to reconvene the inquiry for a one-day hearing, given what I have just said about builders being in dire straits by Christmas, with 30 per cent of them forced into noncompliance and having to go to court to test the legality of whether the insurance companies actually can force them to become reinsurers. The inquiry would not have to take a whole lot more evidence but, firstly, review the evidence that was given by the insurance companies to see whether their evidence in relation to the percentage of claims that were rejected was true; secondly, look at the profitability, because the claims they made certainly do not match what the insurance ombudsman or the Victorian Essential Services Commission have had to say. I just want to have that evidence examined to see whether it was true or whether the Senate committee was misled.
The inquiry should then review the conclusions that the Senate committee reached, which were weak and did nothing to assist the consumer or the builders in this particular circumstance. It should also revisit the issue of whether the product should be mandatory or not. If the federal parliament could move to at least remove the mandatory nature of this product in the next month or two, that would stop these 30 per cent of builders from being forced into a position of noncompliance with the law, while we get things sorted out. That could be done in the course of a single day. That is not a lot for a Senate committee to do. It is about reconvening, examining those issues, getting rid of the mandatory nature of it and  checking that this particular insurance product is not exempt from oversight by these financial oversight bodies. It is critical that the committee be able to look at it, because it is not until you get reports from bodies like the Essential Services Commission and the ombudsman that you actually find out what is going on with this product. Once we get rid of the mandatory nature, then we can move quickly into next year to start looking for a harmonised system of consumer protection across Australia. Getting rid of it in the short term would help the 25 to 30 per cent of builders who are in trouble right now.
I am not asking for a comprehensive inquiry. We have had the inquiry. I am asking for an assessment of whether evidence given to the inquiry was true, whether the conclusions were valid, whether the claims being made now are true—that 25 to 30 per cent of builders are going to be noncompliant by Christmas because CGU and Lumley, plus the one other that is in the market, will have withdrawn and we will be left with only Vero and QBE, and those builders will be unable to get security.
We have had a lot of talk in this place about how people support small business. Oh yes, they support small business. If you do not support this reference you are not supporting small business in Australia; you are undermining it. Many of these builders are small to medium sized builders, and many of the companies that are contracted to them are also small to medium sized contracted businesses. You are putting the whole construction industry at risk by not re-examining this. This is not just my assertion; this is factual. This is also the claim of the insurance industry ombudsman and the Essential Services Commission from Victoria. Reject it if you choose to, but understand the ramifications. When this happens at Christmas time, come out and admit that you are the people who knowingly allowed it to happen. I urge the Senate to reconsider.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-10-29,"—The government is aware of concerns about builders home warranty insurance and sympathises with the frustration that has caused some consumers and builders to make representations. The Senate Standing Committee on Economics recently held an inquiry into builders home warranty insurance, and that inquiry did hear all of the concerns that Senator Milne has raised this morning. We understand that the government is considering its response to the Senate inquiry into the mandatory last resort home warranty insurance scheme and will table its response soon.
The Senate inquiry reported on 13 November last year. Its main recommendation was that COAG and the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs pursue a nationally harmonised scheme of consumer protection in domestic building. That recommendation is already in place as a result of the inquiry last year.
In the meantime the government gained the agreement of the states and territories at the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs meeting in May this year to review consumer protection measures in the building industry, following the Commonwealth placing it on the meeting agenda. That ministerial council noted the findings of the Senate inquiry’s report, and it has already agreed to refer this matter to the Standing Committee of Officials of Consumer Affairs to consider as part of the review of the harmonisation of conduct provisions for the national licensing system. Establishment of a national trade licensing system is identified as a priority within the national partnership agreement to deliver a seamless national economy between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. This agreement forms part of the broader Council of Australian Governments reform agenda. Additionally, the ministerial council has agreed to place builders home warranty insurance on its strategic agenda.
State and territory governments are responsible for regulating builders home warranty insurance. Senator Milne asked for the Economics References Committee to do a one-day hearing and then, as she said, get rid off it in the short term; but that is not a possibility. The Commonwealth does not have responsibility. The economics committee certainly does not have responsibility for those laws and regulations, and it is unable to put such a thing in place before Christmas. Having the Senate committee revisit its inquiry in which all of these issues were raised will not produce Senator Milne’s desired action before Christmas.
Action has already been undertaken by the government to have this reviewed by the state governments, who are, after all, responsible for laws and regulations in this area. Therefore, the ministerial council is the most appropriate body to pursue the issues further, as it includes representatives of state and territory governments. This process will enable insurance arrangements to be considered in conjunction with broader aspects of the building industry, including licensing requirements and dispute resolution mechanisms. The Senate inquiry included those two issues specifically as something that had to be considered in conjunction with insurance. The government considers it is essential that insurance be considered in this broader context as well.
The government is also closely monitoring developments following the recent decisions of both Lumley General and CGU Insurance Ltd to withdraw from the home warranty insurance market. In its role of monitoring the implementation of the General Insurance Code of Practice, the Financial Ombudsman Service published statistics provided by insurers about insurance claims, including builders warranty claims. As part of the process of responding to the Senate inquiry, the government is considering options to address issues associated with the lack of access for homeowners to effective dispute resolution schemes, as well as a lack of homeowner understanding about the product. So the government has put in place motions.
Senator Milne raised questions about the Labor Party’s role in Suncorp. I have no knowledge of Labor Party involvement in Suncorp. But I would point out that it was a Tasmanian Labor government that abolished mandatory home warranty insurance. The Queensland government—and, as I understand it, Suncorp is based in Queensland—runs its own very good government insurance warranty. We had no complaints from either South Australia or Western Australia. This is principally an issue for Victoria and New South Wales governments. Our Senate inquiry found that the New South Wales government is undertaking significant reform in this area. As chair of the economics committee during the inquiry, I did not see that there was any basis to suspect that there was any Labor government involvement in Suncorp.
So, as chair of the economics committee, I see no benefit in doing an additional inquiry, whether it is one day or 10 days. The frustrations were in evidence. We understood the frustrations. We understood the issues. We made strong recommendations, which the government has commenced dealing with. I think that there would be no benefit—beyond what the government is doing—in pursuing another inquiry. I think it would be basically a waste of time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-29,"—I indicate my support for Senator Milne’s motion. I think it is a very worthy motion and it deserves support. I would like to discuss both the merits and the issue of process as well.
In relation to the merits of having another inquiry, I would like to say a few things. Senator Hurley says that the Commonwealth does not have responsibility for home warranty insurance—and that is correct. The Commonwealth does not have responsibility for home warranty insurance at this time. But what is clear from the High Court’s decision in Work Choices is that the sphere of Commonwealth power and the extent to which the Commonwealth can be involved in issues previously thought to be the purview or the jurisdiction of the states is quite extensive by virtue of using the corporations powers, and other powers in the Constitution. I think that, if the Commonwealth wants to have responsibility in relation to this very important issue, it ought to. I believe that in terms of state schemes there has not been a seamless national approach to home warranty insurance. It has been a mishmash and a fiasco in terms of the way it has operated in various states. I note the move of the Tasmanian government to abolish the scheme, to go it alone, in a sense, with respect to this.
I think it is relevant to take into account the whole issue of what has occurred in the last 12 months since the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics into home warranty insurance. There have been developments. The 2008 federal Ombudsman’s report demonstrated that home warranty insurance is the worst performing insurance in the nation. The recent review of the Essential Services Commission in Victoria demonstrated that this scheme is fundamentally flawed. An article from insurancenews.com.au of 21 September this year states:
The Victorian Essential Services Commission has released the latest report into the controversial privatised last resort system, which once again reveals a massive disparity between the number of claims submitted and those paid by insurers.
The Victorian report reveals insurers have accepted just 273 claims from 1363 received between 2002-08, for a total outlay of $10.23 million. It’s a profitable line of business, with insurers earning around $7 million in premium each quarter.
—It’s outrageous.
—Senator Milne says, ‘Outrageous,’ and she is absolutely right. That is price gouging. Not only are you being ripped off on price but also you are being ripped off on service in terms of what is being covered by this form of insurance. The article in insurancenews.com.au goes on to say:
Judging by the report, the product is clearly failing to meet consumer expectations. That’s having a negative effect on the industry via a stream of critical reports in the daily media.
Madam Acting Deputy President Hurley, it was not so long ago that we were both in the South Australian parliament when HIH collapsed. I remember that I was involved with a group of HIH victims dealing with their frustration with the system. The then Liberal government eventually moved to provide support for those families, but it was a very difficult time for them. The delay caused a lot of angst and a lot of heartache for those people while they were waiting to see whether they were covered.
I think it indicates that we need a national, seamless scheme with consistency of purpose and consistency of service—a scheme that actually does what it is meant to do in terms of home warranty insurance. I believe there is a lot of merit in Senator Milne’s motion on the whole issue of the process. I note, Madam Acting Deputy President, in your role as Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, you quite rightly pointed out that a comprehensive report was prepared last year and I commend the committee on the work done. I was not that involved in it—I think it was in my first few months as a member of the committee—but things have changed since that time. There have been a number of developments that indicate a need for a further review of this matter and I believe, as does Senator Milne, that we can deal with this in the course of the day. I know how busy both the Economics References Committee and the Economics Legislation Committee are, but I have confidence that we can build on the work done previously to review the recent developments and that we can at least push the agenda forward. There are many consumers around the country who have been affected by a building company collapsing and, by their having to go through the trauma of trying to claim through a very inadequately administered scheme, some good can come out of the Senate committee process.
I urge my colleagues in the coalition to consider supporting this motion. It might involve an extra day’s hearing to advance the debate. I think it is inevitable there will eventually be a national scheme for home warranty insurance. When you consider the figures and what the Victorian Essential Services Commission said about the extraordinary profits made—the gouging, as Senator Milne says, and I agree with her—these are way out of kilter with anything that the insurance industry is making from general insurance. This shows there is something wrong. I am not against people making a decent profit from their businesses, but this goes beyond that. It is a case of price gouging; it is a case of very poor service. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Milne’s motion. I also urge Senator Milne, in the event that it is defeated today, to keep pushing this issue because I think reform is needed. I also believe the Economics References Committee can play a useful role in advancing an informed debate in relation to the reforms that are needed for this industry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-10-29,"—I take it that the coalition is not even going to speak to this motion. It is very interesting that members of the coalition are not going to speak because it is they who run around saying they support small business. So let them explain to the builders, their suppliers and companies in November and December this year why they refused to bring this matter to a head in a time frame that would have allowed the federal government to take some action to save builders from being put in a position of building in a non-compliant way under the law or else going broke.
I want to address some of the issues that people have raised. I heard the Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, Senator Hurley, saying that the matter has been referred to the standing committee of officials at COAG and that it is now on its strategic agenda. I am sure that the builders around Australia are enormously relieved to know it is on the strategic agenda! Things are on that strategic agenda for a decade and never get beyond the strategic agenda. COAG is the biggest black hole for inaction. If you want to make sure nothing happens, then you leave it to COAG, but if the Commonwealth decides to drive something at COAG it can do it.
It is a question of political will. If it is left to the states nothing will happen. The Commonwealth needs to drive it. Of course, it needs to be done through COAG and the ministerial council, because that is the mechanism through which the federal government relates to the states. But it should be driven by the Commonwealth and there should be the political will to do it. To say it is not possible for anything to be done before Christmas is saying that it is not possible to save 25 per cent to 30 per cent of Australia’s builders from being in dire circumstances before Christmas. This is the national parliament. This is what we are supposed to be doing. We are supposed to be looking out for the interests of people.
We have Tasmanian dairy farmers in complete chaos because of what National Foods has done. The Commonwealth has no direct power to do anything about that, yet everyone is quite rightly rushing around trying to do something. You would expect parliamentarians to support people who are in dire straits. So why isn’t the government prepared to put its shoulder to the wheel and help builders right now when it has the power to do something about it by driving it through COAG and the ministerial council? I have heard it said that the government is closely monitoring the situation with Lumley Insurance and CGU pulling out. What does ‘closely monitoring the situation’ mean? Who is closely monitoring the situation? To what end is it monitoring the situation? What is being done to assess the fact that the securities that have already been offered cannot be transferred? That is the issue for these builders, because when those two companies pull out there will be no more securities to provide because the ones that have already been provided to Vero, QBE and other companies are not transferable. What are they supposed to do?
What is the government doing? It says it is monitoring the situation. The minister did not tell me what that means. It is like in Oliver Twist: ‘I am monitoring the situation.’ Very good. I am glad they are monitoring the situation! But what is monitoring of the situation actually doing about the situation? This is the sort of thing that people in the community cannot stand: bureaucratic gobbledygook for monitoring a situation. I hope Senator Abetz can tell me what monitoring the situation means since he is not prepared to support the builders on this occasion. I would like him to tell us why he is so comfortable about the fact that the federal government is monitoring the situation. Very good. Let us see what the builders think the government’s close monitoring of the situation is doing.
The New South Wales government is about to engage in significant reform. Nobody could seriously believe that the New South Wales government is capable of engaging in significant reform, and I cannot believe the coalition would think the New South Wales government was capable of engaging in significant reform. It needs to significantly reform itself before it can significantly reform anything else in the New South Wales economy. Frankly, people have lost all confidence in the New South Wales government being able to administer things in a way that is not in many ways questionable. Whilst we have the New South Wales government reviewing the situation—no doubt, closely monitoring the situation, again; no doubt, looking into it, again, being yet another government of mirrors looking into things—we have the Commonwealth, the chair of the Senate estimates committee and of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and the federal parliament saying that there is no benefit in an additional inquiry, that it would be a waste of time.
I hope every builder in Australia knows that as far as the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party are concerned it is a waste of time to consider the fact that 25 to 30 per cent of Australia’s builders are going to either be carrying on their businesses illegally by Christmas or be out of business by Christmas, and the fact that they have to raise money to go to court in order to try and get some judgment about whether these companies can force them to be their own reinsurers. This is a ludicrous situation and it just cannot be allowed to continue. I really am appalled that we have a situation where the federal parliament is prepared to abrogate its responsibilities in this regard to a group of people who are the backbone of the government’s stimulus package. All this money is being spent on building and construction around the country, supposedly to keep people in work, in the face of the global financial crisis and we have a ridiculous, last resort, mandatory home warranty insurance scheme putting people out of work. This is a classic case of the government failing to look at the consequences of its action: pouring money in and then letting builders build illegally. That is the situation we have at the moment. Worse still, it is forcing them to put up their own deeds of indemnity and their own bank guarantees to get insurance so that they continue to carry on their businesses.
I thank Senator Xenophon for his support for recognising what is clearly in the figures from the Essential Services Commission of Victoria and the insurance ombudsman, which pointed out that this is a very, very poor insurance product—45 per cent of claims rejected—and that what is going on with these insurance companies is price gouging. There is no-one who could justify the fact that the total value of the claims between 2002 and 2008 was $10.23 million yet at the same time the average premium income was $6.9 million a quarter since December 2005. How can you possibly justify that? So few claims have been paid out. In the course of the inquiry we discovered the reason for that. It is very difficult to prove that a builder has become insolvent and the insurance company just says, ‘No, they remain solvent.’ Then you have to take another legal route to try and prove anything to the contrary.
This is a disaster for Australian builders and for communities, and we desperately need a standardised system around Australia of consumer protection. Tasmania started the ball rolling. This should be a two-stage process. Instead of just monitoring the situation, the government should be moving now to call an emergency meeting to make sure we abandon the mandatory nature of this before Christmas, so that the builders can build legally and then, instead of putting it on the strategic agenda for some consideration years down the track, move rapidly to get it quickly onto the national radar so that we can roll out a system similar to the one in place in Queensland.
I want to express my thanks to Senator Xenophon and my disgust at the government and the coalition for their lack of care and responsibility for builders in Australia—
—Consumers.
—Yes, builders and consumers. I congratulate the Builders Collective and the work they have been doing for years and years to bring to the attention of the parliament the reality of what is going on with this junk insurance. The community already knows it because consumers are suffering. Choice called it junk insurance, quite rightly. Tasmania responded and the rest of the country is lagging behind in response. I really urge the coalition to reconsider its position, because I can see chaos in the building industry ensuing by Christmas. I do not know when the Builders Collective court case will get into court. But why should a consumer advocacy group have to get to the situation of taking this matter of whether reinsurance is legal to court in order to continue their business?
For the life of me, I cannot understand why a parliament is so careless about such a significant group of people, a significant number of businesses and the whole consumer public when it comes to the issue of constructing your own home. For most families who get to the point of building their own home it is the major asset in their life. It is a failure of leadership by the Australian parliament to be so careless about this consideration in reassessing the validity of these schemes, the price gouging of companies like Vero and the failure of this insurance product.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2009-10-29,"—There is no doubt that home warranty insurance is a very serious matter in which there is room for a great deal of improvement. The facts of the matter are that there are different regimes around this country and consumers, except in Queensland and the ACT, in fact get very little protection from their home warranty insurance even though they think it means that if something goes wrong with the construction of their building then they will be indemnified and the necessary repairs will be made.
As Senator Milne said, I think, there have been 38 inquiries into this matter. So one must conclude that all the relevant facts are known about this issue of home warranty insurance and how inadequate it is in, as I said, all places except perhaps Queensland and the ACT. There are certainly a lot of issues of consumer protection that need to be addressed. However, the coalition does not believe that a further hearing will lead to more relevant or substantially different knowledge about the state of affairs in home warranty insurance than what has already been revealed through the very long inquiry into this matter by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics.
The coalition believes that the time has come for the question of home warranty insurance to be referred to COAG so that common legislation can be developed which will apply across Australia and give protection to people building homes across this country. I think that, Senator Milne, is what we should do from this point on. There should be a common agreement to refer this to COAG for the COAG process to come up with, as I said, legislation which would apply across the country and provide adequate protection to people building houses anywhere in Australia.
There is no doubt that Senator Milne is quite right: it is a scandal that home warranty insurance has the flaws that it does. Home warranty insurance is in fact quite fraudulent. People are taken in by it and consumers are put at risk. But it is not really a federal matter; it is a matter for the states, and the best outcome would be to refer this to COAG for the COAG process to deal with it.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-29,"—In relation to the motion that is before us, this matter was adjourned last night and that allowed an opportunity to further discuss this matter with the minister. I would like to apologise to Senator Minchin—I have been trying to get on the phone to him this morning but I physically have not been able to, so I have not had an opportunity to speak to him, and that is not through lack of trying but because of other business. But essentially, and I indicated this broadly to Senator Minchin yesterday, I do have some concern about the whole issue of commercial-in-confidence, and I think those are concerns I have expressed to both Senator Conroy and Senator Minchin in terms of how commercial-in-confidence and public immunity claims have been dealt with in the past to prevent the release of information.
We note that the Auditor-General, both for this government and the previous government, was critical of the way commercial-in-confidence was being used. I note Senator Minchin’s arguments in relation to the issue of the relevance of the documents that were referred to—I think 16 pages out of about 884 were released—in relation to that. I believe it has been dealt with in this respect given the statement made yesterday by Senator Conroy about the basis upon which those documents were released, and that is on the record in Hansard. It is fair to say that I do not think it right for the government to say that these documents are completely irrelevant in the context of the structural separation bill, but in the context of the debate they are clearly more relevant in relation to the NBN bill that will be coming up next year.
Following discussions with my colleagues in the Greens, in particular Senators Ludlum and Brown, and Senator Fielding from Family First, I believe the best way forward in seeking to deal with this longstanding problem is to give notice of motion that there ought to be a reference to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. That committee should report back on the first day of sitting in 2010. It should consider the process of the release of documents to test whether such documents ought to be protected using the public interest immunity claims. It should also look at the approach used by, for instance, the New South Wales upper house in its processes, and look at whether an independent arbitrator, or indeed the Auditor-General, should look at these documents.
I want to make it clear to the government, publicly as well as privately, that I believe there ought to be reform in terms of the whole issue of commercial-in-confidence documents. There will be debate on the NBN in February, and the whole purpose of this process is to ensure there needs to be fundamental reform with respect to this. The committee will report back by the first sitting day in 2010, and my position is very clear: that governments need to do much better than they have in the past in dealing with commercial-in-confidence claims. In terms of this matter proceeding, my position is to support the government’s motion. We will not, in effect, be able to deal with this until the last two sitting weeks of this year. That does not mean that I am signed up, by any means, to the government’s legislation. I have a number of concerns. I have already said publicly that I am generally supportive of the principle of structural separation, but there are a whole range of issues to be dealt with before I get to a point of support for the government’s position. I do, however, think the debate ought to proceed further.
I note Senator Minchin’s general concerns on the whole issue of commercial-in-confidence with respect to this process, and I believe that by the first sitting day next year we will be in a better position to deal with those issues. I note that the minister will be making a statement in relation to the government’s support for this inquiry, as well as the resourcing of that inquiry, and further that the government will fully cooperate with such an inquiry dealing with public interest immunity claims. So that is my position, and I am grateful to the Senate for adjourning this matter last night to allow further discussion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,16,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-10-29,"—I will speak very briefly on this motion in relation to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009. Just before we adjourned last night, Senator Brown put some remarks on the record on the way that commercial-in-confidence information is handled. Whilst recognising, of course, that there are legitimate times when commercial-in-confidence material should not be tabled and put into the public realm, he noted that it is used as a shield by both sides of politics against disclosure of documents that may well be in the public interest. It is quite a number of months since Senator Minchin originally put this motion on the Notice Paper, and in that time we have consistently maintained that the government’s claims are unacceptable. It is completely unacceptable for the government to say of the entirety of the material produced by the ACCC and by the expert panel in relation to the work done last year and earlier this year: ‘No, you cannot have it. The entire content of those documents is commercial-in-confidence because we run a commercial tender.’ If we run too far down this road, given the pervasive influence of corporations in Australian society, and indeed globally, we wind up with nothing at all in the public domain because everything somehow ends up being tied up in commercial-in-confidence considerations one way or the other.
Last night these two principles finally came into conflict. The documents really had not been tabled. A tiny proportion of the RFP documentation had actually been made available and put into the public domain, and we had to take it on trust from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy that nothing else was going to be able to be tabled. Against that—the principle of the fact that the Greens do support debate on the Telstra bill before the end of this year—we, similar to Senator Xenophon, have some concerns. We will be putting some amendments to the minister. Those negotiations are ongoing. We look forward to the government’s support for those amendments but we do, in the first instance, believe that it is time that this bill was debated.
I have sat through a year and a half of quite constructive hearings and work done in the Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network, and the response from the industry, that this market is dysfunctional and has been so for a period of some time, has actually been pretty overwhelming. This was partly relating to the privatisation of Telstra, which obviously the Greens did not support, and partly relating to the fact that Telstra, as an incumbent, has been in a position for a long time to use and to abuse the dominance it has, both vertically and horizontally, within telecommunications markets. We understand, although we are not party to the negotiations, that Telstra is in negotiations with the government and that those will be ongoing, but we believe that there should be a framework within those negotiations to take place. That is why we believe the Telstra bill should be brought forward for debate before the end of this year.
As I said, Senator Brown spoke last night in some detail about the reason we needed more time to negotiate with the government and to come to an agreement around the issue that it is not really good enough that we simply need to take it on trust that the minister cannot release any further documentation. This is obviously the tip of the iceberg of a much broader issue around the way that corporations are accountable to the parliament and to the public of Australia. I note advice that we received from the Clerk that the motion we are debating today is of direct relevance to the NBN and that there is indirect relevance to the Telstra bill. That, of course, is why the block was put up. We are putting the minister on notice that, before we get to consideration of the substantive NBN bill and the other NBN bill floating around which we have been considering for some time, the order of the Senate stands. I believe that the process we have put in place is long overdue. It is long past time that we had some investigation of commercial-in-confidence claims and other claims which shield documentation and information from disclosure to the public, because there are far better models than are used here in the Senate. Orders for production of documents should be taken seriously and there should be some mechanism for independent review so that we are not simply taking the minister, from whichever side of politics, on trust.
I would like to thank my crossbench colleagues for the constructive way in which they approached the negotiations. I think we have a good outcome. I would like to thank the minister and his staff for the way in which they approached the negotiations as well. Most of all, I look forward to bringing forward the debate on the Telstra bill so that we can actually discuss, at long last, the structure of telecommunications markets, which have been dysfunctional for such a long period of time.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,16,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-10-29,"—by leave—I thank the chamber for granting me leave to make a few remarks in response to the statements of Senator Xenophon and Senator Ludlam on the motion relating to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009. I must say, on behalf of the opposition, that I am disappointed that the crossbench senators have agreed to exempt this most radical of bills which is directly related to the National Broadband Network proposal from the order that required the government to produce the relevant documents if it wished to have its NBN related legislation considered by the parliament.
We must remember that this was not just a straight order for the production of documents. It was a motion of the Senate to the effect that, if the government wanted its NBN related legislation considered by the Senate, it should provide the Senate with the requisite background information to enable the Senate to vote with the full knowledge of the background to the government’s decision to embark on what it itself describes as the biggest infrastructure project in the nation’s history involving up to $43 billion of taxpayers’ money. If the government did not want to produce the documents, that is fine, but what the Senate was saying was that the Senate itself would not consider NBN related legislation until it saw those documents. I thought that was a very proper position for the Senate to adopt, given the magnitude of the NBN and the fact that the government had consistently said from the moment of the announcement of this rather extraordinary proposal that it was relying on the report from the evaluation study of NBN mark 1 to advance the proposition that we should now set up a government owned company to roll out, at a cost of $43 billion, a nationwide fibre-to-the-premises network.
I think it is reasonable for the Senate to say, ‘We would like to see that evaluation report on which you are basing this whole package, this extraordinary proposition that you are asking the Senate to support, before we agree to pass such legislation.’ I think that is the proper position for the Senate and I was pleased that the Senate supported our motion when we put it up. I am very disappointed that the crossbench senators have decided not to hold to that position because the government has agreed to have an inquiry. I think you are selling yourselves out very cheaply if that is the price. Senator Conroy has done a remarkable deal, because all that has happened is that you have agreed to have an inquiry. I do acknowledge and welcome the fact that Senator Ludlam has made clear that, as far as he is concerned, the order still applies in relation to any other NBN related legislation.
For the government to have come to this chamber and produce 16 of the 893 pages of the evaluation study and claim that the remaining 98.5 per cent of the report is all commercial-in-confidence is, from the perspective of someone who has spent 10 years in government as a minister, a complete nonsense. What I suspect is the case is that the evaluation report does not provide the justification which the government claims for it advancing this proposition that we now set up a government business to build, own and operate a $43 billion national broadband network. That is the reason we are not seeing the evaluation report—not that it is commercial-in-confidence but the fact that it does not provide the justification.
On behalf of the opposition, I say, ‘Yes, we have no objection to this inquiry,’ although I do, as I say from the experience of government, acknowledge that there are documents which are in fact commercial-in-confidence and cannot be released. In this case, I say that that could not possibly cover 98.5 per cent of the evaluation report, but we are happy for this inquiry to proceed. I must again say, however, how very disappointed I am that the crossbench senators—certainly Senator Xenophon and the Greens—have let the government off the hook on this, but I acknowledge the weight of numbers.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,16,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-10-29,"—This matter goes back to 4 February 2009 when there was a motion before the chamber that matters ‘be laid on the table by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy no later than Thursday, 5 February 2009’ and I amended that motion to omit ‘Thursday, 5 February 2009’ and substitute ‘the day after the day the winning bid is announced’. On 13 May another motion was put and it was carried on the voices. That is the issue that we are really debating again today. That motion said, ‘if the government continues to refuse to comply with the orders of the Senate for the provision of these documents’—which were tender documents and some other bits and pieces; it was not just those documents but some others as well—’consideration of any bill relating to the government’s new national broadband network be postponed and made an order of the day for the next day of sitting after the documents described’ and so on.
The issue is whether the legislation that the government wants to put before us be held up while we wait for some other documents to come through. We have had some documents come through. Some of it, it has been claimed, is confidential and commercial in confidence. It is like claiming diplomatic immunity or something, like you see in those television shows when someone says, ‘Diplomatic immunity! I can’t do any more!’ We do need to get to the bottom of it. We do need to have a better process. A notice of motion has been put in, and I think we will deal with this once and for all. To be absolutely frank, I have been here long enough to know that both major parties have, I think, occasionally claimed certain things and all of a sudden we are left guessing, ‘Is it really or is it not?’ I think we need a far better process of dealing with commercial in confidence and confidential documents and why they cannot be tabled. I think that the notice of motion that was put in today will go to the essence of resolving that particular issue.
I have to come to a conclusion on whether I think we need more documents, which may be confidential or whatever, to debate the legislation that the government wants to put through or whether that will unnecessarily hold it up. Is it going to substantially change the debate on those bills? I do no think so. With this motion from Senator Conroy, even though potentially there may be politics being played by both major parties, I have got to look at the essence from here. The reason I suggested that Senator Conroy change the notice of motion was that I did not want to make any links—whether there were links to NBN or whether there were not. There are clearly some links to NBN. You cannot deny that. But I had a look at the bill that the minister wants to put to parliament over the coming days, and I could not hand-on-my-heart justify not allowing that to come into the chamber before some other documents that have been claimed to be commercial in confidence or confidential.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-10-29,"—In closing the debate on this motion, I thank all of those who have made a contribution. I thank the crossbenches for their indicated support and their willingness to move ahead with this bill, which represents part of the government’s historic reforms in this sector. Could I also indicate that I am pleased to support the notice of motion for a Senate inquiry into these commercial-in-confidence issues. I understand the concerns and the frustrations that senators have on this matter, so I look forward to the report coming back to the parliament in February.
We would hope and will seek to ensure that the resourcing of the committee is adequate to do its task. We have debated this for a couple of days now, so I am sure we would all like to just move on to the next stage, as Senator Ludlam indicated, and actually get down to the substance of this issue, which is a historic package to reform the telecommunications sector in this country, which is so desperately needed. I thank all those who have contributed.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-10-29,"—I move:
That intervening business be postponed till after consideration of government business order of the day no. 3 (AusCheck Amendment Bill 2009).
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,18,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-10-29,"—The AusCheck Amendment Bill 2009 seeks to amend the AusCheck Act 2007 to provide a capacity for background checks under the act to be carried out for national security purposes. In 2005, the coalition government established a centralised background-checking service in the Attorney-General’s Department as part of a wider initiative to strengthen aviation and maritime security. This service, known as AusCheck, was created to help the aviation and maritime industries to identify high-risk individuals who should not be granted access to secure areas of Australian air and sea ports. It began operation in September 2007.
AusCheck is responsible for identifying individuals who should not be eligible for an Aviation Security Identification Card, ASIC, and/or a Maritime Security Identification Card, MSIC, by applying a consistent interpretation of the statutory requirements and coordinating background, criminal and security checks on applicants, and for notifying the relevant issuing bodies of the outcome of these checks. These background checks were previously processed and coordinated by the Background Checking Unit of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government—whose acronym I will not hazard. AusCheck maintains a database of all applicants and card holders for the aviation and maritime industries and operates on a cost-recovery basis. The current act only allows background checks for the purposes of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Security Act 2003 in order to coordinate background checks for the purposes of the Aviation and Maritime Security Identification Card scheme.
The amendments will also include specific provisions to authorise and protect biometric information about an individual where this is required in order to complete a background check. The amendments are intended to ensure that if AusCheck is required to facilitate the provision of this information to the relevant police jurisdiction then this information will be afforded all of the additional protections given to other AusCheck personal information but not be available for any purpose other than a further background check. This is intended to reflect the purpose of collecting this information in the first place, which is the verification of a particular individual’s identity only and for no wider purpose.
The bill also includes amendments to the provisions that give authority for AusCheck to provide an online verification service. The online verification service is currently restricted to verifying aviation security identification cards and maritime security identification cards. With the addition of a national security background check capacity this authority is accordingly expanded so that an online verification service may be used to verify other types of cards or licences that may be issued indicating that a person has undergone a national security background check.
The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which reported on 18 June 2009. The committee unanimously made seven recommendations for amendments to the bill. The recommendations were directed to increasing safeguards for the protection of private information and to restrict the uses to which AusCheck data may be put. The recommendations are, if I may say so, very sensible and a testament to the good work of the committee. I am pleased that the government has responded to the report with the amendments circulated on sheet AF220. The amendments directly implement five of the committee’s seven recommendations. The two remaining recommendations are also being implemented by sensible alternative means. I commend those amendments
Australia’s airside and waterfront sites are obvious areas of vulnerability to crime and security threats. We need to have confidence that, as far as possible, those areas are secure and that those with a demonstrated criminal propensity or otherwise posing unacceptable risks are excluded from them. This regime is not perfect: in particular, there are serious concerns about the maritime security identification card arrangements that allow people with criminal histories to work on our docks and deal with sensitive cargo. This is an area which requires constant vigilance and, while supporting this bill in its amended form, I urge the government to give priority to minimising the criminal element on the waterfront.",SENATE,<title>AUSCHECK AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-10-29,"—The coalition supports the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 2009. The bill proposes to allow the government to increase the number of shares Australia holds in the bank. The Asian Development Bank, ADB, is raising capital and has offered its members the opportunity to increase their shareholding. The reason for this is the global economic crisis, which has affected the viability of the international financial institutions, including the ADB. On 2 April, the G20 leaders meeting agreed to a 200 per cent general capital increase for the bank as part of its $850 billion commitment to support growth in developing countries. On 29 April 2009, the ADB board of governors resolved to raise capital by allowing its members to increase their shareholding. The board’s aim is to triple ADB’s capital, which will be achieved if all the members take up all of the shares on offer. Members can buy additional shares in proportion to their current subscription. Australia currently owns 5.7 per cent of the total number of issued shares. As such, we were entitled to buy 409,480 additional shares, 16,379 paid-in shares and 393,101 callable shares. In layman’s terms, paid-in shares are normal shares—the stake in the bank; callable shares serve as security for ADB’s borrowing on world capital markets. The bank has never drawn down on its callable capital and it is not likely to do so.
In the 2009-10 budget, the government announced it would purchase US$197.6 million, the equivalent of A$241 million, of additional shares in the bank over 10 years and draw on US$5.6 billion, the equivalent of A$6.8 billion, of callable shares. The additional shares are a capital measure in the 2009-10 budget and do not impact on the underlying cash or fiscal balance. The additional callable shares appeared in the statement of risks as a contingent liability.
This bill will continue Australia’s work with the Asian Development Bank to develop our region. Established in 1966, the ADB is an international development institution which works to foster economic growth and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. It works with its members to develop them both on an individual level and as a group of interconnected nations. Australia was one of the original 31 members of the bank, along with the United States, Japan, New Zealand, China, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. There are now 67 members, both inside and outside the region, including Brunei Darussalam, the Cook Islands, Portugal and Luxembourg.
The ADB works with individual countries, the private sector and non-government organisations and uses its triple-A credit rating to finance projects in agriculture, education, health, law, governance, transport and communications. The ADB funds training programs in public policy, water management, transborder animal disease control, customs and quarantine. ADB consultants provide technical advice on energy projects, road construction and air pollution. ADB loans are made available for infrastructure, and grants allow education and immunisation to take place.
I think the Senate would be interested in hearing about some of these projects. One example of a worthwhile project is a public policy training program in Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Vietnam. These three Asian countries have moved from planned to market oriented economies in the past two decades. The ADB supports their transition, with US$17.8 million for training programs for senior civil service officials. Another example is HIV prevention. As we know, the countries in South-East Asia are improving their transport infrastructure. While this is good news for trade, it brings with it social and health issues, such as the spread of HIV. The ADB has provided US$6 million to tackle this problem. A third example is a health project to prevent and control avian influenza. We all remember the pandemics of the last few years, including bird flu. The ADB is providing US$25 million to fight the spread of H5N1 virus among birds and to improve the region’s preparedness to tackle human influenza outbreaks.
There are a number of reasons why the coalition supports this bill. Firstly, Australia plays an important role in providing both funding and expertise to the bank’s projects. The majority of the bank’s contracts are awarded through an international tender system, which is open to companies and individuals from any member country. In 2008, Australia’s contracts for goods and works were worth $3.57 million and $32.64 million in addition for consulting services. A number of Australian companies have worked with the ADB in recent years, including HSBC Bank Australia, Flinders University, Sinclair Knight Merz and the Australian ITA Consortium. Australia has also recently co-financed projects in the areas of road assessment management in Cambodia, HIV-AIDS prevention in Papua New Guinea, and hydroelectricity in Lao People’s Democratic Republic. As of 31 December 2008, 49 Australian professionals were working at the ADB.
When the coalition were in government, we made significant contribution to Australia’s place in the Asia-Pacific region. The most noteworthy economic contribution of the Howard government was our action during the Asian financial crisis of 1997. We were one of the first countries to offer assistance and Australia became an important regional player as a result. We provided $3 billion in currency swaps and loans to South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia through the ADB. By doing so, we were able to engage these countries in the economic reform that has helped them develop.
The Howard government acknowledged that the Asia-Pacific region is integral to Australia’s future. We recognised that its development directly affects us in a number of ways, including in the vital areas of trade and security. The Howard government successfully managed regional partnerships during the move to independence by Timor-Leste in 1999. We maintained and improved our relationship with Indonesia. We successfully maintained our relationship with Japan, our most important trading partner, while building a relationship with emerging China. We successfully identified the importance of India as an emerging economy and the Howard government helped make India a stronger trading partner.
Seven of Australia’s top 10 export markets are now in the Asia-Pacific region: Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, India, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. The export revenue for goods and services to these countries in 2007-08 was $118.7 billion from Australia’s total export revenue that year of $232 billion. This gives you an idea of the significance of the relationship between our economies. Added to that, of course, is the trade activity with our other regional neighbours, which widens the mutual benefit.
In terms of security, development in the region will reduce Australia’s risk of being a target for terrorism, illegal drugs and people smuggling. While these are criminal acts, they have strong links to poverty, weak border protection and corruption—three problems that have plagued the region. The Howard government recognised that it is in everyone’s interest to support development to combat these problems. The coalition believes this still, which is one of the reasons why we are supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-29,"—I am grateful to both Oxfam Australia and Manna Gum for information upon which I will base my remarks on the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 2009. The Greens have been concerned for a long time about the Asian Development Bank’s spending, the lack of control and the note being taken of local communities, and the social and environmental outcomes. Not least amongst those is the building of hydro schemes on the Mekong River. The Australian government ought to be in much closer liaison with community groups in the countries which are recipients of Asian Development Bank spending to ensure that the Asian Development Bank’s own charter is upheld in the expenditure of moneys.
The decision by the G20 finance ministers in London in April to channel an additional US$850 billion to international financial institutions ultimately has resulted in the Asian Development Bank’s fifth general capital increase. Although discussions around the increase were already underway before April, the G20 agreement provided the trigger for the bank’s member countries to agree to a 200 per cent increase in capital. To enable Australia to put into practice the agreed capital increase, Treasury has drafted the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill which we now have before us. If it is approved it will result in payments of $240 million over the next 10 years on top of what would have happened and an additional $6.8 billion callable capital being distributed through the bank.
The bill was approved in the House and we are now dealing with it in the Senate. I need to point out that the capital increase for the bank is in line with Australia’s commitment to increase multilateralism. That is no problem. The Asian Development Bank is a multilateral donor and it is in the strategic position to channel aid flows to developing countries. However, while well intentioned, the bank’s projects and programs can be counterproductive as far as communities, their environments and their human rights are concerned.
Let me go to some specific examples. The Highway 1 project in Cambodia was approved in 1998 with the spending of US$40 billion to upgrade the highway between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City. As a result of the construction, about 6,000 Cambodian villagers living along the highway experienced economic and social hardship due to full or partial loss of their houses, agricultural land, businesses and/or jobs. In violation of its own policy, the bank failed to ensure that the affected communities received adequate compensation in time. There were delays of years. This failure forced families to borrow from black market lenders to finance the reconstruction of their homes, businesses and livelihoods, plunging them into further poverty and debt cycles in which many families remain. A decade later, hundreds of families are still waiting adequate redress. I would like to hear what the government’s attitude has been to ameliorating that stress on those families as a result of the Asian Development Bank operations.
In the Greater Mekong subregion, the bank’s flagship Subregional Economic Cooperation Program in the Asia-Pacific means that $11 billion has promoted large-scale infrastructure, primarily transport and energy, in Mekong countries. The investments facilitated rapid and unsustainable natural resource exploitation in the form of logging, plantation agriculture, hydro power and mining in a region where over 75 per cent of the population still depends directly on lands, forests and rivers for their livelihood. The bank publicly claims that such developments have led to poverty reduction, but let us look at the bank’s own empirical studies of actual poor communities in Laos to see what the real picture is:
 [Compared to the year 2000] villages that were revisited in 2006 were found generally to be either about the same or worse off ... the survey shows that poor villagers increasingly experience difficulty in providing food for their families. Natural resources were said to be seriously depleted in almost all locations ...
The bank is a ‘vigorous promoter’ of the hydropower projects I previously referred to. My briefing from Oxfam says that this is the case:
... particularly in Burma, Yunnan and Laos, where independent civil society participation and open debate are stifled. The bank’s dams in Laos such as the Nam Theun-Hinboun, the Nam Leuk and the Nam Song have negatively affected approximately 40,000 people, many of whom are still waiting for adequate compensation. And the ADB has neglected better renewable energy solutions and planning processes that would avoid this destructive path.
I have no doubt that the bank will read this transcript and I am inviting the bank to send a response to the Senate either through the government or directly, if it will. We will ensure that that goes into the transcript. The Oxfam briefing continues:

The ADB has contributed funding for the controversial Nam Theun II Hydropower Project in Laos (approved 2005, total loan amount US$ 70 million, plus US$ 50 million political risk guarantee), which involves large-scale involuntary resettlement and will cause fisheries losses—
as well as potentially blocking the migration paths of major fisheries and fish stock—
increased flooding and water quality problems for over 120,000 people. The dam will be fully commissioned in 2010—
yet it promises limited outcomes as far as the local people are concerned as well as great stress on those societies. The same can be said about the Visayas base load power project in the Philippines, which is a circulised fluidised bed coal-fired station that is leaving locals with a great deal of concern about, for example, coal ash from the plant. I have raised problems that we have not seen acknowledged in the debate in the House but which are very real for the people, particularly poor people. The assumption that increased funding equals increased results for those people is wrong. The government must be held to account to ensure that the additional resources are well used. I again invite the government to respond to the matters I have raised or to have the Asian Development Bank itself respond to the Senate on these matters. There are initial signs of that intention but it will take a concerted effort from all sides to ensure that Australia’s contributions to the bank are used in a way that promotes long-term sustainable development without disadvantage and without wrecking the livelihoods of local people.",SENATE,<title>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-10-29,"—I thank the senators who have participated in the debate on the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 2009. The purpose of this bill is to obtain approval to allow Australia to subscribe to its additional capital share in the Asian Development Bank. This will ensure that Australia continues to deliver on its commitments within the G20. The G20 has paid a landmark role in responding to the impacts of the global recession. It is important that members of the G20 continue to work together to support recovery in the global economy. In September, the G20 leaders met in Pittsburgh to review progress in addressing the impact of the global recession since their April summit in London. Leaders noted then that we are in the midst of a transition from a crisis to recovery but that a sense of normalcy should not lead to complacency.
Multilateral development banks are planning a very important role in supporting recovery in developing economies and, therefore, the global economy. The multilateral development banks are on track to deliver the US$100 billion in additional lending in response to the global recession. The ADB is helping to support economic recovery and sustained growth and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, of which Australia is an integral part. By working through the ADB to build stronger communities and economies in the region, we of course improve Australia’s own economic and security interests. The April G20 leaders summit agreed to support the ADB through a 200 per cent general capital increase. Australia’s capital contribution will cost around US$197.6 million, payable to the ADB over 10 years. This subscription appeared as a capital measure in the 2009-10 budget and does not directly impact on the budget bottom line. Supporting this bill will enable Australia to demonstrate its leadership globally as well as supporting recovery from the global recession in the Asia-Pacific region. I acknowledge the support of all senators and commend the bill to the Senate.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-10-29,"—The coalition supports the passage of the Long Service Leave Legislation Amendment (Telstra) Bill 2009. The bill has the effect of continuing arrangements established by the Howard government relating to the treatment of long service leave for employees of Telstra. In 2006 the Howard government introduced the bill to ensure that employees of Telstra were able to continue enjoying the benefits of long service leave provided under the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act.
It did this in an endeavour to ensure that the transition from government to private ownership of Telstra occurred in a manner that was cohesive, workable and practicable. The Howard government did not wish to alter the working conditions for any employee working for that telecommunications company. At that time a transition period of three years was envisaged. As is now apparent, that period is soon to expire and there has become a need to extend coverage in the manner consistent with the approach and intention of the bill.
I can indicate to the chamber that the shadow minister whom I represent, Mr Keenan, has received communication from Telstra management to indicate that it supports the passage of the bill. I note with interest that the communication indicated that this bill is the result of an agreement between Telstra, its employees and the relevant union, in this case the CEPU.
Like many other keen observers of matters involving workplace relations, I was reminded that things within Telstra have not always been so rosy. Previously there were long-running disputes between Telstra and the CEPU about a wide range of matters. The disputes in that workplace were widely publicised and sometimes heated. Those disputes occurred for a number of reasons and involved a number of technical and perhaps even philosophical disagreements. However, in my view those disputes boiled down to one simple issue. That issue was whether or not Telstra had the right to speak with and engage its employees directly without having to go through a third party intermediary.
Telstra, of course, has previously adopted a position that I believe most if not all employers in this country would agree with—that being, if they want to speak with their employees directly, so be it. There is nothing wrong with management and workers sitting down to discuss issues that affect them both. This is called employee engagement. Those on my side of the chamber recognise that workers and management are the two most important and valuable participants in any employment relationship. The actions of workers influence the success of the business, and the success of the business influences the benefits and culture that the workers enjoy. Employment relationships are two-way streets. Both workers and management have obligations to one another. They both benefit from improving the lot of each other.
Facilitating employee engagement is something the coalition strongly supports. We believe that workers and management are best placed to work things out amongst themselves in a fashion that is amicable, effective and constructive. While third party interference is sometimes warranted, by and large it does little to achieve what could already have been achieved had workers and management spoken directly. Often, sadly, it results in situations that benefit neither the workers nor their managers. Strikes, protests, lockouts, stand-downs, placards and picket lines are all features of the disputes in workplaces where there has been the involvement of a third party. When these types of actions occur, everyone becomes a loser in the end. Productivity drops, workers lose pay and the culture of the workplace can be adversely affected.
In contrast, workplaces that adopt a focus on employee engagement are winners. There has been much research conducted into the benefits of direct employee engagement. For example, direct employee engagement leads to increased levels of emotional attachment. Employees who have a high emotional attachment are more likely to experience higher levels of personal reward for their efforts at work. They feel as though they are working towards a common purpose and have a higher level of personal fulfilment.
Direct employee engagement also leads to increased levels of employee empowerment. There is nothing wrong with having a workplace where employees know that they have a say and role in the broader direction of the business. Letting workers have a say should be a key objective of all workplaces. They make a contribution to a business and deserve their right to be heard.
Worker commitment levels have also been shown to be markedly higher in workplaces that engage employees directly. A committed employee is likely to experience better feelings of job security and is less likely to leave for another workplace. Morale is higher. Higher levels of empowerment, commitment and personal reward are all significant benefits for workers and workplaces generally. Of course, enterprise benefits from employee engagement, too. Once again, studies have shown that workplaces using direct employee engagement have less turnover, higher levels of productivity, higher levels of staff morale and increased levels of customer satisfaction.
When you take an approach of direct employee engagement everyone wins, and that is how it should be. I believe all workplaces in Australia would share my view. However, as I observed earlier, sometimes this has not been the case. Moving away from engaging employees towards engagement via third parties detracts from the benefits the former approach brings. In this context one has to question the intention of Labor’s recent changes to the Australian workplace system. Sadly, these changes facilitate, encourage and sometimes even mandate the involvement of third parties in a workplace.
We acknowledge that Labor’s new laws are in their infant stages. However, the signs so far are not looking good. Broadly speaking, we are beginning to see an upward trend in levels of industrial action, so this will be a key test for Labor’s laws. Will they facilitate the reasonable and beneficial approach of employee engagement or will they take Australian workplaces backwards to the dark old days of strikes and disputes?
These are early days for Labor’s new laws and some say there is much to be said for giving them the benefit of the doubt. But I believe workplaces are entitled to be concerned about where the new laws are taking them. It looks as if the new laws are, so far, failing to facilitate the reasonable and beneficial approach of employee engagement and by default taking Australian workplaces backwards. I do struggle to see how this goes towards the government’s stated aim of creating a balanced, flexible and productive workplace system.
I remain hopeful, however, that, whatever the future holds, Telstra and its workforce are able to achieve a resolution to its current circumstances. I also remain hopeful that the agreement giving rise to this bill is something that becomes the norm rather than the exception. It is with this in mind that the opposition supports the passage of this bill. It reflects an agreement achieved in a manner that we believe should be encouraged throughout Australian workplaces, an aim that I hope will not be hindered by Labor’s new workplace laws.",SENATE,<title>LONG SERVICE LEAVE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELSTRA) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-10-29,"—I thank Senator Brandis for indicating coalition support for the Long Service Leave Legislation Amendment (Telstra) Bill 2009. It makes a lot of sense, of course, to do so. As noted by the Deputy Prime Minister in her speech, the bill is designed to ensure the continued operation of the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act to Telstra employees. The bill is an interim measure designed to address the particular historical circumstances of Telstra, pending the development of a national long service leave scheme, and the discussion with state and territory governments on that has commenced.
The move to develop national long service leave arrangements is yet another example of this government’s commitment to building a truly national employment system for the private sector in Australia, and the government is well on the way to achieving this goal. Victoria, for example, has already referred workplace relations powers to the Com-monwealth. South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland have agreed to refer power and have introduced legislation into their parliaments to give effect to their decision. Last week the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations introduced the Fair Work Amendment (State Referrals and Other Measures) Bill 2009 to give effect to these referrals, and cooperative discussions are also occurring with New South Wales. Unfortunately, the Western Australian government has indicated that it will not refer powers, denying the benefits of a national system to employers and employees in that state. However, the government is also making considerable progress towards developing uniform national occupational health and safety laws, which will dramatically reduce complexity and red tape for businesses that operate in multiple jurisdictions.
In taking these steps, the government is answering the repeated calls by business to end the overlap and duplication of state and federal employment laws and to end the inefficiency, uncertainty and legal complexity for Australian businesses and employees. In the absence of the measures proposed in this bill, Telstra would need to transition its employees from the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act to multiple state and territory schemes when current transitional arrangements expire on 24 November 2009 and then back to a Commonwealth scheme when the new national long service leave arrangements are implemented through the National Employment Standards. The government agrees with Telstra and relevant unions that a sensible solution to the complexity and uncertainty that these multiple transitions would cause is to extend the existing transitional arrangements until the new national employment standard on long service leave is in place. This is a piece of legislation that supports the premise of common sense. I commend the bill to the Senate.

—Hear, hear!
—Thank you, Senator Fifield. Perhaps this is thought by some in the bowels of the Attorney-General’s Department to serve the value of accessibility, but it just goes to show how accessibility can be taken too far. The acts to be repealed are self-evidently obsolete and have been superseded by other legislation. In the acts to be amended, most of the proposals relate to transitional provisions and periods that have expired. Schedule 1 to the bill contains amendments to 17 acts. Schedule 2 repeals eight acts and makes consequential amendments to three other acts. The most notable of the changes affect the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Telecommunications Act 1997.
The amendments to the Trade Practices Act involve the repeal of part VB. These are the GST price exploitation provisions, which were enacted following concerns that price rises unrelated to the GST might be represented to be caused by the introduction of the GST. Given that the GST has been in place for almost 10 years, it is unlikely that any such representations would be made now. Any misrepresentations of price would, in any event, be covered by other provisions of the act. The amendments to the Telecommunications Act relate to the regulatory framework supporting a digital data capability of 64 kilobits per second and in which Telstra was the declared provider. Telstra’s declaration has been repealed and the market now provides data capabilities far beyond the rate provided for in the act. The bill also proposes to repeal the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Act 1987.
—Go on! No, it doesn’t!
—Be still, Senator Fifield. Do not become too excited! This tax ceased to be payable after June 2002. The relevant provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act was repealed in 2006 as inoperable; the 1987 act is therefore redundant. Bills of this nature are traditionally non-controversial and receive the support of the parliament because they are regarded as an essential tool in the process of keeping the Commonwealth statute books accurate and up to date. Accordingly, the coalition is pleased to support the bill and looks forward, on the next occasion we have such a bill, to reverting to the more dignified form ‘statute law revision bill’.",SENATE,<title>STATUTE STOCKTAKE (REGULATORY AND OTHER LAWS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-10-29,"—I thank Senator Brandis for his comments and his indication that the coalition supports this important piece of legislation. Some people might consider it a review, some people might call it a statute stocktake and some of us might say it is a good piece of government housekeeping. Whatever the name of the bill, I think we all agree that well-designed and targeted regulation is essential to reducing costs and complexity for business and the not-for-profit sector, and it forms a part of the government’s commitment to ongoing microeconomic reform. Well-designed regulation increases Australia’s productivity and international competitiveness and fosters innovation and structural flexibility.
The Statute Stocktake (Regulatory and Other Laws) Bill 2009 underlines the government’s commitment to reduce unnecessary or poorly designed regulation. It proposes to amend or repeal almost 30 acts where the provisions no longer have any functional purpose, as Senator Brandis described, including the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Act 1987 and a number of acts relating to the removal of digital data service obligations—and thank heavens we have gone beyond 64 kilobits per second as our digital data standard!
The redundant regulations were identified through a regulatory stocktake conducted by the Commonwealth departments in 2008. This was, in fact, the first stocktake of its kind conducted since the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments commenced in 2005. The review identified a large stockpile of redundant or potentially redundant regulations. In addition to this bill, the government’s wider regulation clean-up exercise is expected to remove around 200 pieces of unnecessary subordinate legislation over coming months.
Further, in an effort to better understand the impost on business and to identify scope for further regulatory efficiencies, a review of 30,000 subordinate legislative instruments is being conducted to identify reform priorities and ensure the current stock of regulation is being adequately managed and tested for ongoing relevance. While it may go unnoticed by many, leaving undated, redundant regulation actually increases costs for business. It is harder to identify which rules apply and resources are diverted to irrelevant and inefficient activities. There is also a high probability of inconsistent or overlapping rules.
This bill represents just one element of the government’s ambitious regulatory reform agenda. Through COAG we are working with the states to achieve a more consistent and harmonised national approach to key regulatory issues. On 2 July 2009 the Council of Australian Governments reaffirmed its commitment to microeconomic reform and the critical role that the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy, and its regulatory reform agenda, plays in enabling productivity gains for the economy. At the Commonwealth level the minister is delivering regulatory reform in the areas of Commonwealth regulatory responsibility including reducing the length and improving the readability of product disclosure statements for financial products and reviews of health technology assessment arrangements as examples to improve unnecessary costs and facilitate earlier patient access to innovative and cost-effective new health technology.
The global economic stresses we have faced and continue to encounter remind us of the importance of delivering microeconomic reform efforts that enhance our productivity. A sustained commitment to better regulation is an essential tenet of our microeconomic reform agenda and this bill is an important step in delivering on the government’s commitment to continuous improvement in regulation. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-10-29,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment Bill 2009, which the opposition supports. This legislation primarily focuses on the governance of ASADA and the bill builds on the foundations which the former coalition government put in place to tackle doping in sport. The policies that the coalition developed ensured that ASADA built a strong international reputation as a world leader in best practice anti-doping regulations.
In 2006 the coalition replaced the Australian Sports Drug Agency with ASADA. This change was implemented by the then Minister for the Arts and Sport, the Hon. Rod Kemp. I should note that Mr Kemp is generally regarded as Australia’s best and most successful sporting minister ever. In saying that, I mean no disrespect to Senator Brandis and his tenure in that portfolio. Indeed one of the cruel twists of political fate was the premature end to Senator Brandis’s service in that portfolio. We can, sadly, wonder all we like, but we will never know whether Senator Brandis may have even perhaps eclipsed Mr Kemp in that portfolio. We can but wonder.
I do think Senator Brandis showed great promise during his brief tenure. Senator Brandis was also a great crusader against drugs in sport and I remember very fondly Senator Brandis urging the AFL to be even more rigorous in their anti-doping efforts and the TV footage of the high noon showdown between Senator Brandis, Mr Pyne and Mr Demetriou. For those of us from the state of Victoria, it is indeed a brave public figure who takes on the AFL, and can I just say there should be more of it.
The 2006 change was brought about because of the Anderson inquiry in 2004 into the Australian track cycling team. The coalition ensured that this new agency had strong powers to investigate and present cases as well as to exchange information with other enforcement agencies. The coalition provided an additional $2.24 million to ASADA in the 2007 budget to enhance its capacity to investigate instances of alleged doping violations and the subsequent preparation and submission of briefs in relation to individual cases, bringing the total funding to $12.9 million. Because of the work of the previous government, ASADA has earned a fine international reputation.
To ensure that our anti-doping efforts are as effective as possible ASADA, which is central to our fight against doping, must be operating at optimum capacity. A review of ASADA commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing in 2008 found that this is not necessarily the case. The review found that the complex governance arrangements made it difficult to resolve disagreements between the ASADA chair, who was also the head of the agency, and the ASADA members.
I would also like to take the opportunity to note the great work being done by former federal minister and former New South Wales Premier John Fahey as head of the World Anti-Doping Agency. I think his position is a measure of how well regarded Australia is in the antidoping field. Again, credit goes to Senator Brandis for securing the election of Mr Fahey. Senator Brandis was able to deploy for good purpose all the skills of lobbying, negotiating and persuading that he developed within and between the factions and forums of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland.
—All those dark arts!
—That is right, Senator Brandis. It is nice to have one happy ending, isn’t it? This bill seeks to alter ASADA’s governance arrangements by ensuring that ASADA operates as a conventional FMA Act agency by removing its CAC Act elements. Just in reference to the CAC Act, we do need to find a new acronym in that place. This legislation will create a new CEO position with an advisory board, it will create an antidoping rule violation panel and it will make changes to the way the National Anti-Doping Scheme will be amended in the future.
In conclusion, the coalition regards this legislation as very straightforward. It goes to the governance of ASADA. ASADA has operated well in the past, but some governance problems have been identified and they need to be resolved. The opposition supports this legislation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SPORTS ANTI-DOPING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-10-29,"—I thank Senator Fifield for the opposition’s support. I think we are at one in wanting to ensure that Australian sport continues to be played in a domain which is safe and equitable for all Australian athletes and their support personnel and to ensure that performance-enhancing drugs are detected, dealt with and deterred at every opportunity. It always amuses me to come and discover things about my colleagues in the chamber, and today I have discovered something about Senator Brandis’s dark arts that I will remember for another occasion.
The reforms in the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment Bill 2009 will enable ASADA to continue to deliver its prescribed functions efficiently and effectively and to be well placed to handle the ever-changing challenges within the fight against drugs into the future. These reforms will provide greater clarity and transparency to the structural and governance arrangements of ASADA and provide an effective framework for the delivery of the Australian government’s antidoping priorities to ensure that Australia remains a world leader in the fight against drugs in sport. The bill brings ASADA’s governance arrangements into alignment, as Senator Fifield said, with those of a traditional model of Financial Management and Accountability Act, or FMA, agency. ASADA will remain an FMA agency but will cease to be a corporate entity with a legal identity separate from that of the Commonwealth. In addition, these changes will further deliver on recommendations of the independent review of ASADA, which sees ASADA being headed by a CEO who will be responsible for operational and strategic matters.
In line with the recommendations of the independent review, an advisory group will also be established to assist the CEO in the development, implementation and delivery of core business matters. The establishment of this advisory group will give the CEO access to individuals with specialist skills and knowledge to assist him or her on matters such as education, testing and investigation. The targeting of members’ skills and knowledge ensures that the advice and support that the advisory group provides are not only of the highest quality but also very appropriate to this challenging task.
Under the bill, the newly established antidoping rules violation panel will be responsible for making decisions on antidoping rule violations, recommendations about follow-up actions and sanctions. They will also be responsible for maintaining the register of these findings. The antidoping rule violation panel will consist of members with specialist knowledge and experience in sport law, ethics, medicine and pharmacology. Australian athletes and support personnel can be confident that the decisions regarding an antidoping rule violation will be at arm’s length not only from the government but also from ASADA, which is responsible for testing, investigation of possible rule violations and prosecution of such violations. The bill also gives effect to a number of other changes to ensure that the ASADA Act maintains consistency with the revisions of the World Anti-Doping Code, which came into effect on 1 January 2009. With those comments, I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-29,"—Senator Fielding on 28 October 2009 asked me a question in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
SENATOR FIELDING asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 28 October 2009:
I refer to an article in the Age on 22 August 2009 which revealed that an increasing number of unsuspecting Australians are having their mouths filled with cheap dental prosthetics from overseas laboratories which contain toxic heavy metals. Is the minister aware of these serious allegations and what is being done by the government to protect Australians from this dangerous practice?
Isn’t it true that the Therapeutic Goods Administration has banned the use of heavy metals such as lead and nickel in the manufacture of dental prosthetics made in Australia but it is still perfectly legal to import cheap products from overseas that contain these dangerous metals? And don’t these imported dental products end up in the same place as Australian made products—that is, in the patient’s mouth? What is the government going to do to close this dangerous and dodgy loophole?
Given that there is no law to stop dentists using dangerous toxic dental prosthetics from overseas, such as crowns, bridges and dentures, how can it be said that a patient is giving their informed consent when agreeing to have a prosthetic put in their mouth if they do not know what it is made out of or where it was manufactured? Will the government tighten disclosure requirements so that unsuspecting Australians are made aware that their prosthetic may contain dangerous, toxic materials?
SENATOR LUDWIG —The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
Dental prostheses are regarded as therapeutic goods and are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) via a robust international regulatory framework.
However, under this framework some dental prostheses, such as crowns and bridgework prepared for an individual under the direction of a dental professional, are regarded as custom-made medical devices. These products are not required to be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.
The TGA is unable to mandate the source of products or materials used by Australian dentists in these devices.
Dentists and others who import such products are, by definition, the ‘sponsors’ of these medical devices and are therefore fully responsible for ensuring the products meet the appropriate standards.
The TGA has worked with the peak dental industry bodies over a number of years to ensure dentists are aware of their responsibilities. However matters relating to professional practice standards are matters for state and territory health authorities.
The TGA has not ‘banned’ the use of heavy metals such as lead and nickel in the manufacture of dental prosthetics made in Australia. Metals such as lead and nickel are invariably present at low levels in dental materials such as porcelain and cannot be completely eliminated.
As a result of discussions with industry associations, the TGA recently initiated a public consultation process in relation to the regulation of custom made medical devices. Comments were invited from all interested parties and the TGA received a number of submissions, including from the professional associations. This work is still under way and the TGA has begun discussions with industry representatives in relation to the comments received to determine the best way to move forward.
Consumers or professionals within the dental industry who have concerns about the quality, safety or performance of specific products are encouraged to report any incidents to the TGA via its Incident Reporting and Investigation Scheme (IRIS). Such reports enable the TGA to investigate and test the materials used in the construction of the devices.
In addition, given the nature of these products it is unlikely that consumers will have an opportunity to review the product labelling. In these circumstances consumers should seek this information from their treating dentist before consenting to undergo any treatment.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health: Dental Prosthetics</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,28,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-10-29,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Senator Fifield and the Leader of The Nationals in the Senate (Senator Joyce) today relating to the economy.
This government is truly blessed—truly blessed because nothing is ever its fault. More people-smuggler boats? It is not due to any change in policy; it is all because of push factors, apparently. The AMA releases a report slamming the performance of public hospitals? It is not the government’s fault. Just ignore the PM’s promise to fix hospitals or take them over—it is not this government’s fault. Record deficits and ballooning debt? It is all the fault of the GFC. It is nothing to do with the government, nothing to do with cash splashes, nothing to do with reckless political spending, nothing to do with their outrageous pork-barrelling, nothing to do with the money they have wasted on bicycle paths, nothing to do with the money they have wasted on pink batts—no, absolutely nothing to do with this government. Rising inflation and rising interest rates: are they the fault of this government? Not on your life. Again, nothing to do with this government. Rising inflation is apparently all the fault of electricity retailers increasing prices in some states.
But there is a real problem. I cite Mr Michael Stutchbury, the Economics Editor of the Australian if you do not take my word for it. I almost hesitate to do this because I know how much the government likes the Australian. It would be fair to say that the government has declared something of a jihad against the Australian newspaper and possibly even a fatwa against some of its journalists, but I shall persist despite that. In the Australian today Mr Stutchbury said:
At 3.5 per cent, core inflation remains above the Reserve Bank’s 2-3 per cent target, partly because of domestic price pressures that will be intensified by the looming emissions trading scheme—
That is an interesting one.
On this basis, inflation is not “subdued”, as Wayne Swan suggested yesterday, even though headline inflation has slipped to 1.5 per cent. Backing his budget stimulus, the Treasurer again preferred to emphasise the economy’s negatives.
Once upon a time, treasurers used to focus on the strength of the Australian economy, on our economic fundamentals. But not this Treasurer. He always prefers to focus on the negatives.
You may recall that this government once upon a time talked a little bit more about inflation. They used to talk about inflation genies escaping bottles and things of that sort. So concerned were they that they once had a five-point plan to tackle inflation. The first point was to run strong budget surpluses. Fail! That is no longer part of this government’s strategy. The second was to encourage private savings. I am not too sure there has been massive success there. Another was to fix chronic skills shortages. I guess when an economy takes a bit of a dip they tend to sort themselves out. Infrastructure bottlenecks? We know, courtesy of the BCA, that only 14 per cent of this massive stimulus spending is actually going on serious economic infrastructure. The other thing was to lift workforce participation, which is a funny thing to do when you are reregulating the labour market.
There is a bit of a problem with inflation and a bit of a problem with upward pressure on interest rates. On 7 October this year interest rates went up from three per cent to 3.25 per cent. Possibly on Cup Day we may see another increase in interest rates. We certainly hope that we do not. Clearly, this government needs to re-examine the balance of its stimulus spending. Professor Tony Makin of Griffith University tells us what we know, which is:
… economics textbooks also tell us is that continued fiscal expansion will limit the extent to which interest rates can be lowered in the future.
And that is what we are seeing. But do not take my word for it; take the word of Prime Minister Rudd, who in his five-point plan said:
Fiscal policy should not complicate the task of monetary policy. It should make the job of the Reserve Bank easier, not harder.
I think they are very wise words. They should be followed and this stimulus spending should be wound back. There is a way to take pressure off interest rates. It is to wind back the stimulus spending now.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,29,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-10-29,"—I also rise to speak to the motion to take note of answers. Question time and take note of answers has, again, targeted the economic stimulus. After the report of the Senate Economics References Committee on the economic stimulus package, you would have thought that the Liberal Party would have learnt their lesson. They fronted up day after day to that inquiry to be told that they were wrong. They were told that they were wrong by senior officials in Treasury, they were told they were wrong by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and they were told that the stimulus package was appropriate, that it was targeted and that it would wind down over time in an appropriate fashion. The only recourse the opposition have is to shut their ears to all of that advice and steamroll ahead on a policy that they had, because they have nowhere else to go. They have got no policy on this matter, they have no credibility on it; all they can do is power ahead on the tram track they have created for themselves.
We have people from the Liberal Party on the economics committee deliberately not listening to answers because they are the answers that they do not want to hear. We have had not only the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia saying that Australia was on the right track and had done well but also the IMF and the OECD. We do not need economics writers in the Australian or from overseas to comment on this matter, because the answer is in our figures; the figures that Australia is producing—the growth, the jobs and the interest rate figures show that Australia has been doing well, compared to every other developed country. So we do not need to argue against the opposition because the figures and facts speak for themselves.
The only way the opposition develops an argument is to ignore the facts. Senator Joyce, for example, will probably carry on about arbitrage between US interest rates and Australian interest rates, despite the fact that he asked these kinds of questions in the economics committee of the AOFM and of Treasury and was told that there is no evidence of arbitrage between interest rates, that anyone who did indulge in that practice would run a risk with hedging and the difference between currencies, and that it had been done previously and showed the risks of that. But Senator Joyce, not deterred, will carry on with that kind of argument. The opposition has nowhere to go on the economy and that is now reflected in the general polling that we are seeing. The Australian public understands that the Labor government has got this matter right. It introduced an immediate stimulus to counteract the problems of the global financial crisis; it had an intermediate stimulus, which is now being put through; and it has a long-term stimulus with infrastructure, which is badly needed by this country after more than a decade of neglect by the previous Howard government.
People understand that very clearly because it is simple, it is direct and it is the appropriate response to what has happened globally. That is recognised, it seems, by everyone but the opposition. To seize on inflation figures, as Senator Fifield has done, is to seize on an issue which the opposition have no credibility on. The Rudd Labor government developed the five-point plan as a result of the failed economic policies in the latter years of the Howard government. I almost feel sorry for the opposition. They continue to try to bolster their economic credentials, with very few feathers to fly. I do not wish them any further luck.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,29,1
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-10-29,"—I rise to make comments on the questions asked by my colleagues Senator Fifield and Senator Joyce. On 24 June, in the Senate, I said, ‘If the government continues on its spending spree it will put upward pressure on interest rates.’ That is exactly what is happening. It is a simple situation. There are two levers on the economy. One is fiscal policy, which we know as government spending, and the other is interest rates—or monetary policy, as the so-called experts call it.
When the global financial crisis hit 12 months ago both levers were put on fast forward. We saw a 4.25 per cent reduction in official interest rates from 15 September last year by the Reserve Bank and we saw this huge spending spree that Treasurer Swan and Mr Rudd took this country on. Both levers were put on fast forward. Now it is clear that the Australian economy is in far better shape than what the economic experts and Treasury forecasters believed. And it is in good shape because of the way we went into this financial crisis. The coalition left the federal government in a debt-free position, with billions in the bank and with low unemployment, at around four per cent. Australia was unique. No other country in the world was going into this global recession debt free, but Australia was. What has happened? The spending has continued and now the economic indicators are clear. Just a few weeks ago, there was a 0.25 per cent interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank, taking it to 3.25 per cent. And now the bookmakers are setting the price for next Tuesday’s Melbourne Cup on interest rates. Will it be a quarter of a per cent or will it be half a per cent?
My younger son, Thomas, is currently looking at buying a house. Interest rates are around 5½ per cent for home loans. I said to him, ‘Run your cash flow at an eight per cent interest rate, because that’s what you could be facing if this government keeps spending the way it is.’ My advice to my young fellow just last week was, ‘Do your figures at eight per cent; that’s what you could be facing.’
But there is another part of this interest rate situation that people have not really focused on, and that is a rising Australian dollar. Senator Joyce asked a question today: what are the interest rates in America? They are one per cent. There are no rising interest rates in America, Europe or around the world—only in Australia. The further the interest rate gap grows between the United States and Australia, the more investment in Australia as those investors chase a higher return on their money and the Australian dollar goes up and up and up. The ramification of that is simple: the nation’s income is reduced. Whether exporting gold, iron ore, coal, beef or wheat, it means fewer dollars coming into our nation. So, in effect, what we are doing is reducing our nation’s income.
This has been brought about by higher interest rates and by the federal government’s spending—which is assisting and promoting higher interest rates. And it is regional Australia that that has a negative effect on, because the dollars are not coming into those communities where the exports are derived from and those regional communities are missing out on the money. That is the effect. It might suit many people in the city areas who buy a lot of imported products. Of course, we import a lot of products. As I have said before, trade is about exporting and importing. It makes imported products cheaper, but it also certainly makes exports cheaper, and we are losing income. That is a problem when the interest rates are going to keep rising in Australia. There is no talk about that stabilising. It is our exporters who will suffer the most.
Let us look back at what Prime Minister Rudd said. He said he was a fiscal conservative—yeah, right! He inherited a debt-free nation with billions in the bank and, all of a sudden, we are running an annual budget of $58 billion in the red. He also said that he would put downward pressure on grocery prices, that he would put downward pressure on fuel prices and that he would fix our hospitals—that the buck would stop with him if they were not fixed by the middle of 2009. But yesterday the Senate had to face a situation with respect to hospitals where the government was trying to do away with any sort of cataract surgery, to remove the incentive for people to carry out their operations—putting more pressure on our public health system. We know that Mr Rudd has not delivered on any of the promises he made prior to the 2007 election. What I find so frustrating about his spending spree is that all he is doing is filling a gap for the state governments. Buildings in schools and those sorts of capital works are not going to improve our economy or lead us to earning more income.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,29,1
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2009-10-29,"—It seems to me that senators opposite actually wish that we were in recession—that Australia was facing recession right now—because, without the fiscal stimulus, Australia would be in recession right now and hundreds and thousands more Australians would be out of work. For interest rates to be where those opposite would like them to be could only mean one thing: recession. The RBA has flagged more interest rate rises to come, but we should not forget that those interest rates are four percentage points below their peak last year and are still providing a substantial boost to household budgets. It is a good thing that the Australian economy is out-performing other advanced economies. Many economists will see the interest rate rises as the inevitable consequences of our recovery. At the Senate inquiry into the stimulus package, the Reserve Bank Governor, Treasury business economists and business groups all said that our stimulus was the right course of action and that it has helped keep Australia out of recession.
Why is this so important? You talk about interest rate rises and the pressure that that puts on people, but what I want to talk to you about is unemployment. When we are in recession, it means greater levels of unemployment. We have already seen a huge spike in unemployment here in Australia, and it has risen very rapidly in Western Australia. Unemployment in WA stood at 2.7 per cent last year. It has risen every month, including last month. That means that there are more than 70,000 unemployed in WA—which is more than double what it was a year ago. That figure would be much, much higher without the stimulus. So I ask you about the pressure of paying a mortgage and how you pay your mortgage if you are out of work—because that is what the stimulus debate is really about. Unemployment can scar the lives of individuals permanently. They lose skills, they lose the opportunity to gain experience, they lose confidence and they lose hope. We have young people in Australia who are suffering severe unemployment at the moment, and that impact on them is severely pronounced. It has a profound impact on people’s working lives—and that has been the major reason that the Rudd government has supported the stimulus package. That is what senators opposite fail to appreciate.
Every Australian knows that interest rates went up 10 times under the Liberals, despite their promise to keep them at record lows. You ignored 20 warnings from the RBA on the need to invest in critical infrastructure and skills—critical infrastructure and skills that Australia now so desperately needs in order to build up its economy. Under your management, inflation rose to a 16-year high and interest rates went up 10 times. We need a dose of reality in this interest rate debate. You talk about not wanting to invest in stimulus and I talk about the need for a stimulus to avoid recession.
Senator Williams compared us and our interest rates to overseas countries that are all in recession. Australia’s response to the global financial crisis has been declared the global success story. It is the kind of approach that other countries are now wishing they had taken. Last week we saw a great example of how foolish the scare campaign of those senators opposite is. The opposition claimed that there was evidence that a Labor government meant high interest rates. But where are interest rates now? They are 350 basis points lower than their peak under the Liberals—lower, not higher. (Time expired)

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2009-10-29,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the answers given in question time today by Senator Conroy, particularly about interest rates. I would like to point out to Senator Pratt that Australia is the first G20 country to resume increasing interest rates following the global financial crisis. Interest rates which have been low are now on the march again due almost entirely to Mr Rudd’s and Labor’s mismanagement of the economy. We need look no further than Mr Rudd’s five-point plan to fight inflation to see why rates are on the rise and how he has failed not just the opposition’s test or the financial market’s test but his own test.
Point 1 of the plan is a target surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP. That is a fail. From inheriting a surplus of over $20 billion, Mr Rudd recklessly drove this country into a record deficit of $43 billion to splash out on school halls and everyone’s plasma TVs—made overseas, of course.
Point 2 is:
… a range of policy options concerning, how do we boost national savings and how do we encourage a broader national savings culture in Australia.
I regret to say that this is another fail. National savings have been decimated, with a record government debt level of $300 billion. That is a record deficit. Mr Rudd may want to look at his own government’s culture before he starts lecturing people about their spending habits. There has been a complete lack of financial discipline and rigour, with reckless projects such as the National Broadband Network, the so-called schools stimulus, the GROCERYchoice website and the 2020 Summit, not to mention four classrooms that are being knocked down to be replaced by the same four classrooms because the school has no use for the money. Things like that are putting enormous upward pressure on interest rates.
Point 3 is:
… to act decisively and effectively on the skills crisis.
That is presumably to be done by closing Australian technical colleges. That is an obvious fail. It is another sop to the union movement that costs young Australians the opportunity to learn a trade and secure a job.
Point 4 is:
… to deal effectively—
these are Mr Rudd’s own words—
with a challenge of public infrastructure and infrastructure bottlenecks which exist across the economy and are creating capacity constraints.
With the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government coming from New South Wales Labor, we do not have high hopes. Let us face it: Labor’s record on infrastructure falls over faster than New South Wales Labor premiers, and this minister seems more concerned with what John Howard is doing with rugby in his retirement than anything to do with his own portfolio. Talk about being obsessed with the wrong priorities. Water, power, roads and tolls have all proven too difficult for state Labor governments to deal with, and our cities are parched and gridlocked as a result. We will give them only a partial fail on this point because the federal government have not actually done anything yet, apart from building some apparently desperately needed school halls in schools that were to be demolished anyway. But the signs are not good.
His last point, point 5, is:
… to act also with a clear pathway to the future on how do we boost, effectively, workforce participation.
In other words, how do they put more people into jobs in the future? To that I say, ‘If you want more people in jobs in the future, don’t vote red in 2010.’

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-10-29,"—I present two government responses to committee reports as listed at item 13 on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to have the documents incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE COMMUNITY AFFAIRS LEGISLATION COMMITTEE
REPORT ON COMPLIANCE AUDITS ON MEDICARE BENEFITS
Government Response to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee Report on Compliance audits on Medicare Benefits

Government Response


Recommendation 1

The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing and Medicare ensure that as part of the Medicare compliance audit process, specific measures are detailed in the regulations to ensure that patient clinical records are only required to be accessed where necessary

Accepted

The Bill has been amended to make clear that:
practitioners should only provide clinical records if they are necessary to substantiate the service; and
if clinical records are provided, they may be provided to a Medicare Australia medical adviser (an employee of Medicare Australia who is a medical practitioner).  Medicare Australia will have qualified medical practitioners available to receive documents in all audits.
Medicare Australia is also working with relevant stakeholders, including the Australian Medical Association, to develop guidelines for practitioners on the kind of information that will substantiate particular services or groups of services.  These guidelines will be publicly available and will emphasise that clinical information is not to be provided unless it is absolutely necessary to substantiate the claim.  The commencement date of the Bill will be 1 January 2010 to allow time for these guidelines to be developed.

Coalition Senators’ Minority Recommendations

Coalition Senators do not agree with the Majority Report recommendation.

Recommendation 1

The Government conduct a review of the Medicare Benefits Schedule with the view to rationalising or simplifying individual schedule items.

Government Response

A Review of the MBS primary care items was announced on 9 December 2008.  Key stakeholders including general practitioners were consulted during the course of the Review.  In addition to individual meetings, an all day GP Working Party meeting comprising the major GP organisations took place in Melbourne on 21 January 2009.
The aim of the Review is to reduce red tape for GPs, encourage prevention and simplify the primary care items in the Schedule.  Specific areas of focus for the Review include:
general practice attendance items;
after hours attendance items;
out of surgery attendance items;
health assessment items;
chronic disease management items;
GP multidisciplinary case conference items; and
emergency attendance items.
The Government has already simplified requirements for chronic disease care planning items by removing the requirement from 1 January 2009 for a rebate for a care plan to be claimed before the rebate for allied health services may be paid.
Further outcomes from the Review are currently being considered by the Government. 

Recommendation 2

The Government develop a training/information program in consultation with relevant professional associations to improve the accuracy of Medicare billing practices among health care professionals.

Accepted

Medicare Australia will continue to conduct education and training to improve billing practices among healthcare professionals.  The education and training resources will be updated to address issues that arise during compliance audits.  These resources will continue to be developed in consultation with key stakeholders.  At present more than 30% cent of practitioners receive some form of targeted information, educational or training support from Medicare Australia each year.

Recommendation 3

If the Medicare CEO remains unsatisfied with the responses of the medical provider or has further questions that the CEO believes may only be resolved through reviewing a patient’s record, then the matter should be referred to the Professional Services Review Board to be reviewed by a committee of the Practitioner’s peers.
A report prepared by the PSRB could then be submitted to the Medicare CEO for consideration.

Accepted in substance

The key issue here is the involvement of a medical practitioner when clinical records are produced to substantiate a service.
The Bill has been amended to make clear that:
before a notice to produce documents may be issued, the CEO must take into account advice from a medical adviser (an employee of Medicare Australia who is a medical practitioner) on the kind of documents that a person may need to provide to substantiate a service;
a practitioner should only provide clinical records if they are necessary to substantiate the service; and
if clinical records are provided, they may be provided to an employee of Medicare Australia who is a medical practitioner.  Medicare Australia will have qualified medical practitioners available to receive documents in all audits.
These changes have been made because the PSR scheme is a peer review process designed to manage inappropriate practice.  It was not constructed to manage a large volume of matters.  Implementing this recommendation would require significant revision of the PSR provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973.  It risks shifting the focus of PSR to the detriment of the management of inappropriate practice.
The compliance audit process is designed to be a simple, administrative mechanism to manage incorrect payments.  Involving PSR in the compliance audit process would be likely to significantly increase the time required to complete a compliance audit.  It could also considerably increase the cost of the process for the practitioners who are audited and taxpayers. 
At present information produced as a result of a notice to produce documents under the Bill, may not be used to refer a practitioner to PSR for investigation of inappropriate practice.  This protection would need to be removed if PSR was made responsible for the assessment of some or all of the documents produced.

Recommendation 4

The Office of the Privacy Commissioner should be consulted to develop protocols and guidelines for the protection of patient history record confidentiality during any Medicare compliance audit activity.

Accepted

The Privacy Guidelines for the Medicare Benefits and Pharmaceutical Benefits Programs issued by the Privacy Commissioner under section 135AA of the National Health Act 1953 will apply to documents containing clinical details about an individual provided to Medicare Australia during a compliance audit.
In addition Medicare Australia will work with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to develop further administrative guidelines to ensure patient confidentiality during Medicare compliance audit activities.

Australian Green Senators’ Additional Comments

The Australian Greens support the Committee recommendation that further measures are adopted to ensure that patient clinical records are only required to be accessed where necessary.

Comment 1

Medical Advisors have oversight of all audits involving clinical information.

Accepted in substance

The Bill has been amended to make clear that:
before a notice to produce documents may be issued, the CEO must take into account advice from a medical adviser (an employee of Medicare Australia who is a medical practitioner) on the kind of documents that a person may need to provide to substantiate a service;
practitioners should only provide clinical records if they are necessary to substantiate the service; and
if clinical records are provided, they may be provided to an employee of Medicare Australia who is a medical practitioner.  Medicare Australia will have qualified medical practitioners available to receive documents in all audits.

Comment 2

Provision of a clear definition of what constitutes ‘a reasonable concern’ to conduct a review of the health provider against which a determination is made

Not accepted

It is not feasible to further define ‘reasonable concern’ in legislation.  The Medical Benefits Schedule changes constantly to keep up with clinical practice and medical technology so ‘fixing’ the definition of reasonable concern could unacceptably limit the ability to protect the integrity of the Medicare scheme from emerging compliance risks.  However the Department of Health and Ageing and Medicare Australia will investigate the possibility of developing further guidance for practitioners on what constitutes a ‘reasonable concern’.  It may be possible to distribute any such guidance each year when Medicare Australia publishes the National Compliance Program.

Comment 3

The decision to investigate patient records is made by senior officers delegated by the Medicare CEO, with oversight by Medical Advisors.

Accepted in substance

The Bill requires the decision to issue a notice to produce documents to be made by the CEO or the CEO’s delegate. 
Medicare Australia will not be requesting clinical records from practitioners.  Medicare Australia will outline the reasonable concern in relation to a service and ask the person to provide documents to substantiate the service.  It will be up to the person who receives the notice to decide what documents they have which substantiate the service.
However the Bill has been amended to make clear that:
before a notice to produce documents may be issued, the CEO must take into account advice from a medical adviser (an employee of Medicare Australia who is a medical practitioner) on the kind of documents that a person may need to provide to substantiate a service; and
practitioners should only provide clinical records if they are necessary to substantiate the service; and
if clinical records are provided, they may be provided to an employee of Medicare Australia who is a medical practitioner.  Medicare Australia will have qualified medical practitioners available to receive documents in all audits.

Comment 4

If it is decided ‘reasonable concern’ exists, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is made to justify accessing patient records including that there is no other way to obtain the necessary information and that the investigation is in the public interest.

Not accepted

This is not the function of a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).  A PIA is an assessment tool to allow agencies to identify and analyse privacy impacts during a project’s design phase.  In addition, Medicare Australia will not be requesting clinical records from practitioners.  Medicare Australia will outline the reasonable concern in relation to a service and ask the person to provide documents to substantiate the service.  It will be up to the person who receives the notice to decide what documents they have which substantiate the service.  However, in determining that there is a reasonable concern, and asking the person to respond, Medicare Australia will provide the person with assistance and guidance to ensure that only information necessary to substantiate the service is collected.

Comment 5

The PIA will include assessment of whether the necessary information can be gained by de-identified records without undermining the integrity of the audit process.

Not accepted

It is not possible to de-identify records without undermining the integrity of the audit process.  The audit will be conducted on specified Medicare services provided by a particular practitioner to a particular patient.  Wherever possible the identity of a person will occur through a Medicare number (rather than name) and the medical service will be explained by reference to the Medicare item (rather than a detailed description of the service).

Comment 6

The patients, or their authorised decision maker, should be advised that their personal health record is to be accessed for the purpose of a compliance audit.

Not Accepted

The are significant disadvantages to individual patient notification including risks that notification may:
compromise the patient’s privacy;
unreasonably disrupt the therapeutic relationship (a patient may lose confidence in the practitioner); and
cause unnecessary anxiety to some patients (a patient may think that the medical care their practitioner is providing is not appropriate);
However Medicare Australia has accepted recommendation 2 of the PIA and will:
conduct a broader information campaign for patients to raise awareness that excerpts of their medical records may potentially be provided to Medicare Australia during a compliance audit; and/or
provide information on assignment of benefit forms and patient receipts; and/or
work with stakeholders to provide practitioners with notices to put up in their medical practices.

Comment 7

That if the patient or their authorised decision maker objects to the use of their personal medical record and provides reasons, the decision to access information is subject to an internal review and the patient is provided with written reasons for the decision.

Not accepted

This would undermine the integrity of the compliance audit program because an “opt out” provision would mean that some services for which there is a compliance risk could not be audited.  It may also lead to situations where access to the necessary information could be prevented by a practitioner who is able to convince patients to withhold their consent.
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES
REPORT 95: REVIEW INTO TREATIES TABLED ON 4 JUNE, 25 JUNE AND 26 AUGUST 2008
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that in any specific arrangement concerning the exchange of Defence personnel, the Australian Government seeks to ensure that Australian personnel are protected from corporal and capital punishment under United Arab Emirates law.

Response:

The Government agrees in principle.  It is the United Arab Emirates Government’s strongly held view that its laws are a matter of national sovereignty.  Within this context, the Australian Government would seek for Australian personnel to be protected from corporal and capital punishment.

Recommendation 7

The Committee supports the Agreement between the Government of the United Arab Emirates and the Government of Australia on Defence Cooperation and recommends that the binding treaty action be taken.

Response:

The Government agrees that the recommendation is appropriate, and notes that binding treaty action has been taken.

Recommendation 11

The Committee supports the Agreement with the French Republic Regarding Defence Cooperation and Status of Forces and recommends that binding treaty action has been taken.

Response:

The Government agrees with the recommendation and supports the Agreement with the French Republic Regarding Defence Cooperation and Status of Force.
On 6 January 2009, an Exchange of Notes was sent to the Embassy of the French Republic advising that the Government of Australia has concluded all domestic procedures necessary for entry into force of the Agreement pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 1.
On 15 May 2009, the French Parliament ratified the Defence Cooperation Agreement. The Agreement will enter into force on the date that the French side notifies the Australian Government in writing, through diplomatic channels, that all its domestic procedures necessary for the entry into force have been concluded.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,30,1

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-10-29,"—I will speak about this document on electoral reform. Again, I raise the stupidity of our electoral system and the recent redistribution. In North Queensland we have a situation whereby the electorate of Dawson is based upon the city of Mackay. It takes in the rural community towns of Ayr and Home Hill, where I live. It has gradually crept to the north and now encompasses the southern suburbs of Townsville, around Stuart and some parts of Oonoonba. The stupidity of the redistribution, about which there was an enormous number of complaints to the Electoral Commission of Queensland, is that the electorate now continues right into Townsville proper—into the suburb of Annandale where, coincidentally enough, the current federal member for Herbert actually lives. It is a suburb right slap bang in the electorate of Herbert, and it is clearly part of Townsville.
The Electoral Commission, in its wisdom, has now included that suburb of Townsville in an electorate which is based on Mackay, some 400 kilometres away. The electorate of Mackay is a seat broadly based on the sugar industry in Mackay and coming up into the Burdekin district. Mackay, of course, is a very diverse community; it has a lot of mining, beef cattle and tourism, and the Burdekin does have some small crop farming and beef cattle, as well as sugar and the sugar mills. But the electorate now goes into what one might say is one of the leafy suburbs of Townsville: the suburb of Annandale.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2009-10-29,"—I rise tonight to take note of the interim report of the Senate Economic References Committee into the government’s economic stimulus initiatives. I had the privilege of joining this committee for its inquiry and I could not let the comments of another member of the committee, Senator Cameron, from earlier this week go by without responding to some of them.
This report actually outlines how this stimulus package has failed, even against the very low bar which the govenrment sets for it. This has placed an extraordinary debt burden upon future Australians. This debt burden has not been undertaken for productive reasons, and it is a burden on the future of every Australian, as they need to pay back well over $200 billion of debt.
When businesses and people borrow money, they do so after analysing whether it is an investment in a business, in providing housing or in providing for their own personal future. This government has not done any of that. The justification from the government for parts of this report is, ‘We have spent $14 billion on education.’ Building school halls all around the country is not an investment in education. This tries to walk both sides of the street by saying this is an education investment and a stimulus investment. But it fails on both counts.
I do not think that anyone in this building has any doubt that we could find a better way to invest $14 billion in educating young Australians. We could invest it by improving standards or we could improve teacher training. Building a school hall is not going to help one child to read better or to count better. This claim that it is investment in education is a farce. Asserting that something is infrastructure does not make it so. Asserting that something is an investment in education does not make it so.
Earlier this week the Business Council of Australia outlined that many of these projects had not been tested by Infrastructure Australia with a cost-benefit analysis and that many of the projects were not of real economic value. They were simply called ‘infrastructure’ by the government. They had not been examined. They had not been tested to see whether or not they actually provided a stronger economic environment for Australia in the future. Handing out $900 cheques, building school halls and throwing borrowed money around willy-nilly does not improve the future economic capacity of this country. But the most important thing about this so-called economic stimulus plan is its impact on the future economic growth of Australia through interest rates.
The Reserve Bank governor himself admitted to the committee that if this were to be wound back, interest rates would be lower than they will otherwise be under this government’s plans. So every time the interest rates go up in this country every Australian who is paying higher interest rates for their business loan or who is paying higher interest rates on their home mortgage will know who to point the finger at—that is, those opposite. The Reserve Bank governor was asked: if there were $20 billion or $30 billion less of government spending in the forward estimates, would that mean there would be less pressure on interest rates? The Governor of the Reserve Bank said, ‘Yes’. The Governor of the Reserve Bank said that that would mean there was less pressure on interest rates. What we see from this government is a plan that knowingly, wilfully and intentionally will make interest rates higher than they otherwise would be, and that is something the Australian people will hold these people to account for.
Senator Cameron made some comments earlier this week about what he alleged were ‘academic economists’. We were fortunate enough to hear from some of Australia’s most eminent economists, who came before the inquiry. What they, being very well credentialled professors at two of Australia’s universities, outlined was that the model and the assumptions that underpin this government’s ideas—we will call it neo-Keynesianism, because they so favour the word ‘neo’ these days—do not work in a modern economy. The idea that governments can borrow money and pump prime an economy died in the 1970s. It died when our economy opened up. It died when our exchange rate became internationally tradeable. It died when tariffs went down. What we are seeing right now was in fact predicted by one of the economists. Professor Tony Makin from Griffith University outlined exactly how governments borrowing tens of billions of dollars to splash around Australia without any concern for its impact on future economic growth would drive our currency up.
Every exporter in Australia today is living with the consequences of this government’s borrowed money, not just in terms of their interest rates going up but also in terms of lower prices in Australian dollars for everything they sell overseas. And, Senator Marshall, every person who manufactures, every Australian manufacturer who tries to export a product, is actually facing a squeeze because of this rise in our currency. This rise in our currency is being pushed up higher than it otherwise would by the interest rate increases driven by your stimulus package. It has been pushed up higher than it otherwise would be by the policies of your government of borrowing money and splashing it around. That is the reality of a modern internationally tradeable economy. I know that those people opposite do not like it. They refer to it as neo-liberalism or some sort of neo-liberal conspiracy, but that is the reality of modern Australia.

Senator Pratt interjecting—

—Those opposite like to claim they support jobs. I recall a year ago that they were talking about creating jobs. Now they talk about supporting jobs. Senator Pratt interjected earlier, ‘Two hundred thousand jobs’—200,000 jobs for $200 billion. Is that what you are asserting? If that is what you are asserting, I will be very interested to see what the Australian people consider the value of that particular alleged stimulus package. Australians are going to pay for this for a long time. Not one child is going to come out these school halls being able to read, write or count any better. They are going to have lower employment prospects. If they want to go into an export industry, they are going to have lower employment prospects—less chance at a job. We had people come before us who explained exactly how and the Governor of the Reserve Bank pointed at the elephant in the room and said, ‘Interest rates are going to be higher than they otherwise would be because of this government.’ This government will stand condemned in future years for this.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,36,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2009-10-29,"—I just want to make a brief contribution on this report too. A couple of things that Senator Ryan said in his contribution just do not pass the old laugh test. People here forget that you should actually put things up and test them for their veracity. Senator Ryan put it to us that an economist predicted that the currency would go up. Well, there you have it! Currencies have two ways to go. They can go either up or down. And, because of the fact that an economist predicted that the currency would go up, therefore his whole economic theory that espouses support for that should be absolutely believed and is the only credible point of view to put before this Senate—you have got to be joking! If that is the sort of argument that you are putting forward to support your case, Senator Ryan, I suggest you go and do a bit more rigorous intellectual work and then come to this Senate with a reasonable proposition.
The other thing that I encourage you not to do, Senator Ryan, is to selectively quote the Governor of the Reserve Bank just to support the propositions that you want to put. I was not at the committee hearing and you were, as you have said. The interesting thing about A-PAC now is that I unfortunately find myself sitting at home in the evenings watching it when I should be watching something else. It is very sad and it is a serious concern! But I actually watched a lot of that evidence and I found it very interesting. But I think, Senator Ryan, to simplify the responses of the Governor of the Reserve Bank in the way you did to support your argument did no justice to the very thorough, long and detailed presentation the Reserve Bank governor gave to that committee. I just wanted to make those points in case anyone was listening—or watching on A-PAC, as I do.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-10-29,"—I also want to make a couple of comments on this report of the Economics References Committee. I congratulate the committee on their work and the quality of the report. I was interested to listen to Senator Marshall, and I just want to ask Senator Marshall one thing: who is going to pay off the money that has been borrowed for the economic stimulus package? It is all borrowed money, which puts upward pressure on interest rates, as you know, and we are seeing the results of that now. Already interest rates are starting to climb and will continue to do so, because Mr Rudd, that supposed economic conservative, has borrowed all of the money for the economic stimulus package. Who is going to pay that off and how?
—I am happy to answer that question.
 (Senator Humphries)—You may be happy to answer, Senator Marshall, but it was a rhetorical question, I assume.
—Please get up and answer it at any time that you are able to within the standing orders—and I do not think that is now, Senator Marshall. Just tell us. How is it going to be paid off? Will it be increased taxes? More taxes? Additional taxes? The CPRS is a huge tax grab with some $50 billion unaccounted for. Is this how we are going to pay for the economic stimulus package? I would be interested to hear. Perhaps someone from the other side who has not spoken in this debate could answer my questions if Senator Marshall is not permitted under the standing orders to do it.
I did want to raise one other thing in relation to the committee’s report on the economic stimulus package. In question time today we had the Minister for Employment Participation responding to some interjections I have been making during the week about the rate of male unemployment in the city of Cairns in the north of Queensland. It is 17½ per cent, which is beyond even the Hawke-Keating unemployment rates in Far North Queensland. There are a number of reasons for that. The tourism industry is struggling but it is not getting any assistance whatsoever from the Rudd government. Of course, the changes in industrial relations laws mean that it is more difficult for the small businesses that constitute the tourism industry in Far North Queensland to engage and employ people. The minister has just come into the chamber; he must have been attracted by my commenting about his sterling performance in question time today when, in response to my interjections about that 17½ unemployment in Cairns, he said, ‘Oh, but we’re building some schools in Ravens Shoe.’
Opposition senator interjecting—
—Is it in western New South Wales? I am not sure where Raven Shoe is. I thought he must have been talking about a bird that was wearing some footwear. I assume he was talking about Ravenshoe—which, while it is in Far North Queensland, is nowhere near Cairns. My interjections, to which he said in his answer he was responding, were in relation to the high rate of unemployment in Cairns. Ravenshoe is some two or three hours to the south-west of Cairns, at the bottom southern tip of the Atherton Tableland. Senator Arbib, if you ever get out of running the Labor Party in Sydney, you would do well to go and have a look around Cairns and places in Queensland and in Northern Australia where unemployment is so unacceptably high.
My real concern about these artificial measures which Senator Arbib is saying the government is putting in place—the ‘Julia Gillard memorial halls’—is that they are supposed to be economic stimulus. In Cairns they have had a very good shipbuilding industry for almost 100 years and perhaps even longer. It is a shipbuilding industry that built the first iteration of Australia’s very successful patrol boats. It is a shipbuilding industry that employed a considerable number of tradesmen and labourers, blue-collar workers, in Cairns. There was a government contract around that was allowing for some shipbuilding work for the Navy. I understand from all reports that the Cairns company North Queensland Engineers and Agents—NQEA—trading under another name, was pretty well in line to get the contract. Then, because of the Queensland government and the federal government, on the cusp of signing the contract it was pulled from under the feet of NQEA, the shipbuilding operators in Cairns. As a result, over 300 trade jobs in the shipbuilding industry have gone.
Cairns is now in a situation where it is experiencing 17½ per cent adult male unemployment. This government could have secured the jobs of all of those working families in Cairns, but it chose to stab NQEA and every single one of those tradesmen in the back. Now they are talking about artificially stimulating the economy, when there was a very viable business there—a business that was paying its own way and employing a lot of working families in Cairns. The federal Labor government, in conjunction with the Queensland Labor government, let that business go to the wall. This is why I get very distressed at the way the Labor Party cannot handle the economy, cannot handle employment and simply cannot be trusted with our economy. There are more than 300 skilled tradesmen in Cairns who know firsthand what it is like to be victims of the Labor Party’s mismanagement of the country. Their jobs, their secure jobs that could have been there for the next 10 years if they had got this shipbuilding contract, were capriciously taken from them by the Labor governments in Queensland and the Commonwealth. Mr Rudd and his government must stand condemned for that and for the fact that unemployment in Cairns is now in excess of 17 per cent for adult males.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,36,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2009-10-29,"—I want to make a brief contribution to this debate. I want to commend the Senate Economics References Committee for its report on the government’s economic stimulus initiatives. Like Senator Macdonald, I would like to draw attention to the flawed thinking which is evident in the way the government has approached this stimulus spending. Obviously, anybody from blind Freddy upwards can see that the government is using a large amount of this stimulus spending for pork-barrelling.
This was emphasised today in question time when the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Arbib, very clumsily suggested that any criticism of the way economic stimulus spending occurred and was distributed around Australia was a call for those senators to have stimulus spending made in their own electorates or jurisdictions. Of course he was referring to my criticisms earlier this week of the government’s neglect of the ACT in allocating stimulus spending, particularly for school science labs and under the Jobs Fund program. I reject the suggestion that criticising the government stimulus package’s fairness of distribution in any way amounts to a call for a stimulus package of the size and scale which the government has in fact rolled out. It is perfectly appropriate to say that the government is wrong to attempt to borrow as much money as it has and to spend it in such a wayward and targeted way and then to suggest that it needs to reconsider how it has distributed that money between Australian jurisdictions and between different citizens of Australia.
I think the spending was wrong, and I am very proud to have voted against that spending. That is not to say that the opposition does not believe a stimulus package of some sort was warranted. The opposition has never pretended that stimulus spending was not needed; but, as Senator Macdonald made reference to in this debate already, it did not claim that spending need be on such a scale and in such a badly targeted way. I think the corollary of the argument which was used in question time today—that a member of the Senate who voted against the stimulus package has no right to criticise the way the money is spent in his or her electorate—is presumably that the government is free to not target for funding the electorates of those senators who voted against the government’s package. Is that what the government is actually suggesting—that because the member for an electorate in Queensland or a senator for the ACT voted against the package of government stimulus spending the government is entitled not to spend money in those places? That is what it sounded like in question time today.
Just because we oppose legislation does not mean we walk away from our obligation as legislators to scrutinise the way money is spent. That is our obligation to the electors who return us to this place. We do that job; irrespective of whether we support the package in the first place or not. If members of this government think they can avoid scrutiny because their package is not supported in the first place, they are very sorely mistaken.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-10-29,"—I seek leave to table my study leave report entitled From the farm to the wardrobe: a snapshot of the Australian wool industry, August 2009, as a report to the Senate.
Leave granted.
—I first thank the government for granting me leave to table my report as a report to the Senate. Having commenced my work and research in October last year, I have watched the report evolve to 620 pages of what I have termed ‘War and peace on wool’. Indeed, the photo on the front—a merino sheep in an elegant wardrobe—encapsulates the two ends of this complex industry. In my report I acknowledge the many people, both here and in Italy, who took the time to speak with me and provide me with information. To my ‘wool family’—and you know who you are—thank you for your guidance, support and commitment. Thank you also to the Senate IT staff, and in particular John Baczynski, who helped me with the logistics of the report; to my staff, and in particular Gemma Iafrate, who persevered with me in this venture; and to my husband, John, for his support and understanding. Cuddling lambs across the countryside meant that lamb was off the Wells’s household menu for a while! It is unusual to prepare such a study leave report. I suspect it is one of the longest ever tabled and I am very proud to do so.
Over the years I often asked myself why Australia produces the best wool in the world, yet we sell it to the Italians and then buy the clothes back. I myself have been guilty of this, as I suspect have quite a number of my Senate colleagues, judging by their suits. And so I decided to get the answer for myself. I admit that I had only seen sheep in paddocks and never touched one in my life. I thank Senator John Williams, former shearer, who kindly demonstrated the finer points of shearing to me during my visit to Inverell last December.
The wool industry has historically been important to the Australian economy. It is worth approximately $2.6 billion and provides employment across regional Australia. But it faces many challenges, which I traverse in my report. In particular, continued negative media, especially around the mulesing issue, has compounded its difficulties.
The challenge for the industry is to manage transition and change whilst there is still a core base of breeding ewes that can continue to produce the commercial quantities of wool that are required to supply Australia’s existing markets, and in particular the Italian market, before we embark on new opportunities. Continued business with Italy remains the leading opportunity to continue wool’s presence in the premium apparel market. In times of continued economic pressure and much more environmentally aware consumers, wool is well placed to re-establish its position within the textile markets.
In researching my report, I came at it as a consumer. I enjoy wearing wool and would like to ensure it remains a viable product into the future. But what has become apparent to me is that the wool industry has failed to start with a clear view of the needs of the consumer and the properties of wool and work back and produce what the consumer wants. It has always been a production oriented business. However, things have changed, and so too must the industry.
What happens on the farms of Australia affects what happens on the catwalks of Milan and what happens on the catwalks of Milan affects what happens on the farms of Australia. If the consumer does not demand wool and if the designers do not use wool in their apparel, there will be less wool for sale. Australia remains the largest producer of wool. We supply 85 per cent of the world’s merino wool, so there is an 85 per cent chance that the wool in apparel will be Australian. However, this is under challenge with the Chinese industry in very much a growth phase. Regrettably, this has been allowed to happen at the expense of Australian wool growers and at the expense of our traditional relationships.
My report is lengthy and a comprehensive analysis of the industry. The table of contents alone covers nine pages and outlines the many different and complex aspects of what wool is about today. The report also has an addendum which includes my comments following the release of Australian Wool Innovation’s 3 year review of performance final report released on 1 September 2009. The review of AWI undertaken for the WoolPoll process vindicates much of my criticism of AWI. It is very clear that AWI’s problems are systemic and ingrained. Its standing and reliability as an effective organisation have been compromised to the point where it is best for the Australian government and industry stakeholders to start afresh with the establishment of a broad skills based, industry-wide body.
In addition to wider wool industry participation covering the spectrum, including wool growers, processors, testing and certification bodies, such a body should also include the broader wool industry stakeholders such as the textile and apparel sector, the fashion industry, research and educational stakeholders, trade development and marketing expertise. Many stressed to me the need for an umbrella organisation to undertake the functions currently spread between AWI and other wool bodies and others not being met. In short, we need a go-to body for the whole wool industry.
Mulesing is one of the most important issues facing the wool industry. One thing that is clear is that the issue has been badly handled since the beginning. Irrespective of the merits of pro- or anti-mulesing, the reality is that the 2004 undertakings were given and the perception is that, whilst ever mulesing continues to be an issue, there will be a negative perception about wool. There needs to be a reality check. Two recent incidents—the decision by the Ermenegildo Zegna Group not to award its coveted award this year and resume the award next year for non-mulesed wool only and the comments by key Australian wool buyers such as China’s Sunshine Group about ceasing mulesing—provide a salutary warning about the future demand for non-mulesed wool. Regrettably, rightly or wrongly the long-term continuation of this practice is not sustainable.
I make 10 recommendations in my report which broadly fall into three categories: firstly, the need for the Australian government to review the current wool industry representation and research and development options, including abolishing AWI and establishing a broad skills based, industry-wide body or reviewing and substantially restructuring AWI by changing the voting eligibility, voting system and selection process for directors. There should also be a review of the wool levy system, the current grant criteria and an audit of AWI Ltd research and development, innovation and marketing projects against the key legislative criteria of their benefit to Australian wool growers and to the Australian community generally.
Secondly, I have made a series of recommendations to strengthen the relationship between Australia and Italy on wool. Australia and Italy are the premium ends of wool. Australia produces the best fine and superfine merino wool and Italy is our flagship manufacturer and brand leader. I suggest that a memorandum of understanding between Australia and Italy be established with a view to a closer working relationship and more direct cooperation between the two countries, including between Australian and Italian wool industry bodies; between key Australian and Italian fashion, textile and apparel bodies; between Australian and Italian tertiary, vocational and research institutions in the textile-apparel areas and especially in wool; greater cooperation on technical issues such as reclassification of wool as a primary product and the standardisation of veterinary certificates; and greater grower awareness of their Italian textile, apparel and fashion markets.
Thirdly, there are technical recommendations, including that Australian government and wool industry support be given to AWEX to ensure that on-farm audits are fully implemented as soon as practicable; that the Australian government examine the previous role of EFIC regarding credit in the wool industry and consider the re-establishment of a similar facility; and that licensing parameters for the use of Woolmark be reviewed, noting that the 2008 TCF review recommended a new Australian ethical quality mark be devised which will have important repercussions for the mulesing issue and for ethical and quality labelling.
In conclusion, I cannot but say that this is an industry which, despite its challenges, does have a future. Whilst many in the industry are facing difficulties, they still retain their passion and commitment to wool, and it is this passion and commitment which I believe will see the industry through these difficult times and into the future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Wool Industry</title>,Adjournment,38,1
