"Mr ABBOTT,MP",LP,2003-10-07,"—Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.
—The Leader of the House may proceed.
—In question time today, the member for Prospect asked me what I was going to do about the health care crisis in her electorate. Whatever else might be going on in her electorate, there is no bulk-billing crisis. I can inform her that the latest figures for bulk-billing in the Prospect electorate are 96.9 per cent.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—Mr Speaker, in question time on 18 September 2003, you said to the Leader of the Opposition:
I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the style of answering questions by asking rhetorical questions is not outside the standing orders ...
I would ask that you reconsider this statement on two grounds: firstly, there is no provision in the standing orders for ministers to ask questions. The purpose of question time is for the parliament, on behalf of the nation, to hold the executive accountable; secondly, the asking of questions across the table incites responses which are, in turn, disorderly. This was raised as far back as 1914. The House of Representatives Practice says: 
... the Chair has suggested that Members refrain from adopting an interrogatory method of speaking which provokes interjections.
Mr Speaker, I took this up with your predecessor, Speaker Halverson, back in May 1997. He acknowledged in his reply that members should refrain from adopting an interrogatory method of speaking which provokes interjections. It also offends standing order 59 in many cases. Given this, I would ask that you review your statement of 18 September. ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Question Time</title>,Questions to the Speaker,7,1
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2003-10-07,"—As I recall the instance, it was a case—and I will stand corrected if I am wrong—of the Treasurer addressing questions to government members which were invoking a response, and it was in that context that I used the remark. If I am in error, I will come back to the member for Wills. I do, however, recognise the comments made by Speaker Halverson and I would uphold them. I thought the way in which I was involved in this was a case of the Treasurer asking questions of the government side of the House rather than questions directed to the opposition or the Leader of the Opposition, but I will check the transcript and come back to the member for Wills.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Question Time</title>,Questions to the Speaker,7,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—When the Prime Minister tells his favourite, Tony Abbott, the new Minister for Health and Ageing, to do whatever it takes to fix Medicare we all know that he is speaking in code: the Liberal code for destroy. We know that he wants Tony Abbott to fix it good and proper; to fix it up once and for all— 
—Order! The member for Lalor will refer to the minister by his title.
—to fix it so that it can never be fixed again. The last order the Prime Minister gave to the current minister for health, Mr Tony Abbott, was to fix Pauline Hanson and One Nation and the order before was to fix the unions—and we all know what happened with that. Interestingly, the fix on the unions does not extend to the AMA, once described by his predecessor as a militant trade union. The fix does not extend to the AMA because on radio recently the new minister for health said:
 ... what we're dealing with here are professional people, professional people who have traditionally approached these issues with a great sense of commitment, a strong sense of vocation, high ideals, and of course, they're dealing with peoples' lives.
Does this mean that his approach to industrial relations now depends on whether workers have a strong sense of vocation, high ideals and are dealing with people's lives? If so, when the minister replies he might like to try and tell us what his attitude now is to industrial campaigns by nurses, ambulance officers, firefighters, teachers, police and general employees in our hospitals and aged care institutions. This is industrial relations and how you deal with constituencies Liberal style: you make sure that you extend the greatest largesse to the most privileged. So the former union buster now cowers before the AMA and tries on Melbourne radio to get a little bit of spin about where his position is now.
Now, we all know that the Howard government is on a mission to destroy Medicare, and no amount of cheap question time talk, picking up the member for Sydney, the member for Lowe, the member for Scullin and others, is going to cover up that central fact. They are campaigning in their constituencies on the government's plan to destroy Medicare, and that is the truth. It has been the truth since Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister's guru. It proceeded apace under Fraser—and the Prime Minister knew a bit about that government, even if he and Malcolm Fraser are no longer on talking terms. And now the Howard government is about finishing that agenda; it is about destroying Medicare once and for all.
To believe otherwise would require you to believe that the Prime Minister has somehow given up his lifelong ambition to destroy Medicare. To believe anything else is to believe that the Prime Minister is prepared to give up the history of the Liberal Party. To believe that this government supports Medicare would require you to believe that John Howard and the Minister for Health and Ageing, sitting at the table, are about to burn their tickets of membership of the Liberal Party, because they would have to do that to genuinely reposition themselves and pretend that they support a universal health system.
Let us not kid ourselves. In the past week, the Prime Minister and the minister for health have not experienced a conversion on the road to Damascus, and neither of them suddenly decided to become the good Samaritan either. What we have seen in the past week is a new diversion on the road to the destruction of Medicare. Liberal governments from Menzies on have travelled down the same road. It is not the road to Damascus; it is the road to destroying and dismantling the universal health system. Have a look at the history books. It was Labor under Chifley that introduced the first stages of a national health system; it was Menzies who wound it back. It was Labor under Whitlam that introduced Medibank; it was Fraser, with Howard in tow, who destroyed it. It was Labor under Hawke that introduced Medicare; and it is Howard, with Wooldridge, Patterson and now the minister at the table, who is determined to finish the job. 
We all know that John Howard throughout his political life has been Medicare's greatest enemy. Time and time again, he has threatened to destroy it, including saying that Medicare raped the poor in this country. He went on to say he was going to pull Medicare right apart and get rid of the bulk-billing system which he said was an absolute rort. Nothing has changed since the 1980s, except the Prime Minister has got a bit cleverer about the tactics; he is trying to get to exactly the same place. The Prime Minister is no doubt proud of the progress he has made so far in destroying Medicare and even prouder of his intentions to finish the job.
I think the Prime Minister had a little lapse in the spin the other week on national television. He has been trying to portray himself as a bit of a champion of Medicare, asking us to forget all of the 1980s, but he led his guard down on national TV when he said:
I thought we had a very good system in the ... early 1970s ...
Let us remember what system he is referring to; he is referring to the system before Medibank. That might be the system that dominated the Prime Minister's cultural reference point of the 1950s, but it was not a very good system. It was a system under which many Australian families faced the choice of getting no treatment at all or paying to go to the doctor—and, let us remember, you even had to pay to be treated in a public hospital then. Is this is the system that the Prime Minister muses about as a very good system? 
I am keen to hear the minister at the table tell us whether or not fees in public hospitals are on the agenda, because the Prime Minister is so fond of the health system of the 1970s. If he is going to be true to that statement—that it was `a very good system'—then that must be what is coming next: fees for public hospital admissions. Just like the Prime Minister wants us to forget all of Liberal history from Menzies on, and every statement he made in the 1980s, the minister at the table wants us to believe that the divisive whirling-dervish boxer is now gone and has been replaced by cute and cuddly Tony: Tony with Toffee the dog on the front page of the newspaper; Tony listening to doctors; Tony the softie.
—Or is he just a worn-out old thug?
—Anyone who wants us to believe that would have us believe that Arnold Schwarzenegger is about to become a Catholic priest. You would have to believe that to believe that this minister has somehow been converted into Tony the softie—Tony the softie with Toffee the dog. The real point of all of this is that all of their intentions are wrapped up in doublespeak.
Is it any surprise that the minister at the table is an expert in spin? He is a former commentator, a former journalist. As a former journalist, he can write 800 words on anything you want him to write about. He is the sort of bloke who can write 800 words on why paper should be made from marijuana—and in fact he has. He is the sort of bloke who can write 800 words on a Harry Potter book review—and in fact he has. He is good on spin but not on honesty. Saying it, writing it and believing it are different things. Let us not forget that the minister at the table is the minister who created an organisation called Australians for Honest Politics and then did not manage to tell the truth about it. He is good at spin, not so good at honesty.
In true doublespeak style, the government's strategy for Medicare and its unfair reforms has been called A Fairer Medicare. Now the minister is going to change it, and I am waiting breathlessly for what I bet is going to be called Even Fairer Medicare. When are you going to give that to us, Tony—Even Fairer Medicare? We are all waiting to hear about it. In designing Even Fairer Medicare, he thought he had better go and meet a GP—some time, as minister for health, he had better meet a GP. Does he walk down the street and see his local GP? Does he go out to the western suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne to see a GP? Does he go to a rural town to see a GP—if he can find one? No, he goes and visits a celebrity GP in the leafy suburb of Hawthorn. 
And I understand the consultation was not so much about the state of the health system, or the minister's health, but about the next phase of his strategy. Hold on for yet another tax-funded public advertising campaign with a bit of spin in it—except this time, instead of Dr Wright, it is going to be Dr Feelgood, telling us how we should be feeling good about the government's Medicare reforms. But if Prime Minister Howard and the minister at the table get their way with Medicare, then no-one is going to be feeling good about it. 
Can I go to the misrepresentations that the minister engaged in during question time today, particularly his misrepresentations of Neal Blewett. You might not understand Medicare, but we do, Minister, and what Medicare stands for is two promises. The first promise is that you will be able to access a bulk-billing GP—not that every GP will bulk-bill, not that there will not be choice, but that you will get reasonable access to a bulk-billing GP. That is what Neal Blewett believed in—and, if you are in any doubt, give him a ring this afternoon, because that is what he will tell you. And that promise of Medicare worked under Labor, when bulk-billing rates were around 80 per cent. It is that promise of Medicare that your government has corroded and now wants to destroy. The second promise of Medicare, of course, is that you will be able to get free treatment in public hospitals—and we already know what the Prime Minister thinks about that.
Medicare has been corroded, bulk-billing rates are plummeting and this government's plan is to structure a scheme where, for forever and a day, the only people who will be bulk-billed will be concession card holders. That is the truth, and the members for Lowe and Sydney and others make claims about what people are going to have to pay under the government's system because it follows logically that, if bulk-billing is going down, it is only concession card holders who are going to be bulk-billed. What does the minister think happens next? What happens next is that everybody else gets asked to pay. How hard is it to understand that? Everybody else gets asked to pay, and that is what members on this side have been campaigning about. That is not misrepresentation, Minister; that is the truth.
In the remaining minutes, I would like to turn to the medical indemnity crisis. With Medicare we have seen wilful neglect, followed by deliberate destruction. What we are seeing with the medical indemnity crisis falls into the first category of wilful neglect. You do not have to listen to me to believe that; you can listen to the words of the former Liberal minister for health, Michael Wooldridge. We on this side of the House remember him. There was the MRI scan scam and the $5 million to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners for a new Canberra building immediately before the election, with the public never told that the money came out of asthma and rural health funding. After the election, he turned up there as a consultant. Then, when he got sacked in a scandal, he sued and got $300,000. This is the minister we are talking about. As recently as April he was proudly claiming in a public seminar that he did not do anything about the medical indemnity crisis. He said: 
As minister I was accused of doing far too little on medical indemnity. That is completely unfair; I did absolutely nothing whatsoever.
The man had been misrepresented. He let this crisis build and build, and we are seeing today exactly the results of letting a crisis build: 200 doctors are expected to walk off the job this week. You cannot wash your hands of it, Minister, because it is where the record of the neglect of the Howard government has got us. You might have had Senator Patterson and Senator Coonan out trying to sell a failed package, but your task now is to keep those 200 doctors working. I am challenging you to take the first step today by publishing the calculations on which the IBNR levy is based. The doctors reckon the maths is dodgy, and the Treasurer might even think the maths is dodgy, given the answer he gave in question time today. If the maths is dodgy, then the levy is too high. If that is the problem, you could whack those calculations on the table today. We could all look at them, and we could work out a fairer arrangement. If you do not do that, people are entitled to say, `What are you hiding? A levy or a tax that is too high? Is that what this government is hiding?'
We know that in the run-up to the next election the fundamental divide in values about health will become starker and starker. There is nothing this minister can do. There is no political fix, no sweetening, no tinker and no plan to get you through the next election which will fix that problem for you. You might be a political fixer, but you cannot fix the fact that the values which the Prime Minister and you stand for in health, historically and always, are for a two-tiered system: one system where people pay and a concessional, residual system for everybody else. 
I know that, whilst he is trying to be new cuddly Tony with Toffee the dog, what is coming now in this reply is an absolute spray about the private health insurance rebate, because the minister has already reverted to type in question time today. What he is going to do now is the next bit of the political fix he has been put in for, which is the scaremongering campaign. Before you start the scaremongering campaign, Tony—because we are not expecting you to talk about health policy—remember that the most important point from Labor is that we are entitled to review a public policy measure for effectiveness and efficiency. We are entitled to do that. If you were a responsible minister, you would be doing that too. But nothing Labor will do will increase the financial pressure on families, and nothing we will do will affect the capacity of families to take out private health insurance. On with the scaremongering campaign! (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Medicare Insurance: Medical Indemnity</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-10-07,"—The shadow minister for health, the member for Lalor, has just given us a fine, scripted speech. I am sure she has been working on it, literally, for weeks. She may even have brought Bob Ellis in to help craft some of her lines. But there were two fundamental problems with what the member for Lalor has just said. First, she is playing politics with other people's health, the health of ordinary Australians. Second, she is consistently spreading lies about what is actually happening to our health care system. The member for Lalor will have no credibility at all until she withdraws the dodgy dodges and the bodgie petitions which her colleagues are now circulating to the Australian people, presumably with her encouragement. She knows that the factoids, the so-called facts in these dodgy dodges and spurious petitions, simply are not true. She knows, because she told us in the Canberra Times on Friday, 19 September this year, when asked about the allegations that were being made by the member for Lowe and the member for Scullin that the government was going to charge people $20 to visit the doctor. The Canberra Times said: 
A spokesman for Ms Gillard conceded that the claims were not true ...
In other words, the shadow minister, the member for Lalor, knows that claims being made up hill and down dale right around the country by the member for Scullin, the member for Lowe, the member for Sydney, Senator Ludwig, the member for Banks and numerous others are not true. Now, if she is to have a shred of credibility as a health spokesman, she must forget about Bob Ellis and scripted speeches that she works on for weeks, repudiate this scare campaign and withdraw those dodgy documents which she and her colleagues have been using to con ordinary Australians about the state of our health care system.
There are some problems in our health care system—of course there are some problems in our health care system. This government cannot solve all of those problems overnight. At least some of those problems are fairly and squarely the responsibility of the states. But this government is determined to make a difference. This government is determined to do what it can to ensure that as far as is humanly possible all Australians have access to affordable high-quality health care.
One of the things that the member for Lalor has done consistently today is to resort to something known as the big lie technique. She has constantly talked about what she alleges is the government's plan to destroy Medicare. Let me make it absolutely and perfectly clear: this government supports Medicare. This government will strengthen and extend Medicare. This government believes in Medicare. This government thinks that Medicare is an article of faith. How can there possibly be a plan to destroy Medicare when this government is spending $8 billion dollars plus on the medical benefits schedule? We are spending $31 billion on health. 
The federal government's spending on health has been increasing fast, much faster than the states' spending on health. Health is now 18 per cent of the total federal government's spending compared to just 14 per cent in 1996, when members opposite were in power. In 1996 the federal government's total spend on health was 3.7 per cent of GDP; today the federal government's total spend on health is 4.3 per cent of GDP—a sustained, consistent and significant increase in health spending under the Howard government. While federal spending as a percentage of GDP has gone from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent in that same time, the states' spending has gone from two per cent to just 2.1 per cent. Let me make it absolutely crystal clear: this government supports Medicare. This government is determined to deliver affordable high quality health care to all Australians. We will strengthen Medicare. If members opposite were serious about Medicare, they would at least talk constructively to the government about the Fairer Medicare package now before the Senate.
Let me make it very clear. Members opposite are trying to say that Medicare equals bulk-billing; Medicare does not just equal bulk-billing. Yes, bulk-billing is an important part of the Medicare system but it is not necessarily the heart of the Medicare system. The heart of Medicare is a universal insurance system—a system for all Australians to ensure they get reasonable access to affordable high quality health care and, in particular, that they get reasonable access to an affordable local GP. That is the heart of Medicare. That is the system that Neal Blewett put in place. As I said today in question time, we support what the original architect of Medicare intended when in 1987 he said: 
What we mostly have in this country is ... compassionate doctors using the bulk billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services—
That is what Neal Blewett said the Medicare system was—
which was always the intention.
And today, as then, that is what the government supports: a system which has widely available access to bulk-billing but which does not necessarily pretend, as members opposite have, that bulk-billing must be universal, that Medicare equals universal access to bulk-billing. Again let us go back to the father of Medicare, Neal Blewett. At the beginning, back in 1983, he said:
Where the doctor agrees, direct billing will be available to everyone.
But Neal Blewett said this is a choice left to the doctors. It is interesting, isn't it, that in their determination to try to ensure that every person, every time he or she goes to the doctor, is bulk-billed, they are really threatening a campaign of medical price control. We know why members opposite are doing that—because deep down they do not like doctors. They think that doctors are the class enemy.
—Here she is, the former lawyer who ran all these `no win, no fee' campaigns on medical indemnity and other issues. They do not like doctors, they have never liked doctors, and now they are trying to destroy the medical profession with their insistence that everyone should be bulk-billed. I am the Minister for Health and Ageing. I am the minister for the health of all Australians. I am not the minister for doctors, but let me say that I respect doctors and I think they do a good job. Doctors are highly qualified, highly committed professionals with a strong sense of vocation. The Australian Medical Association is an organisation which should always be given a fair hearing and it should nearly always be listened to with respect. As long as I am the minister for health I will continue to work with all reasonable and responsible people to try to ensure that we have the best possible health care system.
The other thing that the member for Lalor asserts as part of the big lie technique of which she is becoming so practised an exponent is that the government has somehow created the medical indemnity crisis. This government did not create any medical indemnity crisis. To the extent that there is a medical indemnity crisis, it has been created by our legal system. I am not in the business of criticising judges. Judges apply the law as they understand it, consistently and conscientiously, to the facts that come before them. Notwithstanding the conscientiousness of Australian judges, it is a fact that tort law—particularly where it deals with medical indemnity—has become a mess. Until recently, Sydney was developing the reputation of being the medical litigation capital of the world, but I do want to congratulate the New South Wales government on their recent efforts at tort law reform. I also want to congratulate my predecessor, Senator Patterson, and my distinguished friend and colleague the Assistant Treasurer on their efforts to work with the states to try to control the tort law liability issue—in particular, the medical indemnity issue. 
Because the New South Wales government, unlike members opposite, have acted responsibly throughout this issue, we now have a much better system of tort law in New South Wales. The New South Wales tort law is now substantially under what is called the Bolam principle, which is that, if you do something which professional colleagues would recognise as reasonable, it is not negligent. That is a perfectly reasonable principle. It is a principle which should never have been departed from in Australian law, and I congratulate the New South Wales government on re-establishing the Bolam principle in New South Wales law.  
I note that, while many doctors are still understandably nervous about what will happen to medical negligence claims notwithstanding the tort law reforms, it is reported that new claims to United Medical Protection, the main medical indemnity insurer in New South Wales, have fallen from 60 to just 15 a month since July last year under the new tort law. I think there is every possibility that the so-called medical indemnity crisis will be defused in part by the work of the federal government but very substantially because of the good work of the New South Wales government.
What we cannot have is the courts using the tort law as a de facto compensation system. The tort law must be a system based on actual fault. I announced an 18-month moratorium on the IBNR levies over $1,000. In that time, the actuarial estimates will be redone. They will be recalculated on the basis of the practical experience of tort law outcomes under the reformed system. I am confident that over time, if these tort laws work as they are intended, medical indemnity costs will come down to the great benefit of not only the medical profession but also, ultimately, patients and all Australians.
I do not believe that people should be playing politics with people's health. I do not believe that we should be playing politics in this very important area of deep concern to all Australians. The thing about health is that health is important to everyone. There are all sorts of issues that come before this House. Some of them are of great moment on any particular day, but the fact is that health is always important to everyone. It is particularly important to the families of those who need health care, and Medicare is safe with this government. This government will protect and extend Medicare. This government will do its best to ensure that, as far as is humanly possible, all Australians will have access to affordable, high-quality health care. 
It is not just this government that will not play politics with health. I was very happy to stand beside the New South Wales acting health minister, Frank Sartor, last Friday as we tried to do our best to ensure that doctors do not leave the public hospitals in Western Sydney. Frank Sartor said: 
There are times when federal and state ministers must stand shoulder to shoulder to find practical solutions in the public interest. This is one of those times. 
I am quite happy to stand shoulder to shoulder with Frank Sartor and other responsible Labor people, but I do not believe there is any responsibility in the shadow minister for health, who is playing the grubbiest politics with this particular issue.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—It warms my heart to see how worried the new Minister for Health and Ageing is about his opponent. He is so worried that he does not believe that our health spokesperson can come up with her own speeches. He imagines that if she says anything articulate or sensible she has got the speech writers in. We do not have such resources. We write our own speeches, and I am sure Julia Gillard wrote her own speech today. It is not hard to make the case that the government is out to destroy Medicare. It does not take a genius to make that case.
It is interesting that this Arnold Schwarzenegger of Australian politics, who is all punch and no policy, blames everyone but himself for the crisis in Medicare today. He blames the doctors. He is saying that the doctors are careless in their insurance—that the doctors did not ring the insurer and ask, `Excuse me, are you charging me enough?' So the doctors are careless, and patients are selfish because they want new and modern treatments as they come out. `Selfish' patients should not expect too much from this government.  
The minister blames the states. He never blames the Commonwealth; the only group that he never blames is the Commonwealth government. He is never prepared to take responsibility there. He says that our health spokesperson, Julia Gillard, is using the big lie. I say that this health minister patented the big lie. I think the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is worried that this government has the patent on the big lie—that it has cornered the market and there is no room elsewhere for the big lie. This government has an article of faith, the health minister says, that it will protect and extend Medicare. I wonder if that article of faith is like the article of faith that the clergy remain celibate. I wonder if that is his definition of an article of faith.
This government's plan to destroy Medicare and the government's creation of the medical indemnity crisis is something that concerns every Australian. This government has long had a plan to destroy Medicare. The Prime Minister has made no secret of that desire. When he was Leader of the Opposition in the 1980s John Howard said that Medicare was a `miserable, cruel fraud', a `scandal', a `total and complete failure', a `quagmire', a `total disaster', a `financial monster' and a `human nightmare'. He promised he would `pull Medicare right apart' and `get rid of the bulk-billing system' which he called an `absolute rort'. His 1987 election commitment was that `bulk-billing will not be permitted for anyone exception pensioners and the disadvantaged' and `doctors will be free to charge whatever fees they choose'. That is the only promise he has delivered on in all those years. Obviously it was the only core promise of that election campaign.
The facts speak for themselves. There were 10 million fewer bulk-billed visits to doctors this year compared with when John Howard came to office. In my own electorate the rate of bulk-billing has gone down 5.8 per cent and the cost of visiting a doctor has gone up 11.2 per cent. But this is nothing compared to other areas of this country where the drops have been even greater—much greater than this. The Australian Medical Association admits that GPs will have to charge non concession card holders more under the government's plan, and the government has admitted that it will have no control over the fees that GPs charge. This is in stark contrast to Labor's $1.9 billion plan to renew and restore Medicare by paying 95 per cent and then 100 per cent of the scheduled fee and by providing incentives to doctors who bulk-bill 80 per cent or more of their patients in metropolitan areas and 70 per cent or more in other areas, with bonuses of up to $22,500.
The government's Orwellian doublespeak in alluding to A Fairer Medicare system is truly frightening. Australian families with two children will be denied access to bulk-billing once they start earning over $32,300. The system will encourage doctors to charge a gap fee and increase the cost of medicines by 30 per cent. The government has recently held a gun to the head of the states and insisted on their accepting a shortfall of about $1.5 billion by 2008 in their health agreements. Surely the $7.5 billion surplus that we have just heard announced could cover some of that $1.8 billion shortfall in hospital funding.
The government shirks its responsibilities both in a financial sense and in a policy sense. It shirks its responsibilities in the financial sense by not providing the funding that states need to provide decent hospital services, but it also shirks its policy responsibilities in that it is doing nothing to take pressure off emergency departments in major hospitals. The federal government could very easily follow the New South Wales government's lead, where GPs have been co-located at hospital sites, and it will be extending this trial program soon. So people who formerly would have seen a bulk-billing GP but who instead turn up at hospital emergency departments are now able to visit a GP. People who could see a GP if one were available but instead turn up at casualty cost the health system about $400 million each year; if they went to GPs, it would cost about $115 million each year—a saving of nearly $300 million. That is the sort of positive policy leadership we would love to see from this government. 
Another area crying out for reform is that of elderly patients who, instead of receiving the proper nursing home care they would benefit from and living in an environment they would benefit from, are in hospital beds. It is not that we begrudge them hospital treatment, as the government has tried to make out in the past, but they cannot be cared for as well in hospitals as they would be in nursing homes.
This government is presiding over a crisis in health care. We heard tales last week from Victoria, where children were being denied cancer treatment because of a $25 million shortfall in funding for that state's hospitals. We have an expert committee recommending a new suite of immunisations for children, but the government will not fund them. This is unprecedented: an expert panel is recommending immunisations that the government will not pay for. So the children of the wealthy presumably will be immunised while the children of the poor will not receive the necessary immunisations that have been recommended by experts.
Like my colleagues, I am constantly contacted by both doctors and patients crying out for help because this Medicare system is in such crisis. Kylie, a constituent of mine, told me that she could not find a bulk-billing sharedcare doctor to see her through her pregnancy—and her nearest doctor charged more for a half-hour visit than she and her husband spent in a week on groceries. Doctors at a Glebe family practice told me when I visited them a few weeks ago of some of the problems that they face. They face the usual problems with paperwork and the costs of running a practice, and people would assume that an area like Glebe would have no trouble in recruiting doctors, but that is not true. A great deal of difficulty is faced in finding GPs to practise even in inner city areas like Glebe.
We have known for a long time that we are facing a shortage of GPs, and it is truly incompetent that this government has not acted to do anything about it. The same is true for nursing. The government says that we need an extra 6,000 nurses. Last year alone, 2,500 applied to do nursing at Charles Sturt University but only 10 per cent got in. Contrast that with Labor's policy to introduce another 3,000 nursing places to do something to begin to address the shortfall in this area.
This government has form. Every single time it ignores these emerging issues until they are crises, and then it blames the people who are affected worst by them. The Tito report six years ago, in 1997, warned this government that there was an emerging indemnity insurance crisis. It has known since 1997. It has not known about it just since Tony Abbott became health minister but for seven years, and it has done nothing about it. Indeed, Michael Wooldridge boasted that nothing had been done about it. 
The doctors believe that they are being asked to pay too much. We are not in a position to judge that because this minister will not release the calculations. The doctors say that the calculations are based on legal systems before tort law reforms were introduced and, if that is the case, there might be a very good argument that they are being charged too much. Surely the first step should be for the minister to release the calculations and let us know just how they are being made. He should reassure the doctors if he has a good case—although I think we are all very sceptical that he does.
The Prime Minister has said that he wants to do something about catastrophic injuries. He mentions it, and it sinks without a trace. This minister says that, if the doctors are resigning, they are not doing so because of the levy—but that is not what they say. This situation has reached crisis point now. The government cannot afford just to flick it off until after the next election and hope that the doctors will go away quietly for the next 18 months; they will not do that. This government has absolute responsibility to take this crisis in hand and provide a reasonable solution instead of just a moratorium. A moratorium is no solution.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Medicare Insurance: Medical Indemnity</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2003-10-07,"—This MPI touches on issues which relate to Australian health and the issue of public hospitals. I want to talk a little about the private health insurance rebate, Medicare, bulk-billing and, lastly, the situation with medical indemnity. First of all I would like to restate very clearly the Liberal Party's position on health. We have now gone to three elections, and we will go to a fourth, committed to retaining Medicare, bulk-billing and community rating. That is the Liberal Party's position. Last week we celebrated 20 years of Medicare, and 7½ years of Medicare were under a coalition government. There are really three aspects to Medicare. They are: access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and we have seen that scheme growing, which allows access to the newer generation of drugs; free access to public hospitals; and universal access to the Medicare rebate. We have heard both opposition speakers talk about the Orwellian nature of this—but let us get a bit more specific. I remember distinctly in Animal Farm the way the tenets on the back of the shed changed over time. This is what is happening with the opposition. They used to say that Medicare was a universal scheme in which everyone had access to the Medicare rebate. They are now saying that Medicare has always been about high rates of bulk-billing. It simply has not. That is restating and remaking history.
I would like to say a little about the health of the Australian people, because that often gets lost in these debates. In fact, I think Peter Baume did tell Michael Wooldridge when he became minister for health to not purely become the minister for health financing but to actually become the minister for health. Let us talk about Australia's health. Australians have the third longest life expectancy of people in major developed countries after those in Japan and Switzerland. We have the fourth longest healthy life expectancy after people in Japan, Sweden and Switzerland. We have gone from spending about 8½ per cent of GDP on health for most of the last 10 years to 9.3 per cent of GDP now. That is the highest proportion of our economy we have ever spent on health. Our life expectancies are longer than they have ever been. Also, if you look at immunisation rates, you see that when the Howard government came in they were at 53 per cent. It was a disgrace. Vietnam and China had much higher immunisation rates. Now 91 per cent of 12- to 15-month-olds are fully immunised. We have also seen tobacco use go down by 18 per cent. We have the third lowest rate of tobacco use in the OECD. 
It has been a long time since I have heard any member of the opposition say anything on diabetes, obesity, immunisation or any preventative health measures. The group which has been led by government members like Judi Moylan and Senator Guy Barnett has been doing some really good things in the area of diabetes. On rural health the government spent $562 million more in the previous year's budget. Indigenous health has increased by 51 per cent since 199697. Medical research spending doubled after the Wills review. We introduced the 30 per cent private health rebate. Anyone who was here that evening can remember the screaming of the member for Jagajaga as she was forced to realise that the private health rebate was going to come in. So we know where the Labor Party stands on that. General practices are computerised. Screening for cervical cancer is now much more common. Hospital funding has increased by 28 per cent since the previous Australian health care agreement. This government has led the debate on public health measures, such as the introduction of folate prior to pregnancy, on diabetes and on immunisation. The aggressive use of adjuvant therapy now sees that in some states, like South Australia, we have some of the best five-year survival rates for breast cancer anywhere in the world. The rates are comparable.
I want to say a little about public hospital funding, because we hear a lot of nonsense from the state premiers about it. Let us look at the report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The most recent report shows that over the last 10 years the state and territory share of public hospital funding has fallen. At the same time, the Commonwealth share has risen, from 42.7 per cent in 1991-92 to 47.9 per cent in 200001. Who is the major funder of state government public hospitals in Australia? It is the Commonwealth government. Whose share has been increasing at the faster rate—the Commonwealth's or the states'? It is the Commonwealth government's share. We hear a lot of rhetoric, but we never hear any figures to back it up. This is from the independent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
Over the last 10 years, the Commonwealth's share has increased by 5.3 per cent per year while the states' contribution has only grown by 3.8 per cent a year. Also, during the first four years of the last Australian health care agreement, the Howard government increased spending on public hospitals by 4.9 per cent a year compared with 2.6 per cent by the state governments. We have seen private hospital admissions increasing at something like six per cent compared with public hospital admissions increasing by two per cent. The amount that the Commonwealth government—the Australian government—is going to give to the state governments for their public hospitals has increased from $32 billion to $42 billion. That is a 17 per cent real increase. The state and territory governments need to pull their weight. They need to match the increase that the Commonwealth government is putting in. I do not care about the rhetoric of the opposition. We need to see them actually come up with something concrete, like a fact or a bit of evidence, instead of this phoney rhetoric which is constrained by ideology and a very skewed view of history.
With regard to the 30 per cent private health rebate, I am not sure but probably one of the first votes in this House by the member for Lalor was to oppose the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate in November 1998. I am sure that, just as the Hawke government removed the incentives for private health insurance in 1983 and then removed all of the subsidies for private health insurance in 1986, we will see that that is Labor's secret agenda. That is what we will see from the Labor Party—the withdrawal of the 30 per cent rebate. We know they are not committed to it. 
The government believes that private health insurance plays a critical role in reducing the demand on public hospitals. As I said before, we have seen private hospital utilisation increase by six per cent while public hospital utilisation has increased by only two per cent. Some of the comments we have heard recently include the shadow Treasurer saying Labor was still working on its policy regarding the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate policy. He said:
We're going to have a look at ways in which that rebate can improve. It's quite an expensive policy and we want to ensure the Australian taxpayer is getting value for money ...
I always get nervous when I hear that the member for Werriwa has notions of how to improve something. The shadow minister for finance talked about the opposition's expenditure measures when he said:
Some of them will be tough ... and there'll be a lot of people complaining before we're finished.
I now want to talk briefly, in the time that I have got, about Medicare. The previous speaker, the member for Sydney, talked about a bulk-billing crisis in the electorate of Sydney.
—I did not say that. I said it was worse in other electorates. You obviously weren't listening!
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Sydney!
—The bulk-billing rate in Sydney in 2002 was 84.3 per cent. But at the same time Sydney had a median weekly family income of $1,517. This is based on 2001 census figures—that is, fifth out of 150 electorates.
—I said it was worse in other electorates. Go back and read the Hansard.
—Member for Sydney!
—Over 50 per cent of families in the electorate of Sydney are on weekly incomes of $1,500 and above.
—He is misrepresenting me!
—The member for Sydney is warned!
—That is the No. 1 Labor seat; it is No. 8 out of all the 150 seats.
—The member for Sydney is warned! The next move she makes will be out!
—There are only 16.9 per cent of families with a weekly income below $500. The focus on bulk-billing rates is a red herring. I raise that to show there is nothing fair about bulk-billing as it exists now. Bulk-billing is principally concentrated in inner metropolitan areas and very specifically in Sydney. I want to pose a couple of questions. At the moment, 67.2 per cent of total services are bulk-billed. In which year of the Labor government did they reach that figure? The answer is 1993-94. It took 10 years of Medicare to reach that figure. We hear sometimes that bulk-billing for GPs was over 80 per cent; it was not.
We also have in this MPI the claim that the government created the medical indemnity crisis. It is a bold claim that it all rests with the Commonwealth government. The shadow minister for health showed an intense interest in the previous occupations of the minister. If we are going to say that the Commonwealth government is responsible, we should at least say that contingency fees and uncapped liabilities did exacerbate the problem. (Time expired)

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2003-10-07,"—On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to correct the Hansard record. In the House on 9 September 2003, I stated that the Defence land at Point Nepean will be retained in Commonwealth ownership. I wish to clarify that the land will be retained in Commonwealth hands under leasehold from the Department of Defence. I had previously thought and stated that the freehold would be with another Commonwealth agency, Parks Australia. This information was incorrect. The error was mine, and I wish to correct the record. The critical point is, and always has been, that the Defence land at Point Nepean will be held in perpetuity by the Commonwealth for community benefit and I have fought passionately to that end.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Medicare Insurance: Medical Indemnity</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2003-10-07,"—by leave—On behalf of the Standing Committee of Privileges, I present revised guidelines relating to the resolution of the House for the protection of persons referred to in the House, and a guidance to members in relation to the handling of their records and correspondence. I seek leave to make a statement in connection with these papers.
Leave granted.
—The two documents I have just presented on behalf of the Standing Committee of Privileges are for the information of the House and members. The first of these documents is revised guidelines relating to the resolution of the House for the protection of persons referred to in the House, commonly known as the right of reply procedure. Under paragraph 9 of the House's resolution, the committee can agree to guidelines to apply to consideration by the Committee of Privileges of right of reply submissions. Guidelines were agreed upon and were presented by the committee in 1997, and they have not been revised since then. The experience of the right of reply procedure since 1997 is that 11 submissions have been made and none has so far been recommended by the committee.
The committee recently reviewed the right of reply procedure and considered that the guidelines may have led to unreasonable restrictions on the committee's consideration of submissions. The major change in the revised guidelines I have presented is to relax the focus on the capability of persons to be able to respond to comments made about them in the House. While the committee will continue to have regard to the existence of other remedies that those who make submissions may have, it will also consider whether those remedies have been exercised. Media personnel will no longer be specifically excluded from consideration.
The committee will have regard to the purpose of the right of reply procedure to give persons the opportunity to respond to remarks made about them in the same forum as the original remarks were made. The revised guidelines will operate in relation to submissions received by the committee after today. There will be no retrospective considerations of submissions.
The second document I have presented is guidance to members in relation to the handling of their records and correspondence. The guidance is in the form of responses to commonly asked questions about how members should handle their records and correspondence. The committee has previously produced a report on records and correspondence of members and has developed comprehensive guidelines for members on handling their records and correspondence. The purpose of the information I have just presented is to provide members with, in a simple form, the major issues they need to think about in relation to their records. I believe the information will be of value to members, and I will circulate a copy to all members. It is also intended to hold a seminar on the issue of members' records and correspondence for the staff of members. I thank the House. ",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I would like to commence my discussion of the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2003 by talking for a few moments about the ministerial reshuffle that was announced last week, which saw the appointment of a new Minister for Family and Community Services who was sworn in today. Two years ago the Prime Minister gave a speech setting out his third term priorities. He said he did not aspire to an Australia where our growing wealth was built at the expense of families and communities. He said welfare reform was a central platform for this third term. Just a month before the 2001 election, the Prime Minister told those attending an ACOSS conference:
I know the welfare sector is particularly anxious about the effect of welfare reform on the most vulnerable in our community. In response to that very natural concern, I want to re-state the assurances I have previously given...nobody's benefit will be cut as a result of changes to the social security system.
Another ironclad guarantee. Today it is plain to see that the Prime Minister has failed to deliver on this promise.
His former Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, failed to reform the government's flawed family payments rules which have seen almost one million families hit with more than $1 billion of debt over just two years—an enormous clawback from that compensation package that the government produced when it put forward the new taxation system, which it brags about in this House. That is about half of the $2 billion the government claimed as an increase in family payments. The government has failed to deliver on paid maternity leave for Australian families—something it promised before the election and something which it talked about constantly after the election. The Prime Minister says the issue of work and families is a `barbeque stopper'. We get talk, talk and talk and no action. 
The Prime Minister and the former Minister for Family and Community Services failed to address the punishing effective marginal tax rates that are hitting families who work overtime and those trying to move from welfare to work. We have seen the Prime Minister's department confirm the figures that the opposition has been putting forward in this House for the past 12 months; that is, that there are nearly one million families, many of them earning between $30,000 and $60,000 a year, that are paying effective marginal tax rates of 60c in every additional dollar they earn when they work overtime or when they work intermittently. And that is before you come to the punishing effective marginal tax rates that are flogging people trying to move from welfare to work, where people are losing as much as 80c and 90c in every additional dollar that they earn from working casually—working an extra hour or so.
How is it that the government can construct a system such as this which punishes those who work hard? I thought the objective of everyone in this House was to ensure that people who work hard get fairly rewarded for that work. The government has created a debt trap in the family payments system and a punishing tax trap in the interaction of the welfare system and the income tax system. The government has not lived up to its promise before the election. It has failed to protect the social safety net.
We have seen additional measures come in which have become more readily apparent in the last six months, where the government has cut huge holes in the social security system. Perhaps the nastiest of these is the removal of the carer's payment from 30,000 families caring for disabled children or children who have chronic illnesses. The minister tried to create the impression that the government had backtracked after there was public outrage at this, but the truth is that the plans to remove that payment from the 30,000 families are proceeding and those families out there are suffering. So we have seen those attempts to cut holes in the social safety net as well as the problems in the family payments system and the tax system. What we have had is an attack on the living standards and the adequacy of payments of many people in the system, and we have seen the mess that is the family payments system.
The person the Prime Minister today swore in, supposedly to fix the system, is the person who has just plundered the Medicare system. This is the person who has presided over dramatic drops in the rates of bulk-billing, which have put the same families I was talking about before under tremendous financial pressure. Senator Patterson, who was regarded by many in the community, including groups like the Private Hospitals Association, as being inept and whose policy failures were exposed in this House today in the previous debate, has been elevated to a portfolio which is responsible for the expenditure of one-third of the national budget—$60 billion—for stuffing up the health portfolio. What could be more perverse than that?
How are we supposed to have any confidence that someone whose principal task has been to put the wrecking ball through Medicare is going to come into the Family and Community Services portfolio and do something about a family payments system that delivers debt to one in three families in the country? How is anyone supposed to have any faith in that? The notion that this is some form of promotion only exposes the outrageous arrogance of this government—the arrogance of this government to think that it could spin Senator Patterson's appointment to Family and Community Services as some sideways move or promotion. So now we have Senator Patterson let loose on the Family and Community Services portfolio. 
I hope that the Prime Minister's claim that Senator Patterson will have greater sensitivity in the families job is true—I really do. These matters that I have spoken about do need to be fixed. It is certainly true that it would not be hard to have greater sensitivity than Senator Vanstone. Senator Vanstone is someone who went on A Current Affair and said she was prepared to sell the homes of pensioners who had been overpaid through no fault of their own over a period of time when the reason they were overpaid was that Senator Vanstone had not been checking the accuracy of their payments. This is a person who went on television and said she would be prepared to sell their homes. It will not be hard for Senator Patterson to show more compassion than Senator Vanstone. But what is needed is some lateral thought. What is needed is a root and branch reform of many aspects of Family and Community Services.
I am sure that we all have grave fears that Senator Patterson will not be up to this task, particularly when you look at one of the last decisions that she took when she was in the health portfolio. Her last decision was to introduce the user-pays principle to child immunisation. Families with young kids will now have to fork out $500 to immunise their children against chicken pox. That is on top of the massive decline in bulk-billing, which is slugging families every time their kids are sick. In my view, putting Senator Patterson into families is a bit like putting a doctor who has just lost a patient through negligence in charge of the grieving family. Nevertheless, we will be keeping her accountable and we will be continuing to push for vital reform.
This bill, like most others put forward by this government, has few beneficial or sensible changes. But as always there is something nasty. In this instance, it is in the form of a proposal to halve the portability provisions in the Social Security Act which enable pensioners to undertake short overseas trips to visit sick or dying relatives. And there are also plenty of missed opportunities in this bill. I first of all want to talk about one of those real missed opportunities, which is the subject of our second reading amendment. I will go through that amendment before I continue. It reads:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns:
(1)	the Government's attempt to reduce the generosity of portability rules that assist people on social security benefits to attend to family commitments overseas; and
(2)	the Government's failure to strengthen debt recovery rules to prevent Centrelink pressur-ing the aged and disabled to mortgage or sell their homes or use credit cards to recover debts that have arisen because of adminis-trative errors rather than a deliberate attempt to defraud the Commonwealth.
I want to deal with the second one of those, because it is in this area of debt recovery that Senator Patterson really does need to act.
In the debt recovery measures contained in this bill today there is nothing to address the government's increasingly unscrupulous and aggressive debt collection practices at the expense of aged and disabled Australians. The existing legislation does not afford pensioners who have incurred a debt as a result of a genuine mistake or bureaucratic bungling sufficient protection against aggressive debt collection by government agencies. This was not more obvious than when just one month ago aged and disabled pensioners began phoning and writing to parliamentarians because they were receiving bills ranging from a few hundred dollars to $50,000 from Centrelink. Many of these pensioners have told stories of bullying and threats from government debt collector teams. The debts have come about because of a new government budget program to review the past financial records of 43,000 pensioners each year to search for discrepancies. The government hopes to collect $100 million from aged and infirm Australians. 
This is part of a larger program that will see around 344,000 aged and disabled pensioners and students targeted with debts for inaccurate payments made during the last seven years which have never been crosschecked by the government. They have arisen because the government has not had checks in place. And because the government has not had checks in place most of these people were unaware that the debt was accumulating. In the case of pensioners, there have been no checks in place. This is stunning when it is measured against the rhetoric of the government about how tough it is on compliance. It has not been tough on compliance and because it has not been tough on compliance overpayments have been occurring. Now the government is seeking to recover much of this money in a brutal way.
What we now have is a trifecta. Not only have the government been out there getting stuck into parents of disabled and chronically ill children, they have been out there getting stuck into pensioners. And the latest area in which they have been moving is in the area of youth allowance, where they are going back four years because they have not been checking. We have a hit list trifecta of students, parents and pensioners out there at the moment. That is certainly going to require some attention from the new minister.
These people are not welfare fraudsters. They are generally people who have in most cases dutifully provided Centrelink with a constant diet of payslips and other paperwork. They are trying to do the right thing but they have been tripped up in most cases because Centrelink has failed to properly advise them or record their information. It may not have occurred if this government was actually doing what it claimed it was doing in relation to social security compliance.
In every case my office has examined, any of the pensioners who have had additional earnings have lodged those earnings each and every year. But this government has not been running the checks between the tax system on the one hand and the social security system on the other to pick up discrepancies before they get out of hand. And that is what has happened: the discrepancies have got right out of hand. That is why we have ended up in the situation where so many pensioners have been caught in this government's pretty brutal attempt to recoup these moneys. That is when Senator Vanstone really let the public face of this government show—when she said she would be prepared to sell their homes.
If Senator Patterson is genuine about changing the way her debt collectors go about their work she will support amendments in the Senate to ensure the life savings and the homes of pensioners who have played by the rules are not stripped away and that where the overpayment is due to an error by Centrelink and payments were received in good faith the law requires that it be waived—no ifs or buts. Where an overpayment has been made due to an unintended lapse by a pension recipient the government ought to adopt a far fairer approach to recovering the debt. 
It is simply irresponsible that aged pensioners should be asked to mortgage their homes or use credit cards, with the interest rates that are attached, to settle their debts. Just another extraordinary thing that the government is up to is advising people who are caught in the family payments debt trap or who are caught in these arrangements that they pay debts off on their credit cards. No responsible financial counsellor in the country would be prepared to advise people to do that, but that is what this government is doing. You can see that advice on Senator Patterson's web site—or maybe it has been deleted in the last six hours; let us hope it has. These people, particularly the pensioners, deserve to live out their retirement years with respect and dignity and to not be regarded as criminals and treated as such and to suffer the brutal, thuggish approach that has been occurring with debt recovery.
I now move to the specific provisions of this bill relating to portability. The measure within this legislation that concerns the opposition is the plan to limit the generosity of the portability provisions relating to work force age social security payments. In particular, this bill seeks to reduce the allowable period of temporary overseas absence for portable social security payments from 26 weeks to 13 weeks. This new portability period will also apply to a range of payments, including the disability support pension and family tax benefit. Labor is particularly concerned about the impact of this measure on some of our larger communities that have a heritage overseas. This includes former UK citizens and also the Greek community.
There are good reasons why the portability provisions should be 26 weeks and not 13. Many families who have parents or siblings living overseas are called upon to go to their aid when they get sick or are dying. In some cases this may involve finalising a person's estate. Often there is a need for a person to spend considerable time overseas. There has never been any evidence presented that shows the current rules have been abused. In fact, the net savings the government is claiming for this provision amount to $4.1 million, and I think they confirm the fact that the government also does not believe that the rules have been abused. These are mean changes that will have a direct impact on people who have loved ones in other countries and they are changes which we will be urging Senator Patterson to join with us in rejecting when this bill reaches the Senate.
There are a range of other measures contained in this bill which by and large are either beneficial or represent improvements to the way the social security system and the child support scheme are administered. The extension of income exclusion rules that currently relate to German and Austrian compensation payments for persecution is particularly welcome. Enabling the Child Support Agency access to AUSTRAC data—a privilege that was removed when the organisation moved out of the Treasury portfolio—is also positive. We also will be supporting the proposed changes to the administration of the assurance of support scheme.
This legislation provides further evidence, if any were needed, that the Howard government has run out of steam. There is some housekeeping and there are savings, and there is some meanness, but most of all there is nothing that indicates that the government has a vision of a better social security system or a better life for people who currently rely on social security payments. Some people have questioned why the Labor Party would want to conduct an inquiry into poverty and financial disadvantage at a time of seemingly unparalleled economic prosperity. This sort of complacency I think has affected the Howard government and its ministers. The fact is that, as a nation, we are on the verge of undoing the sense of a fair go that has underpinned our social security system for nearly 100 years. It is true that we have become a far wealthier community in the last decade. In fact, I think wealth in this community has increased by over 100 per cent in that time. The fact is that we are not sharing it as fairly as we used to and there is a growing gap between those at the top, who are doing very well, those in the middle, who are being squeezed, and the poor, who are falling further behind. 
Many in our community feel in their bones the approaching chill of their country slowly—bit by bit—being turned into a place they do not recognise and certainly not the place they were born in. They do not want to wake up one day and find themselves strangers in their own country with a huge chasm between a few at the top, many struggling in the middle and many more left behind. That is why over the course of the past 12 months and through the hearings that have crisscrossed the country the Labor Party, through Senator Steve Hutchins, and members of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee have been collecting evidence and ideas in an effort to make sure that inequality and prejudice do not overtake opportunity and fairness as core Australian values.
The experience of their inquiries to date is a sobering one. The stories of the new poor in Australia and the working poor, the stories of kids going to school hungry or not at all, the stories of families forgoing visits to the GP for want of money—these are stories that lie behind the bald figures: 2.4 million Australians impoverished and around a million of those with some form of work but not necessarily a fair day's pay. The message on the street is that battling Australians face multiple barriers to opportunity. We need a range of responses that enable them to move forward. That is why it is disappointing to come into this House and find yet another piece of legislation devoid of any longer term social policy solutions.
Early in this term the government claimed they were compassionate conservatives. What we have seen in practice are not compassionate conservatives but cold-hearted conservatives. When you look at the measures that have been taken against parents of disabled or chronically ill children, when you look at the approach to aged pensioners and when you look at what is happening to students on youth allowance you see that fact time and again. This whole practice of trying to paint themselves as putting forward a social coalition of compassionate conservatives has simply been stripped bare by the actions of this government and the Family and Community Services portfolio over the last couple of years. All of that rhetoric is just about putting the `con' back into conservatism. That is what it has been all about and it has been laid bare by the practices of Minister Vanstone, which is why Minister Patterson now has such substantial challenges before her.
Where are the promised welfare reforms which would reward work over welfare? Where are the incentives to help people move from welfare to work? It is just a travesty that through this most recent period of strong economic growth the number of people on long-term benefits has increased in the last seven years. It is a damning figure, as are the figures on the number of children living in jobless households and as indeed are the figures on people living in poverty. As we near the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty there is absolutely no indication that the Howard government views social policy in any terms other than as a vehicle for making savings. It does not see it as essential to the heart of this country, to its soul and to that ethos of a fair go that it claims to believe in. 
I believe that probably the most urgent task in our community is to conduct a crusade against growing poverty in our community and to create the conditions for growing opportunity in our community. To do that, we must concentrate on preserving and expanding the core universal institutions in our community that deliver opportunities. What are they? They are access to affordable health care, they are access to educational opportunities, they are access to housing opportunities and they are access to a decent social safety net. So we must fight to preserve the social safety net to serve those who are out of work, sick or disabled. We need to give them a helping hand. We need to recognise the hard work of the great bulk of these people in the community, people who have created that 100 per cent increase in wealth in our community in the last decade, and give them a fairer share.
The bill we are debating today is part of portfolio budget cuts totalling more than $600 million. It gives a little, and it tries to take a lot more. We can support the small improvements while lamenting the absence of real reforms, but we will not support further mutilation of the social safety net. That is why I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns:
(1)	the Government's attempt to reduce the generosity of portability rules that assist people on social security benefits to attend to family commitments overseas; and
(2)	the Government's failure to strengthen debt recovery rules to prevent Centrelink pressur-ing the aged and disabled to mortgage or sell their homes or use credit cards to recover debts that have arisen because of adminis-trative errors rather than a deliberate attempt to defraud the Commonwealth.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2003-10-07,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, if I may, I would like to congratulate Senator Kay Patterson on her assumption of new duties as Minister for Family and Community Services. I might also congratulate the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister assisting the Prime Minister, who is at the table, on the assumption of his new duties. He will discharge them very well. Senator Patterson is a person with a very strong social conscience. I have known her for some years now, and I know that she will bring to this portfolio the compassion, understanding and policy foresight needed in a portfolio that has such a large budgetary expenditure.
Something many people in Australia do not realise is that this particular portfolio spends, in pensions and income supports, more than $1,000 million a week, which is an awful lot of money, in looking after those who are least able to look after themselves. I heard comments in the parliament this afternoon that the government does not look after these sorts of people—well, $1,000 million a week is not a bad expenditure in this portfolio area. It is money that is increasing week after week and year after year, and the government is determined to always support people who cannot look after themselves and who need assistance from the government.
I was intrigued by the member for Lilley's comments about `Where are the incentives to move from welfare to work?' I would like to report to the parliament that, in this portfolio, last week I took the trouble to go and visit all of the Job Network agencies in my electorate in Townsville and Thuringowa. 
—How many have you got?
—I have got six. We have got job placement agencies as well. The interest was the number of jobs that are out there and available. In relation to the incentives to move from welfare to work, the Job Network and Centrelink have been asking job seekers to come in and update their vocational profiles, and something like half of them have not been going in. When you talk to the Job Network members, you find that they are desperate. They say, `If these people would only come in, we've got jobs for them.' They took me and they showed me their job boards, and there was job after job after job, ranging from the most menial, unskilled work right through to management, senior management, team leader type work. It is such a pity that the government has these incentives where we will pay job seekers to come in and have their vocational profiles updated, where we will give them whatever assistance they need to find a job—and, these days, things are very flexible for Job Network providers—but they will not come in in the first place.
Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know which group of people are the most unlikely to attend? It is the 16- to 18-year-olds. Why is it that their parents do not say to these kids, `Get off your backside. Get in there. We'll get you a job. We don't want you to be welfare dependent for the rest of your life'? I appeal to parents: if you have got a job seeker in that age group, get them into the local Job Network provider, and they will get a job.
I now want to address a number of matters in relation to the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2003. I utterly reject the claims from the opposition that this is somehow a brutal and thuggish approach. It is nothing of the sort. It is sensible legislation that in fact protects not only those in receipt of government welfare support but also the Australian taxpayer. After all, it is the taxpayer who foots the bill. The government has got to be careful about how it spends taxpayers' money. It has got to make sure that those who are entitled to receive assistance receive proper and adequate assistance, but it has also got to ensure that money that should not be spent is not spent. Some of the amendments contained in this legislation before us this afternoon do exactly that. There are some technical amendments. There are some amendments that are very specific. They are designed to make sure that we spend taxpayers' money wisely and well.
Labor continue to say that we should not be putting through these amendments, that we should be spending the extra money. They then accuse this government of being the highest-taxing government ever, which is not the case.
—It's not? It's a fact, an incontestable fact.
—Labor say that we should be spending more, and they also say that the government has to be careful of taxpayers' money.
—If the member for Hunter wished to speak, he should have reserved his right.
—The mixed messages that float around when this occurs are just amazing, and they should not be floating around. I will now just add a personal view on a matter. The particular matter is contained in an amendment to this bill where it talks about recovering debts that have arisen because of administrative errors. I have a personal view on this and I have some sympathy in relation to this particular matter. If a private business makes a mistake with a customer, it does not go back to the customer years later and say, `Gosh, we made a mistake; we want our money back.' It is the last thing that it would do. If a business makes a mistake, it wears the mistake. I know that legislation has gone through the parliament that deals with administrative errors and the question of whether organisations, such as Centrelink, are able to write off particular mistakes or whether they have to seek to recover them. 
I came across an issue in Townsville last week which I thought was most unfair. For something like six years a carer had been clearly caring for their mum and dad and also their disabled brother. They all lived in the one house on the one piece of land, but they all had individual units in this one house and there were no connecting doors. Under the rules of Centrelink, you are not a carer in the sense of receiving a carer's pension, or having the ability to receive one, unless you live on the premises. The problem was that, in truth, the carer did live on the premises but there were no connecting doors. The carer fully disclosed this situation to Centrelink at the time of asking for a carer's payment, and the carer's payment was approved. Several years later Centrelink came back and said to that particular carer: `You weren't entitled to that payment. We've made an overpayment; we would like you to pay back $8,000, please.' I reckon that is very unfortunate. I know it is the rules and I know that Centrelink made a mistake in the first place, but, equally so, I believe that Centrelink have a responsibility not to seek the recovery of that particular debt, that style of debt, when they made the mistake in the first place.
—You passed the legislation.
—The member for Shortland will have an opportunity in a second.
—Turning to the bill itself and not the amendment, I do not think there is any argument in relation to the point about compensation payments made by Germany and Austria being excluded from the social security and veterans' entitlement income test. I think that that is perfectly reasonable, and this bill will exclude any such payment from the income test, regardless of the country making it. Ex gratia payments are being made now in anticipation of the legislation being passed, so I hope that it does in fact go through the parliament. This measure is just to update the current policy on income treatment of Holocaust payments.
Another matter that the bill deals with is in relation to targeting social security fraud, particularly where people use the cash economy and false identities to evade detection. I do not think anybody could argue with that. I think the government have a responsibility and a right to make sure that we detect fraud in any way that we can lawfully do so, and this particular measure gives us the legal teeth to do that. It will allow limited access to newly available sources of data on taxation and financial transaction activities to combat this fraud. These sorts of data-matching operations are now getting quite sophisticated and they are working very well. I think the taxpayer will applaud the government for making sure that we are catching any person who attempts to use the cash economy or a false identity to evade detection. I can say—and I checked this when I was reviewing the legislation—that this legislation has been drafted in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. The Information Law Branch of the Attorney-General's Department has been involved and so has AUSTRAC, the privacy advisory group. I also understand that the Child Support Agency will resume access to financial transaction information from AUSTRAC as well. 
I said that I would speak for only 10 minutes, so I would just like to conclude—and allow the member for Shortland to speak—by paying tribute to the men and women in Centrelink in Townsville and Thuringowa. We have three offices in Townsville and Thuringowa. They are all staffed by the most wonderful people. They really look after my office. They really look after our customers and theirs, and they do everything they can to update the way they give exceptional customer service. I want to thank the men and women in Centrelink in Townsville and Thuringowa for the very great work they do on behalf of the Australian government and for their customers.",REPS,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2003 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I will start where the member for Herbert ended by acknowledging the fine work that the Centrelink staff do within my electorate. They work under appalling conditions. They have had enormous staff reductions, and they are being asked to do more and more with fewer resources. I recognise how difficult it is for the staff of Centrelink, and I call on the government to also recognise the difficult task that Centrelink have and ensure that they have an adequate number of staff working for them and adequate resources and training. The member for Herbert was right when he acknowledged the fine work done by Centrelink staff. The member for Herbert spoke about a constituent who has incurred quite a debt—I think he said that it was $8,000—and how that should not be and that it was an administrative error. I would like to remind the member for Herbert that it was Howard government legislation that implemented that power to recoup debts that were caused by administrative errors of Centrelink staff. If he feels so strongly about it, he should be bringing it up within the party room and seeing if he can do something to remedy the situation, because I, like him, have many constituents who have had that problem, and I will detail that a little bit later in my speech.
The Howard government is a harsh and mean-spirited government, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the areas of Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs. This government has a philosophy of demonising and attacking those people who look to their government for support and a little extra assistance and understanding when they need it most. These departments are supposed to deliver that support to these people. Rather than assisting Australians, the Howard government is forcing them to jump through hoops and is enforcing a harsh debt recovery regime, just like the one the member for Herbert was talking about.
The Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2003 is an omnibus bill which gives effect to most of the 2003 budget measures in the areas of Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs. Some of the changes and some parts of this bill are quite uncontroversial; others will cause a lot more problems for people in Australia. One of the non-controversial areas is that payments made for persecution by the National Socialists—that is, payments made under the laws of Germany and Austria—are going to be excluded from the definition of income under the social security and veterans' income tests. This is a good change which we on this side of the House believe is worthy of support.
Another change is the single point of contact for people migrating to Australia. Once again, this is quite a good reform, or change, but it is interesting that the government's purpose with this change is to save money, not to provide a better service. I think it is good because it will provide more information to people and make that information easier to access, but the government is doing it because it will save some money. 
I am a bit worried about the amendment to strengthen the arrangements for ceasing payments to people who travel overseas and forget to notify of their departure before they go. I think it is beholden on people to notify the department if they are going overseas but I think we must be careful how that is implemented.
I would now like to turn to and concentrate on access to information by Centrelink, deal with what the member for Herbert referred to as an overpayment, and talk about how social security fraud is something that we in this parliament should absolutely oppose. None of us on this side of the House would in any way condone fraud, but what concerns me is what the member for Herbert was talking about: the data-matching arrangements that have come into place, how effective they are, how the technology has improved and will ensure that the right information is processed and received, and how this is a way of ensuring that fraud does not occur. What I would say to the member for Herbert, and to the government, is that this can have some very adverse effects; it is not quite as foolproof as he would like us to believe.
As recently as last Friday, a constituent from Caves Beach in my electorate came to visit me on behalf of her son who works in Sydney five days a week in a full-time position. He did work at BHP, but when BHP closed he had difficulty securing a new job. Initially he was working with labour hire firms within the Hunter area but was unable to secure a full-time job. All the time he worked with the labour hire companies, he provided information to Centrelink that was absolutely accurate. I have never seen anyone record their information to the extent this gentleman did. He had an exercise book in which he recorded every payment he had received while doing his casual or contract work—the kind of work that is available in the Hunter since this government moved to deregulate the labour market and increase the casualisation of the work force.
When this gentleman went to Sydney and started doing more regular casual work, once again he was at all times informing Centrelink of his employment details and the income he received. He informed Centrelink on 23 October 2000 that he had obtained full-time work, and he received no more payments from Centrelink. But on 10 July this year he received a bill for nearly $3,000. I had to put my arms around his mother on Friday as she stood in my office crying and telling me that her son was one of those people who were meticulous about always doing the right thing. She said: `I have brought him up to do the right thing, and he would never mislead Centrelink. He would always tell the truth.'
My office investigated this a bit more. We found that there has been some data matching—data has been matched with the tax office. They looked at his yearly income and said that, based on that yearly income, he has not declared all the money he has earned. What they have failed to recognise is that he was unemployed for part of the year and employed for part of the year. Centrelink were quite free in admitting to my office today that there has probably just been a mistake with the data matching—they have some problems with it and it is not accurate at this particular time. What I would say to the government is: if they are going to implement a system which is inaccurate and causes constituents to come to my office and cry because they are so upset and be frightened to go to Centrelink to put forward their case, I think there is something wrong. There is something very wrong with a system that is causing so much distress to so many people. That lady is not the only person who has been to my office. I will touch on that a little more as I go along. 
A number of people have come to my office and talked about the problems they have had with debts. It is interesting to know that the 2003-04 budget contained more than $6 million in funding cuts to the Family and Community Services portfolio. On the one hand, Centrelink are being asked undertake these tasks—to go through data with their debt recovery teams and pursue pensioners, the unemployed and people who are really disadvantaged and to undertake this data-matching procedure which, as I have demonstrated here, is not always accurate and needs some finetuning. On the other hand, this government is ripping all that money out of Centrelink's budget. That is going to affect their ability to deliver the services that Australians need when they go to their Centrelink office.
I thought it would probably be an appropriate time to go through the problems of a few more people who have come to visit me. One of them is a gentleman who lives in Windale, which is quite a disadvantaged area. He is a veteran on a TPI pension and his wife is on a veterans partner allowance. That is absolutely the only income they have received. Yet, earlier this year, they received a letter from Centrelink telling them that they had a $1,300 debt resulting from an overpayment. We followed it up with Centrelink and it appears that this occurred because there had been an administrative error. Now this man and his wife, who live from one pay to the other, are going to be asked to try and find the money to repay a debt that was caused through no fault of their own. They did nothing wrong, yet now they are being penalised.
This really concerns me. If you are a person with very limited finances—if you live from one pay period to another—you cannot afford to have a debt like this. You cannot afford to be asked to repay something when you already have very little to live on. Another constituent, who lives in Belmont North—another area within the Shortland electorate—received a letter about a debt of $700. There were problems transferring from the parenting payment to Newstart and, once again, an administrative error was made. Now they are being asked to repay $10 a week. This couple are really struggling. They have other debts that they are trying to repay. Yet, out of their limited budget, they are being asked to find that money. It means that their children are unable to go on school excursions, which stigmatises them. It really does create enormous pressure.
Another couple in my electorate very recently received a letter about two debts, one going back to 2001 and one in 2003. Out of the blue, they received a letter telling them that they owe $3,136 to Centrelink. When you look into it—guess what—you find it was another administrative error. Once, this would not have been a problem. Once, these people, just like the constituents of the member for Herbert, would not have been saddled with these enormous debts—years after they have occurred, in some cases. It is because of this government and this government's legislation that they are now suffering.
Another bill I have before me belongs to another constituent—it is for $2,600. She is another single parent, and it is a very sad case. She is receiving Abstudy. Her son had a serious head injury and she had to suspend her studies. She was immediately asked to repay all her Abstudy. This is a lady who is having trouble just surviving and coping with her very ill son. Another couple received a bill for $22,000, going back 10 years. What do these people do? They come and see their local members, and they expect us to be able to help them. We try very hard, but, unfortunately, this very mean-spirited government has made it extremely difficult for us to give them the kind of assistance that we would like to be able to give them. 
This is a government that thrives on division, one that has refined and made an art of blaming the victims in our society, the people who rely on the government to provide them with assistance and security. It thrives on developing a culture of envy, a society of haves and have-nots. It is interesting to look at recent figures. The Sydney Morning Herald had an article earlier this year, on 2 June, entitled `Generation $ stretching the poverty gap'. This article identified that, while 20 per cent of wealthy Australians control more than 50 per cent of Australia's wealth, the poorest 20 per cent of Australians control only one per cent of Australia's wealth. That means that 20 per cent of Australians are living in abject poverty. 
In a country like Australia I really do not think we can accept that, and I do not think that this government has ever tried to address that. Australia has become a society where Australians are ostracised for being disadvantaged, and the number of Australians that are disadvantaged is increasing. I have many other figures that I could quote that show that the number of people that are extremely disadvantaged in our society has increased enormously under this government. But, whilst the government is making it harder for people that look to it for support when things are not going well for them, the government rewards its friends in big business. The government sits on its hands and allows CEOs' salaries to skyrocket whilst it pursues pensioners and families and people that are unemployed to repay debts which, in a significant number of cases—as I have demonstrated—have occurred through administrative errors. 
This is a government that is prepared to allow Ziggy Switkowski to be paid a $7 million salary based on financial performance—not even based on service performance—whilst trying to force pensioners, people that are unemployed and families to mortgage their houses, take out personal loans or use credit cards to pay Centrelink debts. This is possibly the harshest government in Australia's history. It creates hardship; it attacks those Australians who are struggling to survive. It takes from the poor and it gives to the rich. The Howard government is mean spirited and its mean spiritedness is reflected in this legislation. This government stands condemned for its attack on ordinary and disadvantaged Australians.",REPS,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2003 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—This is one of the most important debates we could be having in this parliamentary term. From the fact that you have participated in this debate, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, I think you would be well aware of how important it is. I certainly would not agree with your sentiments in some of the areas that you raised, but the fact that you were one of the very few members of the government willing to enter into this debate illustrates how important you believe it is. It is a very important debate because it is about the way in which government takes care of people in need. It is about the way in which the government derives a system that is fair and balanced and effective, both in terms of—as you have said—the responsibilities the government has to the taxpayers of this country and the responsibility that all governments have towards those people in need of care and assistance. 
Getting that balance right is not necessarily easy; however, I think the government has fundamentally got it wrong in many areas, and I would like to draw the House's attention to those deficiencies within government policy and implementation. The Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2003 is an omnibus bill and it goes to many areas. I have no problem with some of the areas to which it refers, and neither does the opposition in general. There are some issues which are non-controversial and are supported by the opposition. Amongst those—and it was referred to by the member for Shortland—is the issue of payments made under the laws of Germany or Austria for those persecuted under what is now referred to as National Socialist persecution from income. Another non-controversial issue is the assurances of support provision—that is, where the bill seeks to make amendments to improve the operation of the assurance of support scheme and simplify arrangements for people who provide an assurance of support. Again, I do not think that is an area of great controversy and I think it can be supported. 
There is also of course the stopping of payment to people absent from Australia without notice, and comparable foreign payment debt recovery. This bill seeks to make amendments to strengthen the arrangements for ceasing payments to people travelling overseas who do not notify of their departure. Under the new rules, as I understand it, there would be the capacity to suspend payment where a person leaves Australia without notifying of their departure and where the secretary of FaCS finds out about the departure before the end of the person's portability period. Again, this is an area which should actually reap some savings and it is not something that I would rise to oppose.
Another area which is not controversial but which is very important is where the bill seeks to restore access by the Child Support Agency to financial transaction information held by the AUSTRAC database. It bewilders me that the agency could have lost this access, as it did in 1998 when it ceased to be part of the Australian Taxation Office and therefore ceased to be part of the administrative arrangements of the Taxation Office. That has meant that the Child Support Agency has been doing without information that is absolutely vital to it undertaking its responsibilities. It is a deficiency that has resulted from decisions by this government. The government is now seeking to make amends belatedly. I support those late amendments to the system with respect to Child Support Agency information access, and I think all members on this side would.
The issue of where the Child Support Agency links up with the family tax benefit is a very important one. There have certainly been concerns in my electorate about the way in which people are asked to repay debts that they have accumulated based on calculations of their income where it has been assumed that child support payments have been made to them when they have made it very clear to the department that no payments have been made. I draw the attention of the House to an example from my electorate: a constituent of mine who at the moment is a single mother and custodian of her child. The father of the child is no longer residing with them; he is no longer a custodial parent. He is obliged under the law to pay child support, as he should, and to help with the care of the child. For over two years he has not paid child support, and the agencies have not been able to have him comply. However, what is most concerning to me in relation to this debate and the broader debate about the way in which the family tax benefit operates is that the mother has made it very clear to the department that, whilst the father owes that amount, she has not been in receipt of it, but the department determines her income on the assumption that she has been in receipt of that payment.
I find that an absolutely unconscionable approach by a department to seek arrears from a woman who is doing it tough as a single parent, looking after her child and not being provided with moneys that are legally owed to her. The department is well aware that the moneys have not been paid to her, but it still calculates the family tax benefit payment as though it were part of her income. I cannot believe that any government would support the outcome that I have outlined, so I am hoping it is a glitch or a deficiency in the implementation of the process. The government and the department should seek to rectify that anomaly if it is occurring throughout the country—and, from discussions with other members, I believe it is. It is certainly something that I am seeking to resolve for my constituent who is now loaded up with a debt based on a figure of income that she is not in receipt of because the childcare payments are not being paid to her. 
The fact that the Child Support Agency is gaining access to information is good. It rectifies what has been a deficiency of this government for five years in allowing it to break in the first place. I commend that provision of this omnibus bill. However, there has to be a further correction in relation to the relationship between the Child Support Agency and the department whereby income is being calculated including a child support amount when it is not being paid to the recipient—the custodial parent. That is something that should be addressed by this government and the department. I draw this House's attention to that and I hope the government listens to my concerns in relation to that.
Apart from the major problem I have with the way in which this woman—this single parent—has been treated, in the issues I have raised there are some things that we can support, but there are some critical problems about the way in which this government would like to set about recovering payment. This is a very difficult issue too. I do not for a moment think that it is easy to resolve these issues, but the assumption should not be that you seek to remove or go after people's assets in the first instance, particularly when there has been no intent by the recipient of a benefit to in any way defraud the department—and therefore the public—nor should there be an immediate attack upon or threat to sequester the assets of people who have been overpaid if indeed the errors or overpayments have been due to miscalculations by the department or the fact that there are some deficiencies in the information that the department has.
It appears to me that it is almost assumed that when there has been an overpayment it is the result of an intention of the recipient to defraud the Commonwealth. Therefore not only does the money have to be sought and recovered but there has to be some almost punitive dimension to the recovery. There has to be a greater effort made by this government to work out ways that can mitigate the adverse social impacts of having to pay back or return moneys where there has been a genuine overpayment by the Commonwealth.
I take the point you made when speaking on this matter, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, about trying to find a balance between the responsibilities to the taxpayer and to the recipients of family tax benefit payments, but we should not be trying to insert a punitive dimension to recovering money from people who are innocent of any bad faith or motive in terms of an overpayment. This is a system that has some serious deficiencies. I do not think blaming the recipients of family tax benefit overpayments is the way to rectify any problems in the system. There has to be a greater balance. There has to be a capacity to mitigate the problems that will arise from repaying moneys, particularly for people on very low incomes or people who have very small asset bases—which, of course, would include many of the people that are in receipt of family tax benefit. 
This government has not demonstrated any sense of fairness or any concern for those people. I think it really is a shame because it could do a lot better. The concern I have is with the way this bill would go about correcting social security overpayments and failures to disclose incomes. The way the Centrelink debt recovery teams have been seeking to recover new large debts aggressively by threatening people with the remortgage of their homes, I think it was, and with the use of their credit cards to offset the debt are examples of people being forced into further debt. In other words, the debt that people may have with the government is being shifted to a credit card or to a bank, and that is not something that it is going to be very easy for them to recover from. It could in fact create further poverty traps within our community, and I think it has to be avoided wherever possible.
They are some of the concerns I have with this legislation. I have already commented upon those matters in this compendium of bills which I agree with. However, I think there is a more comprehensive matter in the whole area of the family tax benefit that really has not been properly addressed by this government, although it has been touched on by a number of people. I do not think that Senator Patterson has really been given any favours. She was sacked as the Minister for Health because she was not able to sell what was clearly a very bad health policy, and now she has been given the hospital pass of the day, or of the week, to try and fix up the problems in the family tax benefit area. In being given this area, she certainly will not think she is the favoured colleague of the Prime Minister's office, because clearly there are major problems with the system.
In effect, this government supports a family tax benefit system, as it stands, where parents on middle incomes pay an effective marginal tax rate of between 60 per cent and 77 per cent, and where, because of the allowances income test, an individual claiming Newstart who earns more than $62 in a fortnight pays an effective marginal tax rate of 67 per cent. In no way is this going to encourage people to re-enter the work force or provide any proper incentive for people to work. This government supports a system—again, due to the same allowances income test—whereby an individual claiming Newstart who earns more than $150 in a fortnight would be paying a marginal tax rate of 87 per cent. These figures are absolutely startling to anyone who was not aware of them. Effectively, people who are on the lowest rungs of our society, who are trying to get back into the work force, are paying more income tax than people on a quarter of a million dollars a year. That is a ludicrous situation if we are trying to assist people back into work.
I do recall the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, now the Minister for Health, about a year ago actually commenting on the problems with providing any incentives in the system and with the unfairness that arises as a result of these sorts of marginal tax rates. But he was effectively gagged by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and we have not heard any further comment from him nor from any of the frontbench members of the government in relation to this area. There are major problems in this area, and there are major inequities. The government is slugging the people who can least afford it and preventing them from having any incentive to get off parts of welfare where they can. It is something that has to be fundamentally tackled by this government, but to date we have seen very little energy or thought go into finding a system that is fair. 
In effect, week after week in this House we get family tax benefit legislation that tinkers around the edges. We had some a number of weeks ago which effectively improved the lot of people who had overcalculated their income, so that they can now take two years rather than one year to actually seek a return of their income. It was a minor improvement and it is certainly better than it was, but it still stands as very unfair when you compare it with the opposite situation—that is, the person who actually has to repay moneys and who has no two-year limit if the government wants to recover moneys from them. As we can see, there are things that the government is doing, but it is tinkering around the edges and looking to make tiny improvements. I have acknowledged in this debate, as I did in the debate on that bill, the extent of the doubling of the time. I did say that, while it is a small step in the right direction, the problem is that that is not the fundamental problem with the family tax benefit system. The problem with the family tax benefit system, fundamentally, if the government were to look at it seriously, is that it is inequitable in terms of who it hits the most. It provides no capacity and no genuine incentive for people to try to find a way out of poverty traps for themselves. This is a real problem that has to be addressed.
I have mentioned those quite extraordinarily high marginal tax rates, and I can mention a number of others. For example, due to the Youth Allowance with a combination of other tests, there are about 40,000 families that face effective marginal tax rates of over 100 per cent.
—It is 102 per cent.
—I think that is about right. So you have the situation where, if you go out to work, you had better bring 2c for each dollar you are looking to make. That is quite extraordinary. If you are making $5, you had better bring 10c because that is how much you will have to pay for the privilege of notionally earning $5. That is an extraordinary anomaly that has to be fixed, you would think, but it has not been fixed. It is something that really boggles the mind. I do not know how people can actually stand up and defend the family tax benefit system without laughing because it is so ludicrous. I suppose the one thing that should stop them from laughing is the effect of it—
—It is cruel.
—It is not funny, because it is a cruel system, as the member for Braddon suggests. It is a cruel system to expect people to actually go out and lose money because they are actually working. They are the fundamental issues that this government has to focus its mind on. I have acknowledged that there are some benefits in this bill, but there are some real deficiencies in the system as a whole. I have some real concerns. One thing about this area of policy is that all members in this House know about the problems, because we hear all the time at the electorate office about concerns about payment and recovery and the way in which they are implemented. So there are fundamental problems. At the heart of it there is the problem with the inequitable marginal tax rates and the inability of the government to find a policy that provides incentives for people to work, to get out of the poverty trap and get out of the system. That is something that the government should turn its mind to now to deliver a decent, fair and effective system.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I am happy to debate with my colleagues here, along broadly the same lines, our support for the general provisions of the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2003. But, as indicated by the shadow minister, particular areas of this bill are subject to Labor amendment here and, as has been foreshadowed, in the Senate. They are areas where we think the government provisions are unfair and would be imposed in a way which would cause significant harm and difficulty for those people who are least able to pay. This legislation is a conglomerate, a collection of a series of different proposals in the family and community services area and also in veterans' affairs. It covers a very wide range of matters. Much of it is non-controversial, and it is to the non-controversial parts of this bill that I want to go in the first instance. 
Almost all of these measures relate to measures foreshadowed in the 2003 budget. There is also a measure that harks back to 2001. There is a very small measure in the legislation, which we are supporting action on, with regard to the Child Support Agency—which originally had information available to it and has not had that information available for some time. This bill proposes that information from the AUSTRAC database, which takes account of tracking sums of money of more than $10,000 that are taken out of Australia in cash, be made available to the Child Support Agency. Because that database is controlled by the Australian Taxation Office—it is their responsibility; they have carriage of it—previously there was an absolute fit, because the information was available to the Child Support Agency as part of that department. However, in 1998 purely administrative changes were made. Since then there has been an uncoupling of that information.
Labor say that the government is quite right in determining in this legislation that information from the AUSTRAC database should be made available again to provide information about child support liabilities so that those individuals who have since 1998 sought to avoid their responsibilities can be brought to account through this mechanism. The indications from the government are that probably a fairly small amount of money is involved. But the question of principle is very important here. Closing an avenue where people might not have to sign up to their responsibilities is important. It is a clear and simple administrative measure to take, and we are supporting it.
The fundamental basis for that support goes back to the fact that the Child Support Agency was set up under Labor. Previously, many people were in a position where they chose not to continue to support their children after a marriage breakdown, even though they were capable of it. When Labor brought legislation into place to set up the Child Support Agency it was on the fundamental basis that once two people have children it is their responsibility as parents to look to the care and the future of those children and that, if a marriage dissolves, one or either of the partners should not be in a position to forgo the financial responsibility that was occasioned when they were a couple. Ensuring that the system works properly and well is fundamentally important. Making sure that there is no easy way for people to get out of their responsibility is necessary and important, and we support that.
Assurance of support is another relatively minor matter. It is a question of where it is best sought administratively. In my electorate office, over the years the bulk of our work has been with immigration cases and social security. We know those matters extremely well and understand the problems that people often have in dealing with assurances of support and in dealing with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and Centrelink. This bill properly proposes that the administration should be in one place: Centrelink. The opposition agrees that that is a reasonable and sensible thing to do. For people who have signed up for assurances of support, having the one agency to monitor all of that not only is sensible but also will help those people who have signed up in the first place. Dealing with different government departments can be difficult. In the city of Bankstown it has become more difficult now than it was in the past because this government closed down our immigration office—as they closed down our Taxation Office. In having to deal with two different departments, people have to travel to Parramatta or the city or other places in Sydney in order to transact their business with the department of immigration. It would therefore be a direct help to them to deal with Centrelink, because they can deal with them directly in Bankstown. 
In terms of providing consistent advice and getting the right outcome for people, this is an indication of where, in the two measures mentioned so far, doing things better administratively is important. It is usually very difficult to attain, but we want greater simplicity both for the agencies who are providing the services and for the people who are seeking to avail themselves of those services. We want it to be as simple and straightforward as possible. This is particularly the case, of course, where people have difficulty with English, where they have come to English as a second language, and where they have difficulty in dealing with the intricacies of bureaucratic procedures and approaches. Often in the countries that people have originally come from, the bureaucratic standards and approaches are not what we have in Australia—they are a great deal more lax, more casual and more open to misinterpretation. It comes hard for some people to deal directly with agencies, even though there are translation capacities available to people working in departments. Having one source of advice will be a boon in regard to the manner in which this proceeds.
Another relatively non-controversial matter is the question of people who go overseas for a short period of time. They build up a debt, which accrues whilst they are overseas. This bill attempts to change the social security debt recovery provisions to allow for the full recovery of overpayments that arise when a foreign pension payment is made as a lump sum in arrears. The amendments seek to enable the recovery from that person or the person's partner, and it is expected that all up, while the previous provision was expected to save about $11.2 million, the government expects to save about $14.8 million here. That is a question of tidying up the arrangements that were made and signifying that those sorts of things should be done.
The very first matter, dealt with at the beginning of this bill in schedule 1, is the question of excluding payments for national socialist persecution from income. Currently, the Social Security Act provides that, in terms of moneys provided to people under the laws of both Germany and Austria, people who have been subjected to persecution by national socialism or sectors of that do not have the income they get as compensation payments taken into account. I will talk about what the changes here propose to do—and it is an almost strange set of arrangements, in that the existing law pretty well has the whole situation covered, and those changes were made some years ago. The explanatory memorandum says that it is covered off, but what is being provided for is a series of potential possibilities that may not be completely provided for, and, if that income could possibly be taken into account as income for social security purposes, there is a series of ways in which that will not be taken into account. I have no great problem with it except that it is interesting that it has arisen in this way when the law itself, as it stands, has proven over a number of years to be successful. 
I am fully supportive of the regime that we currently have, given that, when I worked for the then Treasurer when he was the member for Blaxland, on his behalf I initiated the basic work which went into ensuring that people who received compensation payments because they had been persecuted by the Nazis—either because of the time they had spent in concentration camps such as Dachau or because they had been forced into slave labour in concentration camps or in factories—would be in a position where they would not lose out because the German and Austrian governments had finally determined to make restitution. It was the case that people used to have those amounts taken into account for both social security and taxation purposes. I argued with the then social security minister, as I put the case to the then Treasurer, that these cases were of such gravity and importance that, despite the restrictive nature and the bureaucratic cast of mind of our law makers, people who had suffered enormously—some to the point of almost having their own lives extinguished, as well as seeing the lives of members of their family, in some cases their parents and grandparents, extinguished—should not suffer further. They should not have to suffer the situation where, when finally some recompense—although not enough, because it never could be enough—was made to them to cover part of the damage that was done to them, there was an Australian set of bureaucratic arrangements which said, `You're getting income from overseas, therefore we'll take that income into account and we will knock down your pension,' or `We'll take this into account for taxable purposes.' It took quite a while because the bureaucratic cast of mind with this can be very strong. The argument was put that there were other people in similar circumstances who received compensation payments for this, that or whatever else and that you could not really extend the whole thing. Luckily the argument was finally won with the people who were responsible for this.
The second set of arrangements needed to be made later. The first set of arrangements was for people who had spent their time in concentration camps. The second set of arrangements where changes needed to be made and put into regulations was for people who had worked in labour camps or labour factories and had suffered. Some of them, at 15 years of age, had virtually served an apprenticeship, giving all their work from the age of 15 to 20 or so for national socialism rather than for themselves or for their country, and they had had taken away from them their future prospects of training in trades or professions and so on—that had been whipped away.
I understand that the particular changes that are being argued for here are being put in terms of what may happen. The payments are not only from Germany and Austria now; as the explanatory memorandum indicates, France, the Netherlands and Belgium have signed up to this as well. Given that they were occupied countries, there is some culpability there because people were taken from those countries to Germany or Poland and so on and made to work against their will.
This seems to be a set of provisions that covers whatever circumstances—for example, payments made by a national government or equivalent of any country or by the government or equivalent of any part of a country, such as a state or province, which is covered—if it is the law of a country or part of a country or it is the law applying in a country. My guess is that where a legalistic cast of mind is taken in the future, as there used to be in the past before I was able to assist in these changes being made, that should be covered off and we should ensure that that will not happen. For all of those people who suffered such degradation and were robbed of their youth and the joy of their lives, any legislation which does this is to be profoundly welcomed and I support it entirely. 
As you, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, would no doubt appreciate, I have found things in this bill that I cannot support in full. In fact, the shadow minister has covered those well in his presentation, as have my other colleagues. But I want to go to some of the particular problems. This is a question of a cast of mind where we do have controversial items—where Labor have said that, in particular cases, it is a question of how you go about things and the attitude that you have that can make all the difference.
People in difficult circumstances—and no matter how well some people might think people on pensions or benefits do get on, I know from the people in my electorate that they are in difficult circumstances—as well as those people who are in low-paid jobs are in situations where they cannot save all that much. We know that there has been case after case where people have been overpaid but where there has been no fraud or no intention of fraud on their part. Where you have a scheme of arrangement where people are allowed to pay back an overpayment over a period of time, attitude and approach are enormously important.
The opposition think that the provisions for how the government intends to pursue them—effectively putting the frighteners on people by putting very heavy-handed debt recovery teams into action—are inappropriate. Through the whole of our period in government and indeed the period up to now where people have had overpayments, questions need to be asked about not just the overpayments but how they arose in the first place.
One of the key problems of this set of specifications in this bill is the question of retrospective payments. Those retrospective payments go back about seven years. If the data matching between the Commonwealth and its agencies was inappropriate seven years ago and if seven years later someone is tagged and told, `You got too much then. Now we're going to make you pay it back with interest. You might have gone through that dough and it may be difficult but we want it back now,' and if it is in the hands of the debt collectors and there are demands that people either refinance, remortgage or sell their house or otherwise put themselves into real difficulty with credit card debt and so on, you have to ask just how viable and sensible that is as an approach.
Labor thinks you will actually do better out of people if you give them a reasonable run. We are not dealing here with people who have committed any intentional fraud whatsoever. It may be that they may have had income that was not taken into account because the data matching was not sufficient or not good enough or the government has changed the way it looks at how income comes to be. But it is also a question of how the approach can simply drive people further down and make their lives far too difficult.
In terms of our approach to this, we have said both here in this House and also in the Senate that given the nature of poverty in Australia, given the nature of circumstances of people and given the fact that the burden in a credit open and credit free society is growing—where the demands to do as others do and consume greatly is ever present and when virtually all the forces in society drive people towards that—belting people over the back of the hand if administrative errors are made by the departments is not the best way to go about things. If you make a reasonable and sensible set of arrangements with people for them to pay back within their capacity, that is a sensible and proper way to do it. You will probably get a lot better cooperation than driving people to the wall. 
In the second part of our amendment, we condemn:
	the Government's failure to strengthen debt recovery rules to prevent Centrelink pressur-ing the aged and disabled to mortgage or sell their homes or use credit cards to recover debts that have arisen because of adminis-trative errors rather than a deliberate attempt to defraud the Commonwealth.
We know that recovering debt is something that has to be done by the departments, but the whole general approach and attitude should be as human as it is in the first schedule, directed towards taking into full account people's circumstances, whether they are victims of National Socialist persecution or just ordinary Australians.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I rise to speak on the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2003 and to support the amendment moved by the member for Lilley. This is an omnibus bill that makes a number of technical amendments on issues ranging from Nazi holocaust payments to the child support agencies and data retrieval. As members would be aware, compensation payments to holocaust survivors from Germany and Austria are exempt when determining the social security and veterans entitlements income test. This bill seeks to change that to include all such payments regardless of the country of origin.
The change is largely symbolic because the estimate of the cost of this proposal is only a little over half a million dollars over the next four years. I note that there is a disallowable instrument before the Senate that exempts the pensions of mercy given by the Chilean government to survivors of the murderous regime of Augusto Pinochet from the social security income test, finally treating these payments the same way as the holocaust payments. Both the agreement with Chile and this bill that now covers all holocaust payments are a positive move and are changes that should be supported.
The bill also seeks to make amendments to improve the operation of the assurance of support scheme and simplify arrangements for people who provide assurances of support. An assurance of support is a bond paid by a person here in Australia—usually but not always the sponsor—that covers any social security payments made during the exclusion period for new migrants. Depending on the type of visa, both the assurance of support and the exclusion period can differ. For example, a skilled migrant will face a two-year exclusion period and his or her sponsor will have to put $3,500 into the assurance of support bond. An aged parent is facing a 10-year exclusion period and a $10,000 bond.
Under the new arrangements proposed in this legislation, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs will continue to determine which new migrants are subject to an assurance of support. However, once this determination is made, the assurance of support will be issued under the social security law and Centrelink will administer the scheme. Centrelink will become the single point of contact and will be able to provide much more comprehensive advice regarding all aspects of the scheme, including both rights and responsibilities. If a new migrant does receive a social security payment during their exclusion period, having the scheme administered by Centrelink will also mean the recovery of their debt will be easier.
This measure will to some extent streamline the scheme, cut down on overlap and make things easier for the government and the assurers and migrants who use the system—that, at least, is the theory, and we will be watching the practical application of the scheme to see how it works in the real world. We will also be watching to see if it does indeed save the $11.2 million over four years that the government anticipates it will. 
Another amendment contained in this bill seeks to strengthen the arrangements for ceasing payments to people travelling overseas who do not notify Centrelink of their departure. The measures will allow Centrelink to suspend payment if they become aware that a person has left the country without informing them first. Again, we will watch with interest to see if the projected $14.8 million over the next four years is indeed saved. We will also be watching closely to see how many people have their payments suspended when they have not in fact left the country at all.
When the Child Support Agency was moved from the Australian Taxation Office to the Department of Family and Community Services it lost access to information stored on the AUSTRAC database. This bill seeks to restore that access and allow the Child Support Agency to carry out its functions efficiently and effectively. Quite frankly, the access should never have been denied to the Child Support Agency but, in their maneuverings back in 1998, the government forgot about the need for the CSA to have access to this information. It only took five years for them to work out that they had made a mistake and to seek to rectify it.
The bill before the House today seeks to partially address the problems of Centrelink debt. It seeks to do so by amending the data-matching programs available to Centrelink. If this bill is passed, Centrelink will have limited access to newly available data sources relating to taxation and financial transaction activities, but only for the purpose of the administration of the social security law. In its last two budgets, the government has put in place measures to pursue debts for incorrect payments dating back some seven years. Many of these retrospective debts have arisen because data matching of Centrelink records and tax records has not taken place regularly with the pensioner population, including the aged, parenting, disability support and carer categories of pensioners.
In many cases, these debts have arisen because Centrelink has made administrative errors and it has not been the fault of the client at all. Centrelink debt recovery teams have swung into action and are pursuing these debts to the full force of the penalties and punishments available to them. The previous minister suggested on the Sunday program on Channel 9 that pensioners should put the debt on their credit card at 18 per cent interest or even consider selling their house in order to pay back the debt. Certainly, people's tax returns have been garnisheed and the baby bonus has been stripped from some people. This is totally unacceptable. It is no wonder that the Prime Minister was forced to move the minister to another portfolio.
Almost three-quarters of a million families have been caught in a government designed debt trap called the family tax benefit. Senate estimates figures put the number of families with Centrelink debts at 728,458. Over 230,000 of these families have had their tax returns stripped to pay for the debt, in direct violation of the government's own pre-election commitment. In my electorate of Greenway, it is estimated that as many as 4,000 families have accrued debts at an average of $850 and that around 1,000 have had all or part of their tax cheque stripped as a result. The question of Centrelink debt is really a major issue in the electorate of Greenway, and I am sure that is the case in many other electorates. In many cases, of course, the people are providing what they believe to be the correct information and are acting quite honestly although they are incurring these debts. I am sure that most of us are confronted with raising with the government a number of examples that apply in our own electorates. 
I have spoken on this before, in a speech that I made on 5 March in response to a bill called the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. I refer to a constituent, Mrs Racquel Sheeyh, who had notified Centrelink of a change in her circumstances immediately it happened and in fact tripled her estimated income in order to overcompensate. Unfortunately, she still incurred a debt. This is the hard part: as she had incurred the debt, Centrelink then took her entire tax return as well as her baby bonus and the low-income rebate in order to recover the debt. Instead of getting what she expected—a return on her taxation, her baby bonus and her low-income rebate—it was taken from her by Centrelink, still leaving her with a small debt.
It went to the tribunal, which accepted that Mrs Sheeyh phoned Centrelink on 4 February 2002 to advise of her return to work and to provide a new estimate, that she was advised that she may have a small debt of a family tax benefit and that she should overestimate her income for the remainder of the year in order to receive only the minimum rate of family tax benefit. As I have said, she did overestimate her income, I believe by some three times, but still finished up with a debt. This is a case where the lady did everything possible. I think that her case also probably falls under the recommendations of the Ombudsman, who says that those sorts of debts should be waivered. In this case I do not believe it was.
What the government should understand is that low-income people—the people we are talking about—spend all their Centrelink payments on the necessary essentials of life. In most cases, they are already living close to the breadline. When they are hit with a debt of $4,000 or, in many cases, a lot higher, it defeats the purpose of the whole legislation. The people concerned would have been better off if they had not received Centrelink payments in the first place. People are being hit with a double whammy. The legislation that is supposed to improve their quality of life is, in effect, having the reverse impact. Worse still, they would be better off if they did not take the part-time, casual or short-term jobs that would have given them the experience and training that could lead them off welfare and back into the work force. These debts create great hardship and, in many cases, a great deal of stress.
This is a flawed system that expects casual workers to estimate their income 12 months in advance. That is simply impossible. Even if families continue to notify Centrelink of their changing circumstances, as I have indicated they will still rack up a debt at an alarming rate. The government's incompetence has also led to thousand of students being overpaid youth allowance because nobody at Centrelink bothered to check the figures for four years.
The amendments in this bill relating to data matching have come too late for these families now facing high debts to the Commonwealth. Household debt is already at the highest point in Australia's history, and the government's flawed scheme that creates unavoidable debt to Centrelink is only adding to the financial burdens of families. The government Ombudsman and the opposition and welfare groups around the country have called for wholesale reform of the system but the government so far has ignored everyone and continues to allow debts to accrue at an alarming rate. 
Finally, this bill reduces the portability period for people travelling overseas from 26 weeks to 13 weeks. The new portability period will also apply to disability support pension recipients. Labor has consistently opposed the government's attempts to reduce portability provisions in the social security system. Portability provisions are extremely important to all Australians, but particularly to those who were born overseas. In my electorate, that figure at the last census was some 41,811 people or 31 per cent of the total population in the Greenway electorate. The reason it is particularly important to this group is that many still have family and friends in their country of origin. When a parent or other family member is sick or dying it is only natural that they would wish to travel back and spend time with them. Thirteen weeks is an awfully short period of time to spend with someone in those circumstances.
As I said at the beginning of my contribution to the debate, these are largely technical amendments covering a wide cross-section of issues. Most will be supported by Labor, as they represent some streamlining of administrative functions and redress some earlier mistakes made by this government. It will be interesting to see if the proposed savings really are there in four years time or if the implementation of the changes ends up costing more than the government estimates. With those few words, I support the amendment moved by the member for Lilley.",REPS,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2003 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I am pleased to speak on the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2003. It is one of those bills that more closely represents the true position of many of the constituents in the seat of Oxley and the pain and suffering they go through because of the policies of this government. Most bills that come through this place have an attached doublespeak or nastiness—a more appropriate word to use—contained within the policies put forward by the government, and this bill is no different. This bill wraps up in a sort of fancy wrapping a few good measures, including some administrative changes, that the government needs to implement, and we would support those changes. But it hides within it a whole range of very mean-spirited and nasty measures that should not be supported and are not supported and which are the subject of a second reading amendment by the shadow minister, the member for Lilley.
This bill gives effect to most of the family and community services and veterans affairs budget measures that require legislative changes. This bill also gives effect to a 2001 budget measure upon which the 2003 measure relating to a recovery of overpayments arising from lump sum foreign pension payments depends. The introduction of this bill again demonstrates that the government is only interested in increasing revenue flows, without taking into account the vulnerabilities of those Australians that it will affect.
I will quickly go through what is contained in the bill. It includes the reduction of the portability period for social security from 26 weeks to 13 weeks. That will severely disadvantage many Australians, particularly those Australians who were born overseas and who need to travel abroad for short periods to visit sick or dying relatives or for whatever reason.
There is also data matching with pensions authorities in the Netherlands. That has enabled Centrelink to take huge amounts of money out of the pockets of those Dutch pensioners who have been overpaid as a result of administrative errors and miscalculations over great number of years. This has caused great pain to the Dutch community not only in my electorate but also right across Australia. That has come about from a system that probably, right from the very beginning, was not coping with the type of information it needed when Australia signed a reciprocal social security agreement with the Netherlands. There is also the recovery action by Centrelink in relation to that particular case of the Dutch community, which I believe has severely traumatised many people in that community. Those people have lost trust, lost faith, in their government, in the government that is supposed to govern for all Australians and does not do that. 
This bill before us also regulates the recovery of foreign pension payments made as a lump sum in arrears. This change will create heartache in the multicultural communities in my electorate and right across the country, because it is going to be applied retrospectively. The people who receive these foreign pensions were of the belief and understanding in agreements for some time that those payments would not be taken into consideration for recovery purposes at a later date, and now the government is travelling down this path.
What we have seen over the last two budgets is a government that has put in place measures to pursue debt at an incredibly ferocious rate. The ferocity of debt recovery from those who are most vulnerable in our society has been overwhelming. If only the government would apply the same rigour, the same enthusiasm, to other areas which might need some attention: corporate tax arrangements; corporate high-flyers and the payments they get; moneys owed to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, because of company closures or companies going bust, where superannuation was not paid, and so forth. There are so many areas in which the government could apply the same rigour, the same enthusiasm, to those who are little bit tougher to get maybe but who are probably more important in the long run. Instead, what we see is a government that applies, as I said, this incredible rigour and enthusiasm to going down every burrow and every hole, pursuing the frail, the aged, the weak—those most unable to fend for themselves or defend themselves and most unable to cope with the changes that are being imposed on them.
What we have seen this week is some major changes in the Howard government's frontbench ministry. We have seen the government make some big changes, particularly in the area of family and community services, where we have seen the minister, Amanda Vanstone, removed from her post and given another post. At the end of the day, Minister Vanstone was moved because she failed. She has failed as a minister. She has failed to reform. She has failed to do the things that this government promised it would do—govern for all Australians in terms of welfare reform, not welfare attacks—and hence we have seen this major change.
The government has failed to reform the flawed family payments rules and system. This is a system which has affected almost one million families across Australia, with debts over the last two years of around $1 billion. That is $1 billion that this government is ripping out of the pockets of around one million families. The government has failed to reform that system, a system which needs so much work to make it work for all Australians, to make it work effectively. The minister has been removed from her responsibilities because she has failed to deliver on paid maternity leave, which the government said it would deliver. This was going to be a scheme for all Australian families. The government has got some ideas on how this might work, but it never actually implemented it. It always does something but not what is required. 
The minister has failed to address those punishing effective marginal tax rates that are hitting working families harder than anybody else in the community. I am not talking about the corporate high-flyers who earn huge six-figure sums; I am talking about ordinary Australian families, who today if they are earning the average income are struggling to survive. They are struggling to survive in a new world, a new economy, a Howard economy under a Howard government, a Howard world where those who work hard are punished, where those who work overtime are punished, where those who do the right thing are punished. You cannot meet the requirements put forward by this government. Nobody can. The reality that nobody can is evidenced by the number of families that it affects—all of them. How can everybody get it wrong? The reality is that they do not get it wrong. The reality is that the system just does not work. The reality is that the system that is put in place by this government is designed to not work. That is the belief I have. I think the belief that most Australian families have now is that they are part of a system that is designed against them. It is not designed to help, aid or make life easier. At the end of the day, that should be the charter of the government, the charter of the departments: to try to assist, to try to help. What is the point is of having family tax benefit A or B if it is not there to assist people? If it is there to make them more frustrated, to incur debt for them, to make life hard for them, what is the point of having that system there? That is the reality of what is happening in Australia right now.
If you visit a Centrelink office, go and look at the queues, go and look at the frustration, go and talk to the people who have to stand there for two to three hours to be served—not because people at Centrelink are not doing their job but because the people at Centrelink cannot do their job, because they are not too sure what they are supposed to do. They are not sure what they are supposed to do, because the government changes the rules every fortnight. Every fortnight there is some policy change, there is some regulation change or there is some sort of new rule. It is so complex that if you asked three different people in any Centrelink agency, and in fact in the department, the same question exactly—a very simple one, correctly worded, but the same question—you would get three different answers. There would be stark differences—not just an interpretive difference but a complete difference at opposite ends of the spectrum. There is a dichotomy of information in organisations such as Centrelink. No-one is too sure what the rules are. They change often. They are very complicated. In fact, when I look at them I sometimes have trouble interpreting exactly what the government is driving at. What is that rule exactly? When you ask somebody in Centrelink to explain it to you, they have problems explaining it.
Take that concept and apply it to people in the community—people who may have literacy problems, who may be frustrated by the system, who have got better things to do, honestly, than spend two hours in a queue only to be told when they get to the front of it that they stood in the wrong queue and that they are actually supposed to talk to somebody in the other line. If Centrelink staff cannot themselves digest, interpret and apply consistently across the board the rules, the regulations, the mile-high stacks of volumes of government legislation, the policy, the attitude and the correction of the way it is meant to be implemented, how are ordinary people walking into those places—who have got much better things to do, like looking for employment, if that is what they are doing—meant to do it? How are they meant to fill out those super-complex forms? 
I have a copy of the package in my office, which I have had a brief look at. It is about the new system—again, another new system—the filling out of forms, the reporting of income and how it is supposed to be all made simple. Just from a cursory look, just flicking through it, I thought: `My God, I'm going to need an accountancy degree to fill this out 100 per cent. It's going to take me hours.' It would literally take me hours to do this. I looked at it and thought, `How frustrating it must be to have to do that.' And not only do you do it once—it is not like tax where you do it once a year—you have to do it every fortnight. Every fortnight you have to subject yourself to this process that annoys you, makes you angry and causes you to have all sorts of rage. At the end of the day, it just frustrates people.
This is what the government and the minister, who has now been removed and gone off unfortunately to another area where she will probably do the same thing, do. They are punishing Australians. The real question you need to ask is: what are the government punishing these people for? That is the question you need to ask the government. They are punishing them for working overtime. They are punishing them for reporting what they estimate they are earning. The evidence is there that, no matter how hard you try—there are even those who deliberately now overestimate by two or three times to try to get out of this problem—you are punished. You do not want a debt at the end of the year; nobody wants a debt. Do government ministers want a debt at end of the year? No. People just want to get their payment, keep life simple and do things honestly. That is what the majority of Australians do; they are honest and want to do the right thing. In all the discussions we have, in all the policies we make, it is not about catching criminals or people who are dishonest; it is about the mistakes that are made—and they are usually made because the system itself does not work.
We are also going to see that the 30,000 parents who are caring for children with disabilities are just weeks away from having their care allowance payments removed and reviewed. These people do not have enough on their plates—that is what the government must think. They must think that parents caring for children with disabilities have a really easy life. It is a smooth, easy life, where they get up and just do whatever they want to do on a daily basis. The reality is so different. The reality is that these people have so much care to give, so much love to give and so much work to do to give their children a good shot at life and to do the best they can. All they ask of the government is to be on their side—that is all. They do not ask for a lot. The money they get is not a lot, so it cannot be that. All they ask for is somebody to be on their side, for somebody to care as they care.
But this government does not care, as evidenced by this bill, which is going to take away the little support that people have. And where it does not take it away, it makes new, very hard and complicated rules and introduces more forms to fill out. It gets to the point where people decide, `Maybe we don't need these payments that badly.' Of course, only a few have that choice where they may not need it that badly and do not want to participate any more. Most do not have a choice; they are forced to participate. Not only do they have all the caring responsibilities, all the angst and anguish that must go with parents caring for children with disabilities, they also have to deal with a government that makes life difficult for them. They must ask themselves: `Why is the government doing this to me? Why does this government hate me so much? Why does it hate my family so much?' Why does it? What is it about this government, about the agenda, and about the ideological persuasion of these ministers and this Prime Minister that make them want to make life so hard for people? I cannot understand it and I am sure they cannot either. 
There must be a way that this government can come up with some simpler methods—methods which are rigorous but simple. We all want people to be accountable. People want to be accountable. But you have to make it at least possible for them to be accountable and possible for them to do the job that you require of them. When this government talks about mutual responsibility, it is not talking about a level playing field and a fair trade. It is not talking about that at all; it is talking about a continual change, about continually making life harder and more complex, and about continually shifting the goal posts. That is what it does, no matter what it says. When it talks about other bills—for instance, the `fairer work, more pay' bill—it is the complete opposite. This is what I started with: the Orwellian doublespeak of this government that, by merely saying something is so, it is. We all know that it is not, because it is contained in the detail of the bill, not in the title.
I cannot go on without mentioning one of the interesting things about Minister Vanstone's removal from this portfolio by the Prime Minister, and it is his version of why. The Prime Minister claimed that Senator Patterson, the minister moving into the families portfolio, would have greater sensitivity in the way she deals with the families job than Senator Vanstone had. What does the prime minister mean by that? Does he mean that the new minister will have greater sensitivity than the old minister? That is pretty obvious; it is something that we have known for a long time. The old minister did not have any at all; there was no sensitivity. The old minister did everything that she could to make life hard. There is a litany of comments and views by the minister of her attitude towards people who are struggling. One of the most recent ones that comes to mind is when the minister was being questioned about what would happen to age pensioners if they could not afford to repay to the government the debts that they had incurred through no fault of their own. Her response was simple and one that probably you or I or normal people would never dream of saying. The interviewer asked:
What if they don't have the cash?
Vanstone: Well, we would look at their assets.
Interviewer: So you would be prepared to sell up their family homes?
Vanstone: Well, I would be.
I think that speaks volumes for this government and this minister. Simplicity where it counts for the government is in what you do to rip out the debt from those who cannot afford to pay. What are you going to do with them? Just sell out their homes. If you cannot pay, do not worry, because the government is now looking at a credit card system where, if you owe a debt to the Commonwealth, you will simply pay it back on your credit card. You are already in debt; you already have nothing; you already have no assets; you cannot afford to repay it. It will take it out of your measly, miserly payments every fortnight. And, on top of that, it will add to the woes of this country—already with the largest credit card debt in history—by promoting more debt and shoving people's noses right into it. It is just incredible.
The debt recovery systems that this government is putting in place are beyond belief. It is like something out of a bad novel in which you read about a government that seeks people out and spends a fortune on technology, not to help people but to trawl back through their affairs and find the minute detail, the tiny little errors. These were made through no-one's fault, because the technology did not exist at the time. Nobody knew those debts were incurred. In fact, no-one worried about them, because they were part of the normal system—the mechanisms—of how payments are made. But now the government has the new technology, the new-found desire and the rigour and enthusiasm I was talking about to trawl through and find these small debts. They are small debts but they add up over long periods to a lot of money that people cannot afford. So it is not only happening in the Dutch community, with the Dutch-Australian pension and the guarantees they were given—people are getting letters for debts of $10,000 or $15,000. These people are in the traumatic situation where they want to pay it back but do not know how; they are given a deadline and they are considering how they are going to do it. We are talking about 85-year-olds who have trouble with the language. Does the government take that into consideration? No, it does not. This government is not interested. 
Debt recovery is one of the biggest problems we have in terms of what this government is trying to do. If it was debt recovery in terms of trying to seek out businesses that have not paid superannuation for workers before the business goes under, I would be cheering the government and saying, `It is about time you did something positive for ordinary families and workers in this country who have lost everything because of a company that did not pay their superannuation for years and years.' What all this means is quite simple: the government is prepared to put energy, money, effort and enthusiasm, like no-one has ever seen before, into hitting the weak, frail and aged—those least able to defend themselves—and at the same time it shows a blind eye and turns its back on those with the greatest wealth and assets. The government says: `Those people we will look at later—much, much later.' What this government needs to do is make amends and do something that helps ordinary Australians. (Time expired)
Debate (on motion by Fran Bailey) adjourned.",REPS,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2003 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I rise to speak in the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003 and move: 
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	supports the continuation of a statutory form of regulation of migration agents, believing that complete voluntary self-regulation, as advocated by the Coalition in the past, would seriously endanger vulnerable clients and badly undermine the integrity of our migration system; 
(2)	expresses its dismay that the Government has allowed privileged access to Ministers, and Ministerial and Departmental staff, to a number of unregistered agents who are close associates of the Coalition;
(3)	notes growing concern about the Ministerial intervention process, particularly in so far as it is entails unequal access by certain groups and individuals and arbitrary and non-transparent decision making by the Minister; 
(4)	requires the Department of Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs to display a stronger resolve to investigate and prosecute individuals engaged in unregister-ed practice, people trafficking, migration fraud and other offences under the Act, including matters referred to the Depart-ment by the Migration Agents Registration Auth-ority (MARA);
(5)	urges MARA to address concerns about its visibility, efficiency, and accessibility and improve its means of communication with consumers, registered agents, ethnic com-munity organisations and media outlets; and
(6)	requests the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs to give priority attent-ion to the need to bring overseas agents into the regulatory system and to develop a mechanism to require agents to maintain adequate professional indemnity insurance as a condition of registration”.
 (Mr Wilkie)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment.
—The amendment essentially goes to a number of issues. There is the failure of the government, at this stage, to deal with a number of considerations which the Spicer inquiry indicated action should be taken on, including the question of the current failure to police agents overseas. Realistically, that is probably where we have more problems than even on shore. The other matter is the question of indemnity insurance for the players in the industry. Again, this was highlighted by the Spicer inquiry. The point was made that it is not uncommon among professionals in this country to have such coverage. I note that on 25 September—which was quite some time ago—the minister indicated that he would act on these matters.
We understand, in going to this issue, that 10 per cent of the practitioners in the industry are not-for-profit and any scheme would of course have to take that into consideration. There has been a doubling of complaints, which is an indication of the problem. Certainly the request that Spicer made that DIMIA and MARA explore the feasibility of a scheme is a matter the government should act upon more swiftly. We do not need to reiterate at length the reality of this industry. We have people who are extremely desperate to live in this country. Some of them have very valid claims in relation to protection visas and others have less credible claims. But what they usually have in common is that they lack a fundamental knowledge of the legal system and processes.
People with this degree of desperation can be exploited greatly. I have enough practical experience to know that there is often a common conspiracy between the client and the agent or the lawyer involved. But realistically they do need protection and the question of what happens in the case of a crisis with an individual practitioner should be tackled by the government. The amendment goes to those issues and it also goes to MARA lifting its game. We have seen enough coverage from the Australian newspaper in recent weeks and its disquiet over that aspect of it. I do not believe the situation is quite as dire as the Australian makes out, but there is obviously a perception of a need for MARA to lift its game.
I will return later to the other aspect of the amendment: the question of the favoured relationship of the minister and a number of unregistered people in this marketplace. On the broader thrust of the current legislation, I want to say that Labor has a strong track record of wanting and seeking integrity in this industry. We have consistently questioned the ideologically driven perception of this government that MARA and the institute were basically able to police themselves, that there was no need for the government to have a role and that essentially the industry was mature enough to look after itself.  
The previous minister, who has moved onto the Attorney-General's role, was a strong advocate of getting out of this marketplace. Whether it is because of the fairly shameful allegations and the series of donations that have been made to the Liberal Party, and the relationship with the grant of visas over recent months, or whether it is because the minister who handles this particular portfolio sees an opportunity to become a shining white knight—a Sir Galahad—against fraud and corruption in this field, there has certainly been a change of tune by the government. This government, which said that all was well and that within two years there could be total deregulation and total independence for the industry, is now coming to this House with legislation that really is going over the top in trying to cater for the problem. It is an absolute 360-degree change of position by the government.
As I said, we do not for one moment resile from recognising that there is a very fundamental problem in this industry. The figures that have been provided to the opposition—and I would have hoped that the government would be more forthcoming with what they hold—indicate that, of the 500 practitioners who launched cases over the last two years, 300 managed a 90 per cent failure rate and 50 managed not to win a case. That does indicate that some people might be launching questionable cases. It would be hard in many fields to get that kind of picture.
Yet the industry does attract a large number of applicants. To this date, I think estimates have been given of a 13 to 20 per cent growth rate in the number of people coming into this field. More and more people are coming in and many of the practitioners seem to have, on the surface, a very dubious track record of success. In these situations, clients often do not know the details. Many of these practitioners go to various gala events in ethnic communities, make donations to good causes in those communities, advertise in ethnic media and sometimes essentially have a monopoly practice in different ethnic markets. They might lose a few cases, but, for the ones they win, the clients tell the next person et cetera. So they actually have people out there in the marketplace seeking business for them. That situation, as the opposition has consistently said, is not satisfactory. Certainly, it is not helpful to the integrity of our immigration processes that people launch preposterous cases and seek to buy time or that clients and the people who advise them launch cases which, on any honest and objective analysis, have no validity based on the objective human rights situation in those countries.
We then have streams of cases. If you are in your electoral office often enough, you will see a stream of cases from Nigeria, because some states have introduced sharia law. We have a line of argument that says that every Nigerian Christian should move to Sydney rather than relocate within the country. Similarly, at one stage, we had a stream of Tongan women's cases because Tonga is a patriarchal society. So it goes on. In more recent years, there has been a proclivity to argue that homosexuals and lesbians from the Middle East, if they were to return to their villages, would be persecuted greatly.
We have agents out there manufacturing these cases, perhaps thinking they might beat the system—they might find the tribunal member who got out on the right side of the bed that day—or, more particularly, buy time within the system, hoping that other alternatives will emerge during the period in which they are fighting their way through the system. Alternatively, in cases where applicants have children, they might be here long enough for those children to acquire rights of permanent residence and thereby change the families' migration situation. I have had people walk into my office, having fought the system in some cases for eight, 13 or 14 years, and tell me that they will simply take another class action to get the required further year or two until the balance of the family have permanent rights in this country. 
We do not for a moment think that all is well in this situation. However, there must be grave doubts about whether the government is tackling the issue in a sensible fashion. The government's intention seems to be to start building up a profile of dubious agents, constructed through a requirement that the agent advise whenever they give assistance to a person. There are a number of concerns with this. Firstly, in the last week many lawyers have put to us the question of confidentiality of the client. Others have put it to us that it would feasibly allow the department to build up a list of people who were shopping around, possibly to launch claims—the fact that they have been to a person for advice would perhaps indicate that they have a few ideas. Personally, I am not as concerned about that complaint as some other people are. I think we can possibly work our way through options for confidentiality between client and agent.
However, I think we really do have to look at the broader picture. There are some grave difficulties in this legislation. It seems that the government is going to take a profile of four cases in a six-month period, from what I understand. If, in the case of protection visas, the agent fails in 90 per cent of cases and, in other classes of action, that agent fails in 75 per cent of cases, the agent would have to show cause as to why they should remain in the industry. For all my concern with the manipulation of the system, with people launching false claims and buying time and thereby, most importantly, hurting other people who have legitimate claims—and these people are forced to wait longer and longer and get more and more frustrated with the system—I think we have to be realistic about the possibility that many very genuine agents could launch four cases in a period of six months and lose all four.
All MPs in this House have seen cases which they thought were fairly strong and which were eventually rejected. You could have a situation where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade takes a particular position with regard to a country. I am cynical enough to think that the Foreign Affairs position is not always totally objective and altruistic—it relates to our national and international needs. For some nations, Australia takes a softer line on human rights abuses because our national requirements dictate it. A person could be launching most of their cases involving that particular country. Therefore, they could have a very low success rate without in any way intending dishonest practice.
It is also a reality that circumstances can change in a particular nation or region between the launch of a case and its finalisation. This is quite clearly what the government are saying in regard to the situation with temporary protection visas—that they will look at the situation of Hazara Shia or Uzbek speakers in northern Afghanistan, or perhaps now more the stronger claims of Pashtuns on the border with Pakistan. They are saying that the situation can change, so an agent could, as I say, launch a case and find that the rugs have totally moved during the consideration of that case. That could be taken as another cross against their name and lead to their exclusion from the field. 
Similarly, there are issues as to what advice is. It has been put to the opposition that, if you require people to indicate that they gave any advice whatsoever to a claimant, then a number of agents could be involved in a particular case as it goes through the system. A person could seek the interpretation of a variety of agents before they even launch their initial approach. Those agents could give varying analyses, varying advice, but they would all be part of that claim, it seems. We could have a series of agents affected by the one failed case, with each of those agents having a very different relationship with the launch of the case, its preparation and the fight for it. Agents who advised people not to launch a claim and that a claim lacked merit could be affected because they have still advised. So that is another issue that must cause concern. 
There is also the issue that the department seemingly is going to be judge and jury in these matters, that MARA is essentially going to be sidelined, sent to Coventry, in regard to this area. Who would not be worried about that, particularly when the criteria are so low in a number of cases? It could feasibly be a situation where a particular agent has been associated with campaigns that the government—and even the department—do not particularly like. Those agents, those lawyers, would seem to have some grounds for concern that it is the department that is seemingly going to decide whether there is good cause for them to be thrown from the industry. I appreciate there can be appeals to the AAT but I still think that, when you look at the overall approach that the government has in this legislation, there must be a grave worry here.
Also—and this comes to the question that I and other speakers will refer to about the image of the previous minister over the last year or two in regard to ministerial discretion—seemingly another provision of this bill is that the minister or his department, having decided that someone has a track record so bad that they should be forced out of the industry and MARA should basically stamp that situation, can revoke that. The minister can turn around and decide, for whatever reason, that that was all wrong.
As I say, if you go through this you do have to say that there are indeed grave worries with the way in which this has been constructed. There are other parts of the legislation of course that we would fully endorse—the strengthening of sound knowledge, the move towards examinations, the strengthening of penalties against unregistered practice, the introduction of additional offences. All of those things are commendable. They have been advocated in the past and they have been supported by MARA, by practitioners, by activists and by Spicer. As I say, it is unfortunate that the department and the minister have chosen to deal with what is a very real problem in such a ham-fisted way that it might not be too easy for us to come to some kind of consensus about this legislation. I want to say very genuinely that, if there is a will, there is a way. I hope that we can come to some kind of understanding on these matters.
I now turn to the other aspect of the second reading amendment—that is, the question of the seemingly special treatment of some people in the immigration field. The past few months have seen tremendous focus on a number of individuals and the use of section 417—ministerial discretion. The main player, of course, has been Mr Karim Kisrwani, a travel agent from Western Sydney. We have moved on from the first event there—allegations in regard to Mr Bedweny Hbeiche, who the previous minister told the House was successful because he had a few sisters in Australia. Realistically, I think we know that that is not a very credible argument as to why that case was successful. I could go through the situation with a few other communities—Pacific Islanders, for example. Many Pacific Islanders in my region have multiple siblings in this country, and the ones I have seen have cases as poor as Mr Hbeiche's. They did not get any special treatment or recognition because of their family ties in this country. We have the allegation that donations were made and, despite the previous efforts of the member for Parramatta and the previous firm rejections by the RRT and our courts, suddenly Mr Hbeiche was judged to be a person meriting protection.  
We have moved from there, of course, to Mr Kisrwani's broader role in Australian immigration. It is interesting to note that the Senate inquiry is now seeking his appearance. One would have few reasons why he could perhaps be very helpful to an inquiry with regard to ministerial discretion, because he seems to have broadened his interest in the immigration field beyond the traditional pattern of a father figure in the Lebanese community who historically undertook a role of assistance to a wide number of recently arrived migrants to a pattern of facilitating people with more questionable antecedents. The first of these, of course, is the Filipino corporate fugitive, Mr Dante Tan. We know the claim of Mr Kisrwani that he certainly did not take money with regard to trying to influence the minister. This was all a business transaction—a loan to a company that Mr Kisrwani was involved in. It was so successful in water and, from recollection, leather exports that that loan was allegedly paid back in a few months.
In this process, Mr Tan developed some very close relationships with people in Australia. He saw a need to go to breakfast with Minister Abbott and Minister Reith; to go on harbour cruises with Minister Abbott and Minister Coonan; to attend Romeo's Restaurant with the New South Wales member for the Hills, Minister Abbott and Minister Ruddock; and to attend Melbourne Cup luncheons. Minister Ruddock conceded at one stage that he had been out with him two or three times socially, but could not recall which events. We have a situation where, when you add up all the events, he was at a fundraiser every week or so during the campaign.
Then we had, of course, Mr Foo, who was escorted in handcuffs from a plane in Singapore. Returning to Mr Tan, we had a reversal of the department's hostility to his claims to have been setting up legitimate businesses in this country. The department vacated the field because it was costing the Australian taxpayer too much money! If you look at what the department is doing in this country with regard to the cost to taxpayers, the argument that the reason they suddenly withdrew from Mr Kisrwani's business partner's case was because of cost is once again a preposterous argument. We all know that the department, sometimes quite rightly, fights many of these things to the nth degree. I am, quite frankly, totally unconvinced that that was the reason the department vacated the field in this case.
Then, of course, Mr Kisrwani—coincidentally a travel agent, not involved in immigration, just a `community leader'—got tangled up with Mr Foo, and they were gallivanting around town to fundraisers as well. And there has been an admission, not an allegation, that Mr Foo—I am not sure whether he is still in Changi prison or where he is—also seemed to think that Mr Kisrwani, this travel agent, was somehow the No. 1 honcho in Australian immigration, because he went into a $4,000 consultancy with him. He did not go down to some of the larger firms in Sydney or Melbourne to get his assistance. He thought that this little-known travel agent in Harris Park was the person to go to. I wonder why. Could it be because Minister Abbott described him as a close personal friend of the minister for immigration? I think that is perhaps the reason, because I cannot logically see why he would otherwise be regarded, unregistered as he is, as a person who could be helpful with regard to immigration advice. 
As I have said on many occasions, I am also rather amazed that when this Filipino corporate fugitive, Mr Dante Tan, got off the plane, having used a speedboat to escape from the Philippines and divert legal authorities, he said: `I won't look at the Financial Review or go down to the stock market to get a business partner. There's a guy in Harris Park, Karim Kisrwani. He's the person I should go into partnership with if I am going to establish a legitimate company in Australia and make enough money. He's the one person in this whole country that I should go into partnership with.' Once again, I wonder why. I think it is fairly clear that the reason that he at least perceived he should go into partnership with Mr Kisrwani was that Mr Kisrwani was perceived as having influence.
Then, of course, we had Mr Kisrwani, travel agent, again involving himself in an area of the immigration system when he became the middle man with regard to sale transactions of the Australian College of Technology. Once again unexplained was the great expertise and the great need for this man, but he was there again when Mr Nasr and Mr Yung, it seems, entered into some negotiations with regard to that college, which certainly had grave problems with the department. The other coincidence was that Mr Yung was walking around the Australian political system saying: `I'd like to participate. How can I participate in politics in this country? Why don't I give a donation to the minister for immigration?' There was no connection with him giving that money to the particular minister. There was no relevance in the relationship between Mr Kisrwani and Mr Yung and the fact that Mr Kisrwani was a close personal friend of the minister, but Mr Yung decided to give $2,000 and the person he was negotiating with, Mr Nasr, also had to give $1,000.
I want to say—and I think it is very unfortunate that I have to make this point—that I noticed that the former minister for immigration indicated that he thought his memory was somewhat better than Mr Kisrwani's with regard to the timing of donations. He has refuted Mr Kisrwani's claims that he and Mr Tan went to the campaign launch in Berowra and that a donation was made around 14 October. He claims that the donation was actually made by cheque in January the next year. I am slightly questioning of that, because Mr Yung also just happens to have signed a statement about his donation, and he just happened also to put 14 October. So we have these two people in this mire indicating that there were donations around that time. I have to say that the image of ministerial discretion has very much come under the spotlight. The whole problem was perhaps summarised in the current issues brief No. 3 2003-04. In relation to ministerial discretion, it stated:
While this provision was designed to act as an accountability mechanism, in reality these tabled statements read like a set of templates, containing three or four paragraphs which convey very little substance about the specific case.
We have a situation here where the Australian public and the Australian parliament know nothing whatsoever about why approximately 2,000 people have been allowed through the system under ministerial discretion. These are people who were rejected by the department, rejected by the tribunal and rejected often by the courts. Yet 2,000 of them have come through the door. We have people out there trying to increase ethnic tension in this country and to denigrate and stereotype people that arrive by boat. I for one am realistic enough to know that they are not all genuine claimants either. At the same time as we have 2,000 people coming through the back door, we have a travel agent in Parramatta who has a 50 per cent success rate. That compares with Amnesty International's 11 successes and 51 losses. That compares with the Fijian Australian Community Council's zero successes and 36 losses. That compares with the Refugee Review Tribunal referring back to the minister many cases and having a 17 per cent success rate. It does not read as genuine. There is no way in the world that this travel agent knows more about immigration, knows more about these cases, knows more about the law of protection visas and has had this success rate by himself. 
Quite clearly, he is only a small part of a bigger mess. We have Mr El Ashwah described by the Australian as `the poor man's Karim Kisrwani'. We have his involvement in the case of Indograin. We have Gilda Ponferrada, former officer of the department, sitting in Kisrwani's office for many months, and it was allegedly put to the public that she was still working for the department long after she had left. We have Fahmi Mustapha Hussain, the former Liberal candidate for Auburn, who is debarred as a lawyer and debarred as a practitioner. He is also part of this peddling of influence that has basically characterised the operation in Western Sydney. The opposition has moved the second reading amendment that goes to those points. I would hope the government shows some sense about the way in which we can handle the broader bill.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2003-10-07,"—I am pleased to speak to the two concurrent bills this evening: the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003 and the Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003. These bills will amend the Migration Act 1958 and will implement recommendations of the 2001-02 review of the statutory self-regulation of the migration advice industry, which is generally known as the Spicer review. Out of that review came 27 recommendations. I want to deal briefly with the body of the legislation and then talk about some individual cases of my own. I certainly will not go into the politics of hate and envy, which the member for Reid has just indulged in. The fact is that this industry does need a clean-up. It has allowed itself, under self-regulation, to fall into disarray in some areas. MARA—the body that has been given the job of dealing with this industry—through lack of vigilance, lack of desire or lack of resources is not pursuing some of these cases as enthusiastically as I would have hoped. I will give you a case in point on that shortly.
First of all, I would like to deal with the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003. We know that this basically deals with recommendation No. 19 of the statutory self-regulation review—the Spicer review—which recommends the introduction of charges for those who wish to act as migration agents on a non-commercial basis. What has been happening is that people who quite rightly wish to involve themselves at a community level in charitable and community organisations and offer advice for free pay a much lesser fee. In paying this much lesser fee, they give advice where they can to people in need. What has happened is that a few sometimes unscrupulous registered agents that are non-commercial have suddenly decided they wish to become commercial agents. They then operate at giving commercial advice but on the much lower registration fee, which is quite wrong. I understand that people giving advice and then charging for it when they are not entitled to is an actual offence. This legislation introduces a pro rata fee, and it allows greater discretion for both MARA and the minister to investigate where offences have occurred to see that it does not happen across a wider range. To put that into context, there are some 3,800 registered agents in this country and 10 per cent of those are not-for-profit providers. Those 10 per cent do a marvellous job, and naturally they are not charging the exorbitant fees. 
The bulk of the information this evening goes to recommendations 3 and 16 of the Spicer review—that is, education and sanctions for large numbers of vexatious visa applications. The purpose of this bill is to see that those key recommendations are given greater substance so that migration agents, or people who wish to become migration agents, go through a far tougher and far more rigorous education process so that they can become good migration agents for people who need their services. It has always been a concern in the community that a number of people suddenly decide for whatever reason—and the member Reid mentioned some of them, such as having an attachment to an ethnic community or whatever—that they would make good migration agents. They have no background in the area of migration law or in any migration processes. In fact, one person said to me, `I don't know. My husband's at work and I thought I wouldn't mind having something to do. I've often thought I wouldn't mind being a migration agent.' So off she trotted and got herself a migration agent's licence and she now dispenses advice as a migration agent. That is one of the reasons why there needs to be greater scrutiny and regulation in this bill.
As was found out from evidence given by MARA to a Senate estimates committee, there has been growth of between 13 and 20 per cent each year in the number of migration agents. In fact, last year the number of new migration agents grew by 700. There were 700 new migration agents registered last year. That has to say something about the industry. Either it is real cash cow and a lot of people have suddenly said, `How long has this been going on? I'd better get into this. There's a good earner here,' or there is a greater need. Given the fact that the very honest Minister Ruddock has put so much integrity back into the migration system—
—Did Hansard pick that up?
—Hansard can't detect irony.
—We hear those opposite cackling and guffawing. He has done something they could never do and that is to bring integrity back to the migration system. There is no real extra work in this industry other than work that they suddenly decide to generate. There are some very interesting cases in point. Here we are with a huge growth in the number of registered agents, yet there are a greater number of complaints. My understanding is that in the last few years the number of complaints about migration agents has doubled. As the member for Reid quite rightly said, through his electorate office—and mine and, I am sure, those of many other members of this House—there are complaints on a regular basis about migration agents.
In Perth I sometimes recommend to people a migration agent called Robert O'Rourke. I have never had a complaint from anybody when I have suggested him. I hand out a number of cards of different agents in Perth that I have had good dealings with and that people have had help from. People like Robert O'Rourke provide a marvellous service to the industry. People from non-English-speaking backgrounds, people from overseas who come to this country for the first time, do not have a working understanding of migration law and they need help. They generally pay a fee for it. But I have brought to the attention of this House a number of migration agents who have caused some problems. For example, a person about whom I have had a number of complaints through my electorate office is Rose Todd of Todd Holdings Pty Ltd, in Walter Road, Dianella. She is somebody that, under this new legislation, there might be some attention paid to.  
It is no secret that I also brought to the attention of this House, the media and MARA—and I will go through that process shortly—the case of a former upper house member from Western Australia, Mr Sam Piantadosi. I wrote to the Migration Review Tribunal in August 2002 about his activities. I then wrote to MARA. In relation to Mr Piantadosi and his dealings with a Mr and Mrs Bruno, I wrote to Ms Laurette Chao of the Migration Agents Registration Authority on 14 March this year and laid a complaint which was canvassed. Mr Piantadosi had been providing services to the Brunos and a number of other people, including Amano Signorelli, whom I had been helping through my office. As I said on the record earlier in this House, Mr Piantadosi had taken their money and had not even lodged their applications. He disputes this, of course. But the fact is that Mr Signorelli was going to be deported because his application for a visa had not been lodged. Yet Mr Piantadosi had taken the money. These are the sorts of migration agents that this legislation is intended to address.
I am disappointed with MARA, because it is 7 October and I received a letter on 24 April from them saying that they were investigating this case and that I should contact Mr Irving if I needed any further information. I just wanted them to get on with the job of completing the investigation into Mr Piantadosi in particular. That letter was signed by Laurette Chao. I have rung them today and they have told me that it is now with the Conduct Advisory Panel and that the executive officer is David Mawson. They have not dealt at all with this application that they are supposed to be investigating. So here is someone you would possibly call a rogue migration agent who is still practising after I brought this to the attention of the authorities over 12 months ago, starting off with the Migration Review Tribunal.
So I am a bit worried about giving MARA extra abilities and sanctions in being able to address this issue if they cannot deal with something simple under the powers that they have now. I hope that the minister—and this is one of the reasons the minister is going to have a ministerial intervention capability enshrined in this legislation—will take a sterner view of the activities of MARA. I think they had better beef up their activities in looking at some of the many complaints they get. In fact, my understanding is that the last time an agent was drummed out of business was in 1999, so it is not a great success record on behalf of MARA.
I understand that there is bipartisan support for this legislation. I did not hear all the comments of the member for Reid, but he seems to agree that there are a number of concerns in this area and that they should be looked at in terms of the operation of migration agents. I also note that Senator Bartlett on 20 June 2002 also expressed concern about:
the very large number of people who rely on migration agents and the enormous consequences for them if those agents do not act appropriately when they are meant to be helping them.
He goes on to talk about there being a possible lack of confidence in the integrity of registered migration agents and says the Migration Agents Registration Authority has been tasked by the parliament to do its job, basically. The select committee is also looking at this area.
An interesting case, which is quite fortuitous—and again the member opposite raised this issue earlier—was described in last Saturday's Weekend Australian. Both Rebecca DiGirolamo and Natalie O'Brien raised the issue of Mark Clisby, an Adelaide solicitor who is at the centre of investigations into a migration scheme spanning three states and who has previously been found guilty of unprofessional conduct. His dubious activity has gone back to court cases as early as 1995. So Mr Clisby has been under scrutiny since 1995 about some of his activities. The article in the Australian goes on to say: 
Clisby has had his registration as a migrant agent renewed annually by the Migration Agents Registration Authority since 1999, despite it having full knowledge of his guilty plea and the tribunal reprimand.
Now similar criticisms are being levelled against him—this time by a handful of Federal Court judges.
So when you have Federal Court judges talking about a rogue migration agent—Clisby, in this case—there needs to be some sort of action. Further, in the article, according to government lawyers:
... Clisby orchestrated a scheme designed to frustrate the court, doctored court documents and failed to advise clients he had abandoned their cases, leaving them open to deportation as illegal citizens.
Why would Clisby be doing this? Why would Clisby want to put in all these sorts of bogus claims? I understand he currently has 600 claims clogging up the courts. It is very simple. It is because Mr Clisby charges, on average, $2,200 for each case that he has before the courts. They tell me that he has great success in getting these to the High Court. On any reckoning—let us give him the benefit of the doubt—Mr Clisby is looking at a fee arrangement for those 600 cases of $1.2 million. That is a bit ordinary! Not only that, but the fact is that these concerns have not been dealt with. They also tell me that Clisby was actually a bit of a serial branch stacker and tried to run for parliament a couple of times in South Australia—
—For the Liberal Party!
—That is right, for the Liberal Party; we have rogues on both sides of the parliament. In this case, he has been mentioned in this article as having done the same. I believe it was John Olsen's seat that he tried to run for in South Australia. You do not go `Hee' for somebody who is misbehaving.
In this case, as I said, there are so many concerns that they could take these to the High Court. This is where I find the Labor Party so disingenuous on the whole subject. We could be stopping this huge range of legal entanglements from going through every court and every system in Australia if the Labor Party had supported our legislation on a number of occasions. We wanted to look at a smaller review process so that lawyers like Clisby could not use up not only the small amounts of money that many of these migrants and refugees have but the resources of the Australian courts.
People say, `Why don't they stop these people going all the way to the High Court?' There is one simple reason: the Labor Party, in conjunction with the Democrats and the Greens in the Senate, have stopped us trying to do something about this cascading succession of appeals through the courts. Yet today the member for Reid said that it is a problem. He outlined that there were people who prolong these things for up to 14 years, I think he said, so that they can get the balance of their family to Australia and then they have a better case for staying in Australia themselves. They are using the system to circumvent proper process when we as a government are trying to put in place legislation to do something about the problem. It is hugely expensive matter, and the time and the resources of our courts are being consumed in dealing with it.
But the Labor Party do not always tell it up front, because they have a political scalp to take here and a point to score there. Rather than trying to fix the system, they would rather bag Philip Ruddock, who should be beatified rather than criticised in the public's eyes. It is really funny in here. The Labor Party want to savage him and think they do well when they lay a glove on him, yet out in the community people think that Philip Ruddock is one of the greatest things that has ever walked. As I said, the general community thinks he should be beatified. For what he has done for the integrity of the migration process in this country, he should. 
However, my last point about Clisby's case is that MARA's executive officer, David Mawson, says he cannot reveal whether Clisby's registration has been scrutinised by MARA because of privacy issues. That is fair enough, but you would think that after all that time—from 1995 to 1999; it has been reviewed ever since—that they would actually have a good look at him. As I said, this is what this legislation may well go to.
In the last few seconds I have I will just finish by saying that because of my concerns I have not just complained about it; I have written to the minister asking him to bring a term of reference before this parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Migration. That would be a good place to deal with this issue. The fact is that the minister responsible, the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, wrote back to me outlining the number of reviews that have taken place. As a result, bringing legislation to this House in the interim should deal with a great many concerns that we have with the migration agents and the control of them in this country. This is a bill that if supported by the opposition will bring back integrity to the process of migration agents, and also for the welfare of the people applying—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS INTEGRITY MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I too would like to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003 and the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003. Labor welcome this overdue attempt to tighten up the standards of the migration advice industry. We do ask though why it is now that the government has suddenly decided to act. We know that there has been a debate in the community for a long time about the type of regulation that should cover migration agents and lawyers. In fact, it was the immediate past minister—if that is the correct terminology for former Immigration Minister Ruddock—who argued when he first took on this portfolio for getting rid of the regulatory controls that covered migration agents. We have not come full circle but we have come partway back around the circle because there has been a realisation that it is very important for us to properly regulate and control this industry in some way.
People in this House know that the migration advice industry, or the migration industry, is a seriously big industry in Australia now. I have no doubt that the vast majority of advisers and agents are good and capable, but we believe that there is still a serious and significant number who are dodgy in one way or another. We believe that the government has a clear responsibility to ensure that people who are using migration agents are protected from those who are the most shonky.
When I say that the advice industry or the migration industry is a big industry now, we are talking about serious amounts of money. The Senate inquiry that is currently looking at the use of ministerial discretion has had evidence from a number of agents who have put the costs of getting migration advice at various stages anywhere from $2,000 to $30,000 or even up to $50,000. Some issues may take a very small amount of time; others involve cases that might go through many court processes, and perhaps some of those upper amounts might be expected in those cases. Nevertheless, it is seriously worrying to Labor that, when you have such large amounts of money, when you have people who are desperate and very determined to be able to stay in Australia and when you have a minimal amount of regulation, it is quite a dangerous cocktail for some people who are determined to do the wrong thing and who take advantage of people who are seeking to have their claims processed to stay in Australia. 
We welcome the reforms and we welcome the fact that the government recognises that this is a big issue but we think that it is only partial recognition of what needs to be done. Clearly it is a major step back from the arguments that were proposed and the system that was set up by the previous minister, Mr Ruddock. It is proof that the system that he had hoped would work does not, and that there need to be more steps and protections built into the system.
There is a significant problem with the way MARA operates and with the interaction between MARA and DIMIA, because MARA does not have as many powers as people might think it does. As the registration agent, and as it has responsibility for self-regulation, it does not have the extensive powers that many in the community might want it to have. At the same time, DIMIA, which is the department responsible for a number of other areas and particularly the control of unregistered migration agents or people who are providing migration advice but are not registered to do so, does not use its powers to enforce or regulate appropriately the activities of community representatives. I will go into that more in the future.
We are a bit concerned that these bills give more power to the department even though we have some doubts about whether the department is properly or actively using the powers that it currently has. As the primary decision maker on most migration matters, there is also an issue of conflict of interest, and we need to look closely at how we deal with those sorts of allegations. Is it going to be appropriate for DIMIA to be able to give or not give a tick or an okay to people who are going to provide advice when it has an interest in making a decision on the cases that are before it?
There are growing numbers of complaints about the activities of migration agents and lawyers. It is vital for customers that these dodgy practices are stamped out. It is also vital for those very professional agents, and it is in their interests, that they do not have their standards and profession brought into disrepute. So looking to regulate more and introducing some new offences could have a positive impact.
It is a desirable and necessary aim for us to deal with this serious problem of many people providing poor migration advice and perhaps being serial offenders in bringing vexatious claims, and certainly for us to deal with the potential exploitation of people who are in vulnerable and desperate circumstances. So Labor support this purpose—we think the aims of the bill before the House are good—but Labor do have concerns that some of the methods and procedures that are being proposed in this bill will not necessarily achieve this aim.
The government is revealing some strange priorities by having a particular focus on agents who bring vexatious claims, when clearly DIMIA has an interest of its own in preventing those claims being made. The nation has an interest in preventing those claims being made. But the government does not seem to have taken quite so an enthusiastic approach in the areas where Labor have persistently revealed that there are serious allegations of corruption in the process. I would like to spend some time dealing with that in my speech today. 
My colleague the member for Reid is the shadow minister who has carriage of this bill. He has clearly set out Labor's position on the bill and the negotiations that we would like to have before this bill is debated in the other place. I support the comments that he has made and hope that the negotiations that will be held between the government and the Labor Party will result in some of the changes in the areas in which we have concerns.
The second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Reid sets out clearly some of the issues that we are concerned about. In particular, I refer to paragraphs (2) and (3), where we express dismay that the government is not using this opportunity to address the questions that have been raised around the exercise of ministerial discretion. Whilst we think that measures tightening up the requirements for agents so that they demonstrate sound knowledge of the Migration Act and ensuring that they undertake ongoing professional development are very welcome, we are concerned that the small numbers of claims that might be involved in assessing whether people are actually displaying those professional standards and the low success rates might be used as indicators. We are particularly concerned about that when we look at some of the success rates that people have in other areas and see quite disparate results that do not seem to reflect in any way the sorts of standards that people might have in this area.
I want to recap in particular the cash for visas affair, because of the fact that the government has decided to implement this bill now, after recommendations that deal with some of these issues were made many years ago. It is good that it is going to take these steps, but it is just a little bit coincidental that it is only now, when the issues that Labor have been raising about the integrity of the system have really got some public interest, that the government wants to look like it is clamping down on these procedures. When it does that and then has a provision in the bill which says that we will make an exemption for unregistered agents or people who are not migration agents putting forward a case to the minister seeking his intervention and that as long as they are not getting any fee or reward they will not be covered by these new provisions, it seems to us that the clamping down is not actually occurring in the area where some of the most serious allegations of corruption have been made. So we do not really believe that the government can be given too much credit for deciding to pick up some recommendations that have been around for a long time which, whilst appropriate, do not necessarily deal with all of the issues that we would like them to deal with.
I will quickly touch on a couple of those issues. A new offence is going to be created for an agent failing to inform DIMIA of their involvement in a visa or review application. There is going to be an increase in the criminal penalty for giving immigration assistance whilst unregistered. That might be something that people feel would go to the sort of circumstance we have been dealing with with Karim Kisrwani, but I need to draw the House's attention to the fact that DIMIA is not currently prosecuting people under those provisions. In fact, we know from the Senate inquiry that many complaints have been made over several years about Mr Kisrwani and that the only thing DIMIA has done is counselled Mr Kisrwani.
Supposedly an investigation has been afoot, and we have found out through the process of the inquiry that at the same time Mr Kisrwani has actually taken the head of the DIMIA Parramatta office out to lunch. This is not the sort of thing that gives people confidence in the system if DIMIA is to have more power and is supposed to be the keeper of the integrity of the system. We really do need to deal with the fact that there is a perception of influence and favouritism and that that perception does not just relate to the former minister; it relates to the department as well. 
Debating a bill like this raises very serious questions about how a system can be regulated appropriately, the sorts of interests that a department might have as the administrator of a whole system and the interest that it might have in actually regulating the system or excluding people from using the system. We think there are some serious matters that have to be dealt with here. We are particularly concerned about revelations, again in the Senate inquiry, about the relationship that some community members have not just with the minister but with the minister's office and the department. We think it is strange that the government wants to cloak this bill in the language of clamping down on dodgy practices but has got more than a bit of a blind spot when it comes to the role that some community members can play in accessing the minister, particularly on matters of ministerial intervention.
This is not a small issue. Paragraphs (2) and (3) of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Reid go to our concern that there are not actually sufficient checks and balances in place for the decision making process that the minister goes through. For the period that the minister was the minister for immigration he exercised his discretion nearly 2,000 times, which is at least once every single working day that he was the minister—Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday; every one of those days the minister said yes to granting a visa to someone who otherwise did not fit through the immigration system. Through the Senate committee, the process of question time and the media, we have seen that Mr Kisrwani—but others as well—have undue influence on the process. They have access that others do not have. They make donations to the Liberal Party and they can speak to the minister's office three or four times a week—and this is not regarded as an issue that the government want to regulate against in this bill. If they were taking seriously the complaints that were being made in the migration industry and the community, that would be one of the things that they would have addressed in this bill.
It is very important, because the minister's power to exercise his discretion to grant a visa is not compellable, reviewable or delegable. Also, it is exercised in secret. The departmental officials have appeared before the Senate inquiry and said, `We do all this work, these are the steps we go through and this is how we advise whether we think a claim is worth while or not, but then it goes to the minister and out come the results. We can't tell you anything; we're sorry about that.' The department says, `We can't tell you anything about how that decision is made, because it is purely a decision for the minister.'
That would be okay if we were confident that the minister had to use some particular process of reasoning, that he had to measure the claims against some sort of check list. But there is no such check list. In fact, we find the person who has the highest success rate with the minister is a travel agent from Western Sydney. He is not a registered migration agent and is only involved, it seems, at the stage of ministerial intervention and thus would not be covered by any of the provisions in this bill that are supposed to be tightening up a system that the government recognise does have some loopholes and some dodgy practices. 
We have identified a major practice and put focus on it in a way which has moved the government to finally act in this area; but they have left out one of the most critical issues that they could have dealt with. We believe that this is a big issue and that the bill has missed an opportunity to bring some integrity into the system, particularly in the area of ministerial discretion. We are, as I say, talking about large numbers of people who are getting through the process. We are talking about no reasons being given. We have serious questions that have not been answered about whether or not influence is being brought to bear on the minister by friends, Liberal Party donors or other businesspeople.
It seems to us that the previous minister for immigration certainly liked to play God in this area. He certainly seemed happy to say to any individual applicant, `Yes, I'm going to grant yours; no, I'm not going to grant yours.' He was very happy and comfortable with the idea that he was the ultimate decision maker and, perhaps like God, did not have to give any reasons for those decisions. But we are concerned that it went a step beyond that. He was not just interested in playing God; it was more like he was playing the Godfather, going by some of the characters that he surrounded himself with. It seems that every corporate criminal in the country is somehow or other involved in immigration issues. Illegal immigrants turn up. There is the Philippines corporate fraudster Dante Tan. Jim Foo pops up. He was sent off and has now been taken into custody in Singapore. It is not just limited to these cases and those that the member for Reid flagged.
Mr Bob Robertson, a Liberal Party candidate, got particular assistance from the minister in getting his Iraqi father to Australia in a process that no other person was able to access—which was the minister's office personally telling the departmental post to ignore their normal check list. We have got this on email; it is not a wild allegation that I am making. This has been reported before and is publicly available information. Mr Robertson gets his father here, ahead of everybody else who has to wait in the queue. Then the expected happens. As the departmental post advise, an application was made for Mr Bob Robertson's father to stay here. He is here permanently. Since that time, Mr Robertson has been convicted of defrauding the Commonwealth of several million dollars—bizarrely enough, related to ethanol. Some of these things in the world connect to each other.
But it seems to us that there is more than a whiff of corruption in this immigration area. There are some very serious allegations. Some of the most serious allegations have come to light this week—the minister being aware of departmental officials being involved in passport fraud and in encouraging detainees to obtain and travel on false documents. We see the minister now happily scuttle off into another portfolio where he will have responsibility for making the decision about whether or not the Federal Police should investigate these matters. It just goes on and on. It is a web that gets very complicated, and it is one that we will pursue using every avenue. It does not matter to us what portfolio the minister is in. If something dodgy has happened that he has been involved in, that has come about as a result of donations to the Liberal Party, that has come about as a result of his negligence in pursuing matters when they have been raised with him or that has come about as a result of favouritism or friendships, we are going to pursue it.
We are very concerned that this legislation does not do a single thing to help deal with those sorts of allegations. If, as some of the members on the other side of the House who spoke previously said, this bill was really about putting integrity back into the system, we would see some of those matters being addressed in either of these two bills. We do not. And that is why we have moved a second reading amendment to flag our concern that these matters have not been properly pursued and followed up. 
As I say, the measures that were presented here today in the two bills go some way towards tightening up parts of the industry. The member for Reid has flagged the areas of agreement and the areas where we hope to have further discussions with the government. But there is a big gap where some of the most serious allegations have been made. They relate to personal favours, to personal influence, to personal fundraising and to the minister's personal discretion and decisions to grant visas to nearly 2,000 people. Every working day that the minister was in power—be it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday—he granted a visa to someone. We want to make sure that he granted visas to people who deserved them, not to people who just donated money to the Liberal Party or who were in some way friends and favourites of the minister.
This is a system of deregulation that the minister himself was involved in when the government came to power in 1996. We are not going to give the government too much credit or praise for now fixing up something that they clearly broke to start with. We want to help clamp down on those dodgy or shonky agents that are taking advantage of people in vulnerable circumstances, but we want to make sure that the balance is right. We want to make sure that there are checks on the department and on the minister in appropriate circumstances. We want to give MARA enough power to do its job properly. (Time expired)
Debate (on motion by Mrs Gallus) adjourned.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS INTEGRITY MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2003-10-07,"—I thank members for their contributions to this debate. Before I give the government's response in the debate on the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2003, I would like to particularly thank the member for Herbert for his contribution, which was a most lucid and meaningful contribution to the debate. I certainly thank him for that. The member for Lilley could have taken this opportunity to make a real contribution to this debate in the chamber but, regrettably, the standard response from the member for Lilley was grandstanding and beating up on the former Minister for Family and Community Services—blame the person rather than the policy. This has become such a pastime of his that I believe he will sorely miss Senator Vanstone when she moves to her new portfolio.
I acknowledge the contributions made by the members for Shortland, Burke, Greenway and Oxley and also the contribution by the member for Blaxland, who I know has had a very keen interest, particularly in the issue of pensioner entitlements et cetera for people from the Republic of Germany. I acknowledge the work that he has done in the past on this issue. Before I give reasons for the government's follow-through on this bill, I would like to also note that we will be opposing the opposition's amendment to this bill. Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi, whilst I am on my feet I would like to compliment you on the fine rugby skills that you displayed on behalf of the national parliament over the last few days. 
On a more serious note, this bill makes amendments to support several 2003 budget measures. It also makes a small number of non-budget, minor policy or technical changes. Currently, payments made under the laws of Germany or Austria by way of compensation to victims of the National Socialist persecution are excluded from income under the social security and veterans' entitlements income test. More countries are now making such payments—for example, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. This bill will extend the current income exclusion to any such payments, regardless of the country making them, so that this beneficial treatment under the income test will be available to all receiving the payments.
The main cause of incorrect social security payments is failure to disclose income and assets, including cases of serious fraud. Most undisclosed earnings are detected by the comprehensive data-matching arrangements that are currently in place. Concerns about the impact of the cash economy and increasing identity fraud require an enhanced capability to detect fraudulent payments. Centrelink's fraud detection and compliance activities will be enhanced by the amendments in this bill. These amendments will also allow Centrelink limited access to newly available data sources relating to taxation and financial transaction activities for the purpose of the administration of the social security law.
The administration of the child support legislation will benefit from amendments enabling the Child Support Agency to resume access to financial transaction information held in the AUSTRAC database. The agency, which is part of the Department of Family and Community Services, lost this access when it ceased to be part of the Australian Taxation Office in 1988.
On 1 July 2004, responsibility for the operation of the Assurance of Support Scheme will be transferred from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to the Department of Family and Community Services. The scheme will be established under the social security legislation and will be administered by FaCS through Centrelink.
Currently, the responsibility for, and administration of, the scheme is split between DIMIA and FaCS. The new arrangements will improve the administration of the scheme and strengthen recovery of assurance of support debts. Under the new arrangements, DIMIA will continue to decide when an assurance is needed. However, the administration of the scheme—including the assessment of the proposed assurances, their acceptance or rejection, and debt recovery—will be done by Centrelink.
Centrelink will become a single point of contact for assurers. Centrelink's extensive customer service network will provide assurers with easy access to comprehensive information, in their preferred language, about their financial commitments. No assurance will be accepted without an assurer having the nature of the commitment explained in a face-to-face interview. This will enhance awareness on the part of assurers, resulting in fewer migrants claiming income support. The fact that Centrelink will have direct control over all relevant data related to assurers and the migrants covered by the assurers will result in improved recovery from the assurers of the supported debts.
Overseas absences can affect a person's entitlement to, or rate of, social security payment. It is therefore important, Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi—I know you are interested in this area—that customers departing Australia notify Centrelink. Customers leaving Australia without telling Centrelink may incur a debt. To avoid this, amendments have been made so that from 1 July 2004 Centrelink can suspend payments where a person leaves Australia without notifying Centrelink of their departure and where entitlement to the payments while the person is overseas needs to be reviewed. Depending on the outcome of the review, payments will be restored or cancelled. 
Also, the social security debt recovery provisions will now allow for full recovery of overpayments that arise when a foreign pension payment is made as a lump sum in arrears, covering the period during which the customer also received a social security payment. The amount by which a person's social security payment would have been reduced if the arrears had been paid as a periodic payments will be a debt. The effect will be similar for partners of customers who receive these arrears payments, because half a person's arrears payment is counted as a partner's income.
On 1 July 2004, the allowable period of temporary overseas absence for the most portable income support payments and family tax benefit will be reduced from 26 weeks to 13 weeks. This change will not apply to age, wife or widow B pensions, which currently have unlimited portability. The new 13-week portability rule will apply to disability support pensioners, including those who are severely disabled. DSP for the severely disabled currently has unlimited portability.
However, severely disabled customers will be able to receive unlimited portability in defined circumstances. The first is where the pensioner is terminally ill and leaves Australia permanently to be with family or to go to his or her country of origin. The second is where the pensioner is overseas on 1 July 2004 and returns to Australia for a short stay. Also, the existing capacity to extend the portability period where a person is unable to return to Australia will be kept. Some of the reasons may include serious illness of the person or family member or a natural disaster in the country where the person is located. Customers who are overseas on 1 July 2004 will not be affected until they return to Australia. This measure is in line with the government's overall welfare reform strategy, which aims to engage people of work force age in activities in Australia that will lead to greater levels of economic and social participation. I commend the bill to the House.
 (Mr Barresi)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Lilley has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-10-07,"—I rise to speak in support of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003. As I am sure many members of the House are aware, I represent a very diverse electorate which boasts the multicultural communities of Griffith, Leeton and other areas and takes in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. The city of Griffith alone is home to people of 140 nationalities. The MIA was developed by migrants, and the region is recognised as one of this nation's greatest success stories. These migrants and their families, mainly of Italian descent, worked to establish the food bowl of the nation. Immigration is an extremely important issue for my electorate, part-icularly for the communities of Griffith and Leeton. Because it is so important, I run a second office in Griffith that deals primarily with immigration inquiries. The Riverina is also home to a Charles Sturt University campus that attracts large numbers of students from Asia. It is for all these reasons that I have become deeply involved in immigration issues and that I constantly seek ways to assist the Riverina's multicultural communities.
Making application for a visa or for permanent residency, for an individual or for members of their families living in an overseas country, can be an extremely daunting process. Having limited English skills and little or basic knowledge of the system of government and the immigration process can make the task even more difficult. In many instances, applicants enlist the assistance of a migration agent to help them fill out forms, answer questions and generally steer them through this process. Just as a solicitor or an accountant steers clients through the legal and financial systems, the expert migration agents understand their specialty as well. Like solicitors and accountants, migration agents charge for the service they provide.
However, difficulties arise with some of the unscrupulous agents that, unfortunately, we have in this country. There was a review of the statutory self-regulation of the migration advice industry which concluded that the migration advice industry was not yet ready to move towards full self-regulation. The review also made a number of recommendations that will strengthen this industry. The amendments will ensure that the Migration Agents Registration Authority, MARA, has adequate powers to protect consumers and that migration agents operate ethically, professionally and competently when assisting people who want to visit or migrate to Australia.
The issue of immigration can be very emotional and very distressing for some people. Unfortunately, there are some unscrupulous operators who abuse the desperation of applicants, and of those seeking to reunite with their loved ones, to take advantage of people, many of whom speak limited English. In my electorate, people coming through my door indicate that they have paid an enormous amount of money to a migration agent and that the agent can no longer be found, has not provided them with a service, or that papers were sent to an address that was certainly not the residence of the person who was seeking to migrate to Australia. The complaints are long and varied but they all revolve around money—and copious quantities of it. Too many times I have seen such people come through my office door, particularly in Griffith where, as I said, I run a second office. I would say that 98 per cent of the matters dealt with by that office are to do with migration. Too many times, people who come in have lost so much money through dealing with an unscrupulous migration agent.
I recognise that there are agents who do run a very good and commendable service. But there are those who really illustrate the reasons why migration agents still need to come under some regulation. These agents illustrate the need for amendments to clarify and strengthen the requirements for registration as a migration agent; strengthen the offence provisions against providing unregistered immigration assistance; clarify and strengthen the powers of the Migration Agents Registration Authority and DIMIA to investigate complaints against registered agents and allegations of unregistered practice; provide MARA with new powers to sanction migration agents, particularly those who lodge a high number of vexatious, unfounded or incomplete applications; clarify and strengthen requirements for migration agents to produce documents and information to MARA; ensure that civil proceedings cannot be taken against people who refer information about unregistered or registered agents to DIMIA or MARA; facilitate the investigation of complaints by allowing information to be disclosed between MARA, DIMIA, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal; and clarify when details about disciplinary action taken against a migration agent or former agent may be disclosed. 
Australia's migration advice industry was largely unregulated, as we all know, until 1992, when the Migration Agents Registration Scheme was introduced. In 1998, statutory self-regulation was introduced with the aim of preparing the industry for full self-regulation whilst continuing to maintain the consumer protection elements of the previous scheme. MARA's role includes assessing, approving or refusing new registrations and reregistrations, monitoring the conduct of registered agents, investigating complaints against registered agents and applying sanctions where appropriate.
MARA's role, quite rightly, is to regulate the industry and protect those who rely on its services. It protects vulnerable people who have a different culture and language, and a different understanding of the way in which government works in Australia as opposed to the way in which government works in other countries. Some places typically have a very corrupt system of immigration. Fortunately, Australia does not have that system of corruption. However, when people come to Australia, having come from a country where the system of vice and corruption is very profound, they think that the Australian system is the same. That is where you find that migration agents who are not reputable and who do not act responsibly are able to take advantage of people who are extremely vulnerable. MARA can regulate the industry and protect those who rely on agents' services. Without these services, you would find that many applicants would not be able to complete the forms required by the government or complete all the requirements they need to complete before an application is approved. It is very important that we have migration agents, but they must be registered and they must be trustworthy.
The 2001-02 review was the second review of MARA's role since 1998. It concluded that regulatory intervention was still necessary to address a number of concerns. These concerns included the quality of service being provided by some agents, the level of professionalism within the industry and the continuing vulnerability of some client groups. By keeping the migration agent industry regulated for a longer period of time, the government is able to ensure that the industry remains committed to both its clients and its crucial role in communities throughout Australia. Whilst the government recognises that many migration agents are professional and committed to providing the best level of service and advice to their clients, there are those in the industry, as I have indicated, who will continue to abuse their position of trust and fail to assist their vulnerable clients. This only adds to discontent and mistrust in the industry. By maintaining an external body to regulate the industry, we can work at improving this industry, ensuring better outcomes for its consumers.
The Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003 amends the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Act 1997, firstly, to enable MARA to charge agents for changing from non-commercial to commercial status. In the past, some migration agents have been able to avoid paying the higher commercial agent registration fee. By registering as a non-commercial agent but providing immigration assistance on a commercial basis during their 12-month registration period, agents can avoid the higher fee. To improve this situation, this bill will require these agents to pay a pro rata amount of the commercial application fee. It will also make provision for outlining when an agent starts to provide immigration assistance on a commercial basis. 
At this stage, it is important that an external body can still keep a check on the actions and conduct of migration agents and provide an avenue of assistance to those with complaints about migration agents. Without regulation there will be no avenues for assistance for those who have not received an acceptable level of service. Regulation will continue to make the migration agent industry accountable to the consumer and the government. We need to ensure that the migration agent industry continues to provide the very best level of service to its customers.
Immigration continues to be an extremely important issue not only in my electorate of Riverina but also right across Australia. People will continue to apply for visas and such and they will continue to seek to reunite with their families here in Australia. So it is imperative that we have a migration agent industry that services its customers professionally and, indeed, ethically. It is crucial that migration agents have a valued reputation in assisting a range of applicants, many with complicated circumstances. Serious and complicated circumstances arise for families that need to be united or that, for some reason, need to leave their home country in order to obtain refuge. Enabling MARA to act against migration agents who lodge high numbers of unfounded or incomplete applications will only improve the integrity of our migration program.
The unethical practices of some agents have caused the government and the judicial review bodies substantial administrative and legal costs. These funds could certainly be better implemented in meeting the needs of and providing services for migrants. My electorate of Riverina and, I am sure, a great many others with a significant multicultural flavour will welcome this with open arms. They will be able to see that, in future, they will be able to trust the system. They will see that the government will ensure that, when they are dealing with an agent, they are dealing with somebody who is reputable and who is there to meet their needs and foster some really important initiatives for them in becoming an Australian citizen or, alternatively, in bringing somebody else here to become an Australian citizen. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS INTEGRITY MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I rise to support the principle of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003, which I will refer to as the integrity measures bill. This is a cognate debate on two bills—the integrity measures bill and the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003. I will only be speaking to the integrity measures bill. Further, I support the foreshadowed second reading amendment to be moved in the House by the shadow minister for citizenship and multicultural affairs, the member for Reid, Mr Laurie Ferguson. I note that the opposition plans to continue communicating with the government following the introduction of this bill in the House on 17 September 2003, and I encourage the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and the government to engage meaningfully with the opposition on this bill, so serious are its ramifications for good governance of the current migration system.
The bill has wide-reaching implications and there are three groups of public interest stakeholders. The first is all migration agents and legal practitioners who are affected by this legislation. The second is all persons who use migration agency services. This public interest group includes two broad groups of persons: (a) visa applicants and those relying upon migration assistance and migration representation from any person as defined in the Migration Act; and (b) other affected parties who have a statutory, financial, matrimonial, emotional or other interest in the success of the visa application. This public interest group includes spouses of immigrants, parents, children, business sponsors, remaining relatives, carers, professional bodies and prospective employers. This bill therefore affects every Australian, either directly or indirectly. That is the third group. 
So what is the purpose of this bill? I refer to the draft Bills Digest at page 1, which says that the purpose of this bill is to implement two key recommendations contained in the 2001-02 report to government, Review of statutory self-regulation of the migration advice industry. The two key recommendations concerned (a) sound knowledge requirements for registration as a migration agent, and (b) sanctions for large numbers of vexatious visa applications. The migration agents and legal practitioners agree that there are a number of unscrupulous migration agents and legal practitioners who bring their professions into disrepute and harm client interests. The honest migration agents and legal practitioners support the need to take action against the relatively small number of unscrupulous agents and legal practitioners. However, this bill does not address the needs and aspirations of the greater number of honest, hardworking migration agents and legal practitioners.
This bill introduces new, wide-ranging, capricious and discretionary powers which are to be solely in the hands of the minister. This new power is yet another power in a long line of existing discretionary non-compellable powers. In other words, the minister has absolute powers for which she is not publicly accountable. We know the dangers of that, as we have witnessed in this House with the prosecution during question time of the previous minister in relation to the cash for visas scandal.
I know that migration agents and legal practitioners are outraged by this legislation because this legislation will do little to curtail the adverse practices of migration agents via so-called vexatious visa applications, nor further the cause of de jure migration agent certification. The bill is misguided for two reasons. First, unscrupulous migration agents will continue to act that way anyway. As with any other legislation that prescribes a policy of deterrence, unscrupulous migration agents will continue to make migration representations and offer migration assistance to advise their clients to lodge vexatious visa applications anyway. Second, if it is the purpose of this bill to sanction vexatious visa applications, it fails miserably in its attempt. This legislation further falsely assumes that a vexatious application is one which fails in its application. The latter does not follow necessarily. It is an arrogant presumption embedded within this legislation that says that, if a visa application fails in which you offered migration assistance or made migration representations, it is therefore a vexatious application.
The purpose of this bill is to give the minister and, ultimately, the department a discretionary power to strike off any agent they deem not fit to hold a practising certificate. The purpose of this legislation has nothing to do with the agent's integrity. Again, this bill makes the bill's very name a marketing tool in order to win public popularity, whilst the actual purpose of this bill is something very different to that which the name says. You cannot judge a book by its cover, so the saying goes. You certainly cannot know this government's legislative intent by the names of their bills either. I might cite the `procedural fairness' legislative amendments to the Migration Act in 1998, which actually erased natural justice rights of visa applicants, as a moot point.  
This power is based on the so-called refusal rate of the migration agent's case history. At once this is anathema to a long history of well-established legal principles. First and foremost, it is a fundamental right of a person to be represented by a legally competent person in any jurisdiction, even if their case would otherwise be considered a hopeless case. However, this legislation now hangs a sword of Damocles over the head of the migration agents, who will be in fear of taking on a difficult migration case, on the basis that it could be a losing case. 
This raises another significant point regarding this bill: what is the `high visa refusal rate' anyway? It is proposed that a new definition will be inserted into part 3 of the act to accommodate this. There are a plethora of variations in this matter. The definition seems to mean that visa refusal or success will determine the visa refusal rate. Does that mean a visa refused at the primary decision stage and subsequently successful on appeal still counts as a high success rate?
A visa refusal can find its way to ultimate success via a wide range of appeals structures: the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court of Australia, the High Court and the minister under her wide number of discretionary statutory powers. That means that a visa refusal introduces a statutory interest in the decision at the appeals stage or at referral to the minister under one of her non-compellable discretionary powers. This is particularly so with respect to section 501 of the Migration Act, a discretionary power which prescribes the character test at subsection 501(6). This power, if exercised, may cancel a visa after it is granted. So I ask: does a visa cancellation under section 501 count as a visa refusal for the purpose of this draft bill?
Noted and merited legal practitioners describe this draft bill as unworkable. It is an unworkable bill. We are told that the substantive provisions of this bill will be found in subsequent regulatory amendments. The mind boggles as to what regulatory amendments the legal profession can expect. These disallowable instruments will not pass through this House. They will go undetected and, even if they are detected, any disallowance motion will be defeated by the government for the purpose of again ramming through the intent of the legislation. It raises the question of why the government is ramming this legislation through. Is it to cull the number of agents? Is it to ensure that only the big end of town succeeds in mopping up on the migration agency business and runs the smaller operators out of the profession? The intention cannot be to protect consumers and public interest holders. The real solution is to adopt the recommendations to be put by the shadow minister for citizenship and multicultual affairs, the member for Reid, and to defer the passage of the bill until real dialogue occurs between the government and the opposition. 
The proposed amendments violate an inalienable right of a person to be represented even if there is little prospect of success in a case due to factors that may or may not be the fault of the applicant. A person is allowed to be adequately represented even if they know their case is not a winner. It is a basic right of any person in natural law that they are allowed to advocate their case irrespective of the prospects of success. Yes, there are notable legal and procedural exceptions. However, this legislation creates a statutory incentive for the migration agent and a good many legal practitioners to say, `No, I will not take your instructions, on the basis that your case is too risky and I fear losing the application. For this reason, I refuse to represent you.' 
In this new statutory regime, it is highly likely that the actual consequence of the legislation will be exactly the opposite of the effect intended. Like the dodgy brothers, only the desperate and disreputable migration agent or legal practitioner will take carriage of a matter that no other agent would dare shoulder. However, by then the damage from the legislative scheme will be done. The client will have the door slammed in their face by those agents who, but for the legislation, would have advocated their cause to the best of their professional skill and expertise. Put another way, the visa success or failure rate is not dependent upon the win or loss rate of agents. Such legislative schemes are legal reductionism—a point I have made in this House consistently over the last five years. By `legal reductionism' I mean reducing law to a discrete and simple list of dos and don'ts or ins and outs. The success or failure of a migration agent or legal practitioner cannot be reduced to such a discrete list. What is 50 per cent supposed to mean in terms of success or failure? How will the agent or legal practitioner ever be able to challenge the veracity of such a statistic anyway? Under section 306A, at page 5 the Bills Digest notes:
... the Minister is empowered ... to refer a migration agent for disciplinary action by the Migration Agents Registration Authority if the agent has a high visa refusal rate ...
The provisions of new section 306A cannot work for the very reasons to which I have previously referred. The bill, its provisions and the manner in which it has been rammed through this House raise serious issues concerning fairness, democratic process and efficient parliamentary government. This bill introduces yet another non-compellable discretionary power in the hands of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Yet again, this bill ensures that the line between the legislature and the executive is further blurred to the point where the executive is at once capable of commanding its will on the legislature to give itself unwieldy and unchallengeable power in the hands of one person.
Indeed, the ambit of discretionary powers is breathtaking in its arrogance of non-accountability. Perhaps the only passage of legislation that applies that surpasses this arrogance is that of the statutory amendments to the Migration Act which ensure that in many provisions of the act—again, for example, section 501—there is a statutory provision that the rules of natural justice do not apply to that provision. This incredible provision means that this government has seen itself fit to abrogate the application of the natural law to laws of its own making, thereby assuming a power that transcends reason. This is not an isolated example. There is now a long line of laws made by this government going back to the 38th parliament whereby it has systematically assumed power far and beyond its natural mandate. A point has been reached in jurisprudence where this government has usurped for itself an immediate right of power, altogether losing sight of the fact that the government is a body that has only mediate rights and is ultimately accountable to its elected constituencies. Government cannot make laws that defy the natural law. If a government does so, it does so arrogantly. Ultimately a law that defies the natural law is no law at all.
This government cannot draft a law that defies reason—as it systematically continues to do. In its drive for power, it will lose it. History is replete with examples of governments that applied tyranny and came crashing down. That is what will happen here if this law is passed. If it is the intention of this government to make laws to curb the unscrupulous agents then, in my view, this is not the way. There are other control devices that are reflected in the shadow minister's foreshadowed amendments, which I support.  
I also want to raise a most serious procedural matter directly relevant to the passage of this bill in this House tonight going to the constitutional conventions being applied—or, more accurately, routinely ignored—by the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and the Government Whip. I refer to the House of Representatives Practice, 4th edition, at page 79. Under the chapter entitled `House, government and opposition' it states:
Fair, democratic and efficient parliamentary government calls for:
	the provision of reasonable parliamentary time for opposition purposes;
	...	...	...
	the provision of information and resources (to reduce the wide gap in information availability between Government and Opposition); and
	the provision of procedural advice and drafting assistance when necessary.
During the last five years, I have kept copies of many of the draft daily programs issued by the Department of the House of Representatives. The published prospective draft daily program bears little, if any, resemblance—as a rule rather than an exception—to the actual order of business in this House. Changes in the government order of business are expected. It is a constitutional right of the government to be free to make changes so as to not hamstring the government in adjusting to the daily occurrence of business, and I accept that. However, there are limits. It is all too easy to say that changes were inevitable. It is long known that this government flagrantly uses this privilege to deny the opposition party in this House or the Senate, let alone any other public interest holder, reasonable time in which to marshal their case in response to the introduction of a bill into this House or the Senate.
The facts with respect to the passage of this bill are that on 17 September 2003 this bill was introduced into this House and on that same day the debate was adjourned. Today, 7 October 2003, this bill is being read for a second time. In my opinion, these bills are being ramrodded through. There is no legal or other binding duty on the government or opposition to abide by the provisions of the constitutional convention; nonetheless, it must be binding in spirit, otherwise the ordering of opposition business becomes impossible. Cynically, this appears to be the deliberate intention of government. In my view, it is the intention of this government to systematically refuse to give validity and due recognition to the constitutional conventions that are supposed to be honored by the government party in this House.
In House of Representatives Practice, Harris notes that the role of the opposition is `critical' to the good management of the House and the parliament. He says: 
A primary function of the whole House, through its role of scrutiny and criticism, is to exercise an oversight of the actions of the Government. In modern times, the Opposition has a critical role in this and, thus, the functions of the Opposition have become identified and linked with the role and more important functions of the House. These functions include ... scrutiny of, criticism of, and suggestion of improvements to legislation and financial proposals ...
I put it to the House that the timing of the introduction of this bill into the House on 17 September 2003 and the timetable of debate for the second reading speech tonight are unreasonable. I further put it to this House that the fact the BillsDigest is unavailable at this time is tantamount to show that the bill has caught everyone off guard by the shortness of time. I do not criticise the Department of the Parliamentary Library, the DPL, for this because they allocate their resources very efficiently and are expert in drafting the Bills Digest, which, as you know Mr Deputy Speaker, is the de jure policy advice for members of this House who seek to be briefed on the details of a bill. 
The fact that this bill has literally caught the DPL off guard is testimony to the fact that this bill is being rushed through. Indeed, it is one of many examples of legislation that is rushed through deliberately whenever the government forms the view that any little public interest stakeholder may raise objection to an item of legislation. In short, this government's flagrant abuse of parliamentary procedure is a deliberate gagging tactic to thwart meaningful debate on this most serious bill. The point has indeed been reached where a capricious, undemocratic and tyrannical mode of governance is driving the government order of business to a point of erasure of longstanding constitutional conventions.
In concluding, I commend the foreshadowed amendment by the member for Reid. I commend the continued dialogue between government and opposition parties and call upon the minister to open this debate to the public interest stakeholders, particularly the greater body of migration agents and the legal profession, so they can comment on the provisions of this bill. I think that is the least we can do, because they are the ones who are most affected by this legislation. It is totally inappropriate to have a bill rushed through the parliament without proper consideration and input from those who are to be most affected by the bill. I hope the minister at the table takes that back to the government on behalf of the opposition. It will serve our democracy better if we get more time to discuss the bill.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I commend the member for Lowe for his contribution to this debate on the legislation before the House. He has canvassed some of the more philosophical issues associated with this particular bill, and also some of the practical administrative difficulties as far as the presentation of this legislation to the House is concerned. I rise to support the second reading amendment proposed by the shadow minister for citizenship and multicultural affairs, the member for Reid, in the debate on the two bills before the House: the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003 and the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003. That amendment has been tabled in the House, and I will comment on elements of the amendment later on in the debate. First, let me preface my remarks with some general comments on the need for legislation to strengthen this whole administrative area. Members like me who have a high proportion of residents from a non-English-speaking background—in the case of Corio it is over 20 per cent—know all too well how important integrity in the administration of the migration program is to our constituents. Given the way the advice system is structured at the moment, it is absolutely imperative that the business of providing migration advice and administrative support is conducted with honesty and with integrity by all who are registered to provide advice. There can be no place for uninformed, misleading or deliberately deceptive advice, especially where fees are charged to assist clients.
There is always a fair degree of personal emotional investment in migration applications as those who are Australian citizens seek to have family join them in Australia, to bring in a prospective spouse or to assist a friend who desires to come and settle in this great country. It is incumbent on governments to make sure that the processes of application and assessment have integrity and that the practitioners are qualified to give accurate and honest advice to consumers. When Labor first introduced a compulsory registration system for migration agents, our purpose was to provide consumers with adequate protection against unscrupulous and dishonest agents. It is a cause of some regret that the former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, and the government pursued a policy of virtually dismantling that system and introduced a system aimed at voluntary self-regulation—admirable, you might say, but, as history has shown, not successful in maintaining the standards and protection required for consumers. 
There are three main measures in this legislation which in themselves are an admission that the system which has grown up under the Howard government is seriously flawed and deficient and requires substantial further amendment. Firstly, the bill seeks to strengthen the sound knowledge requirement for new registrations as an agent. I would have thought it goes without saying that anybody who seeks to enter this industry and to provide advice on this rather complex area of law—and there were 772 people seeking to become migration agents in 2002-03 alone—should possess a sound knowledge of migration policy and procedures.
The second measure in this bill is aimed at strengthening existing penalties against unregistered practice and other offences. There can be no compromise on this matter as far as any government is concerned. Unregistered agents have no place in giving professional advice to consumers who wish to access the migration program for their relatives or friends. It should be a fundamental principle in this legislation that the full force of the law and the penalties in the legislation be brought to bear against those who seek to give advice as unregistered agents. We have seen that under a voluntary, self-regulating system there have been people who have been very free in giving advice—and in many cases bad advice—who have charged clients like wounded bulls for the privilege of giving them that bad advice. So it is extremely important that the penalties under this legislation are strengthened to make sure that those unregistered practitioners are weeded out of the industry.
The third measure contained in this legislation relates to the introduction of a system to profile agents in relation to success rates with visa and review applications and also to provide a mechanism to sanction agents that are responsible for the submission of vexatious applications. Given the law as it is structured today, and given current migration procedures, we know that it is an unseemly side of the industry that many practitioners giving migration advice have on occasions abused the system and made repeated vexatious claims that not only are costly to clients but also make it very difficult for the procedures under this legislation to be effectively administered. This is a very contentious area of the legislation. In the remaining time available to me tonight before the adjournment debate, I refer people who are interested in this matter to the speech given by the member for Lowe. He was very detailed and very thorough in canvassing some of the problems and complexities associated with this particular measure in the legislation.
I will turn to the second reading amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Reid. I will not deal with all of the six elements contained in that amendment. With the remaining time available to me, suffice it to say that I support the amendment. I think points 2 and 3 are worthy of some debate before the House. In point 2 of his second reading amendment the member for Reid expressed the opposition's dismay. It says: 
... that the Government has allowed privileged access to Ministers, and Ministerial and Departmental staff, to a number of unregistered agents who are close associates of the Coalition ...
Point 3 notes:
... growing concern about the Ministerial intervention process, particularly in so far as it is entails unequal access by certain groups and individuals and arbitrary and non-transparent decision making by the Minister ...
You cannot have integrity among migration agents in the industry when you do not have integrity in government. We have seen that, over the past months of sittings of this parliament, the opposition have exposed the Howard government for what we consider to be unseemly practices totally lacking in integrity in this particular area.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I have raised the issue of health on many occasions in this House and I have always been disappointed with the response from the government. On many occasions I have brought to the House my concern about the doctor shortage on the Central Coast. On many occasions I have begged ministers to act to assist the people on the Central Coast to get more doctors in their area and to increase their access to health services. I have also raised the issue relating to the people of Lake Macquarie.
It is very interesting to look at the demographics of the electorate I represent in this parliament. It is the 10th oldest in Australia. In addition to that, the Central Coast, as well as being an older area, has a very young population. It is a very transient population, with a big turnover. People move to the area from Sydney, find that they do not have the resources and do not have the access to health care that they need and then move back to Sydney.
The recently released bulk-billing figures have shown that the bulk-billing rate in Shortland is now down to 46.7 per cent. I find this absolutely appalling. It was well over 70 per cent back in 2000. When I started raising this issue, in September 2000, the government ignored what I had to say—they ignored the people of Shortland—and they have just refused to act. And what has happened? We have had this constant decline—fewer and fewer doctors; bulk-billing for fewer and fewer services—in an area where the majority of people are on some sort of Centrelink payment. The most disadvantaged area in my electorate, an area that is possibly the most disadvantaged in the whole of Australia, does not have a doctor who bulk-bills. One of the first acts of this government was to close the Medicare office at Belmont, which necessitates people travelling a long distance to be able to access a Medicare office. Many of those older people are unable even to drive. Therefore it is something like an hour's trip on a bus to get to their nearest Medicare office.
This heartless, cruel, mean-spirited government has failed to act to address the health needs and the health issues within the Shortland electorate. I really believe that this does not end with the Shortland electorate; it is the same throughout the whole of Australia. Instead of delivering services and access to doctors, this government has let its philosophical opposition to Medicare flavour its response to these health care needs. 
I have a few surveys here that I have received from people in my electorate. One lady even indicated on the survey that she returned to my office that she has recently moved to the area from the eastern suburbs of Sydney—Rose Bay, to be exact—in the electorate of Wentworth, which is one of the wealthier electorates in Australia, and she travels from Shortland electorate to Rose Bay to see a doctor so that she can have a doctor that bulk-bills. It is cheaper for her to travel by train—I think it is $2.50 return—to Sydney so she can see a doctor that bulk-bills than to go to a doctor who charges $46. According to the surveys, doctors are charging a range of fees: $40; $46; $49; according to this response, for a pensioner it is an extra $12; for this person, $12.50; for another person, $12.50; $38; $37.50. These are the fees that doctors are charging pensioners within my electorate.
I think I would be very remiss if I did not just quickly link into the medical indemnity crisis. Eleven doctors have withdrawn their services from the Central Coast area health services. Local GPs have visited my office and told me what a crisis there is: the doctor shortage in those communities, communities without doctors, surgeries closing and an elderly population. What disturbs me more than anything is that there are Liberal members of this parliament who have done nothing. They have not joined with me in demanding that the government act to resolve these problems. I saw the member for Dobell sitting behind the minister today when he was speaking. It makes me so angry that his only contribution to trying to get more doctors to our area and to get more doctors to bulk-bill is to sit behind the minister when he makes a speech. It is not good enough. The people of the Central Coast expect better from their members, and I call on him to join with me in fighting for better resources for our area.
