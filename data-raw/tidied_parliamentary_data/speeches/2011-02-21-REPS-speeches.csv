"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Climate Change Environment and the Arts I present the committee’s report entitled Advisory Report on the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes and proceedings.
Ordered that the document be made a parliamentary paper.
—In presenting this report I advise the House that the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill repeals and replaces the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act of 2005. The bill also restores some review and procedural fairness rights in the process of selecting a site for a facility. It also preserves the previous nomination of Muckaty Station.
The bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Climate Change Environment and the Arts by the selection committee on 21 October 2010. On 25 November 2010 the member for Melbourne was appointed as a supplementary member to the committee for the purpose of this inquiry, and he has submitted a dissenting report.
The committee takes very seriously its responsibility in dealing with a matter referred to it by the parliament and it certainly did so with the inquiry into this bill. When a bill is referred to a committee there are no terms of reference. In determining the nature of the inquiry into the bill the committee noted the long history associated with this matter and, in particular, previous parliamentary inquiries. In fact, there were four separate Senate inquiries into this bill.
The committee noted that the original bill had been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee on 4 February 2010. That committee reported back in May 2010, which effectively means that it had reported back to the House only a few months before this bill was again referred to the committee. The Senate committee had conducted an extensive public inquiry, in which 238 submissions were received and two public hearings were held—one in Darwin and one in Canberra, if I recall correctly.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee made six recommendations and Greens senator Scott Ludlam presented a dissenting report at the time. The recommendations of the Senate committee were substantially addressed in the revised bill. The Standing Committee on Climate Change and Environment and the Arts also considered the matters raised by Senator Ludlam in the Senate committee inquiry’s dissenting report—in particular, the concern with respect to the dispute about the Muckaty Station nomination. I make it clear that the committee took that dispute very seriously. The compliance with environmental and nuclear radiation standards and the federal minister’s powers were also raised by Senator Ludlam in his dissenting report.
On each of these matters the committee was satisfied that the bill should be debated in the parliament. This bill specifically deals with a site nomination process. The nomination of a site does not guarantee the establishment of a radioactive waste facility. The Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Act; the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 will all need to be complied with, including all relevant public consultation provisions, before a radioactive waste facility is approved.
I will just turn back to the nomination of the Muckaty Station. With respect to the Muckaty Station nomination the committee noted that the dispute is currently before the Federal Court. The committee concluded that it would be inappropriate for it to inquire into a matter currently before the courts. In fact, the committee felt that it would be improper for it to do so. The committee also noted that the minister had indicated that the government would respect the court’s decision.
This history of reports and inquiries associated with this matter date back to 2005 and earlier. As I said a moment ago, there have already been four public inquiries into issues associated with this very matter by Senate committees. There exists throughout the community ideological differences on matters associated with the nuclear industry. The committee accepts that. These ideological differences will not be resolved by more costly public inquiries, whether they are by House committees, by Senate committees or by another public body. Ultimately the parliament, through its publicly elected members, will have to decide. The committee, in recommending that the Radioactive Waste Management Act be approved, concluded that the parliament, through its publicly elected members, will ultimately have to resolve this matter.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Climate Change, Environment and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,1,1
"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-02-21,"—We are dealing here with a report into a very important bill—one which will establish Australia’s first nuclear waste dump—and one might expect a rigorous engagement process with full public hearings. Instead, this report—one of the first of its kind presented to this House in the life of this parliament—has not lived up to provisions in the standing orders given to standing committees or to the spirit of open debate and a more collegiate approach to legislation with which this parliament began.
The standing committee had the opportunity to scrutinise the bill, to address its serious deficiencies, to invite public submissions and to recommend improvements. It had until the end of the autumn sittings to do any of these things. It has chosen to do none and deliver an astonishingly brief report three months earlier than required. The extent to which the report has failed to assist members in their decision making is evident in that the committee has left us with no more information with which to proceed than when the bill was referred to the committee in October.
It is worth briefly revisiting the reasons why this bill needed to be referred to the standing committee in the first place. Despite an inquiry being held into an earlier iteration of the bill—an inquiry conducted by the Senate’s Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee—it did not sufficiently scrutinise the bill on environmental and scientific grounds. It was narrowly premised and flawed, and despite taking evidence from sources outside of government, which is more than can be said for the House standing committee, serious questions remained. First, the framework for managing radioactive waste, most notably the lack of procedural fairness or avenues for judicial review, and a lack of sound science being used to inform it. Second, the heavy-handed wholesale overriding of state and territory laws. The suspension of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, the exclusion of the Native Title Act and the suspension of the Judicial Review Act have not been justified. Third, there is a complete failure to uphold international best practice, particularly in relation to securing social licence and community acceptance of a radioactive waste facility. And, last, the bill still gives excessive discretionary power to the minister, who will be able to operate with a minimum of transparency.
The siting decision for the nation’s first radioactive waste dump will be subject to less oversight than we would consider appropriate for a shopping centre car park. The House standing committee has resolved none of these questions. In failing to call for submissions, it has based its findings on a single briefing from officials of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.
If we were to be true to our commitments to more robust and consultative legislative debate, the House would resolve to return the bill to the standing committee with the clear instruction that it does not expect to see the bill again until its provisions and its consequences have been properly scrutinised. The committee could then take evidence from those Aboriginal custodians who have found themselves on the front line of this long-running battle to have the government listen to their concerns.
The Senate inquiry into the bill had, after all, a recommendation—recommendation No. 1—that
... as soon as possible the Minister for Resources Energy and Tourism undertake consultations with all parties with an interest in or who would be affected by a decision to select the Muckaty Station site as the location for the national radioactive waste facility.
The minister is yet to do so, and the standing committee has failed to properly explain why this is the case.
Members in this place received a letter from the traditional owners of the relevant land trust, the Manuwangku/Warlmanpa Land Trust, late last year, which read:
The last two governments didn’t listen to us—you must be different. We have been fighting for the last five years to say we don’t want the waste dump in the land. We are again inviting Minister Martin Ferguson and all members of the new parliament to come down and face us in our own country. Come and sit with us and hear the stories from the land.
This committee report was an opportunity to take up that invitation and to date, despite the committee report, there has not been a meeting with the relevant traditional owners, who do not want this waste dump on their land.
Every member in this place has a duty to ensure that their decisions are informed by the best information available, and are made in the best interests of the people of Australia. Members, therefore, have every right to be disappointed in the lack of information they now have before them with which to proceed to a debate on this bill. I sincerely hope that the rushed process chosen by the standing committee does not set a precedent for future reports.
Finally, I would like to pay special thanks to the secretary, Julia Morris, and other staff of this committee, all of whom served the committee professionally.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Climate Change, Environment and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,1,1

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee’s report entitled Report 114: Treaties referred on 16 November 2010 (part 1).
Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
—The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report No. 114 contains 21 international instruments tabled in the 42nd Parliament but not reported on before last year’s election. Under the committee’s resolution of appointment, Foreign Affairs Minister Kevin Rudd referred these treaties for consideration again in the new parliament late last year. This report represents the first part of the committee’s consideration of the 40 treaties referred.
Of the treaties considered in this report, three are important to Australia’s international security. Australia’s Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement with the United States updates the framework for reciprocal provision of defence logistic support supplies and services formerly agreed to in 1998. As members may be aware, mutual logistic support agreements do not cover sharing of major weapons systems or munitions. Rather, they support peaceful deployments. Such agreements largely follow a set model, addressing such matters as reciprocal pricing principles. However, for this new agreement Australian negotiators have achieved additional provisions. To protect Australia’s interests in the event of injury or damage to personnel or material support, new liability and claims provisions are inserted. The previous Acquisition and Cross-servicing Agreement with the United States has been critical to joint deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East and in the Pacific. The updated agreement will carry forward this framework for defence cooperation into the future.
I turn now to Australia’s agreement with the Republic of Korea on the protection of classified military information, which also advances an important strategic arrangement. This agreement reflects the regional security interests of both Australia and the Republic of Korea. It does not create any new obligations for Australia, but formalises an established and beneficial information-sharing arrangement between our two nations for defence cooperation purposes.
Thirdly, Australia’s agreement with the United States for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy updates an important bilateral treaty with both strategic and commercial underpinnings. The United States currently imports more than half Australia’s exported uranium. Some of this—around 36 per cent—fuels the US power sector; the remainder is processed for utilities in other countries. This agreement will continue this trade for an initial period of 30 years, subject to review every five years. For its validation, the United States must meet stringent safeguards and security provisions to ensure that the exported uranium is used only for peaceful purposes. The Australian government has indicated it will continue to advocate for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and its adoption by the United States.
Report 114 also reviews taxation arrangements between Australia and 19 other jurisdictions to bring them into alignment with OECD standards. Two are double-taxation agreements with Chile and Malaysia respectively. The convention with Chile for the avoidance of double taxation is intended as a comprehensive measure to reform withholding tax arrangements while also reducing the potential for tax evasion. Australia signed a similar agreement with Malaysia on 24 February last year. The third protocol to that agreement amends it to enable greater exchange of taxation information. The common object of the remaining 15 taxation agreements is the elimination of harmful tax practices in low-tax jurisdictions.
Partner countries with significant currency flows include Vanuatu, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, Monaco, St Lucia and Samoa. The committee believes ratifications of all these treaties will be beneficial to Australia and to the agreement parties. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that binding treaty action be taken in relation to all instruments considered in this report, and I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committeee</title>,Committees,2,1

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I present the report on the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia, Brunei and Laos, 11 to 24 April 2010.
Each year, the Australian parliament supports a delegation to three member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. As part of this program, I, along with my colleagues Mr Duncan Kerr and Dr Mal Washer, travelled to Indonesia, Brunei and Laos in April last year. The delegation’s activities and visits centred around three themes: environmental challenges, strategies to reduce poverty, and the importance of strengthening links between parliaments and people. In each of the host countries, the delegation learned of the environmental challenges faced and the programs developed to deal with those challenges as well as their hopes for the future.
In Central Kalimantan in Indonesia, the delegation witnessed the work taking place in rehabilitating degraded peat lands and the sustainable management of peat swamp forests in an effort to reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. The catastrophic impact that deforestation has on wildlife was also seen during our visit to a rehabilitation centre for wild orangutans in the same area, and the link between land degradation, increasing population levels and the impact of natural disasters was highlighted again during a visit to the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction.
In Laos, significant environmental issues confront the Mekong region. Seventy million people live in the Mekong Basin and future projections indicate increases in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns and more frequent, severe and longer periods of drought. The delegation witnessed how Australia is working closely with Mekong governments to try to manage these critical water resources. At the same time as we saw the tragic consequences of environmental degradation, the delegation was encouraged by the extraordinary achievements the small country of Brunei has been able to make in managing its pristine rainforests, which cover 70 per cent of its landmass, through the Heart of Borneo initiative. Each of these visits reinforced in the minds of delegation members not only the fragility of the planet but the commonality of issues in this region.
Poverty in both Indonesia and Laos is widespread. The delegation was pleased to be able to see the positive impact Australian aid has in a number of communities. We got a fantastic welcome when we visited a village health clinic and a junior secondary school in Central Kalimantan, both of which have benefited from Australian aid dollars. We have been having a bit of a debate about overseas aid recently and I wish some of the aid sceptics could visit these projects and see how much goodwill they generate. People there like us. It is a much better way to spend taxpayers’ dollars. Ramping up the defence budget breeds a circle of suspicion, mistrust and arms races, whereas aid fosters a virtuous circle of trust and goodwill.
In Laos, 25 per cent of villages are contaminated by unexploded ordnances that remain as a result of the extensive US bombing during the Indochina conflict. These UXOs not only render land inaccessible but create perpetual insecurity for these communities: villagers are sometimes forced to choose between acute poverty or risking injury and death by cultivating contaminated land. The delegation was appalled by the experiences the people of Laos endure as a result of these UXOs. It is the view of the delegation that the United States should match its responsibility for the horror caused by the UXOs with financial support to reduce the human toll and render the land useable in order to reduce poverty in this region.
The delegation was also pleased to visit Brunei, this being the first Australian parliamentary delegation to have travelled to that country. The meetings held there and, indeed, in each host country reiterated the value of strengthening the friendship and links between parliaments and people. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank the many individuals and organisations in all the host countries who were generous with their hospitality, insights and knowledge. I would also like to thank the delegation secretary, Dr Kris Veenstra, for her support. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia, Brunei and Laos, 11 to 24 April 2010</title>",Delegation Reports,3,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I present the Assisting the Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2010. This bill is an important acknowledgement of the debt that this country owes to people who have been injured or killed in the course of terrorist incidents overseas. We should never forget the high price that Australia has paid due to the efforts and depredations of Islamist terrorists. Since September 11 in 2001, some 300 Australians have been killed or injured in terrorist incidents overseas. We lost Australians in the World Trade Centre. We lost Australians, too many Australians, in Bali—not once but twice. We lost Australians in London and we lost Australians in Jakarta. Some 300 Australians have been killed or injured because they were Australians.
Let us never forget that those bombs went off because the perpetrators of those outrages believe that our way of life is a satanic excrescence—that is what they believe. People who died or were injured in those terrorist incidents were targeted precisely because of the way of life, the values and the civilisation of which they were a part. Australians have been targeted precisely because they are Australians. Australia has been targeted precisely because we are a part of the Western civilisation and the value system which those terrorists hate. It is very important to remember that Australians overseas were killed or injured precisely because they were Australians.
After each terrorist incident I just mentioned the Australian government was there to help. Centrelink assistance was rendered and medical expenses were paid. I want to congratulate governments of both persuasions for the efforts they made to help Australians and to continue to help Australians who were injured and the families of those who were killed in terrorist incidents overseas. But we have to acknowledge that these people suffered for their country in a way not entirely different from the sufferings that our soldiers have faced in the struggle against terrorism. They were not random victims; they were victims because of the way of life in this country and they were chosen as targets because of the way of life of the civilisation in which they participate.
We should not underestimate the ongoing suffering of those people. The member for Paterson and I have some familiarity with the Newcastle victims of the second Bali bombing. Many of them have had to give up their jobs and all of them will suffer permanently because of what they endured at the hands of Islamist terrorism. We cannot think that our duty to them as a nation ends simply because they were given Centrelink assistance to come back to this country and simply because their relatives were given Centrelink assistance to do what they could to help. We cannot think that our duty to them has ended just because their medical expenses were paid for the immediate injuries they suffered. There is a lifetime of pain for those people, physical and psychological, and it needs to be acknowledged, recognised and in some way made up for by the wider Australian community. I want to particularly thank Paul Anicich, one of the Newcastle victims of the second Bali bombing and a former senior partner in the Sparke Helmore law firm, for his continuing campaign on behalf of all the Australian victims of overseas terrorism.
My bill proposes that the national government establish a scheme to compensate the Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts that is analogous with the victims of crimes schemes that have long operated in the Australian states and territories. If an Australian is a victim of a criminal act in this country, he or she will invariably receive some compensation, some monetary benefit, from the state and territory governments. It is not lavish; it is not going to enable people to live in luxury for the rest of their lives—far from it. Nevertheless, it is an important acknowledgement by our community of the unjustified and the completely abhorrent pain and suffering that the victim of crime has suffered. So I am proposing the establishment of a federal scheme analogous to the state schemes purely for Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts. This is a modest, responsible but necessary measure on behalf of those people by the national parliament.
This is not the first time I have introduced this bill into the parliament. I first introduced this bill into the parliament in late 2009, when circumstances were quite different. The former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, in answer to questions from the member for Paterson, indicated that the government was taking this issue seriously, but I regret to say that no action had been taken by the government at the time of the last election. Since the election, I and the member for Paterson have indicated that we have in no way dropped our concern for the victims of international terrorism, hence the reintroduction of this bill.
I recently received a letter from the Attorney-General, and I thank the Attorney for his letter. I acknowledge the Attorney’s sincere concern for the Australian victims of overseas terrorism, but it is not enough to be just concerned. We need some tangible acknowledgement of the predicament which our fellow Australians find themselves in, and that is what my bill proposes to do.
I accept there are some issues with oppositions proposing measures of this kind. The government in a different context has talked about the constitutional questions surrounding opposition members introducing bills which involve expenditure. In consultation with the clerks, I have been very careful to ensure that those rules are not in any way infringed by this bill. I would welcome this bill being taken over by the government. If the government has another more efficacious way of helping the Australian victims of terrorist incidents overseas, I would be grateful to hear what it is.
One thing I will not do is give up the campaign that I and the member for Paterson have been engaged in since 2005 to ensure that we do the right thing by our fellow Australians who were hurt permanently, simply because they were Australians, at the hands of people who hate our way of life. We must stand by our fellow Australians in trouble. They were targeted because they were Australian. They deserve this modest measure of recognition, help and acknowledgement. I commend this bill to the House.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—The purpose of the Patent Amendment (Human Genes and Biological Materials) Bill 2010 is to clarify current Australian patent law in relation to human genes and biological material. It will amend the Patents Act 1990 to reinforce the distinction between discovery and invention. It will expressly exclude from patentability human genes and biological materials which are identical to, or substantially identical to, such materials as they exist in nature.
A similar bill was introduced into the Senate late last year. It was co-sponsored by the coalition, Independent Senator Nick Xenophon, and the Greens. In this chamber the bill is co-sponsored by the coalition and Independent member for Lyne, Robert Oakeshott. The introduction and debate of an extensive motion by a member of the government late last year, which called for this very amendment to the Patents Act, indicates that there is indeed wide support within this parliament for this change to take place. It is a sentiment that the government should take note of, and I believe should act upon, by supporting this bill.
The issuing of patents on human genes has been and remains a highly contentious issue within Australia and, more widely, internationally. It has been the subject of debate in this House; it has been the focus of a committee inquiry in the Senate also. On one side of the argument are scientists, doctors, patients and organisations that argue that patents on human genes and biological material impede scientific research, restrict development of new and alternative medical tests and in so doing deprive us of chances of the discovery of medicines and cures for some of our most frightening illnesses.
On the other hand though, there are other scientists, doctors, research institutes and biotechnology companies that argue equally forcefully that the granting of patents provides the incentives for discovery, development and invention that can quickly bring us closer to better medical diagnoses, medicines and the cures that we all would seek to alleviate the pain and suffering that so many endure. By some estimates it is believed that 40 per cent of the human genome has now been patented around the world since a United States Supreme Court decision in 1980 determined that life forms were patentable under US law. Prior to that, the US Patent Office had a position not to patent a biological organism. Since then thousands of patents have been granted with an estimated 25,000 DNA patents issued by the year 2000.
But increasingly, the issuing of patents over human genes and biological material is under challenge. A decade ago President Clinton and British Prime Minister Blair issued a joint statement saying the human genome should be freely available to scientists everywhere. Research institutes and national governments in Europe are calling for such patents to be brought into question, members of the European Parliament have passed resolutions criticising the Euro Patent Office position on genes; and in Canada, state jurisdictions are ignoring gene patents by supporting public health institutes to ignore patents on tests for cancer. The British House of Lords Judicial Committee invalidated patent claims because the synthetic human protein being claimed as an invention was not ‘new’.
In the United States and here in Australia court challenges have been launched against gene patents. While the Australian case has not proceeded, the American outcome resulted in a finding that a corporation’s patents over breast and ovarian cancer genes had been improperly granted and, indeed, were invalid under law. The case is under appeal and is sure to drag on for years. But significantly, the US government has signalled to the courts that it considers that the longstanding policy of the US Patent Office to grant patents over genes was, in fact, contrary to US patent law. At the heart of the American Federal Court decision that the gene patents were invalid was that they were not inventions. That is at the heart of this bill: the distinction between discovery and invention. Only an invention can be patented. Human genes and biological material are not inventions. They exist; they are naturally occurring. Scientists and researchers discover them; they do not invent them. The amendments to the Patents Act provided in this bill will enshrine that distinction in Australian patent law.
To do otherwise will leave considerable ongoing uncertainty for the scientific community and society generally. Two years ago an Australian company, as licensee for an American biotechnology company, sought to prevent Australian hospitals and medical laboratories from testing for breast and ovarian cancer, threatening to sue them for breach of patents if they proceeded without paying thousands of dollars for the company to perform the ‘patented’ genetic testing. Under wide public pressure, rightly, it backed down, but its actions highlighted the disturbing situation that people suffering life-threatening diseases could be denied the tests and treatments that could help them, because a corporation held a patent on the naturally occurring genes that were part of the make-up of their bodies. To retreat to the fundamental basis of patent law: patents are granted for inventions, as we say, not for discoveries of naturally occurring biological materials such as our genes.
That is what this bill strikes. It will clarify that important difference. In doing so it will remove the threat that patents on genes hold to monopolise and therefore restrict vital research. It could indeed accelerate scientific competition and innovation which lead to the knowledge and the breakthroughs to understanding illnesses and disease and eventually the medical inventions that provide cures or better treatments. While the very genes and biological material that form our make-up will not be patentable, unique processes that provide for their isolation, purification or synthesis will be, thus affording patent protection to biotechnology breakthroughs, just as now. The biotechnology industry will continue to have the scope to patent true inventions.
Two years ago at the height of the concerns over gene patents in Australia, the Senate Community Affairs Committee began an inquiry into this complicated issue. Its report was handed down just three months ago. While that report did not call for a ban on gene patents, it did call for patent laws to be updated to ensure that research into cancer and other diseases could proceed unhindered by threats of patent infringement. It also called for a government response to various national reviews, reports and inquiries into gene patents by mid 2011.
This bill is now being scrutinised by a Senate committee, which should ensure that there are no unintended consequences from these amendments and alleviate concerns that it holds a threat to scientific innovation and research. That committee is also due to report in June. No doubt there will be amendments to the bill, but the parliament will be able to proceed on this critical matter if the government does not.
As renowned scientist Professor Ian Frazer warned in late 2009:
Science sits on the cusp of a surge in the use of genes in the diagnosis and treatment for major illnesses.
…            …            …
It is crucial we address this issue now, before the wave of gene technology breaks.
As the inventor of the cervical cancer vaccine, Gardasil, Professor Frazer has benefited greatly from patent law. But he, like so many others, believes that genes are not inventions and they should not be patented. Nobody should be able to own part of each and every one of us. I commend the bill to the House.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I move:
That the House:
condemns the Rudd-Gillard Government for:
reducing funding for Tourism Australia at a time when the high Australian dollar is putting pressure on local tourism operators; and
increasing business costs for local tourism operators through:
higher tourism taxes;
the bungled award modernisation; and
additional superannuation guarantee payments which will be entirely funded by employers; and
calls on the Rudd-Gillard Government to match the Coalition’s commitment to increase tourism funding by $100 million to:
focus on high-yielding business events tourists;
build stronger research foundations;
encourage tourism infrastructure and product development; and
boost domestic tourism marketing.
The tourism industry in Australia was worth $93.5 billion as at 15 December 2010 and raised $22.8 billion in tourism export value and employed in excess of 500,000 Australians. I have moved that this House condemn the Rudd-Gillard government for reducing funding for Tourism Australia at a time when the high Aussie dollar is putting pressure on local tourism operators. While the Gillard government has been spending big money on pink batts, giveaways and cost blow-outs on school halls, funding for Tourism Australia has gone backwards. The Gillard government’s own budget papers show that while federal government spending has skyrocketed from $272 billion to $352 billion under Labor, funding for Tourism Australia has dropped by $13.5 million in real terms. These funding cuts under Labor mean that, in real terms, funding for Tourism Australia has not been lower since the introduction of the landmark tourism white paper in 2003. Under the Gillard government, the tourism industry is wearing the burden of Labor’s debt and deficit without having gotten any of the benefits of their record spending. In response to Labor’s 2010 federal budget, the Tourism and Transport Forum said:
The tourism industry is concerned the failure to maintain Tourism Australia’s current funding levels means that a golden opportunity to capitalise on Australia’s tourism’s strengths has been lost …
I have also moved that this House condemn the Rudd-Gillard government for increasing business costs for local tourism operators through higher tourism taxes. Labor’s addiction to reckless spending has been matched by an addiction to new taxes to fund their record debt and deficit. In their first term alone, the Rudd-Gillard government have introduced more than $1 billion of new tourism taxes on the Australian tourism industry, including: increasing a departure tax called the passenger movement charge by 24 per cent; raising tourist visa fees by more than 33 per cent; and abolishing the private provider system for the Tourist Refund Scheme for the GST. These new tourism taxes were introduced by the Rudd-Gillard government at a time when the Tourism Forecasting Committee was expecting inbound visitor arrivals to drop by 4.1 per cent. At Cairns Airport, for example, for the year ended 30 June 2009, while inbound visitor arrivals fell by 24.3 per cent compared to the previous year, the Rudd-Gillard government took home an extra $2.25 million in tax revenue.
The Labor government say increasing taxes on cigarettes will reduce the number of people smoking, yet they do not believe that increasing taxes on tourism will reduce the number of people travelling. Analysis by the Tourism and Transport Forum shows that regional Australia has been hardest hit by Labor’s increased tourism taxes. Just a one per cent rise in airfares across Australia results in a 1.01 per cent fall in demand, but for Cairns a one per cent rise in airfares causes a 1.32 per cent fall in demand. Labor’s Minister for Tourism, the Hon. Martin Ferguson, said in 2003 that the passenger movement charge was ‘ripping off the travelling public’ when it was levied at $38 per passenger. Yet in his first budget as the Minister for Tourism he increased it from $38 per passenger to $47 per passenger.
I have moved that this House condemn the Rudd-Gillard government for increasing business costs for local tourism operators through the bungled award modernisation. The tourism industry has more award reliant workers than any other sector, putting it at the front line of Labor’s botched award modernisation process. The Queensland Tourism Industry Council said in 2009:
This has led to the creation of a modern hospitality award that does not recognise the diversity of the tourism and hospitality industry and which will impact on the economic viability of tourism and hospitality businesses.
Labor’s botched award modernisation process, which was led by the Prime Minister when she was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, created much uncertainty for tourism operators. The then Chief Executive Officer of Restaurant and Catering NSW/ACT, Robert Goldman, said in 2008:
The Award Modernisation decision was just circulated … I do suggest that many of our worst fears have been realised …
Ultimately, Labor’s botched award modernisation process has led to higher business costs for Australian tourism businesses, making them less competitive in the international tourism market, particularly when our dollar is at an all-time high. Many businesses will see an increase in operating costs of over 25 per cent. This represents another broken promise from our Prime Minister, who expressly promised that costs to businesses would not increase as a result of modern awards.
Reflecting on those increased business costs, the Chief Executive Officer of the Hotel, Motel and Accommodation Association, Lorraine Duffy, said in 2010 the ongoing cost of doing business for Australia’s accommodation sector is:
... diluting its attractiveness as a country for investment of major hotels and for smaller operators as a sustainable way to make a living.
I have also moved that this House condemn the Rudd-Gillard government for increasing business costs for local tourism operators through additional superannuation guarantee payments, which will be entirely funded by employers. Many tourism businesses will also be slugged with an additional tax on their payrolls thanks to Labor’s increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, which, as I said, is to be entirely funded by employers. The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Victorian Tourism Industry Council said in 2010 in response to the increase:
Increased superannuation costs will hurt the business bottom line and discourage the hiring of new labour...
I have also moved that this House call on the Rudd-Gillard government to match the coalition’s commitment to focus on high-yielding business events tourists. The business events sector represents the greatest opportunity to build Australia’s visitor economy. Business events produce the highest daily yield of any sector of the tourism industry. The business events sector contributes an estimated $17.6 billion a year to the national economy, generating 116,000 jobs. Business events also promote and showcase Australian expertise and innovation to the world and attract global leaders and investment decision makers who would otherwise not have come to Australia. As the global financial crisis approached, the Rudd-Gillard government cut funding for Business Events Australia by more than 10 per cent, deserting the sector at the worst possible time.
Only the coalition recognises the importance of the business events sector to building Australia’s visitor economy. The coalition’s Plan for Real Action on Tourism will provide Tourism Australia with a further $10.5 million over four years to increase the marketing capacity of Business Events Australia. This significant investment would bring Australia’s business events marketing capability in line with our international competitors. The coalition’s real action plan would also provide the Association of Australian Convention Bureaux with $17.5 million over four years to operate a business events bid and boost fund. This industry partnership fund will provide the business events sector with a significant pool of funds to coordinate and support bids for key international conferences. The fund will also help maximise delegate boosting opportunities for conferences. The coalition’s real action plan would also focus departments and agencies of the Australian government, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on delivering leads for potential international conferences Australia could host.
I have also moved that this House call on the Rudd-Gillard government to match the coalition’s commitment to build stronger research foundations in the tourism industry. A strong research foundation is critical to building Australia’s visitor economy. The Rudd-Gillard government has reduced Australia’s tourism research capacity. Labor discontinued funding for the Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre and moved Tourism Research Australia from Tourism Australia to being a general expense in the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. According to a report by its own steering committee on tourism, the Rudd-Gillard government’s policies will ‘leave a substantial gap in the tourism industry research capability’. The coalition’s real action plan would provide Tourism Research Australia with $8 million over four years to grow Australia’s tourism research capabilities.
I have also moved that this House call on the Rudd-Gillard government to match the coalition’s commitment to encourage tourism infrastructure and product development. The coalition has put forward an investment proposal to make sure that our tourism product is in line and competitive with the rest of the world.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the motion on tourism funding, but I can let the member for Paterson know that I do not support this motion that he has put to the House. In fact, I am very happy to tell him that he would be well served to have a look at the National Long-Term Tourism Strategy, which was signed off by all tourism ministers in December 2009, because many of the long-term challenges and opportunities faced by the tourism industry here in Australia are encapsulated in that tourism strategy and, more than that, the strategy actually sets out a working plan to meet many of the challenges and to make the most of those opportunities.
I want to rebut straight off the first point of the shadow minister’s motion, where he talks about a reduction in funding for Tourism Australia. That is simply not the case. Any suggestion of reduced funding for Tourism Australia is incorrect. Tourism Australia’s funding has been maintained across the forward estimates in the budget. In fact, in response to industry demand following the global financial crisis, which of course presented enormous challenges to our tourism industry—as was experienced in the tourism sector right around the world—$9 million of Tourism Australia funding was brought forward at that time and was matched by an additional $11 million from states and territories and commercial partners. That was an effective increase in the budget for tourism at that time when support was so badly needed.
We take tourism very seriously here in the Labor Party, and I note the presence in the chamber here of the member for Port Adelaide, who was the leader of Labor Friends of Tourism in the previous parliament before his promotion to the frontbench. He is just one example of the enormous support for tourism that exists in the Labor Party and in the Gillard government. Why do we support tourism? It is very simple. Tourism is our largest services export industry. It accounts for some $24 billion each year in exports. The most recent figures, from 2008-09, show that it accounts for over 2½ per cent of our GDP annually and also employs half a million people, which is the equivalent of 4½ per cent of the workforce.
We are very mindful of the challenges the sector faces. While those figures are strong and provide a good base for us to work with the industry to seize further opportunities, we do have to recognise—and the government does recognise—that this does represent a drop in tourism’s contribution to the economy and a drop in the proportion of people employed in that sector. There is work to be done but the government is hard at work meeting those challenges.
Mr Deputy Speaker, as a Queenslander you would know as well as I do that tourism is particularly important to our state. In Queensland, tourism accounts for $9 billion of our state’s economy every year. Over 50 million people visited our state in 2010. I will be putting out the call in this and every other forum, and in every opportunity I get, to let visitors know right around Australia and around the world that Queensland is very much open for business and we really do want to welcome you back to our state. We are getting ourselves back on track after the floods and cyclones and of course many of the tourism icons in Queensland were untouched by those disasters.
I do not want to buy into the doom and gloom of some people here in the chamber. I want to spend my time in this debate talking up tourism, the tourism industry and the opportunities and experiences that are still very much on offer for tourists in our state.
The federal government was very quick to respond to the flooding and later to Cyclone Yasi in the state of Queensland. It was back in January that the Gillard government and the state Labor government announced that they would contribute $5 million each towards a tourism industry support package. Much of that money is going towards marketing, which is a very important thing that the industry has been calling for. It will include a very strong domestic marketing campaign to assure Australians that Queensland is open for business and that many of the most popular tourism destinations were untouched by those disasters that held peoples attention during January.
While I am talking about the floods, I will mention something in my local area that is very positive for our tourism sector. In early January, when we were facing the terrible flooding in Rockhampton, while we were getting enormous support from right around the country and even around the world, Tiger Airways announced that they would cancel all flights into and out of Rockhampton until the end of March. They basically pulled the plug on Rockhampton not just for that period when the airport was closed due to flooding, which was going to extend for maybe three weeks, no, Tiger told us that they were pulling out until the end of March. There has since been a lot of effort put in locally. I was furious at the time and sent a very strongly worded letter to the managing director of Tiger Airways Australia and I know I was joined in that response by many other people in Rockhampton.
I am pleased to tell the House that Tiger Airways are now coming out and supporting our local tourism operators. They have got a special deal, which was advertised last week, offering very cheap flights to Rockhampton from Melbourne. They will not start again until the end of March, but I do have to give them credit for partnering up with our local tourism operators to get that message out there that Rockhampton is open for business and that people can get there easily and cheaply.
One other thing that Tiger has done—again, I pay them credit where credit is due—is they are now flying direct out of Tullamarine Airport, which is going to make an enormous difference to the accessibility of Rockhampton, Central Queensland and the southern Great Barrier Reef when it comes to attracting interstate visitors to our community.
On another positive note, another example of how the government is supporting tourism and tourism operators is the TQUAL program. The next TQUAL round was announced just a couple of weeks ago. Some terrific projects have taken place in my electorate with the help of TQUAL grants in the last few years. When talking to the CEO of our tourism body this morning she said there is already a great deal of interest in applications for this latest round.
A couple of the ones I have been involved in and opened in the last couple of years include Henderson Park, which is a farm-stay operation 30 minutes north of Rockhampton. It is run by the Barrett family, who have been on their property at Hedlow Creek for about a hundred years. They have an absolutely beautiful set-up there with cabins and, now, the five-star Hedlow Lodge right on the banks of Hedlow Creek. That was done with the assistance of TQUAL funding.
The other one that received funding in the last couple of years is Capricorn Caves. Ann Augusteyn and her team there received money to help them expand their facilities. The great thing about this is that money from the federal government leverages private investment in these tourism operations and really allows them to take what they are offering to tourists to a new level. That is great news for the tourism operators in our electorate. They are a couple of local examples of some terrific investments in our local tourism facilities and I would encourage operators to take advantage of this latest round of TQUAL grants.
It is very clear from these measures—TQUAL, the long-term tourism policy and the response to the floods—that this government is very strongly behind the tourism industry in this country.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Tourism Funding</title>,Private Members' Business,6,1
"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I move:
That this House:
notes the:
19 September 2010 Declaration by the members of the Broadband Commission for Digital Development to world leaders attending the 2010 Millennium Development Goals Summit at the United Nations on the benefits of broadband as the transformational technology for employment generation, productivity growth and the long term economic competitiveness;
OECD report of December 2009 which makes the case for investment in a competitive, open access national fibre network rollout based on benefits to four key sectors of the economy: electricity, health, transportation and education;
positive externalities of broadband in providing increased opportunities to access Australian health and education services, and the linkages between disparities in broadband access and social disadvantage; and
technical limitations of non fibre approaches to national broadband development, particularly in respect of video and other ‘real time’ applications used to deliver health and education services; and
recognises the merits of the development of universal broadband access in Australia with an emphasis on options for niche broadband delivered content and applications to provide immediate benefits to areas and groups of identifiable need.
I have moved this motion because I have a fundamental belief in the transformational power of information technology to improve the lives of individuals and their societies. It is a belief forged through legal and regulatory experience and my responsiveness to the needs of the communities I represent. I believe this parliament has a responsibility to our society and its future generations to base its deliberations about broadband development in Australia on a well-informed, sound, factual policy basis. For these reasons I believe it is imperative that Australia firstly place itself in the global policy context. In September last year the members of the Broadband Commission for Digital Development addressed a declaration to the world leaders attending the 2010 Millennium Development Goals Summit at the United Nations Headquarters which called upon them to embrace a common goal of broadband inclusion for all. It states in part:
We believe that broadband inclusion for all will represent a momentous economic and social change commensurate with the very problems that the MDGs aim to solve and that it will be a game-changer in addressing rising healthcare costs, delivering digital education for all and mitigating the effects of climate change. Already we see the transformational progress which digital inclusion offers to youth, women, the elderly and people with mental and physical disabilities in rich and poor countries alike.
Just as I have espoused in this place the merits of the virtuous cycle of education, the Broadband Commission advocates a virtuous cycle for digital development that interlinks technology, infrastructure, policy, innovation, people, government, content and applications. Its advocacy on infrastructure is instructive. Whilst a variety of technologies—such as satellite, wireless and microwave—will undoubtedly be employed, achieving a technology-neutral approach, these technologies require a physical backbone in order to function. Accordingly, the Broadband Commission states unequivocally:
A high-capacity fibre optic packet transport backbone is the fundamental backbone infrastructure that countries need to deploy to support the growth in broadband services.
There are two critical points to note here. Firstly, I reiterate my comments made here on several occasions that Australia’s National Broadband Network is the reality of these internationally irrefutable goals and the steps necessary to implement them. We are creating a national piece of utility infrastructure, regulated as a utility, in the public interest. Secondly, those who are opposed to the NBN are fond of asserting that this government has picked a fixed technology and ignored other broadband solutions such as wireless. This is a nonsense. The NBN is not just about fixed networks; to the contrary, the NBN augments all other technologies because it is a technology-neutral backbone. The NBN architecture and infrastructure is the only option which represents unlimited technological diversity and, because nothing is faster than the speed of light—which carries the electromagnetic energy that comprises a communication—it alone has capacity that cannot be achieved by anything else in the network layer of the stack. It is little wonder then that some of the most enthusiastic backers of the NBN are in fact our mobile operators.
Here in Australia we are putting the theory of broadband inclusiveness into action and we can be confident that we are on the right path. But do not just take it from me. Take the endorsement of Eric Schmidt, the former CEO and now executive chairman of Google, who recently said at the Mobile World Congress:
Let me start by saying that Australia is leading the world in understanding the importance of fibre. Your new Prime Minister, as part of her campaign and now as part of her prime ministership, has announced …93 per cent of Australians …will have gigabit or equivalent service using fibre and the other seven per cent will be handled through wireless services of the nature of LTE. This is leadership, and again from Australia, which I think is wonderful.
This motion also notes the analysis by the OECD of the need for investment in open access national fibre networks in order to deliver benefits in electricity, health, transportation and education, which together are estimated to comprise a quarter of a country’s GDP. The quality of the network, its bandwidth and scalability, is a first-principle issue that is determinative of whether these benefits can be realised. Again, the real-time nature of these services and applications requires bandwidth that can only be achieved by a fibre backbone.
While some in this place have sought to argue that the laws of economics demand we instead revisit wireless solutions, I say this: the laws of economics may be malleable but the laws of physics are not. Radio communications spectrum is a shared resource, which means that practical wireless speeds are incapable of achieving the outcomes of fibre. And, like all attempts to quantify a cost-benefit analysis of public investment in new high-speed fibre networks, the OECD emphasises that, contrary to what some in this place would have us believe, the imperative for direct government investment is not novel. It states:
Policy makers understand the importance of these spillovers and government leaders have committed to promoting the extension and upgrade of broadband networks to benefit from these spillover effects. In the OECD’s Seoul Declaration for the Future of the Internet Economy, ministers agreed to ensure broadband networks attain the greatest practical national coverage and to stimulate investment and competition in the development of high capacity information and communication infrastructures ... The recent economic crisis and emphasis on fiscal stimulus have opened the possibility of governments directing investment to building broadband networks. These types of interventions are not new because telecommunications markets have faced a similar challenge before with ensuring a national/universal rollout of PSTN and mobile networks.
Those rural and regional members in this place who want to ensure that their constituents and their local economies are not deprived of these benefits, and those who, like myself, represent some areas of outer-metropolitan Sydney where accessible and affordable broadband is non-existent, are united in our vindication by the OECD’s analysis.
Finally, the linkages between disparities in access and social disadvantage are well documented by the broadband commission and the OECD, as well as even the most rudimentary analysis of broadband accessibility and postcode. I have placed such evidence before this place on numerous occasions; today I draw on my own analysis I delivered in my presentation to the 2009 Communications Policy and Research Forum, which is widely regarded as one of the leading fora in communications and media thinking in this country. The question I posed there was, ‘Universal broadband in an NBN nation: what’s the objective?’ And my thesis identified a potential model for addressing the disparities in broadband access in Australia and the linkages to social disadvantage. My conclusion was that the objective—the answer to my question—needs to be to harness broadband as a mechanism to break cycles of educational, employment and other disadvantage. A year later, I am comforted by the goals of the broadband commission, which are aimed at the same.
Moreover, I am looking forward to the broadband debate moving beyond where it has stagnated in the minds of some in this place—beyond the tactics of delay, beyond attempts to argue economics over physics, and beyond a refusal to admit that the private sector alone will not pick up the mantle to make a truly national high-speed broadband network a reality in this country.
I want this debate to proceed—this is the reason I have raised this motion—to a situation where we work in the common interest of those in our society who stand to benefit from the transformational change of the NBN.
I want the debate to move to the competition for opportunities to utilise the NBN from the ground up—opportunities such as running educational access pilots in Mt Druitt; exporting our educational programs to China from regional universities such as Armidale; having telecommuting hubs on the Central Coast of NSW; or having an elderly person in Riverstone, who may be on the verge of entering permanent assisted care, spend an extra year in her own home because her condition could be remotely diagnosed and treated.
In resolving to note the items in this motion we also acknowledge the logic of the NBN as having a sound, globally endorsed policy basis, which is coming to fruition. Our next step as representatives in this place is to ensure that those who matter—the people we represent—are, and remain, at the forefront of our deliberations. I commend the motion to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I rise on this motion as it is an issue of great interest to me and one that I have worked on for many years. There is no doubt that Australia and Australians will benefit from the provision of high-speed broadband access across the nation. What is in dispute is that NBN Co. is the model with which to deliver it.
If we look at the method of communication delivery and the access of communities in past centuries we see that that was through the roads and the railway lines that were built in those centuries. In this and in future centuries, the connection of our communities, in relation to economic agreements and business going forward, will definitely be through broadband. But just as roads were not the only way of accessing remote communities the NBN Co. will not be the only way to go forward. We need to look at fibre being delivered not just by a monopolistic outdated telco model but through a model that will deliver opportunities for everyone. A model which will have open access and high speeds and will encourage innovation and competitiveness. The coalition says that that will not be delivered by NBN Co.
Looking forward, we need to find a model that delivers opportunities for our communities. As the member for Greenway said, broadband is a way of delivering improved services across the nation. NBN Co. is not the way to deliver that model. NBN Co. is delivering ADSL2 up to 2030. That year is more than 20 years into the future; that model will be obsolete by the time this project is finished—and at what cost? It will come at a cost of over $2,800 per household at today’s costs. Yet the City of Brisbane is delivering this to every household and every ratepayer in the city at no cost to the ratepayers and at no cost to the city. Quite obviously we should be working hand in hand with private enterprise. We should be looking at a mix. We should be looking at what is already there.
The government would have you believe that there is not already existing broadband in our community. Yet the reality is that there is already fibre—superior fibre. But NBN Co. wants to come along and build over the top of existing fibre networks with an inferior model and an inferior product at the taxpayers’ expense. What a waste of money. This is why, from day one, the coalition has said that this project by the government needs to go to the Productivity Commission.
We cannot justify this sort of expenditure—over $43 billion—of taxpayers’ money at a time when there are so many other demands on those dollars and when private enterprise and other models are not only on offer but working already in other parts of the world. Look at the Amsterdam model. Look at what Huawei are doing around the world. Look at what Axia are doing in Canada. Look at what ETRI and other companies are doing in South Korea.
We do not have the right solution. That is what the coalition is saying. Yes, we support broadband; yes, we support fibre; but the NBN Co. model is wrong. It is restricting advancements; it is restricting competition; and—indeed, the most important part—it is restricting speeds.
Look at some of the projects that are happening around our country now. Already the preliminary one in Tasmania—strangely the government is not releasing the result of that preliminary project for NBN Co.—I understand is well over the estimated cost. Yet the Brisbane City Council implemented a program in a trial which came in at one-third the cost of NBN Co. Doesn’t that send up some warning signs for the government that they could do better, that we must do better—that in the interests of providing a genuinely competitive and a genuinely beneficial system for our country going forward, that we need to look at other models, that we need to refer this to the Productivity Commission, that we need to do a cost-benefit analysis? Because only through doing that will we actually get the best outcome for Australia and the best outcome for Australian citizens.
Broadband as it is, is going to offer some wonderful opportunities. Already our health system is spending millions of dollars compressing information to send through existing fibre systems. By delivering dark fibre around the country, government delivery of health can benefit. What we are saying is that, with the advancement of technology, with the advancement of new systems, it is not just ADSL2+; we can deliver much better and much faster systems with the benefit of partnerships with private companies. You only have to look at how fast new products and new innovations are developing.
The member for Greenway said she did not want to argue economics. But that is what we do need to argue. Cost-benefit analysis is critical on any project. This will be one of the most expensive infrastructure projects in the history of this country. Our residents need to know that they are getting value for money.
Going forward, we need to look at some of the innovations. We need ubiquitous speeds: the same speed going up as we have coming down. We do not even know tomorrow what is going to be invented or created that can be delivered down broadband, and yet we are still planning a system under NBN Co. which will only deliver what we currently know is in existence to 2030. Are you really trying to tell me that there will be no advances in technology before 2030, that we really do not need speeds more than ADSL2+ before 2030 and we are going to restrict the delivery? It is like giving all the roads to Ford and Ford being allowed to say, ‘We are only going to have Ford cars travel on those roads.’ This is an incredibly prescriptive and restrictive process. We need to open it up to genuine competition and we need to open it up to genuine innovation.
People used to claim that Napster would have been the death of the music industry, because they opened up the music industry online. Yet, what has happened? The latest music star, Justin Bieber, would not be there if they had not opened it up with that opportunity. The record companies rejected him—just as NBN Co. will reject people who are in competition to what they are trying to achieve with their outdated telco model.
The coalition are great supporters of broadband. We have never disputed the necessity of universal access. What we oppose is the plan to create an outdated telco monopoly that will have no scrutiny; intends to build over the top of existing, superior infrastructure; and, most critically, will waste of billions of dollars in doing so. Once again, it is the height of hypocrisy to move this motion today knowing that some of the advances that the member for Greenway spoke about will not be delivered through the NBN Co. outdated telco model. The only way some of the innovations can be delivered is through an open-access, competitive process.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>National Broadband Development</title>,Private Members' Business,8,1
"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—It is a great honour to be speaking on the motion brought to this House by the member for Greenway, who has really been at the forefront of taking this important debate up in this House.
In the debate today we have heard something similar to what we have heard in the debate in this House for around four years now. The objection to our visionary NBN plan can be boiled down to three key points. The first objection, as we have heard from the member for Ryan, is that it would all be well if we left it to the market. After 11 years and something like 19 failed broadband plans, it is quite clear that the solution of leaving it to the market certainly has not worked for Australia and it certainly has not worked for the people who live in electorates like the member for Greenway’s, like the member for Cunningham’s or my own—those people who represent constituents in the outer suburbs of capital cities. Whilst I can understand the member for Ryan coming in here and putting on her rose coloured glasses and talking about how wonderful the market has been in delivering broadband services to people in the city of Brisbane—or even the member for Wentworth talking about how excellent the broadband services are in the inner city of Sydney, where he lives—I find it very, very difficult indeed to understand why the National Party members, who purport to represent regional Australia, have been so absolutely mute in defending the government’s NBN plan. We know that leaving it to the market means a two-tiered system. It means those who live in inner city suburbs will have an excellent, world-class broadband service, but those who live in suburbs that are represented by people in regional Australia will have a B-class, a C-class or even—as the member for Greenway says—access to no broadband services at all.
The second argument that we have seen being developed over the last couple of weeks, particularly by the member for Wentworth, is that somehow wireless is better—that somehow our fibre to the home is going to be redundant technology because radio communications technology is going to fill the space and we will all be better off with that. That is an argument best adored by those in the opposition caucus, but anybody who knows anything about the delivery of broadband services through wireless technology knows that it is complete and utter bunkum.
I suspect the member for Wentworth knows this himself, because he is an early adapter to most new technologies. He very proudly sports an iPad and delivers many speeches in this House from his iPad. As I am sure he is very familiar with the technology inside that iPad, he would know that the designers of wireless technology like iPads and other reading tablets specifically design those products to ensure that, where there is no access to fibre or broadband technology, people will use 3G and the other wireless technologies available but, where there is a broadband hotspot, where broadband technology is provided through a cable, they will default to a broadband WAN, wide area network, service. The reason they do that? Because the producers of that technology know that it is a far superior means of delivering effective broadband technology. If the member for Wentworth spent a little less time looking through his rose-coloured glasses at his opposition policy on this issue and a bit more time reading and looking at his iPad, he would know that his second argument is complete and utter bunkum.
The third argument that is often put by those opposite is: ‘Let’s have another study.’ This one is the most risible of all because it comes from the party that went to the last election championing something called ‘real action’. Their solution to 10 years of failure and 19 failed broadband plans for people in electorates such as Greenway, Cunningham and my own, and many electorates represented by those opposite, was to go and have another study.
The member for Greenway throws down the challenge to those opposite and all of us in this House, and that is: let’s get beyond these horrible debates and let’s focus on the real issues. (Time expired)

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to support the motion put to the House today by the member for Greenway. Her contribution and that of the member for Throsby encapsulated the reason that we, at least on this side of the House, are so adamantly enthusiastic about the National Broadband Network and why it was so resoundingly endorsed by so many people at the last election. We represent outer metropolitan, regional and rural communities who know only too well the failure of the market to deliver what is becoming an increasingly important piece of infrastructure for modern living, and that is fast, accessible and affordable broadband.
I am quite surprised that more members on the other side have not reflected that their offices, like mine, are consistently dealing with people contacting them to complain that, because of old pair-gain systems and outdated copper technology that has not been upgraded, their access to broadband is severely limiting the capacity of their family to operate. What I particularly hear from people is the effect it has on their children because of the importance of broadband as a study tool, not only at school but, obviously, also at TAFE and university. Many universities now have a huge access requirement. Students often have to download lecture documents and discussion papers that are large and take up quite a bit of capacity and time to access. That is an important reason for requiring broadband access.
It is also important for people who are running small and micro businesses at home. Home based businesses are an often misunderstood growth sector of our economy, particularly in our regions, where a number of people participate in our economy by running such businesses. For them, video access, allowing them to demonstrate their products so that people can view and order them online, is a requirement. This is a growing trend in our communities driving people to seek fast, secure, affordable broadband access.
I represent a region where about one in three of my voters travels outside the region for work every day. I have a very large commuter base—which I know that both of my colleagues who have spoken on the debate today share. The capacity for teleworking and remote work access would decrease the pressures on our cities. For example, if a third of the commuters from my area who go to southern and western Sydney to do back-office jobs in HR and finance were able to work from home two or three days a week over a secure, fast connection to their workplace, it could decrease the demand for new road and rail networks as our cities develop. Through teleworking, a broadband network could address some of the transport and infrastructure issues of our cities, and there is an obvious environmental benefit to having fewer people travelling for work. That is a real opportunity that this broadband network is, importantly, opening up.
I understand that some of those opposite will argue, ‘Well, we also think fast broadband’s important; we just think it should be delivered in a different way,’ but they are living in a bit of a dream world. As the member for Throsby said, they have tried 19 different models. None of them worked. None of them were getting us where we needed to be as a nation. We have bitten the bullet. We are putting in place a model that will deliver that.
With a delegation of this parliament to the United States in September 2009, I visited many tech companies, and they said to us clearly that our model was the way to go, that the models that relied purely on the private sector were failing those who could least afford to be failed: the disadvantaged, the isolated, those who most needed equity of access to participate in a modern community. We see the National Broadband Network as part of delivering access, equity, affordability and growth.
 (Ms AE Burke)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>National Broadband Development</title>,Private Members' Business,8,1
"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to resume the comments and remarks that I made at the previous sitting. I had just spent some time reflecting on the attitude of all those I represent in an electorate that has been fortunate to avoid these floods and the fires. The fact is that I have never experienced a serious flood myself, but I have twice had to evacuate with my family because of bushfires, once when I was a young fellow on a dairy farm. I remember the trauma of rushing to find those things that we thought were absolutely essential if the house went—all the memorabilia and our favourite things—with five of my brothers and sisters and parents; packing the boot of the FJ Holden; and being taken to a safer place while my father came back to fight the fire. I also remember that one of our neighbours was caught on the dividing fence on our property and was unable to detach himself. The fire swept over and he died. I remember how the death of a neighbour fighting a fire on our property rocked our community, and I feel very strongly for all of those that have lost loved ones during these floods. It is a traumatic experience. The thing is that, once your property has been burnt out and people have lost their lives, it takes an extraordinary amount of time for a community to recover, both economically and emotionally. Whilst many of us will move on to other things—and probably already have moved on to other issues in our own lives—we should not forget that there are tens of thousands of Australians who will be living the experience for a long, long time.
I do not wish to go over each of the flood events, but I would just like to remind the House of the first Victorian floods, if you like, because in some ways they have become the forgotten floods. They occurred last year in September-October, and there was widespread damage. We saw literally hundreds of thousands of hectares affected and millions of dollars of damage done. Friends of mine at Serpentine on the Loddon have now been flooded four times, I think, since that time. They had some of the best crops they had seen in a lifetime and have lost most of them. They have been hit with every flood that has come through, and I think it is now a total of four that have affected their lives. It will set them back a long way. The family consists of parents with their own property and several sons with their properties. They have worked very hard to establish the agricultural ventures that they have, and it has been a really massive blow. So to witness firsthand the impact on friends gives you a sense of the grief that is being caused and that will continue for a long time to come right across Australia as a result of these various floods, the cyclone and the bushfires that have so affected many lives.
Again I offer sympathies, condolences and thoughts on behalf of all of those approximately 140,000 members of my electorate. One thing that has struck me is that right across the Melbourne community—and I suspect it is true right across Australia—I have noticed the way in which the dire circumstances of so many of our fellow Australians have prompted a response in the community which is still ongoing. We had another flood donation event on Saturday night nearby, at our Middle Brighton baths, with competitions and all the rest. A serious amount of money was raised and a very large number of people were in attendance. That is just one of many, many such events that have occurred—almost spontaneously in many cases—across the community, and I think that is true right around Australia. As I talk to colleagues, they have been amazed at the way in which the community has so generously and spontaneously—for some time now—been responding and giving. Hopefully that is some small token for many, many people of the support and the thoughts that go with our fellow Australians on this occasion.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,13,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—One feels compelled, notwithstanding the distance between me and the events that have been spoken about here over the course of the last few sitting days, to make a contribution and to support those who have expressed sympathy for all of those who have been affected by floods, not only in Queensland but also in Victoria and Tasmania. Of course, we keep in mind those who, over the same period of time, were affected by bushfires in Western Australia.
We are having this condolence debate to do three things. The first is to express our sympathies to those who lost loved ones and those who were injured or somehow physically affected by what we all saw on our television screens and what many members saw firsthand as local members representing those particular constituencies. It must have been a heartrending thing for them and those close to them. The effect on them has been clear for all of us to see throughout the course of this debate and through their contributions.
The second thing we hope to do by debating this motion is to transmit to all of those who helped others throughout the course of the floods our very great vote of thanks. We are genuinely grateful to them for all that they did throughout the course of those many days, including up to the recent events in North Queensland with Cyclone Yasi. The list of those making a contribution, and therefore the list of those we thank today, is very lengthy and I am reluctant to name them because there are so many. But in the first instance we think of those who are part of the many voluntary organisations, including those in emergency services—the SES, the Bush Fire Brigade—and those who are paid to go beyond the course of duty like those who serve in the police force. One that is very close to my heart is those who serve in the Australian Defence Force.
I was Minister for Defence during the bushfires in Victoria and had the honour of visiting those reservists from the Australian Army who were working in the most difficult circumstances, trawling through burnt houses with the unenviable task of looking for the bodies of those who had not survived. No doubt, in the course of the recent events, members of our Defence Force have faced similar challenges. We are grateful to them all and we thank them all.
The third thing we do by having this condolence debate is to acknowledge and recognise the Australian character and the way in which Australians in times of need always come together, band together to help those most in need. I think it is a trait that is well recognised around the globe and it is one we can be very proud of. On those three points, my sympathies to all those who have been affected, my thanks to all those who helped others in need and my congratulations to the broader Australian community for the way they responded to those people in their hour of need.
Debate (on motion by Me Albanese) adjourned.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,13,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I move:
That the House affirm the constitutional position as stated by the Speaker, and decline to consider the Social Security (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010.
This resolution draws upon three important documents: the Australian Constitution, House of Representatives Practice and Standing Orders. This House simply cannot place the parliament in the position whereby the House of Representatives ignores any of those documents, but in particular cannot simply choose to ignore, out of political convenience, what is stated very clearly in the Australian Constitution.
Under our constitutional arrangements it is the government of the day that is responsible for the management of public revenue and the budget. The government initiates all financial initiatives in the parliament, and that is for good reason. There are a range of initiatives which, by themselves, we could all agree on. We would all like to give extra money to particular groups in society, for example. But the reason that the founding fathers—and they were all men—considered the constitutional issues in the way they did was that they understood that as well as expenditure there has to be revenue; that governments of the day have to put up the budget. They also understood the respective role of the houses of parliament; that the House of Representatives is the people’s house and that the Senate is the house of review, representing states and territories.
The Constitution cannot be clearer; section 53 of the Constitution states:
Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate.
It cannot be clearer than section 53 of the Constitution.
Section 56 of the Constitution reinforces that:
A vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor-General to the House in which the proposal originated.
There is no message of the Governor-General attached to this legislation—none; so it simply cannot be passed by this chamber.
Advice which I have received—and which has been tabled in the House—of the Attorney-General, of the clerks, of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and of any legal minds which have considered these issues considers the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 from the Senate to be a proposed law appropriating moneys. All you have to do is read it. The explanatory memorandum presented by Senator Nash states:
Financial impact is approximately $90 million per annum.
That is, if the bill were enacted an additional amount of approximately $90 million would be appropriated on an annual basis. This would be an increase to 2013-14 of approximately $272 million.
The requirements under sections 53 and 56 are not confined to laws explicitly appropriating from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Laws that cause money to be expended under a standing appropriation are also covered. By altering the purposes for which money may be expended, in this case the category of persons entitled to a benefit, the bill is clearly in contradiction of both sections 53 and 56.
The financial initiative of the executive is enshrined not just in the Constitution, of course, but in House of Representatives Practice and in standing orders. House of Representatives Practice has been used in this chamber since Federation. Page 408 of House of Representatives Practice clearly outlines the financial initiative of the executive:
The Executive Government is charged with the management of revenue and with payments for the public service.
It is a long established and strictly observed rule which expresses a principle of the highest constitutional importance that no public charge can be incurred except on the initiative of the Executive Government.
The Executive Government demands money, the House grants it, but the House does not vote money unless required by the Government …
Page 431 of Practice deals with section 53 of the Constitution and limitations on the Senate powers of amendment:
Section 53 of the Constitution, as well as limiting the rights of the Senate in the initiation of legislation, provides that the Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue for the ordinary annual services of the Government.
Further, page 567 of Practice states:
A private Member may not initiate a bill imposing or varying a tax or requiring the appropriation of revenue or moneys. This would be contrary to the constitutional and parliamentary principle of the financial initiative of the Executive—that is, that no public charge can be incurred except on the initiative of the Government.
Indeed, this practice has been perfectly illustrated by the member for Forrest’s motion concerning this very matter. Advice was provided to the member that it would not be in order for a private member to present a bill to the House to extend the youth allowance in the way proposed in the bill, as it would contravene the practice of the House and be contrary to section 56 of the Constitution. So, rightly, the member for Forrest moved a private member’s motion rather than a private member’s bill. She accepted that that was the situation, as did the entire House of Representatives when we considered the private member’s motion on this matter last year. The same was the case when I put forward a private member’s bill in 2001 on equal rights for superannuation for same-sex couples. It had to exclude Commonwealth public servants because, as a private member, I could not appropriate funds. That is the role of ministers. I respected that. We have to respect the processes of this House if government is to have the respect of the people.
Indeed, a message from the Governor-General for the appropriation of public moneys may only be requested by a minister. Page 568 of House of Representatives Practice makes this clear:
It would not be possible for a private Member to obtain the Governor-General’s recommendation for an appropriation. Furthermore, of those bills requiring a Governor-General’s message, only those brought in by a Minister may be introduced and proceeded with before the message is announced. Therefore, only a Minister may bring in a bill which appropriates public moneys.
It cannot be clearer, and every member of the House of Representatives must understand that this is what we are debating, rather than the substance of the bill. People have views as to the substance of the bill that may vary. Certainly, it is the case, though, that we have to—and every member should—respect the Constitution and not engage in some form of anarchy where people, for opportunistic reasons, can take whatever position they like rather than respect the Constitution, House of Representatives Practice and the standing orders. We all know the rules of the game, and the Constitution cannot be clearer. That is why the standing orders reflect this as well.
Standing order 180 clearly spells out the principle again, and these standing orders were adopted unanimously by this House when this parliament convened. There were no objections by those opposite, there were no objections from the crossbenchers and there were no objections from government members. We all supported standing order 180, which says very clearly:
All proposals for the appropriation of revenue or moneys require a message to the House from the Governor-General recommending the purpose of the appropriation in accordance with section 56 of the Constitution.
For an Appropriation or Supply Bill, the message must be announced before the bill is introduced—
and—
For other bills appropriating revenue or moneys, a Minister may introduce the bill and the bill may be proceeded with before the message is announced and standing order 147 (message recommending appropriation) applies.
This bill would, if enacted, significantly affect public revenue and appropriate revenue by clearly increasing what would be paid under a standing appropriation.
The bill proposed by the opposition amends the Social Security Act 1991 to change youth allowance payments. The effect of the amendments proposed would be to increase the amount of money appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Senator Nash—only on 10 February, in her speech on the second reading debate in the Senate—said the following:
… this is not about fiscal responsibility of the government and bringing budgets back to surplus.
I say that it has everything to do with fiscal responsibility of the government, and our responsibility as members of the House of Representatives to act in accordance with our obligations under the Constitution. This is irresponsible behaviour from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition still has not accepted that he is not the Prime Minister. It is one thing to oppose; it is another to try and wreck the federal budget and play politics with the national economy
If you support having this bill debated then next week we will have another bill appropriating money for another purpose that may or may not be worth while and that people may in general support. But the reason the Constitution, House of Representatives Practice and the standing orders are framed the way they are is that budgets have to be put together, with expenditure as well as revenue. And you do not have to just to believe me—believe the Manager of Opposition Business. He said last week on ABC Radio that he accepted that, even if the bill passed the House of Representatives, the government was not obliged to send it to the Governor-General and it would not become law. This is what the Manager of Opposition Business had to say—and it gives up the game of what they are really about on that side of the House:
It potentially would lead to a constitutional crisis. I mean, the weight of constitutional opinion would be on their side, that they did not need to present it to the Governor-General. That’s true, because the opposition and the private members can’t have money bills adopted. They have to be initiated and they have to be presented to the Governor-General by the government.
I say to the House of Representatives: game, set and match. The Manager of Opposition Business, who will speak after I conclude, was stating the exact opposite of what he said on ABC Radio last week, where he said:
That’s true, because the opposition and the private members can’t have money bills adopted.
I was the Manager of Opposition Business in the dark era of the Howard government, and I never once even thought about taking this opportunistic direction. Never once did we attempt this. It is contrary to the Constitution and contrary—

Ms Marino interjecting—
—We have more regional seats than the Liberal Party. Not once did we take this opportunistic view. Indeed, in 2008, when the opposition last tried this, the Manager of Opposition Business, Mr Hockey, interjected—it is in the Hansard of September 2008—‘What we want is the government to adopt this position’. He gave up again in that debate that private members’ bills can be moved in this fashion.
So we have a situation in which the High Court of Australia has considered some of these matters in the Pape case. We have the Attorney-General, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, the clerks of the House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Constitution, House of Representatives Practice, and standing orders, but those opposite say: ‘Don’t you worry about that. Let’s just consider this and pass it even though, because there is no message attached, it will not make any difference to anybody.’ Let me be very clear: there is no message from the Governor-General attached to appropriate money, so it does not make any difference, but they will engage in this as a stunt. They understood and accepted last December, when they moved a private members’ motion to put the views that members of the House had, as is appropriate.
We facilitated in this new parliament the voting on private members’ motions and private members’ bills. Private members’ motions are completely legitimate for members of the House of Representatives to express their views with. They have done that, and the government has taken on board the views of many members with the announcement that we have made today. I thank those members, particularly all of the members on the crossbenches, who have engaged in a constructive fashion regardless of what way they vote on this particular issue. They have engaged constructively and understood the balance that needs to be made between political objectives to achieve an outcome and behaving in a fashion that respects the role of this House of Representatives.
We have a great honour and a privilege in sitting in this chamber. It is an honour and a privilege that we cannot use simply for opportunistic purposes. It is an honour and a privilege in which we have to respect the law, the Australian Constitution, the House of Representatives, the standing orders and, in this case with my resolution, Mr Speaker, your determination on this matter. It is correct. It is in line with all of the history that has been conducted in this House without exception. That is why I commend the motion that I have moved to the House and support your determination on this matter.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010 [2011]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—Respectfully, I have to disagree with the motion of the Leader of the House based on the advice that you have presented to the chamber. The opposition does not agree with the government that this bill cannot be considered and we do not agree with your ruling, Mr Speaker, that the parliament cannot consider this bill. It is our view that the parliament is perfectly capable of considering this bill. It is quite capable of amending it, of defeating it and of passing it. We fully accept that, under the Constitution, once the parliament has passed a bill it is up to the government whether it presents it to the Governor-General for royal assent. That is quite clear in the Constitution. The Constitution does not say that the parliament cannot even consider a bill, motion or any other action the House of Representatives wants to take. At election time the public elects 150 members of the House of Representatives. This is the people’s House and it has the capacity to determine its own rules and to do whatever it chooses to do. We are not in any way in breach of the Australian Constitution by sitting here today and considering a bill—considering what is simply a piece of paper in the form of a bill which would deliver justice for rural students rather than the government’s latest volte-face today, which is a review being brought forward 12 months.
Today’s vote is not about the legal technicalities of this bill, this House and the Australian Constitution. Today’s vote is about whether we vote for rural students or with the government’s review. Mr Speaker, we very rarely disagree with your statements to the House, but on this occasion our view is that the government is hiding behind legal technicalities in order to avoid what they have accepted is an unfairness. If the government wanted to it could right now adopt the coalition’s bill. It could immediately adopt the bill passed by the Senate. If the government had any good faith at all it could immediately adopt the Senate bill and make it its own bill. We would be more than happy to let it sail through the parliament today so that inner-regional students across Australia would be given the opportunity to have the same access to youth allowance as their cousins in other parts of rural Australia.
There is an inherent unfairness in the way the youth allowance has been developed by this government. Let me give you a very short, potted history. After holding out for 12 months against the government’s youth allowance changes introduced by the now Prime Minister because of their unfairness across all of regional and rural Australia, we were determined that money should flow to as many rural students as possible, so we did a deal with the government to pass as much of the youth allowance reforms as we could that would affect rural students in a positive way. We said at the time that inner-regional students were being discriminated against, we did not like it, we did not support it but we were not prepared to stop money flowing to other rural students in order to punish them in the way the government has punished inner-regional students. But we did in the Senate move a motion at that time—I think Senator Nash moved the motion and was supported by the entire coalition—that would have included inner-regional students in the definition of the criteria for youth allowance. That was defeated by a combination of the Greens and the government in the Senate.
So we are acting entirely consistently with the approach that we took at the beginning of this youth allowance debate. We believe that rural students do not have enough access to tertiary education. The Senate inquiry found that, while 55 per cent of students in metropolitan areas go on to tertiary education, only 33 per cent of students in rural and regional areas go on to tertiary education. It seems utterly remarkable to me that the Labor Party, which claims to be the party of social justice, would change the law in a way that would actually make it harder rather than easier for rural and regional students to get to university. I cannot fathom why they would go down that track but they have. So what we are saying today is that the House should be given the opportunity to consider this bill that has come from the Senate. We should be given the opportunity to consider it and we should pass it.
The legal technicalities that the Leader of the House has hidden behind are all very well for a government that refuses to accept the mistake that they made previously with the youth allowance. I say to the Independents and crossbenchers: if we consider this bill today, if we allow this debate to occur, it is open to the government at any point in the debate to adopt this bill and make it their own.
I know that this morning they gathered the crossbenchers together with the Attorney-General and told them that this is unconstitutional and cannot be done, and said that they will bring forward a review. The member for Lyne has put out a press release saying that they have reached another historic agreement with the government. But this agreement with the government simply brings forward a review by 12 months and accepts the unfairness of the eligibility criteria, because otherwise the government would not say:
… the government will ensure that the new eligibility arrangements which would be implemented from 1 January 2012 would eliminate the distinction between inner regional and outer regional students …
They have accepted the unfairness of their criteria and yet the crossbenchers have agreed apparently that they should change these rules that they have admitted are unfair on 1 January 2012.
If they are unfair, why wouldn’t they change the rules immediately? Why wouldn’t they ensure that all students, including those who graduated from year 12 in 2009 in inner regional areas, are able to access the youth allowance? If they know that that is unfair, why wouldn’t they act immediately to open the doors to the youth allowance for those students? They could apply at Centrelink tomorrow if we change the rules so that all those students from 2009 are not discriminated against. Under the government’s backdown today what we will end up with are students who qualified for the youth allowance before 2010, students who qualify for the youth allowance from 1 January, 2012 and a cohort of students in 2009 and 2010 who are operating on rules that the honourable member for Lyne, his compatriots on the crossbenches, the government and the opposition all say are inherently unfair.
So what I say to the crossbenchers is: wash away that unfairness, get rid of it. Make the rules for youth allowance apply immediately. Allow all those students from 2009 to apply. I can tell you what is going to happen. Students and their families in all our electorates after this latest shambles from the government—this latest backdown, which is just another embarrassing bandaid measure designed to cover their embarrassment because of their failure—will ask, ‘How come because I graduated in 2009 I should somehow not be able to access the youth allowance whereas my brother, my sister, my best friend or whoever, who graduated in 2010, will be able to access the youth allowance?’ It makes absolutely no sense.
So what I say to the crossbenchers and obviously to the opposition is: the government’s backdown does not solve the problem; it simply creates a new problem. I understand that the government have told the independents that they have given them an ironclad guarantee that what they do will have the same effect as the Senate bill, but what the Independents need to understand is that that is not true. What the government have promised you will not deliver what the Senate bill would deliver.
The Senate bill, if we pass it today, will mean that every student who should be able to access youth allowance because of their circumstances will be able to do so under the old rules. Whereas, if you stick with the government’s backdown position today, there will be a cohort of students who will not be able to access the youth allowance they otherwise would have and so you will have cemented in place an unfairness which would not be in place if the coalition’s bill is passed today. It is a very important distinction.
The government says it will give you an ironclad guarantee that they will adopt the coalition’s changes in the Senate. Just like the ironclad guarantees, I assume, on the solar panels program, on the emissions trading scheme, on the carbon tax promise before the election, on health reform which has been changed over and over again, on the start date for the national curriculum and on the mining tax. I could go on and on about ironclad guarantees. There was the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin plan which was a cast-iron guarantee before the 2010 federal election—
—Cash for clunkers.
—The cash for clunkers scheme! The list of government ironclad guarantees, hyperbole and over-the-top claims and announcements does not match their delivery. It never does and yet here is an opportunity for the crossbenchers to vote with the opposition to ensure that rural students are given the youth allowance that they deserve.
I know it is very intimidating when the government gathers together the Attorney-General, public servants and others and says, ‘You’re being unconstitutional.’ But the House of Representatives is supreme in this country. We are a parliamentary democracy. If the House of Representatives wants to debate a motion or a bill, we are perfectly entitled to do so. If it is passed, amended or defeated, that is the end of the matter, but it is certainly up to the government whether it is presented to the Governor-General. But that is a different distinction from whether we can consider it. If we do not consider this bill today, we will be establishing a precedent that the executive can intimidate the parliament into not debating a motion, a bill or any other matter which they deem to be an appropriation.
The President of the Senate, John Hogg, who is a Labor senator and not a member of the coalition, says the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 is not an appropriation bill because it does not create a new appropriation but simply adds to an appropriation that is already present. The coalition has found the savings necessary to fund this change to youth allowance through the Education Investment Fund at least until a review can be properly and thoroughly conducted that establishes how to get rural students to university—how to get them into tertiary institutions. These constant bandaid measures are not sufficient or acceptable. I note that, apart from one, every one of the crossbenchers represents a rural, regional or inner regional electorate. Our constituents will be watching very closely to see whether the crossbenchers stand up for rural students or are bamboozled by the government into not doing what they are quite entitled to do in this House, which is to consider a bill and then leave it in the government’s hands to reject it by not presenting it to the Governor-General.
I have said all along that we fully accept that, under the Constitution, the executive has to present bills to the Governor-General and that we cannot do that. That is a time-honoured tradition going back to the English Civil War, and we certainly have no proposals to change the way the executive deals with the Crown; but that does not mean that the parliament cannot consider a bill. If this debate had occurred in the 17th century, it would have been regarded by the English parliament as a vital debate about what the House of Representatives—or, in that case, the House of Commons—was capable of doing. I can assure you that our forefathers in previous parliaments would never have been intimidated into not considering a bill because they were taken to a room by the Attorney-General and intimidated into saying that they could not even consider a bill in the parliament—but that is what is happening today.
Finally, the House needs to understand that even if the government gets its way and stops this bill from being considered today—and even if it implements its backdown, which it announced in the dead of night last night to the Telegraph in the hope that it would cut off this debate today—there are thousands of students across Australia who will miss out on youth allowance. But the other choice is to consider this bill, pass this bill and force the government through political pressure to change the youth allowance immediately, starting from tomorrow, so that every student who is entitled to government support for their youth allowance to enable them go to tertiary institutions has the opportunity to do so. If we do not pass this bill today, and if we do not even consider it, families across Australia will think that their parliament has let them down.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010 [2011]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I note your statement, Mr Speaker, and I support the motion moved by the Leader of the House to affirm the constitutional principles as stated by you. I note that the Manager of Opposition Business has suggested various mechanisms to facilitate debate on the substance of the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 without passage of the bill, but that is not the issue at hand. These are not mere technicalities; these are fundamental constitutional principles and I will focus on those.
In summary, under Australia’s constitutional arrangements, the government of the day is responsible for the management of public revenue and the budget. The government therefore initiates all financial initiatives in the parliament, and this is reflected, as has been noted, in sections 53 and 56 of the Constitution. Section 53 specifically provides that such laws shall not originate in the Senate. Section 56 states that such laws shall not ‘be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has been recommended by message of the Governor-General’ to the House. The Governor-General’s message can only be given on the advice of the government of the day, and, as the Leader of the House has outlined, the House of Representatives standing orders reflect the government’s constitutional responsibilities. I will now run through those arguments in some detail. I also note that my letter to you, Mr Speaker, has been tabled.
The bill proposes to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and would have the effect of increasing the amount of youth allowance payments made from consolidated revenue under a standing appropriation. As has been noted, the explanatory memorandum itself suggests that the financial impact would be in the order of $90 million per year. The Leader of the House has referred to sections 53 and 56 of the Constitution. I will not reread those, but I will refer to the constitutional history that underpins those provisions. Essentially, the two provisions reflect the important principle of our constitutional heritage that the business of government in the Anglo-Australian context, reflecting our history and heritage, is conducted by the Crown—more commonly referred to in Australia as ‘the executive’. But that business, which necessarily requires a continual supply of money, is conducted with the approval and under the supervision of the parliament. Indeed, the constitutional history was noted by Attorney-General Barwick in his opinion on the operation of section 56 of the Constitution in advice dated 20 February 1962. Mr Barwick, as he then was, referred to the following extract from the British Budgetary System by Sir Herbert Brittain, which was published in 1959—a few years before Mr Barwick’s advice. It reads:
Underlying the Parliamentary procedure on Supply is a rule of the House of Commons which is of fundamental importance … ‘This House will receive no petition for any sum relating to public service or proceed upon any motion for a grant or charge upon the public revenue, whether payable out of the Consolidated Fund or out of money to be provided by Parliament, unless recommended from the Crown.’
That last phrase is crucial. On the basis of that historical analysis, the author concluded:
Only the Crown, therefore, can initiate proposals for expenditure and in the House the Crown’s right and responsibility in this respect are exercised by Ministers in the Government of the day.  No private member, on either side of the House, can exercise such initiative or move for an increase in any grant above the sum proposed by the Government.
Again, that indicates that the initiatives come from the Crown and are exercised by ministers of the government of the day.
Indeed, a review of this historical context makes it clear that the underlying purpose of these provisions is to ensure that the government of the day retains control over legislative initiatives for public expenditure. In his opinion, Attorney-General Barwick highlighted the rationale of these provisions by reference to Hearn’s Government of England, a historic edition of 1886 reflecting the history that we have inherited. That sets out:
It is … a fundamental rule of the House of Commons that the House will not entertain any petition or any notice for a grant of money, or which involves the expenditure of any money, unless it be communicated by the Crown.
This was to avoid, as the historic text describes:
… the scramble among the members of the Legislature to obtain a share of the public money from their respective constituencies, of the ‘log-rolling’, and of the predominance of local interests to the entire neglect of the public interest …
In other words, the executive having the overall functions of government in mind before proposing initiatives.
Consistent with this view, the Final report of the constitutional commission of 1988 saw section 56 reflecting the well-established principle of Westminster parliamentary democracy:
… financial initiatives are the preserve of the Crown. The Executive Government is charged with management of the public revenues and other public moneys and it alone may request public authorisation of expenditures. This request is formally communicated to the House by message of the Governor-General.
This ‘fundamental principle’ has been confirmed by the High Court of Australia in 2005, in Combet v Commonwealth. In their majority judgment, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan and Heydon noted:
… it is the Executive Government which begins the process of appropriation. This the Executive Government does by specifying the purpose of the appropriation by message to the House of Representatives.
Similarly in that case, Justice Kirby referred to a discussion of the issues in Lane’s commentary on the Australian Constitution and concluded that:
… the initiative for proposed appropriations belongs to the Executive Government, in accordance with s 56 of the Constitution.
The constitutional history that I have just run through is reflected in the standing orders, and in particular standing orders 180 and 147, which, again, the Leader of the House has outlined. I will not again describe those.
As has been indicated, there has been the controversy concerning: what is a law appropriating revenue or moneys? Indicating a degree of historic rivalry, yes, it is to be noted that the Senate’s view has not always corresponded with that of the House of Representatives on these matters, and the Senate has taken a different view in respect of this bill. The fundamental difference appears to relate to the question: what constitutes a law appropriating revenue or money? But, with respect, I think that the view of the Senate on this point is incorrect. I base my views on the weight of authority, including Attorney-General Barwick, to whom I have referred. The weight of authority is that the requirements under sections 53 and 56 are not confined to laws containing a clause explicitly appropriating the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Laws that cause money to be expended under a standing appropriation are also covered, specifically a law that alters the purpose for which money may be expended under a standing appropriation—for example, by increasing the categories of person entitled to a benefit or changing the formula by which that benefit was calculated to increase the amounts that could be paid out is covered. This was a view adopted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its 1995 report on the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. In the context of considering the first paragraph of section 53, the committee concluded:
… a bill which increases expenditure under a standing appropriation should not be originated in the Senate …
Indeed, more recently, in Pape v Commissioner of Taxation, the 2009 decision of the High Court of Australia, Justices Gummow, Crennan and Bell cited the following statement in the fifth edition of House of Representatives Practice 2005 when referring to appropriation bills:
… while not in themselves containing words of appropriation, would have the effect of increasing, extending the objects or purposes of, or altering the destination of, the amount that may be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under existing words of appropriation in a principal Act to be amended, or another Act.
Again, that refers to ‘the effect of increasing’ being particularly relevant.
Further, in the opinion by Attorney-General Barwick dated 20 February 1962, to which I have referred, and in a separate opinion that he gave on 26 November 1962, Mr Barwick set out a similar view in relation to section 55, reasoning that it is equally applicable to the principles of section 53. In that 26 November opinion he stated that, under section 56 of the Constitution, a Governor-General’s message is necessary ‘to the passage of a bill to increase benefits under the Social Services Act or to liberalise the conditions under which such benefits are payable’. I emphasise those words: ‘or to liberalise the conditions under which such benefits are payable’. With respect, Attorney-General Barwick was entirely correct on the history that I have outlined. It is clear that the purpose and natural consequence of the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill would be to liberalise the conditions under which youth allowance benefits are payable and thereby to increase the amount of youth allowance payments paid from consolidated revenue under that standing appropriation in the Social Security (Administration) Act.
It follows that the bill is a proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution and, as a result, could not properly have been introduced into the Senate and could not properly be passed by the Senate. On the same basis the bill is a proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or money within the meaning of section 56 and as such requires a message from the Governor-General to pass through the House of Representatives, and no such message has been obtained. It is clear, therefore, that there is no proper basis for the bill to proceed in the House of Representatives, and I support the motion moved by the Leader of the House.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010 [2011]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—The Attorney-General has just given us a long, complicated lawyer’s speech, and I am sure the lawyers in the House are very impressed. I invite the Attorney-General to come to my electorate and give that speech to the students who have not been able to get a university education this year. We are dealing with a serious issue, an issue that surely all members of parliament with goodwill would want to resolve. In this country, students who live outside capital cities have far less opportunity to get a university degree than those who live in cities.
The government often want to herald their social justice qualifications—they have a Minister for Social Inclusion and they say they care about a fair go for everyone—yet they have allowed to be entrenched in this place a system of student support that guarantees that people living in regional areas will not have the same opportunity to get a university degree as those who live in cities. Surely, this is an issue that the government would want to address. They have had three years in office, they have created the problem and they have not been willing to address it. They have not been willing to make the key decisions which would ensure that all Australians got a fair opportunity to have a tertiary education.
When you do not get that tertiary education, that is not the end of your disadvantage; it gives you a disadvantage when it comes to seeking employment in almost whatever career you want to enter. If you have not had the opportunity to get to university because the costs of getting there are too great, then you are disadvantaged throughout your life. If that is not the case, why do we have universities at all? Why does anybody have a university degree? Surely the reason is that the government and indeed our whole society believe that that kind of education is important—to give people a fair go and to make them as productive as they possibly can be in our community.
So we have an issue here. It is not an issue about the so-called rights of the government and it is not an issue about the Constitution; it is about whether or not people in regional areas are entitled to access the independent youth allowance so they can get a tertiary education. The government are hiding behind legal technicalities because they are not prepared to deal with the issue. If they were prepared to give students a fair go, they could find ways within the Constitution and within the bounds of their own arguments which would deliver the result that the coalition is seeking through this legislation.
What is their last minute offer to the Independents and others who are critical in this issue? ‘We will have another committee of inquiry.’ Another review—as if we had not had reviews. There have been at least two Senate inquiries that have gone on for months. Thousands of submissions have come in. Most of us as local members of parliament have received scores of letters on the issue. We know what the facts are, we know how it has to be solved and we could do it now; instead the government is going to have yet another committee, another review, and a decision perhaps in time for students in 2012. What about the students of 2011? They have a classic gap year. They are the ones who are left out altogether. There is no funding for them to get the education they need to assure their future careers.
If the government are really committed to fixing this problem, they should not give us a stack of legal arguments and they should not give us a lawyer’s address that might impress the High Court; they should give us some answers and some reasons why we should believe the government are going to address this issue. Do not just fall over and believe that the government some time, way in the future, might actually be intent on taking action.
It was not very long ago that the Leader of the House was accusing us of stunts and opportunism—which might be credible if it came from somebody else—but he can solve this issue immediately. He can solve it by picking up Senator Nash’s bill from the Senate and making sure we get the message from the Governor-General so that it can be dealt with promptly and immediately, so that income support can flow to students now, not some time beyond 2012 if it ever gets to that stage.
It was not very long ago also that we had the Leader of the House boasting about how well the House is now functioning in the national interest, about how the parliament has adopted important reforms and about how he is cooperatively negotiating legislation. Here is a chance for him to actually prove it, to deliver results, instead of a long line of gobbledygook and legal arguments about why it should not be done. Indeed, there is only one thing that is more complicated than the government’s gobbledygook and that is students trying to access the youth allowance. The gobbledygook that the government is putting up will not cut the mustard when you talk to people who are trying to get access to university.
So what is going on? The government is trying to prevent debate on this bill. We are not even allowed to talk about it. The principles of this bill have already been agreed to through a motion supported by the House, so it is not as though the government does not know what the members of parliament think about this issue. We want it fixed and we have said so in a resolution of the House. It has now been debated at length in the Senate, it has been considered in great detail and obviously it is a matter of significant national interest.
Unfortunately, it did not get the support of the government in the Senate. Quite surprisingly, it did not get the support of the Greens. The Greens, who walk around regional Australia and try to suggest that they are the new-found friends of people who live in country areas, would not support a bill that would enable regional students to go to university. Now they want to do some kind of a deal to put in place another committee. Frankly, that will not wash with the students who want to be at university now; they do not want to wait for some endless committee process.
This bill addresses the government’s decision early last year to alter the eligibility criteria for the independent youth allowance. These changes mean that students from inner regional areas have to work more hours over a longer period before being considered independent. Effectively, we have students in those inner regional areas who have to take a two-year gap after leaving school instead of taking one year, and they have to work full time on a continuous basis. They have to find a job that simply does not exist in those sorts of towns. People are not prepared to put on someone they know is only a short-term employee who is about to go off to university. The government does not seem to recognise how blatantly unfair and discriminatory these requirements are or that these requirements will result in many people, who would undoubtedly be able to make fine professionals, not being able to get the qualifications that they need.
Let me ask the obvious question: why should someone who lives in Gloucester, in the electorate of the member for Lyne, have a greater opportunity to attend university than someone who lives in Port Macquarie, Taree or Wauchope? That is what the current laws provide. Yet it seems that some people think that should be entrenched for another year. I think that is unfair. Why should somebody in Gunnedah or Tenterfield in New England have a greater opportunity than a student in Attunga or Armidale? It does not make sense to me.
But let me give you a classic case, and this may be the illustrative example of Labor’s incompetence in this area. Have many people have heard of the town of Kaimkillenbun, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa? It is a little town of about 100 people on the black soil plains of the Darling Downs. If you live on one side of the street in Kaimkillenbun you can access independent youth allowance but if you live on the other side of the street in Kaimkillenbun you cannot. It is a town of 100 people. What is wrong with the people on the other side of the road? Why can’t they get the same benefits, the same university education, as somebody who is in a house on the other side of the road? It simply makes no sense. A town of 100 people is divided by this government’s legislation—and it is not prepared to fix it.
We have also been told that this particular piece of legislation is inappropriate because it would blow the budget. It is a bit odd for the government to say that the very day after they did a deal with the Greens to give them $360 million and find another $50 million for the member for Denison. They could find all that over the weekend—to try to get in place their new tax to pay for the floods—but the $90 million that is required to fix this problem in relation to the independent youth allowance cannot be found. Apparently that is too much trouble.
In fact, they do not have to go looking around for it, because at election time this was part of our fully costed budget commitments. We identified where the money was going to come from—from the Education Investment Fund. It is one of the few funds that the coalition left to the incoming Labor government that has not been totally squandered. There is still around $2 billion of uncommitted funds in the Education Investment Fund. That is about seven times the amount necessary to fund the bill over the forward estimates. Treasury costed this policy before the election and they found no fault with it. The money is there. The money is available. It is a simple matter of the government putting in place the mechanisms so that it can be transferred for this purpose and used to make sure that people in inner regional areas are able to get a tertiary education.
The Education Investment Fund has already been raided by the government. So it is not as though we would be the first people wanting to spend some of it. But we were going to spend it on an educational function, trying to get regional students a tertiary education. Labor raided it for $2½ billion last year to fund a clean energy initiative. They took $2½ billion out of the education fund so that they could fund a clean energy initiative—one of those I think they have axed now. But that is the way the government operate. Presumably, it is now heading across to their flood funding or some other purpose. In other words, it is all right to use the education fund to finance a failing carbon capture and storage project but it is not all right to use it to support tertiary education for regional students. I think that is hypocrisy.
The bill that Senator Nash presented to the Senate, which is now before the House—and which we are being told we cannot even talk about today—is fully costed. It redresses a clear case of discrimination against 20,000 regional students. It is a bill about social inclusion. It is a bill about social justice. It should be voted on. It should be debated in this House. A government review that will report back in some months time, without any real promise that we will get a decent outcome anyhow, is not a substitute, and it is particularly not a substitute for the students of 2011—the class of 2011 that will not now exist; the class of 2011 that are in the gap year, when there is no assistance for students in this situation.
I agree that in the longer term—and this was very much clearly a part of the coalition’s election platform—there ought to be a better way to fund students. There ought to be a better way to provide living support on a permanent basis so that those people who have to travel to get their university degree get the financial assistance that they need. That should be an objective that we all work towards. Some of this work was done by the Senate committees, and they have got some ideas that certainly could be progressed in this regard. The proposal that the coalition has on the table was always intended as an interim measure, until that more fundamental reform could take place. This bill provides an opportunity to put that in place. We can deal with it. It should be debated in the chamber.
If the government believe there are technical deficiencies in what we are doing, let them get on the front foot and come into the House with a way in which they believe this matter can be dealt with correctly and immediately, rather than trying to fob off Independents and others with yet another committee of inquiry. This is an important issue about social justice for regional students. The parliament has the opportunity today to redress this problem and give to people who are being denied an education this year the opportunity to set about getting the qualifications they need for the future. The parliament can fix the problem today and it should do so.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010 [2011]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-02-21,"—In opposing the government’s motion, and in moving an amendment that would put financial responsibility at the centre of this debate, the Greens are upholding the Constitution. We are upholding the Constitution because the bill currently before the parliament, the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010, is not an appropriation bill. There is a strong line of argument that explains why this is not an appropriation bill.
If the argument is that it is an appropriation bill because it is going to result in the expenditure of money, then arguably any bill that passes the Senate is an appropriation bill, because almost any bill that one could imagine that would pass the Senate may require a public servant to do something, it may require the government to do something, it may require a committee or a tribunal to act in a certain way, and that will involve the expenditure of money—possibly even greater than the government had initially anticipated. More importantly, there is a strong line of argument, equally as strong or stronger in my submission than that advanced by the Attorney-General, that says: where there is an existing appropriation that is unlimited, the parliament has already passed the appropriation bill and the parliament has said, ‘We do not know how much money this will cost, but we are prepared to write an open cheque to pay the money, because it is important.’ When parliament subsequently amends the criteria to access that pool of money, that does not amount to an appropriation bill within the meaning of the Constitution.
It is not only the Senate that believes that, it is not only the advice from the Clerk of the Senate to the President, and it is not only the President who believes that; in fact, this House did exactly that in 2007. In 2007 there was a bill that originated in the Senate. It was the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2007, and it created an entitlement to pharmaceutical benefits in respect of prescriptions issued by optometrists, and it was to be funded out of a standing appropriation in the principal act. That bill passed the Senate, it came to the House and it passed without demur from the then opposition. The reason it passed is that the House has accepted that, in instances such as this, it does not amount to an appropriation bill.
The Attorney-General referred to a number of authorities and I have had a look at those authorities. It is very clear that the courts say: ‘This is about the law-making process. We are not adjudicating on a final law. We will not trespass into that, because that is a matter for the parliament to resolve.’ It is a matter for the House, the Senate and the government exercising executive power, and the other members who make up the parliament, to reach agreement amongst themselves about how they are going to proceed.
In previous parliaments, for reasons that one can readily imagine, where the government has had the numbers in the House of Representatives, when a bill has come here the government has simply been able to say, ‘This does not amount to an appropriation bill.’ But that does not mean that that is necessarily the case, and it does not obviate the fact that the parliament still has to decide what it is going to do with it. We have not confronted a situation before where we have a minority government and where legislation has been brought before the parliament to determine how we are going to deal with it. Those past practices may be well and good, but they do not speak to the situation that we find ourselves in now.
I am concerned that by adopting the principle that anything to do with money is automatically an appropriation bill or that anything to do with an existing appropriation is automatically an appropriation bill we in this parliament are ceding an enormous amount of power to the executive—power that ought to lie in the hands of this parliament. If we are to say that anything to do with money requires the minister to have a message coming from the Governor-General, we are diminishing the role of the Senate to initiate legislation other than appropriations legislation and I think we are diminishing the opportunities that are available to the crossbench in this House.
As a matter of principle we should be able to debate this bill. I would not support this bill; I would vote against it. The Greens do not support this bill if we are able to debate it, but I should emphasise that that is not because of the substance that this bill speaks to. My electorate of Melbourne has the highest number of students of any electorate in the country, and many of them live in residential colleges and they have come from regional areas. I know the enormous difficulty that people have in getting access to the independent rate of youth allowance and having enough money to live on. That is why, for quite some time, the Greens have been saying that we need a new test that will make sure that rural and regional students are not put at a disadvantage and that we do not have a continuation of the figures that we see at the moment where we know that students who do not come from the city are twice as likely, if not more likely, to not complete their first year because of the unique pressures that they face. That is why we want to see a new universal test that would mean that if a student has to travel more than 90 minutes to get to their university, they should be entitled to an independent rate of youth allowance.
I cut my teeth as a student politician around cost of living and access to university campaigns. I have seen governments from both sides, over many, many years, reduce the level of youth allowance to the point where it is far, far less than unemployment benefits. And systematically governments of both persuasions have restricted access to it. I do note the irony in that these very criteria and restrictions that we are debating at the moment arose effectively out of a deal between the coalition and Labor to reform the youth allowance.
It is absolutely clear that rural and regional students need better treatment, and that is why we need a better test that will enable everyone to get access to youth allowance. But the reason that I would not support this bill if we were allowed to debate it is that it is financially irresponsible, in the parliament that we have at the moment, to put up bills that would involve additional spending of money without having before the parliament, either in law or in some other way, a means by which they are going to be funded. We are completely able to do that; that is within our means. That is why, when this bill was before the Senate, we moved a motion that a message be sent to this place to ensure that the mining tax was increased sufficiently to enable the payment of increased youth allowance.
That amendment did not succeed in the Senate, and that is very disappointing. Given the balance of this parliament, we should not be in a situation where we are spending money in an irresponsible manner without saying where it is going to come from. It is not good enough to say by press release, as the coalition has done, that we would cut this program or that program, especially when that program has already been dipped into by the Leader of the Opposition for flood reconstruction; you cannot double dip. It is not appropriate to simply issue a press release to say: ‘If we were in government, this is how we would fund it.’
There is a means by which the parliament could do it and that has not been taken advantage of. That is why the amendment that I am moving to this motion that has been circulated in my name—that the bill proceed when parliament has agreed to a method to finance the measures contained in this bill—seeks to put economic responsibility at the centre of how we deal with this question in this finely balanced parliament.
The Constitution and the authorities that have been referred to send a very clear message—that is, it is up to the parliament to decide which bills it will pass and which ones it will not. We need to put the question of economic responsibility at the centre so that we can have a better deal for regional and rural students, and so it is funded in a fair way that does not leave a hole in the budget.
I am concerned that we find ourselves potentially in a situation where we diminish opportunities in the future that are available to this crossbench and to this parliament to legislate in innovative ways. I note that, despite some of the claims that might have been made by the Leader of the House by voting against this motion, it ought not be taken in any way as dissent from your ruling, Mr Speaker. This is not a matter of dissent from the ruling of the Speaker; this is a matter of the House collectively deciding how it will conduct its own business on a very important matter. It is not within the standing orders in the form of a motion of dissent from the Speaker; it is simply an opinion about how the House ought to conduct its own business.
I move the amendment in the terms that have been circulated. I hope that we are all able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by this new parliament. I hope we are able to have debate about a very important issue, and we do not respond simply by shutting down debate about an important constitutional issue. Ultimately, I hope we can get a better deal for rural and regional students but in a way that is economically responsible. I move:

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—We in this House should be able to debate this bill today. I represent the students who are most affected by this in the south-west of Western Australia. I hope that they and their families are watching this today. I hope that they can see to what lengths this government is prepared to go to continue to discriminate against their right to a higher education. I hope they are watching.
This is a shame; it is worse than that. I have been working on this since 2009, since this government chose to discriminate against students in rural and regional areas like the south-west of Western Australia. It is an indictment on this parliament that the two houses of this parliament have voted for the rights and the opportunities of regional students, and yet now we have this opportunistic process to try to prevent that debate.
Senator Evans actually wrote to the President of the Senate. Senator Hogg’s response was:
You have sought my assistance in ‘drawing this matter to the attention of Senators so that steps may be taken to ensure that the Bill does not proceed—
a preconceived outcome. The President of the Senate continued:
While I am happy to table your correspondence and the Attorney-General’s advice (and this reply) for the information of senators, it is quite inappropriate for you to ask me to take steps to ensure that a bill does not proceed on any basis, let alone on the basis that the House of Representatives has a different view of its constitutionality.
These are the lengths that this government is prepared to go to to prevent rural and regional students from having access to youth allowance. That is a real indictment on this government. We all know that the Australian Constitution is a grand document and the framework for this debate but the spirit of the Constitution is as important as its wording. Section 53 says:
Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate …
But it is pertinent to this debate to ascertain whether the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 does in fact appropriate money—and it does not. According to the Clerk of the Senate, in her submission to the Senate committee which examined this bill:
The Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 is not a Bill that appropriates money. It does not contain any clause that could be characterised as an appropriation.
She makes the important point in her submission that appropriations are already made for youth allowance and the Social Security Act of 1991 provides for income support for students in Australia. The funding for this act does not set a limit on expenditure; that is, the Social Security Act of 1991 does not identify a cap on spending.
The discrimination against some students based on where they live is not a result of the act setting a cap but of the policies of this government putting that discrimination into legislation. The changes to youth allowance did not put a cap on expenditure; they simply applied a discriminatory basis against recipients in certain geographic areas—like my own. So young people in my electorate who are already disadvantaged, who are already less likely to be able to access higher education, are being further discriminated against. The Clerk of the Senate also referenced this point, in saying:
When the parliament agrees to a standing or special appropriation, the relevant agencies have effectively been given a perpetual blank cheque for payments to be made. This means that a change to a bill of entitlements, such as providing wider access to income support, does not need to appropriate any money because the appropriation is already in place.
To make this clearer, I ask that members look at the legislation that passes before them every day. We have heard that nearly all the legislation has a financial impact and most of it involves an additional expense, even if it is simply in administration. But how many of these are appropriation bills? Most are not, because our constitutional forebears recognised the need for common-sense and practicality. They saw the need for acts of parliament that managed programs without calling them appropriation bills.
The Constitution of Australia implicitly directs the government and the parliament not to discriminate against any individual on the basis of where they live in our great nation. I can see Senator Nash nodding her head. She understands this very well because that is what we have seen here. Students today in my electorate are being discriminated against and the 2011 cohort and their families are currently being affected by this. They are moving from their regional area to a metropolitan area. We are losing some fantastic people and families—some wonderful resources from regional areas—on the basis of this discriminatory legislation.
We can fix it today if we debate this bill. It is inappropriate that you should be discriminated against just because you live in a regional area. It is an indictment of this government that it has allowed this to continue since the budget of 2009. This could have been fixed at any time. The government is well aware of this. This parliament—through the election of 150 people to this House, and through the Senate—has said that it needs to be fixed. So let us take the opportunity to fix it and fix it now. My students, my families and the 20,000-plus students and families around this nation are asking and begging for this. They beg me and I am sure they beg Senator Nash. If you had families and students affected by this, you would be standing up here like me and saying, ‘End the discrimination now. Let us debate this bill today.’
We all know the disaffection that regional students feel. It is alive and well, every day, and that is why we are so committed to this. We know what it is doing. I meet the families on a daily basis. I meet them in the supermarket. I meet the mums and dads that are saying, ‘We might now have to take an extra job.’ I have young people whose whole lives and careers have now changed. What is worse, I have young people who are actively not choosing year 11 and year 12 courses that lead to university because they know their families will not be able to afford it, on this basis. I have families who say to me, ‘We have to choose which one of our family members can go to university,’ as a result of this. They choose one member. Would you want to be one of those families? And how do you think the siblings feel? That is all wrapped up in this.
We are not taking this lightly, because this is as serious as it gets in a regional area. We need this to be fixed and fixed now. Another review is not what we need. It is not what the families need. It is not what those families who write to me, ring me and email me on a regular basis want. We know that the elected members reflect the will of the people—and the will of the people has been expressed by both houses. That is the will of the people. The government could and should agree to a fair and just system of access to Youth Allowance, right now. They could do that in the May budget if they chose to. They could do it today. It would indicate the strength of this parliament and the strength of the people’s voice in this parliament.
I believe that last year this House expressed its will in directing the government to act on Youth Allowance. It continues to refuse to do so. It continues to not allow this issue to be debated or action to be taken immediately. The students whom I represent in the south-west of Western Australia and all of the other great young people around this nation who deserve equity of access to youth allowance and therefore their higher education should have this access.
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—The original question was that the motion be agreed to, to which the honourable member for Melbourne has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘that’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

"Chester, Darren, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—In opposing the government’s motion I endorse the comments of the member for Forrest because this debate is all about a fair go for regional students. I would also like to reflect on what we are seeing here today: the true colours of this government and its so-called education revolution as it attempts to effectively gag this debate on one of the most important issues facing rural and regional communities.
The Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 has passed the Senate and should be debated in this chamber. If the government wants to hide behind constitutional issues it can bring in its own legislation to reflect the intent of the Senate bill. A failure to do so is an insult to the thousands of young regional Australians trapped in the mess that was created by the former Minister for Education, Julia Gillard.
Make no mistake, the government’s attempts to block debate on this bill have nothing to do with the Constitution, nothing to do with the rights and wrongs of student income support; they have everything to do with protecting the hide of the current Prime Minister. From the day the former education minister started amending the system of student income support, she talked big and she delivered a mess to regional Australia. This was no education revolution; it was tinkering around the edges and it distorted the system to such an extent that regional students have borne the brunt of the changes. The government at that time insisted that the changes were budget neutral, but at the same time this government was throwing $900 cheques around like they were confetti at a wedding. It is an appalling message that they sent to the students of Australia: the Labor government believed that plasma TVs were more important than giving regional students a fair go and handed out $13 billion in cash handouts and have shafted regional students in the process.
I congratulate the Senate, and in particular I congratulate Senator Fiona Nash, for introducing this bill. I thank her for her doggedness and her determination because she understands the plight of regional students. She is a woman of substance, much like the member for Forrest and the member for Murray and others who have spoken in the past on the need to get a better deal for regional students.
We have heard from several members on this side already, and many on this side understand the problems with the current system of student income support. There are a few on the other side who I believe understand as well but they are just too scared to come out publicly and raise their voices. Whatever happened to this government’s promise to let the light shine in? Let us have this debate, let us do the right thing by regional students and start fixing the mess. There is absolutely nothing to stop this government adopting the bill and introducing it themselves if they are so worried about its constitutionality. Minister Evans has already publicly acknowledged there is a problem with the current system. He is trying to cut a deal with the Independents for a review and changes to be made next year. But if that deal goes ahead, we will have another class of forgotten students—the class of 2009—who will be out of the loop in respect of the issue of inner regional independent youth allowance. I say again: the government has the capacity to fix the mess now and deliver a fair go for all regional students rather than the discriminatory boundaries we currently have between inner regional and outer regional.
The Leader of the House claimed earlier that his side has more regional members of parliament—and finally one regional MP has made his way into the chamber—so let us hear from them. Let us hear from the regional MPs from the Labor Party’s side. The member for Corangamite, the member for Bendigo, let us hear what they have to say because their students are also being discriminated against in this process. They clearly did not care enough to come in here and listen to the debate here today, or perhaps they have been gagged as well?
—Where are your mates? You’ve got none!
—I would invite members from the other side to come over and participate in the debate.
—Where are your mates? Where are they?
—I take up the Leader of the House’s comment about where are they? Where are your regional MPs? Why aren’t they speaking out? Have you gagged them as well?
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: it is a bit rough when there are no members of the National Party in the chamber to hear him speak, for him to be critical of—
—What’s your point of order?
—He is casting aspersions on members, which is against the standing orders!
—There is no point of order. The Leader of the House will resume his seat.
—I invite regional MPs from the other side to speak up on youth allowance, to speak up on the issue of inner regional and outer regional boundaries. I invite them to speak up because the member for Corangamite has towns like Colac, which is considered inner regional. They have to have different workforce criteria for participation in the independent youth allowance, so I invite them to come out and speak and raise their voices on this issue.
The bill, which has passed the Senate and should be debated in this House, is not the final solution, but it is a lot better than the current mess of inner regional and outer regional boundaries which exist today and discriminate against so many regional students. What we need is a complete overhaul of the system of student income support with a focus on levelling the playing field. In the interest of fairness and equity, regional students should have a tertiary access allowance they can access which compensates them and their families for the additional costs of moving away from home, which metropolitan students do not incur.
This government cannot keep hiding behind its ‘education revolution’ slogan. It has to deliver a better deal for regional families, and this bill should be debated. By declining to consider the bill, the House is denying a fair go for regional students.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010 [2011]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—There is another very important right which we need to consider in this debate today—that is, Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1948—that long ago—it stated:
… higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.
Is this government claiming that we are all dumb and stupid in rural Australia, that the merit that is found in rural Australia is not equal to that found in urban or metropolitan Australia? The consequences of what they are trying to do today—that is, to shut down a possibility of ruling out the inequities of inner and outer regional criteria for independent youth allowance—are denying thousands of country students access to tertiary education. The outcome of that is to remove a generation of rural professionals. Are we to look overseas for all trained doctors, nurses instead? Are we going to spend the same millions on trying to orientate them to Australian cultural circumstances, because there will not be rural generated professionals? The only professionals who, in too many circumstances, will come to country areas are those from the country. We are eliminating their chances of getting qualifications because so many Australian rural parents cannot afford the $20,000 or so it takes to have a student kept in accommodation, food, transport et cetera beyond their home.
It is just a tragedy. This is all about the current Prime Minister, the former Minister for Education, refusing to swallow her pride and acknowledge that she got it very wrong. It is one thing to come into this chamber and say, ‘Look, this attempt to get the thing right, somehow it is against the Australian Constitution’, but we have out there right now more than 10 to 15 per cent of students unable to access university from country areas—an inequity which is not only against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but it is also against any sense of Australian decency. The Prime Minister should be deeply ashamed. She should right now be talking to her Leader of the House and asking, ‘How can we fast track a debate where we simply restore the criteria of the coalition for both inner and outer regional students, and then we move swiftly towards a far better way to fund youth students in rural areas into the future so they can afford to go to university?’
People in my electorate have been rallying. We have had deputations. We have had parents in my office weeping because all their lives they have hoped to have their child reach their full potential by going to university and now they are seeing those hopes dashed. We have just come out of seven years of the worst drought on record. We have now experienced the worst flood on record. There is no cash for my families, but those families are designated ‘inner regional’. Their students are supposed to find 30 hours of work per week over an 18-month period within two years—and those 30 hours are not the average; they are the minimum for each week. Those students are supposed to survive a two-year gap period when very few universities in Australia will contemplate making an offer with a two-year gap—

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2011-02-21,"—I would like to share with the House my attendance at two commemoration services over the weekend to mark the 69th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. The 19 February 1942 bombing was the first time since European settlement began that Australia had been attacked on its own soil. Darwin was attacked by the same strike force that several months earlier attacked Pearl Harbor. The attack on 19 February was the first of 64 air raids between February 1942 and November 1943. The two attacks on 19 February killed more than 240 people and injured 400 more. Most of Darwin’s civil and military facilities were destroyed, including 20 aircraft and eight ships that were anchored in Darwin harbour.
I was privileged to attend a wreath-laying ceremony held by the Australian American Association at the USSPeary memorial in Bicentennial Park, a memorial for the two-thirds of the crew who were killed while their destroyer was anchored in Darwin harbour. Later that day, I joined a crowd of hundreds who filled the Darwin Entertainment Centre to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. I was heartened to see a representative of the Japanese government in attendance, the first time this has happened since these commemorations began. Consul-General Dr Masahiro Kohara said to a number of people that he was extremely sorry for the Japanese bombings and the damage they had caused. US Consul General Michael Thurston also attended the events and spoke about how important it was that America honoured the many soldiers who had died: more than 90 American soldiers were killed in the bombings.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—Mr Speaker, I move:
That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on 19 February 2011, of Sapper Jamie Ronald Larcombe, while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its greatest appreciation of his service to our country and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
It is my sad duty to report to the House that on Saturday night Australian time Sapper Jamie Larcombe serving with Mentoring Task Force 2 in Afghanistan was killed in action. He was killed along with an Afghan local national who was employed as an interpreter. Both were struck by gunshots and, despite immediate first aid, were unable to be saved. As a result, there are two families in grief, two families in shock, and we mourn with them today.
Sapper Larcombe’s parents, Steven and Tricia, his three younger sisters, Ann-Marie, Emily and April, and his partner, Rhiannon, will be grieving for him very deeply indeed today. The small community of Kangaroo Island, which is a small and close-knit community, will be in mourning for him today. His second family, the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, will also be mourning for him today, coming as this does so soon after the loss of Corporal Richard Atkinson, who was laid to rest just seven days ago.
I want to say a word about our combat engineers because they are some of the most remarkable individuals in the Australian Defence Force. These are soldiers who build bridges and roads for our forces. They clear landmines and other obstacles. They locate and disarm booby traps and roadside bombs. Their main weapons are patience, steadiness and courage and they stand in a very proud tradition. The 1st and 2nd Combat Engineer regiments trace their origins back to the first weeks of World War I in 1914, and in the past 12 months these close-knit units have been paying a high price. Jacob Moerland and Darren Smith were lost last year, Richard Atkinson and now Sapper Larcombe this year. Today in honouring Sapper Larcombe, I honour all combat engineers, whose work is so critical to the task at hand.
Last year when I spoke to this parliament about our strategy in Afghanistan, I wanted our nation to be under absolutely no illusion about the dangers that lay ahead. I warned then that there would be hard days, and this is one of those days. Every day we lose a soldier is a hard day and every loss hits us as hard as the first loss hit us. Our grief and our gratitude will never diminish, and neither does our determination. Jamie Larcombe knew why he was in Afghanistan and he did not resile from the job. Nor should we: our purpose in being in Afghanistan is very clear. Working under a UN mandate our forces are in Afghanistan to take the fight to the insurgents, to assist with building governance and capacity and of course to train the Afghan National Army. Jamie Larcombe died doing these three things. He was there to mentor and train, he was part of our efforts in Afghanistan, and he was taking the fight to insurgents. He was doing what he was trained for. He was doing what he signed up for.
As we mourn for Sapper Larcombe, let us never mix sorrow with pity. It is obviously hard from our safe and comfortable civilian existence to understand this, but this is the life our soldiers chose. They could do jobs here at home but they freely chose the life of a combat soldier with all of its dangers and with all of its risks, and despite those risks they go on.
The road is hard, but the cause is right. Sapper Larcombe’s loss was not in vain and we best honour his sacrifice by maintaining our resolve and backing his mates as they continue to do the job until the job is done. May this brave young soldier rest in peace and may his family and friends take comfort from the condolences today of a grieving and grateful nation.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Larcombe, Sapper Jamie Ronald</title>",Condolences,16,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to support the Prime Minister and to echo her eloquent words. Yes, Australia mourns another fine soldier, Sapper Jamie Larcombe, killed in action in Afghanistan. We grieve for him and our thoughts and prayers are with his friends and his family at this sad time. We also grieve for the Afghan interpreter who was killed by his side.
Above all though, we wish to encourage and support members of the Australian armed forces who are doing their country’s work in a very dangerous place. We owe it to our soldiers to ensure that their objectives are clear, achievable and important, and they most certainly are in this case. They are building a civil society in Oruzgan Province, training the Afghan army and effectively degrading the capacity of the enemy. It is most certainly in Australia’s national interests to build a safer and a freer world; it is one of the universal aspirations of mankind. Mr Speaker, there is no such thing as a casualty free combat commitment. Soldiers understand that and we should too.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing condolence for Sapper Jamie Larcombe. It is another terrible blow for our nation, another tragedy for an Australian family. I express my condolences to his parents, Steven and Tricia; his younger sisters, Ann-Marie, Emily and April; and his partner, Rhiannon. At just 21 years of age, Sapper Larcombe was our 23rd death in action in Afghanistan, operating, as he was, south-east of Patrol Base Wali in the Mirabad Valley. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have indicated, he was another member of our 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, which has a proud history of almost 100 years. Coming so soon, as it does, after the death in action of Corporal Richard Atkinson, this will be a terrible blow to the combat engineers and a terrible blow to our Army and our Defence Force personnel. It will also be a terrible reminder to 22 other families, in particular the Atkinson family, with Richard Atkinson’s funeral just one week ago.
At 21 years of age, Sapper Larcombe had been in the Army for just over three years. He recently saw his third anniversary of entrance into the Army. He conducted operations in Operation Padang Assist, in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and also as part of the Mentoring Task Force-Two. In addition to his death, we saw the death of an Afghan interpreter assisting Australian Defence Force personnel in Oruzgan Province, and we express our condolences to his family. Sapper Larcombe will have our deepest gratitude and our deepest respect, killed in action, as he was, under a United Nations mandate operating under the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, seeking to pursue Australia’s national security interests by helping to stare down international terrorism. Our thoughts are with his family, his loved ones and his friends.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Larcombe, Sapper Jamie Ronald</title>",Condolences,16,1
"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Defence to honour a fallen sapper, Jamie Larcombe, who, along with his Afghan interpreter, was tragically killed in Afghanistan just two days past. Too short has been the time since last we were here to honour one of our own. It is a poignant reminder that freedom is never free. We stand here, in the nation’s parliament, because fighting men and women stand there, on the battlefields of the world, where freedom, justice and liberty are scorned. Sapper Larcombe is the fourth engineer to be tragically killed in action in Afghanistan. He and his sapper mates bear a tremendous burden—nerves on edge, senses attuned to the slightest change in terrain, skills pushed to the limit. For all of the might of the Western world’s amassed armada in Afghanistan, it still comes down to a sapper to clear an obstacle, detect a mine or search a tunnel. As a combat engineer, it was Sapper Larcombe’s duty to go forward ahead of his mates to clear the path, his only companion the knowledge that every step forward kept his mates safe.
Ever since the 1st Field Company of engineers stormed the beaches of Gallipoli and within seven hours were building a road for ease of movement, sappers have been on the front line and have undertaken the difficult but necessary work with the skill and humour that only sappers can muster. Sapper Larcombe extolled the virtues of those original Anzacs, serving at the front, protecting those who come so closely behind.
As in ages past, so much of the burden falls on the loved ones at home. We offer our sincerest condolences to Jamie’s parents, Tricia and Steven; his sisters, Ann-Marie, Emily and April; and his girlfriend, Rhiannon. You have lost an only son, an only brother. Whilst you may never again follow his footsteps in the red soil of the outback, you can follow his heart, which, to the end, cared for those to whom he was entrusted. You as a family have paid a tremendous price so that our freedom can truly remain free. For that, our nation is indebted and we honour your only son as he joins the hallowed ranks of those who have fallen.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—In continuation, I want to make it very clear that this government has no other option, if it really does believe in the rights of rural students to tertiary education, but to move urgently to reinstate the criteria that the coalition had for all rural students in relation to independent youth allowance and then to move as swiftly as possible to introduce a comprehensive new way for rural students to be able to equitably access tertiary education. The problem is that the boundaries or zones that this government now uses to discriminate between inner and outer regional students were not designed to have anything to do with how close a tertiary education institution is to a population or the socioeconomic status of families in those zones. In fact, they were introduced for medical doctor retention purposes. It was either laziness or stupidity that saw them simply adopted to separate out the haves and the have-nots in terms of potential access to tertiary education.
It would not be so bad if the government at least understood and helped the rural universities now in country areas. But they have not built at all on the coalition legacy of trying to make sure that there are some tertiary education offerings beyond the tram tracks of metropolitan Australia. So there is no option for country students. In a place like Shepparton, which has a La Trobe University campus, there is only a very limited offering of university courses. It is no good if you want to do medicine, law or engineering. There are only business courses and some arts courses available. So I have to repeat: this government has neglected and callously disregarded rural students on so many fronts. It has not built up tertiary education offerings in regional Australia. It has introduced this nonsense approach to divide those who can still, under the old coalition criteria, apply for a one-year gap year and only 15 hours of work a week to become independent youth allowance recipients. It has left people in so-called inner regional Australia—and that includes people in towns like Shepparton and up to Deniliquin—with a two-year gap period that universities very rarely acknowledge as acceptable, and it leaves them in despair. In fact, in my electorate of Murray, there was an enormous drop in those even applying for tertiary entrance this year; and that is a tragedy. Students did not even aspire anymore to trying to gain a university qualification, even though their merit was as great as it ever had been, and even though, in ignoring the merit of country students, it is a direct violation of their human rights. I repeat: this is a travesty of justice for country students. The solution is in the hands of this government and it can be delivered today.
We do not have any alternatives, and for this Prime Minister—the architect of the problems we have on our hands today—to encourage her Attorney-General to say this is all about a constitutional problem and we should not even debate the bill: how cynical and callous can you get. I can imagine would-be tertiary students in my electorate listening to that and again despairing about the two-speed economy and the two-speed access to things like future tertiary education that is being encouraged by this government. I certainly will not be supporting either the amendment that has been moved or the proposition that we completely walk away from the needs of country students today. I urge this government to look at the rights of country students and to act with some humanity and sense of equity and fair play.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Oakeshott, Rob, MP",IND,2011-02-21,"—I think there are many of us in this chamber from regional areas who are salivating at the chance to talk about better regional access to education and I know there are many members of parliament who are also salivating at the chance to have some parliamentary push-back on the executive. This is therefore a welcome debate before the House this afternoon. I need to also reflect and hopefully remind the House why we are able to have this debate: it is because we have a working parliament with tight numbers.
We have had a successful vote on the opposition motion on youth allowance because we were able to negotiate in this parliament the ability of private members to bring forward motions and private members’ bills for debate in this House. We are having a vote because this parliament allows for debate and consideration on private members’ bills. I think generally we are talking about regional education because of some sensitivities of many members of parliament pushing the importance of regional education and access and participation in education.
We are also talking about some of the deeper questions faced by a chamber such as this with regard to the roles that are played by a parliament and members of parliament versus those played by the executive. Again, it is not a debate that is normally had when there is a majority government, so I welcome this opportunity. Hopefully, all members will reflect on why we are having this debate and the advantages that come with a tight parliament, and hopefully those traditions can now continue whenever a majority government returns in the future.
I think the point was made in earlier debate about reflecting on traditions of parliamentary procedure and practice; however, it is also fair and quite right to say that this is a unique set of circumstances, and so those traditions need to be lined up against the realities of the moment. We should not be afraid of, if need be, shaping precedent for the future and being aspirational about shaping a direction for this parliament and the people of this country that is in the national interest.
With regard to regional education, access to education and youth allowance, I would not be on my feet right now if it were not an important issue. To be fair to all sides of politics, I know many members of parliament, both privately and publicly, have also expressed similar views. We can bang on about the politics, but the reality is there is an issue, there is a problem and it does need to be resolved. Before we get there, however, we are also in denial if we do not recognise there is a constitutional question before the chair. I will not say whether I agree or disagree, but there is a question before the chair. The clerks of the House of Representatives deserve to be listened to. Their advice and the advice from the Speaker deserve to be heard. We can deny it, but I think the legal advice to government and the detail that has been provided deserves to be listened to and considered.
From my perspective, I accept the fact that an appropriation without savings is questionable with regard to constitutionality. We can argue yes or no, but what is without doubt is that, if a precedent is established from this legislation, it is definitely unwieldy with regard to the way government would operate into the future. So we have constitutional lawyers at 10 paces, but in the end the question is: can government function with members of parliament in US congress style putting up private members’ bills with money attached to them and without savings measures? That deserves consideration, and I accept that that is a step too far for functioning government.
However, there is an amendment from the Greens and it captures the compromise position. If there were to be savings measures attached to bills in the future, that is a sensible move for parliamentarians to demonstrate in whatever they want to bring forward as a preferred issue that it is important to them. If they can attach to that legislation savings measures of an appropriate amount, I think it is a sensible amendment to the principles of how an Australian House of Representatives could or should work into the future.
That amendment is one that I will certainly be supporting, and I will be interested to see how all parties deal with it. I can only guess that the government will violently oppose it, again from the executive position. The question will be for the opposition to consider, because denying that as an opportunity when going for an even higher standard of having direct access to the Treasury bench from opposition is an odd position. The question of Treasury or bust versus a compromised position where all of us have to meet the discipline of presenting bills with financial savings as well as any money requests, I think, is important for a parliament in its dealings with the executive and the Treasury.
In the case of the bill that has come from the Senate, and in particular from Senator Nash—and I congratulate her, by the way, for bringing this bill forward and bringing the issue forward to this House—I hope it is an example to some of her party colleagues, not in this place but in the other place, who got us into this mess or were a party to getting us into this mess. At the end of the last parliament, the Senate cut an ugly deal that created this concept of ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ regional areas and placed a geography test on top of a poorness test. That has proven to be a failure. So for Senator Nash to pick that up early and bring it on, I think, deserves congratulations, and hopefully the Senate has learnt a lesson on the back of that.
—Say it again, Rob; she’s here now.
—I just praised Senator Nash, who has just joined us. What is not in that legislation in detail, which is unfortunate—I gather it is in press releases and in public commentary—is the nation-building fund as the funding mechanism. That, for me, is a problem—that it is not actually identified in the bill. Going back to that previous point is the reason why. It would have been handy for the funding mechanism to be identified, as well as savings measures alongside that. The nation-building funds do place pressure on the budget bottom line. If there is a spend from that, they are accounted for in the budget cycle and they therefore need to be addressed as a budget item. Therefore, it is not as if these nation-building funds are off on one side as something that can be tapped without budget consideration. At the moment we are all going through the regional round of the Health and Hospitals Fund. That will have budget implications. There are important capital expenditures that are hopefully going to be announced over the next three or four months for many regional projects. Wagga, in front of me, is one example; Port Macquarie is one; so is Tamworth, next to me—look at all the hands go up. These have budget implications and are an example of why these nation-building funds cannot just be tapped without broader budget consideration. So for me it is not an either-or.
The other problem with the nation-building funds is that, if we just tap the education funds or nation-building funds generally, what they were going to be used for starts to be questioned. The EIF, as part of the agreement that was reached with government, does have a regional capital round attached to it, and that will hopefully be opened by government soon. I have been meeting with many vocational education providers and universities who want to develop some really good projects for education, many in regional and rural Australia. Therefore, another genuine concern is this either-or choice between youth allowance and the EIF. I would prefer that we be able to see the EIF do its job of providing capital projects for education in regional Australia and that we do what we can to get the result of better youth allowance outcomes for regional and rural students within Australia and tackle that topic of engagement with education and increasing participation rates.
In response to all of that, what I have tried to do is capture the very real substance of the issue that has been raised, and that is the issue of this ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ regional designation and the problems associated with that for many students. The electorate of Lyne is no different to any other. I now have a line right down the middle of the electorate—a line in the Lyne—where there are those that are in and those that are out and have a different set of rules of qualification for independence. But I also do not want to see a constitutional argument, rightly or wrongly, used as a show stopper in getting this issue addressed, either wittingly or unwittingly.
So, in response, over the past week several of us have been trying to reach an agreement with government on the substance of the issue, and we have reached an agreement in the following terms. It is that the government will bring forward by 12 months the review which is required by the social security amendment act to report by 1 July this year. That is only about 16 weeks away. It is not just another committee; it is the legislated review that is part of these youth allowance changes. This is bringing it forward to a time now 16 weeks away—something that is not in the substance of the bill itself, by the way. So we can now bring that forward and start that process of considering the impacts of the recent reforms, including the capacity of regional students to access higher education and appropriate savings that can be made to pay for extensions in eligibility for youth allowance. The changes will be informed by the findings of the review. The government will present legislation to the parliament this year with a view to implementing new eligibility arrangements with effect from 1 January next year—so 2012. The government will ensure that the new eligibility arrangements which would be implemented from 1 January would eliminate the distinction between inner regional and outer regional students, so we have blown up that concept—that deal that was done in the Senate—of the hybrid model and the geography test put on top of the poorness test, which is the fundamental problem that we are debating today. The final agreement point is that the solution will be evidence based, financially responsible and sustainable in the long term. Given the tough budget environment, any new spending needs to be offset by savings. If there is any political capital in this at all, in my view it is that last point. Depending on events today, if this is where we end up then the arguments around the savings measures and the ability for as much money as possible to be put into youth allowance based on a poorness test are an important fight for all of us regardless of political persuasion.
I will be surprised if we get down to the substance of the bill, because I do think there is a constitutional fight to be had. I acknowledge the amendment that has been put up by the Greens, and I think that is a sensible compromise position for the parliament in its relationship with the executive. I certainly think that provides some good prudential boundaries for members of parliament when they bring bills in in the future. I hope to see, either through this bill or through the actions of government through the agreement reached, the issue of regional participation in education finally getting addressed, and addressed in an equitable manner.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I find it alarming that we are here today debating whether we can debate the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010, but it does not surprise me that we are doing it when you look at the newspaper headlines of today such as that in the Tasmanian Advocate ‘Students urged to lobby for equity’:
The fight continues to give Devonport and Latrobe students the same youth allowance entitlements as their North-West counterparts.
The member for Braddon is quoted in this article. Mr Sidebottom said he was happy to debate the issue again. I look forward to Mr Sidebottom joining us so that we can debate this in proper terms.
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—The honourable member for Braddon, I think, is the term that the member for Wannon intended to use.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a very important speech and I got a little bit excited and carried away. The Courier Mail headline is ‘Backflip on youth: Gillard blows millions’:
In a spectacular backflip likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the Gillard government will today announce it is fast-tracking a review into regional youth allowance.
‘Gillard cave-in heads off crushing defeat’ says the Daily Telegraph:
The Gillard government has caved in to a $300 million Coalition demand and will overturn its youth allowance laws in an extraordinary political precedent.
‘Coalition push on student pay bill’ says the Age:
The federal Coalition hopes to make history today by forcing Labor to relax youth allowance eligibility for regional students.
That is why Labor does not want to debate this bill. I have a word of warning to the crossbenchers on this: private members’ bills are worthless unless they lead to action. We can have debates and we can talk for 12 months or for two years, but unless we get action on this issue the debating will be meaningless and the private members’ bills will be meaningless.
I use an example of a family in Tarrington in the electorate of Wannon who have contacted me. In this family currently there is a student who under the old rules is accessing independent youth allowance and attending university in Melbourne. There is another member of this family who wanted to do exactly the same thing this year, but they have not been able to and, under what is being proposed by the government, they will be left in limbo. Fortunately, if these changes go through, there will be a third member of the family who will be able to access once again independent youth allowance and will be able to go to university. But, as a word of warning to us all, we have to do our best to look after the student that has been left out.
While she is here in the chamber, I would like to praise Senator Nash for her bill. She has been like a dog at a bone on this issue and in defending regional and rural Australian students. I congratulate her on her foresight in getting this bill through the Senate and into the House today. I also praise others on this side who passed a bill on this through the House last year. It goes to show that what we need is action now.
I understand that what has been agreed by the government with the crossbenches is to bring forward the review into what is happening to regional and rural students as a result of the changes which were made to the independent youth allowance. We do not need another review. I am sure a visit by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and the crossbenchers to any regional or rural electorate will suffice because there is no issue for young people in my electorate—and, from what I have heard, from other members—that has hit a nerve like this independent youth allowance issue. It is seen as discriminatory and the record sadly is backing that up.
A report just released called Deferring a university offer in regional Victoria 2010 shows that 30 per cent of those who defer do not take up their offer or remain in their course. We are forcing more people to defer their course to get income so they can work, yet in regional Victoria 30 per cent of those students will not end up completing their course. More than 81 per cent of those who defer are in the two lowest quartiles of socioeconomic status. These laws are targeting the most vulnerable, those people who cannot afford to go to university. They are the ones who are being disadvantaged. Only 7.8 per cent of city students deferred in 2010 compared with 15.2 per cent of regional students. There is an inequality between city and country areas—that is the divide. As Toni Jenkins from the Southwest Local Learning and Employment Network said when she read this report, data indicates that the academic profile of students in our region is just as high as in metro areas. It is clear that other factors, such as financial hardship, are impacting on their outcomes. We have the evidence already; we do not need another review. We do not need a gag on a debate on independent youth allowance. What we need is action—we need action so that regional and rural students can access the income that they need to go to tertiary education this year and next year.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Christensen, George, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—I rise to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 as a representative who lives in an area that is classified as an inner-regional zone of the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Area. I represent students in the Mackay region, who are discriminated against by this legislation which restricts the independent status of youth allowance.
The members opposite have created the situation where students in some regional areas, such as those in Mackay, are treated differently to others when it comes to youth allowance. They have created the situation where students in different towns in the same region are treated differently when it comes to youth allowance. And they have created a situation where students on different sides of the street are treated differently when it comes to youth allowance, as the Leader of the Nationals outlined in the House earlier.
They have effectively created an apartheid policy in relation to youth allowance: a student apartheid. You can either get access to the independent rate of youth allowance through one set of circumstances or you can jump through a whole heap of other hoops and hurdles as students in Mackay have to do.
Today, we have the opportunity to do something about this disgraceful situation. Now we have the Labor Party trying to shut down the debate; trying to stop the vote just in order to save face. Those opposite are very happy to put politics before students; they are happy to continue to screw students over in order to save face on this issue. What a hardhearted bunch these people are. These students are real people we are talking about; they are affected by this atrocious situation—this student apartheid that the government have created. They are real people, often from families who are struggling with rising costs of living already who want the best for their children, but who are unable to fund their university degrees.
And why would that be? We could look at the University of Queensland, which outlines on its website the costs that an average student incurs. I note that many Mackay students do find their way to Brisbane to study in degrees that are not offered locally. UQ says that a student living in shared accommodation and off campus would pay approximately $14,248 for rent, food and utilities, and approximately $3,210 for establishment costs when setting up their accommodation. That is more than $17,000 in the first year alone.
But wait, there is more. UQ goes on to mention the additional living expenses, such as public transport, entertainment, telephone costs, textbooks, photocopying and clothing. And there is more: personal access to a computer and the internet is recommended for all students. And for those who need a car to get about it can vary from anywhere between $5,000 to $25,000 and $90 a week fuel costs. That is a costly exercise for most people, particularly students.
The bill that the coalition wants to put before this House helps those students and helps average families who send their students off to university. It does so by allowing students easier access to a higher rate of youth allowance, this being the independent youth allowance.
On this side of the House we have all had numerous people contact our electorate offices about this apartheid situation. I just want to draw the House’s attention to two of these people in my electorate of Dawson. The first of these is 62-year-old Stephen Parker, who happens to be the father of a young daughter who has begun studying a medical degree in Townsville. She does not get that independent rate of youth allowance, even though for all intents and purposes, she is independent. She just does not get it because it is too hard to get under the current arrangements.
Mr Parker, who is going to retire in about three years time, wrote to me about this matter, and towards the end of the letter he says:
I would not be writing to you at all if I lived in Townsville, Brisbane, Sydney or any other capital city. … My peers who live in these places have no such burdens to face and indeed many will avail themselves of assistance as well. Living outside of these places puts extra costs on families not to mention the additional hassles of finding accommodation, security and all the other worries of having children living away from home. Many of these costs are substantial. It is these extra costs that should be helped with by the government.
Sadly, all too little consideration is given to these costs under the present scheme.
For Senator Nash, who was here earlier, and for all those who are lobbying to change this, Mr Parker goes on to say that he wants to thank this side of the House for what they have done so far and he encourages us to continue lobbying for these changes.
I also want to mention the case of young Matthew Flor. His father, Darrell, wrote to me about this situation and he said that Matthew:
… completed a work placement at Team Engineering in Mackay for which he was paid. The amount that he was paid allowed him to qualify as an independent student for youth allowance purposes according to the criteria that was published on the Centrelink website at the time. Matthew finished his work placement on the 27th June, which allowed him a few days to complete his application for youth allowance before returning to Rockhampton to commence study for term 2. Using the criteria available on the Centrelink website, he completed his application and lodged it in person at Mackay Centrelink on the morning of 1st July 2010 … The Centrelink employee who accepted his application actually congratulated him on providing all the required information for independent status, and advised that he should not have any trouble with qualifying.
Matthew was later advised that his claim was rejected because the rules for independence changed on 1st July 2010.
One day late—so Matthew misses out now because of the hard heartedness of those members opposite. His family now has to scrimp and save, and no doubt Matthew has to chip in as much as he can—as much as a struggling student can—all because they created this apartheid situation. Here, now, is our chance to overturn this disgraceful piece of legislation; to give Matthew Flor, Ms Parker and many other Mackay students a fair go.
Members of the House have been pressured to say that the legislation that we are proposing is unconstitutional. Those opposite claim that it is unconstitutional, or that it is about appropriation or whatever they can dredge up to try to ensure that this bill does not see the light of day. But not everyone on the Labor side actually agrees. The President of the Senate, Labor Senator Hogg, put the view that the bill in question does not appropriate money, and he went on to say that it:
… does not need to do so because any funds required to support the measures in the bill have already been appropriated by the parliament in the form of a special appropriation of indefinite amount in section 242 of the Social Security Administration Act 1999.
The Clerk of the Senate has also said that parliament has agreed to a standing or special appropriation under the Social Security Act, which has effectively given a:
… perpetual blank cheque for payments to be made. This means that a bill to change entitlements, such as providing wider access to income support, does not need to appropriate any money because the appropriation is already in place.
That is pretty much clear cut: this bill is not about appropriation and it is completely constitutional. There is absolutely no reason to hold this bill up. I say to the House: let this bill be debated, let justice and fairness for Mackay students prevail and let this bill pass.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"McCormack, Michael, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—This is about fairness, equity and assisting regional students to have the same opportunities as those who live in capital cities. If, as this government often claim, their focus is on regional Australia, here is the chance for the government to put action where their words are—real action, real policy and real hope for country students. Here is the test. It is not a geography test. It is not a test between inner and outer regional students. Allow the bill to be debated on the floor of the House of Representatives. What does the Prime Minister have to hide? I would like to see the Prime Minister show genuine leadership and help the bill pass. If the Prime Minister decides not to do this then I would like her to tell the students of Wagga Wagga, Junee, Tumut, Gundagai, Coolamon, Batlow and Adelong in my electorate—and all of those students in all of the other electorates, including those in Labor electorates, and also those in Mackay—why she will not allow them fair and just access to independent youth allowance.
Labor’s claim that the coalition’s policy to fix youth allowance for regional students is not offset with savings is a nonsense, a lie and a disgrace. As stated in the accompanying document to the bill, the coalition proposes that this be funded from the Education Investment Fund so as to be budget-neutral. The Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 was introduced by the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional education, Senator Fiona Nash, last September. It follows a similar motion that was moved and passed in the House of Representatives. The bill was passed in the Senate on 10 February 2011, with 35 votes in support and 33 against. The Greens and Labor opposed the bill—what would you expect? Independent Senator Nick Xenophon and Family First Senator Steve Fielding voted with the coalition. The Labor government, in an unprecedented move, wants to scrap the bill, even sounding out the possibility of Governor-General intervention. This is an extraordinary move by a government running scared from the parliament because it knows it will and it should lose the vote on the floor of the House of Representatives.
The changes to youth allowance which passed the Senate will not even be considered by the people’s house if the government has its way. How undemocratic. How unfair. How un-Australian. This is in conflict with the 2008 precedent established when the Rudd government allowed a coalition bill that had originated in the Senate and which sought to increase the pension to be presented to the House of Representatives. A motion to do exactly what this bill proposes passed the House of Representatives with crossbench support last year. The government knows it would again, and it is too weak and too insipid to face the music this time. We do not need another review. This is, if the Prime Minister is to be believed, to be the year of delivery and decision—not delays—so just let the bill be debated and let it be passed. Students in the inner regions who cannot access youth allowance will be the big losers if this government persists with this abhorrent and discriminatory tactic.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Crook, Tony, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—I am bit surprised we are having this debate. This, in my view, has been through this House once before on the back of the member for Forrest, and the vote was won. There was a passionate plea from the Senate. In fact, I thought there was a fire in the Senate on Thursday, as the bells were ringing so often, and the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 was brought back to this place.
I would like to use this opportunity to clarify a few points that have been made today, mainly in the words of the Manager of Opposition Business in his speech. I was not party to an agreement with the government on this. In fact, I pushed hard for it to be implemented almost immediately. Failing that, I asked for it to be brought forward to 1 July 2011 so it could be thought of in the next budget session. There is a real opportunity for it to go forward there, but that request has fallen on deaf ears as well. July 2011 would not have been perfect, but it would have given a clear indication that this government were serious about regional students. My electorate of O’Connor, a mere 909,000 square kilometres, has lots of regional students and every one of them suffers. I appreciate that they are not inner regional, but the intent of this is critical and the intent or the view of government towards students per se are critical in this discussion.
I think it is a shame that we have got to this point where we are now putting pressure on the Speaker. I think the government should have used the opportunity and realised that this motion would be won in the House as it was last year when the member for Forrest got her motion up. With the great work of Senator Nash in the Senate, I think that the government should have taken the opportunity, bitten the bullet, realised the error of their ways and looked out for those inner regional students in this situation. It is a lost opportunity. It is a shame that there was any inequity in the first place. That to me is the biggest travesty in all of this—how a line on a map can determine whether or not you get youth allowance. It is clearly and blatantly wrong.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2011-02-21,"—There are a few issues that I would like to raise. Essentially, we are looking at two issues here. One is the substantive issue of youth allowance. We have talked about that a lot. In the previous parliament there was legislation that came in. I was involved in some of it, and I think the member for Sturt would remember that there were games played. The outcome that we are dealing with at present was not a perfect outcome. In fact, a deal was eventually done in the Senate. I think the member for Lyne has referred to it as ‘a dog of a deal’. I think most of us recognise that it was not perfect and that it was to address a certain sum of money rather than a sum of students. Nonetheless it did occur, and I remember quite clearly that the Minister for Education at the time and the current Prime Minister was trying to negotiate with one of the senators—who will remain nameless for this exercise, but I think most people who were closely involved at the time would know which senator I am talking about. I tried to negotiate a better outcome in terms of a regional package for students who were going to be disadvantaged, particularly that cohort of students who were going to have to leave home to find a job to prove that they were independent of their home so they could achieve an independence test for the youth allowance. That was a proposal of about $30 million which died in a ditch but would have got the support of government at the time had in fact, one particular senator seen the benefits to country students of taking on that regional package.
The youth allowance is an issue that all country members are very concerned about. There was also an issue—and I still think it is an issue—where city based students in particular use the independence test to obtain income and then live at home. They get the benefits of both worlds. There is no doubt in my view that under the Howard arrangements there was rorting going on in the system. On extreme occasions two fathers would exchange cheques for $18,600 to prove that their children were independently earning income over a period of time and, therefore, could access the public purse for assistance. I can remember—and I think the member for Sturt can remember quite clearly too—how there were issues of retrospectivity which have since been cleaned up. Because of the various constituency bases in here there were issues of city based children who did have the option of living at home and attending a university accessing the public purse to the same degree as a country child at Walgett, where they do not have a university and have to leave home to study. The member for Parkes, which includes Walgett, is sitting in front of me. So there are still inequities—and they were in the coalition’s argument as much as they were in the government’s argument at the time.
Before moving on to the second part of the issue I want to bring some members of parliament and the community up to date on what happened in the previous parliament. During the coalition years the income test for students had a cut-off point that started at $34,000 to $42,000. It was $34,000 at one time and $42,000 at another. Students’ family income, once it reached $42,000, started to decline in terms of the capacity of that student to access youth allowance. That is not saying it disappeared immediately; it started to move backwards. I was supportive of the then Rudd government in addressing that issue, because there are a lot of kids, country or city, who could not go to university because their parents were relatively poor. The $42,000 ramp-down figure was far too low. The emphasis changed slightly and was done to within a dollar figure rather than trying to address the substantive issue. The government increased the income test. I have had countless parents in through my doors and I am sure other members have as well. When the debate is solely about the independence test, when you refer them to their accountant the penny very often drops and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t realise that; I didn’t realise that my child could obtain youth allowance at relatively high income levels.’
I will give some examples. For a family income of $80,000 with two students at university, if they had taken the year off to prove that they were independent under the old arrangements or even under the current arrangements, the family would get $28,000 annually. That is not $28,000 each; that is the assistance that the family gets. Under the family income arrangements, based on the $80,000 income the family would receive $21,300. The cut-off level for that family would have been $72,000 under the old arrangements. They would have got nothing. For a $100,000 income in the same example, that family would still receive $17,300 under the income test. That is not as good as being independent, because the family would get $28,000, but it is still a substantial sum of money bearing in mind that the ramp-down started at $42,000 previously. Even at $138,000 family income those two students, where one is in year 1 and one is in year 2, would have the first-year student get $6,250 because of the various scholarship arrangements that were put in place. They were not in place under the old arrangements. The second-year student would get $3,250 plus a small youth allowance. But even a dollar youth allowance allows you access to the Start-Up and Commonwealth scholarships. So even at that level that family would receive about $10,000 assistance by way of youth allowance based on income. The cut-off level is actually $139,000.
I raise those issues because a lot of parents out there think the only way to get youth allowance is through the independence test—the gap year plus the 30 hours a week on average and all the things that we are talking about in this piece of legislation. So we are very supportive of youth allowance, there is no doubt about that. There is a deal that has been done. It is not a review; it is an arrangement. It will happen; there is no doubt about that.
The other point that we have to be serious about is the constitutional issue. I am as emotive about youth allowance as anybody else in this room, but we have to have a parliament that can actually function. I congratulate the senator for bringing this bill to the parliament because it has highlighted an issue that will now be addressed. The crossbenchers have been very active over the last few months on that particular issue. That is a good thing and it will be addressed as of January next year.
I have sought independent legal advice. I think anybody who has taken the time to get some independent constitutional advice on this would see and there is no doubt in my mind, contrary to what the Senate have said—and they can say what they feel; I do not have a problem with that—that under sections 53 and 56 of the Constitution this bill is not a legal entity in terms of the capacity to deal with it in the House of Representatives. In this hung parliament, I signed a document that guaranteed supply to the government. Supply is the budget bills. If we go down this route, we are going to start to develop an arrangement which allows any of us to bring in a money bill, which I have a no doubt that this is in that it appropriates money not from the education infrastructure fund but from the social security administrative standing fund. It is an appropriation bill in any language.
If it is an appropriation bill, I would accept the advice of the clerks. I think all of us have the highest regard for the clerks in this parliament. We might question the Speaker from time to time. I do not terribly often, irrespective of which side of the parliament the Speaker is from. I think I have once. We must respect the judgment and the knowledge of the clerks in terms of where we sit in the House of Representatives. I have also sought other independent constitutional legal advice and it indicates to me at least that there are some issues here. This means of introducing legislation through the Senate and appropriating money from existing funds is inappropriate. What do we do about that? What have the crossbenchers done about it? We have attempted to recognise that there are these two issues, which are different issues.
One is a vehicle to achieve an outcome which Senator Nash should be respected and praised for. It is an outcome that should have been achieved a year or more ago, whenever the legislation came to the parliament. Now we find that, if in fact this bill did get up, it would be unconstitutional and the government would have no recourse other than to advise the Governor-General not to endorse it. So nothing would happen to the substantive issue that we are trying to achieve here in getting a better outcome for students in inner-regional areas. The way to overcome that particular problem is to come up with a solution that addresses the substantive issue. That is being done in conjunction with negotiations with the government and will come into play, as the member for Lyne said, from 1 July and will then be implemented on 1 January next year. That is a good outcome for what I think most of us are trying to achieve.
The other outcome is to go through the antics of this constitutional challenge arrangement about whether it is an appropriation bill from a standing fund ,and whether the Senate can introduce a private members’ bill that appropriates money, including the whole argument about whether it is money because the word ‘appropriation’ has not been mentioned in the bill. I think we have to go past that and recognise that it is an issue, maybe it is something that needs to be sorted out in a legalistic sense on another occasion, and distance the two issues from each other. We get the best of both worlds in a sense. We have stability in the way our system works. In theory—and I know the member for Sturt would not go anywhere near this particular example that I am about to talk about—you could run a political campaign based on waste and mismanagement and deficit budgeting, create the deficit and the waste and then accuse the government of a particular agenda.
Particularly in a hung parliament I think we all have some degree of financial responsibility. If we start this merry-go-round going—and I know it is a great issue—we can create chaos in terms of the economic circumstances in which we live and that can have ramifications far beyond university students into interest rates and a whole range of economic parameters that exist. I will be supporting the government on this particular legislation. I am proud to have been involved with my crossbench colleagues who have been dealing with this issue for some time now. I am proud of the arrangements that we have been able to negotiate within the parameters of appropriation and the parliamentary process to achieve a much better outcome for country students in the inner regional areas.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I must say that for an issue which has been described in some quarters as building to a constitutional crisis there appears to be an enormous amount of consensus in this chamber both this morning and this afternoon. I want to congratulate each of the crossbenchers for their contribution to the debate. It is very clear to me that they are seeking the very same outcome as those of us on the government side of the House—that is, a fair and equitable scheme which supports rural and regional students who choose to travel to attend a university.
I do acknowledge also—and the member for Sturt might be surprised at this—that there is a good deal of goodwill on the opposition benches as well. I do believe that most on that side want the same thing as the government and those on the crossbenches want and that is a fair and equitable scheme for those young people living in rural and regional Australia. The problem is that those on the opposition benches, like all of us who have sat on the opposition benches, have seen an opportunity to score a political point and so to build some political capital in rural and regional Australia. If you read their contributions today, you will be in no doubt that that is the case.
Contributors before me have made the point that, when the government made its original adjustments to the independent youth allowance for students, it was done in agreement with those who still sit on the opposition benches, so I think I am entitled to claim that there is a fair degree of politics creeping into this debate. I, as a person who represents a rural electorate, find it disappointing that they would seek to exploit the concerns and anxieties of some of those rural students just so that they can build their political capital in this place today.
I have two children who are beyond their teens—they are aged 20 and 21—and one teenage child. I have a longstanding habit of describing them all as teenage children, and the fact that they have gone beyond that point I suspect somewhat reflects my age and the time I have been in this place. But I have three children attending university, and long before this became a public debate they complained to me, rightly or wrongly, about how so many of their friends were receiving the youth allowance and living at home with parents who were earning very good incomes while they, the teenage kids of a politician, were unable to secure any assistance at all. I am not suggesting that those listening to this debate should have a great deal of sympathy for my children—I certainly would not suggest that. My wife and I are in a happy position to support them in their studies, but they also do a lot to support themselves in their studies. Each of my three children work an enormous number of hours as they work their way through their education.
Let us go back to taws and ask ourselves what this whole policy change was all about. As the member for New England pointed out, we previously had a qualification regime for establishing independence which was open to abuse—there is no doubt about that. There is surely no-one on the opposition side who would claim that the regime for determining independence was not open to abuse—of course it was. Running parallel to that, as the member for New England also pointed out, was a very tough means test which started the taper rate, I think, in the high 30,000s of income and eventually tapered off in the low 40,000s of income. In other words, rural students were knocked out of the prospect of securing income support from the government while they studied at university if their parents had a family income of around $40,000.
In this day and age, that is a very tough means test indeed—no-one could argue otherwise—so the government’s approach was to attempt to put equity and fairness into the regime. This was not a savings measure. I think that is a very important point. Members opposite are out there in their electorates trying to present this as a savings measure on the part of the government. It was never a savings initiative; it was about taking a bucketful of money of the same value and making sure it was fairly spread throughout the students who are seeking assistance in this country. As a matter of principle, no-one could argue with tightening the test for establishing independence but raising the means test so that students with families earning income above that $40,000 or $43,000 or whatever it was at the time were still able to secure income support. Then, of course, we had the debate in this place, and the government reviewed the situation, accommodated some of the concerns and—as I said earlier—made some changes in agreement with those who sit opposite. It is very sad today to see them taking the opportunity to score political points and to push the government beyond the agreement that was made.
On the question of the constitutionality of the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010, the Leader of the House has very well articulated the position, citing advice from Mr Speaker, the Attorney-General, the clerks and others. So we should not be wasting our time arguing about whether this bill contravenes section 53 of the Constitution; we should be sticking as best we can to the proposal on its merits. I am really fearful of the amendment moved by my good friend the member for Melbourne, because it creates something which I have never seen in this place: any time a backbench senator wants to introduce a bill and they meet with success, they can send it off to the House of Representatives and the precedent will be set for this House to potentially give assent to the bill and therefore have to worry about the fiscal consequences somewhere down the track.
I ask honourable members to think through that proposition. The government sets a budget annually on its best assessment—what it expects the revenue to be over the next 12 months and what it expects its outlays to be. It is not an exact science because those revenues and outlays will be determined by the strength of the economy and other factors. If we have people coming into this place on a weekly basis passing bills and then expecting the government to find the funding, it will make the whole budgetary process a farce. We will have to have a minibudget every fortnight to adjust the budgetary settings to accommodate the bill already passed by the parliament. No doubt the founding fathers had in mind when framing the Constitution the need for the executive to have certainty over its budget proposals so that it could accommodate its outlays over the course of the next 12 months with some confidence. I appeal to all in the House to continue to discuss and debate the issue. Today the Prime Minister talked about another review on the key issue—that is, how we accommodate and take care of our rural and regional students—but let us not undo more than a hundred years of convention in this place just to score a cheap political point.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to close this debate, which has been extensively participated in by members of the government, members of the opposition and the crossbenchers. There has been some debate on the substance of the bill that was moved in the Senate, but we have to remember that the motion that I moved is essentially about the proper procedures of this House. The member for Sturt said, ‘On this occasion, our view is that the government is hiding behind legal technicalities.’ The member for Wide Bay said, ‘The government is hiding behind legal technicalities.’ That was a theme.
—Why don’t you adopt our bill?
—The Manager of Opposition Business gives it away yet again. He says, ‘Why don’t you adopt our bill?’ Inherent in that is his understanding that the bill is unconstitutional. You simply cannot say that the Australian Constitution does not matter, House of Representatives Practice does not matter, the standing orders do not matter, it does not matter what the view of the Speaker is, it does not matter what the view of the clerks of the House is, and it does not matter what the views of the Attorney-General and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel are. You simply cannot wish that away. That is not a responsible way for this House to act. The only thing missing from the speeches of some of those opposite was: ‘What makes this viable is the vibe,’ as Dennis Denuto said in The Castle. No legal argument has been put forward. Indeed, the Manager of Opposition Business made it very clear, consistent with his views over a long period of time, that it is not within the powers of this House to pass a private member’s bill or a bill that has come from the Senate which seeks to appropriate funds. He made that very clear. We did have a statement from the member for Murray, who, of all people, said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was cited to override the Constitution, House of Representatives Practice, standing orders and appropriate processes.
I want to also say that the government opposes the amendment moved by the member for Melbourne. We do so because that amendment, which suggests that the bill proceed when parliament has agreed to a method to finance the measures contained in the bill, does not override the constitutional concerns under section 53 and section 56 of the Constitution. I appreciate the fact that the member for Melbourne came into this House as a member of a political party that historically has been based in the Senate—therefore, a political party that unashamedly wants to see a shift in power from the House of Representatives to the Senate. That is not my view; that is not the view of this House. This House, under the Westminster system, has the responsibility to be the place where government is formed. That is the role that we play. The executive is derived from a majority on the floor of the House of Representatives. That is why the founding fathers constructed the Constitution in the way that they did. For opportunistic reasons, you cannot simply say: ‘We will ignore that.’
I respect the views of the member for Melbourne. I understand why the member for Melbourne has taken the position that he has. But I say to the other crossbenchers and, indeed, to the opposition—who have declared their opposition to this amendment moved by the member for Melbourne—that that opposition is indeed justified. Certainly, a number of members opposite who spoke—
—I haven’t declared—
—Are you changing your position now, member for Sturt? The member for Sturt is showing what this is all about. This is not about substance or about youth allowance; this is actually about trying to create chaos in this House, trying to make the position unworkable and trying to cause these issues. The member for Melbourne argued that the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 was the same and was passed by the House, but, if you look at the advice of the Clerk, he makes it clear that this is not a helpful example. In his advice he said: ‘The PBS bill is not a helpful precedent for the regional students bill.’ That is because this bill was sponsored by the government, the expenditure was for agency operating costs, and government lawyers and drafters did not consider the bill an appropriation bill. This is because agency appropriations are separate and specific appropriations agreed by the government. As such, this bill did not need a message from the Governor-General and was not considered to increase an appropriation.
So have been no exceptions since Federation to the way that the government is dealing with this bill. But I say to the House that we should not go down the road of questioning rulings made by the Clerk of the House or the Speaker of the House, or the proper functioning of the House in accordance with the Constitution, House of Representatives Practice and standing orders. In all organisational forms, whether it be the parliament or the local football club or indeed the rules of sporting codes, you have to abide by the rules. Some of that is based upon stipulation, in terms of a strict application of those rules. Some of it is based upon convention—convention that people will stick to the rules that have been established. The standing orders are important and the House of Representatives Practice is important, but nothing is more important than the Australian Constitution. We are a parliamentary democracy. The foundation of the parliament’s functioning is derived from the Australian Constitution. I commend my motion to the House. I ask that the House not support the amendment moved by the member for Melbourne. I ask that we engage in this House in a way which pays due respect to the Constitution and to the rules and practice of this House.
 (Mrs D’Ath)—The original question was that the motion be agreed to. To this the honourable member for Melbourne has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question—in other words, at this point those who support Mr Bandt’s motion should vote no.

"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the following reports of the committee, together with the minutes of proceedings of the committee: Advisory report on the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011, and Interim report: Review of Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010.

Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.
—by leave—The dimensions of the Queensland flood disaster have been staggering. Between 30 November 2010 and 24 January 2011, 35 people have died as a result of flood related incidents. This is the foremost tragedy of these events, and the committee unanimously extends its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families and friends of the victims.
From the end of November 2010 through to mid-January 2011, flooding occurred over large areas of South-East and Central Queensland, with areas such as Condamine and Chinchilla being flooded several times. In addition, in North Queensland the Herbert River flooded, with the town of Ingham being isolated. Almost every river in Queensland south of the Tropic of Capricorn and east of Charleville and Longreach, except for the south-east coastal fringe south of Maryborough, reached major flood levels at some stage between 26 November 2010 and 7 January 2011. From 10 January to 12 January 2011, floods affected South-East Queensland, causing major flooding of the Lockyer, Bremer and Brisbane rivers. These were the most destructive floods of the December-January period.
The loss of property has been devastating. As of 21 January 2011, an estimated 5,400 homes across Queensland saw flooding over the floorboards. The number of affected homes is 21,000, while a further 15,000 had flooding in their yards. Three thousand six hundred homes were evacuated and 5,900 people were evacuated. In response, the government established over 70 evacuation centres. The property damage has had a terrible effect on individuals and families. The Australian Council of Social Services stated:
Some of this will have an effect on people that lasts many years. Even though the flood itself was relatively short in duration, if your house and all your household possessions were destroyed—family records were often completely lost—that may have all sorts of impacts, material, emotional and psychological. In many cases it will take many years for people to rebuild their lives to the point they were before the flooding.
Of Queensland’s 73 local government areas, 51 have had a disaster declaration since the events started, and 14 of those local government areas have been severely affected by the flooding. Ninety thousand kilometres of local government roads have had some form of damage.
Cyclone Yasi ripped through the Queensland coast near Innisfail and Cardwell on the morning of 3 February 2011. Rated category 5, the cyclone featured extreme conditions such as wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour, a lowest air pressure of 929 millibars at Tully and a five-metre storm surge at Cardwell, just south of Mission Beach. The environment also suffered. Preliminary figures show that Cyclone Yasi destroyed 150 homes and left a further 650 uninhabitable. A further 2,275 homes were moderately damaged and tens of thousands of homes were without power for a long period of time.
At the same time, we saw floods in Victoria. At the end of January, the Victorian Department of Primary Industries calculated that the damage to agriculture could be as much as $2 billion. This includes over 41,000 hectares of field crops, over 51,000 hectares of pasture, 83,000 tonnes of hay and silage, and almost 2,000 kilometres of fencing.
In evidence before the committee, the Queensland Treasury outlined progress so far in that state. On 15 February, the Premier tabled the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill in the Queensland parliament. The new independent authority will manage and coordinate the government’s program of infrastructure reconstruction and recovery within disaster affected communities. It will be overseen by a Queensland reconstruction board which will be chaired by Major General Slater. The primary mechanism for responding to natural disasters is the Commonwealth-state natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. The Australian and Queensland governments are developing a national partnership agreement which is intended to further strengthen the governance and accountability provisions of the NDRRA. This will include detailed performance monitoring and reporting arrangements and new governance arrangements, including the establishment of the Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate.
There is a minority report in which members of the opposition say that it is unclear how or where the money will be spent. Quite clearly that flies in the face of the way in which this money is to be monitored and used and the purposes for which the money is being raised, and that is to make sure that we can rebuild Queensland and the areas that have been affected by the disaster.
We also heard evidence from the Insurance Council of Australia. They have allocated reserves of over $2 billion to meet costs arising from the Queensland floods, which comprise some 43,000 claims. For Cyclone Yasi, half a billion dollars has been allocated, comprising 30,000 claims. There were two issues that the Insurance Council identified. The first is developing a standard definition for ‘flood’, which needs to happen, and the second is developing publicly available flood data that insurance companies can use to accurately determine the flood risk for individual properties. There was some discussion and evidence from the Insurance Council about ways in which insurance could be better used more globally. The view of the majority on the committee was that natural disasters are a reminder that there are a range of significant policy issues in the insurance field that would benefit from a government sponsored review. The committee encourages the government to look at such a process.
The Commonwealth response to the floods is worth putting on record of course. On 27 January 2011 the Prime Minister announced a package to help rebuild flood affected areas. The government estimates that its contribution to the reconstruction of essential infrastructure would be $5.6 billion. This is made up of two-thirds coming from savings in government programs and one-third coming from the flood levy, which was the bill that the committee in particular was asked to look at.
What is interesting is the response of the markets once that announcement was made. The markets are very sensitive to public pronouncements in relation to the economy, and this was one of those. The markets made it quite clear—for example, Citi stated:
The package helps to moderate some pressures on inflation from the flood.
At the margin the package assists the RBA in managing the inflation impact from the rebuild.
The Commonwealth Bank said:
There are some attractive features to these proposals. Adding an (essential) rebuilding overlay to an economy already at full employment carries with it some inflation risks. Making room by lifting taxes and cutting spending looks appropriate even though the fiscal backdrop remains very good.
Christopher Joyce, the managing director of Rismark, said:
More specifically, the government is trying to reduce the inflationary consequences of the floods for fear of the influence they have on monetary policy. This makes sense.
Craig James from CommSec said:
… this is the right levy for the times—modest in size, temporary, progressive and applying to those on higher incomes …
The proposed operation of the bill is that it raises a one-off levy that applies to individuals’ taxable income in 2011-12. It is projected to raise $1.56 billion in 2011-12 and $235 million in 2012-13. Funds raised will be paid into consolidated revenue, where the arrangements that I have already mentioned come into place in terms of monitoring their spending. The levy does not apply if a taxpayer earns less than $50,000 annually. If the taxpayer earns between $50,000 and $100,000 in 2011-12, then the income above $50,000 is taxed at a rate of 0.5 per cent. If the taxpayer earns more than $100,000 annually, then they pay $250—the tax on their income up to $100,000—and then their income above $100,000 is taxed at one per cent.
With this structure, the levy is clearly progressive. In evidence, both the Australian Council of Social Security and the Australian Council of Trade Unions supported this feature. Certain classes of taxpayers can be excluded from the levy. This comprises those people who are affected by the natural disaster between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2012. In order for the exemption to apply, the Treasurer must make a legislative instrument to this effect.
It is worth noting that the total number of taxpayers earning in excess of $50,000 is 4.84 million. From this figure, we subtract the 185,000 people who are estimated to be declared exempt from the levy, which leaves about 4.66 million people who are expected to pay the levy. This is out of a total of 10 million taxpayers, so it is just under half of taxpayers.
By way of comparison, the committee asked the Treasury what proportion of taxpayers paid the one-off increase to the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent to help pay for the gun buyback scheme in 1996-97. The answer was that 6.9 million individuals paid the Medicare levy, so just over two million people paid the levy out of 8.6 million taxpayers. That made up 80 per cent of taxpayers at that time, whereas this levy only affects fewer than 50 per cent of taxpayers.
This is a levy that is required to make sure that we are able to meet the challenges of the rebuild in Queensland. Two economists appeared before the committee. Each of them had differing views in relation to how the funds could be raised, but neither of them said that raising the levy was a wrong option for the government to look at. Quite frankly, the markets have said that this is a response that we should and must take.
It is interesting also to note the response of the public. There has been poll after poll in relation to this, and they have shown overwhelming support for the levy. It is worth mentioning polls because the member for Moncrieff, the deputy chair of the committee, ran a poll on his website as to whether the levy should be paid. When we came into the House, I think it was running at around 70 per cent in support of the levy. Even those opposite know that this is a levy that is supported by the general public.
At a time of widespread tragedy and devastation, the broad spectrum of Australian society has responded to the floods and other natural disasters in a multitude of ways such as through donations of money or goods, giving others temporary accommodation, and clean-ups. Governments are repairing and rebuilding infrastructure. The question presented by the bill is how the government may pay for the rebuild. The committee is of the view that we can fund the recovery of essential infrastructure so as to reflect our wider response to the disaster. In evidence, the Australian Council of Trade Unions referred to our need to take collective responsibility for each other. They said:
… as a nation, we believe we need to take collective responsibility for each other’s welfare, particularly in times of disaster …
This is a levy that is required. It is something that is needed.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—by leave—I rise on behalf of coalition members to speak to the dissenting report that was put forward by the coalition members to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics with respect to the reference of the Income Tax Rates Amendments (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011.
All members of the committee are joined and united in the view that this summer was a time of trial and tribulation not only for Queenslanders but, indeed, across much of Australia. The summer of 2010-11 proved to be a very bad one indeed, and we have already heard the chairman outline a number of consequences where we saw extraordinary loss, damage and suffering—unfortunately not unprecedented, though, in this country. Australia has for many, many decades certainly been a country of extremes when it comes to weather. For those that have had their homes inundated in flooding—the 21,000 or so affected—to consider that in Queensland alone, for example, 51 of the 73 local government areas were declared areas of emergency just highlights that this was an incredibly bad summer. To compound the flooding that took place across parts of Queensland and Victoria, we also had, for example, Cyclone Yasi, which struck North Queensland and in particular the townships of Tully and Cardwell and surrounding communities.
That really is at the epicentre of what gave rise to the inquiry that was undertaken by the economics committee. On 27 January of this year, we saw the government announce its new flood tax. Estimating that it would be liable for repair and reconstruction to the amount of about $5.6 billion, the government announced this new flood tax in the context of saying it was necessary to raise money through taxation coupled with, at that stage, about two-thirds of the funding being sourced from spending cuts the government was making. Much of this has now been overturned, but I will go to that in a moment.
The coalition members of the committee were the ones who instigated this report. The coalition had concerns about the government’s continued predisposition to impose new taxes as part of its fiscal solution. The concern of the opposition—of coalition members—was that once again we saw Labor revert to form, seeing higher taxing and more spending as the way forward. So the coalition took the view that what we needed to do was to work in a cooperative way with the government, and we made a number of options available to the government. The first was that the Leader of the Opposition signified that he was willing to work with the Prime Minister in a constructive and bipartisan way to identify cost savings that could be achieved in the budget so that Australians did not have to face the prospect of yet another new tax under this government. That offer was rejected by the government.
So, as part of our attempts to ensure that we hold the government to account, we proposed—and referred to the economics committee—that these bills be subject to a short, sharp inquiry. We worked in a constructive way with the government for only a one-week time period for this inquiry, and indeed the inquiry itself took place over the course of one day. We felt as coalition members of the committee that it was appropriate that there be as comprehensive an investigation as possible—given the parameters and the time frames involved—for us to look at this new levy raising nearly $2 billion. It was disappointing, therefore, as part of the process and the investigation into this new flood tax, that after only 45 minutes, with a very clear need for there to be additional questioning of Commonwealth Treasury officials, the Labor Party gagged coalition members from seeking an extension of time with respect to questioning of Commonwealth Treasury officials. It seems entirely unnecessary when there were adequate breaks in the course of the day for the committee to continue questioning, and it raises the question of why the government refused to allow the additional questioning on a new $2 billion tax when it could easily have been accommodated in the work program that the committee had. But, that notwithstanding, that was an issue of process.
With respect to the merits or demerits of the new flood tax, the evidence is clear, and it is summarised in the dissenting report that coalition members put forward. The evidence is clear that the reason why this new flood tax is not the appropriate response to the natural disasters that we have had is that it creates a new precedent. First of all, we know that this new flood tax is unnecessary. It is entirely arbitrary and there is no connection that has been made by witnesses or indeed by the government about why, with $5.6 billion in estimated and forecast expenditure required by government for the repair and reconstruction effort, a flood levy of $1.8 billion needs to be raised. It is entirely arbitrary.
So we remain inquisitive as to why this amount was the amount that the government has decided to raise. Bear in mind that, when it was first announced on 27 January, the government said that two-thirds of the required expenditure would be found through savings, yet despite this much has actually been overturned. For example, the government announced the reversal of some $364 million under the Solar Flagships program and the National Rental Affordability Scheme to secure the support of the Greens. In addition to that, $50 million of funding cuts under the Australian Learning and Teaching Council have also been reversed, which was made necessary by the government attempting to buy the support of the member for Denison as well. These examples just highlight the fudgy figures this government works on when it comes to something as important as imposing a new tax on the people of Australia.
In addition to that, we raised our concerns about the fact that, had there not been billions of dollars of wasted expenditure previously, again this flood tax would not be necessary. This is a government that wasted over $2.4 billion under Building the Education Revolution, that wasted another $1 billion or thereabouts under the failed insulation program and that then says it needs to tax the Australian people $1.8 billion as part of a flood rescue tax, as it likes to package it. The reality—clear from the evidence—is that it would have been entirely unnecessary had money not been wasted to the tune of billions of dollars.
But, from an economic perspective as well, there were clear arguments made that there was no economic rationale in favour of this new tax. In particular, I would highlight two economic experts that gave evidence to the committee: Mr Saul Eslake and Professor Warwick McKibbin, both of whom gave very detailed information about the merits or demerits of the flood tax. Both highlighted that there were effectively three pathways available to government when it came to the repair and reconstruction costs that needed to be met: to impose a new tax or increase an existing tax or taxes; to reduce spending on another program or programs; or to borrow the necessary funds and repay the debt over time—or a combination of all three of those. Mr Eslake in evidence said:
I would be concerned if every time a significant or expensive natural disaster or indeed any other exigency fell to the Australian government the response was to slug the 40 per cent of the population who are considered rich enough to bear an additional tax burden. I think that would be problematic, although there is an element of political judgment in that as well as economic. But, obviously, if you continue to increase marginal rates of tax on a segment of the population by large amounts or with high regularity over time then there could well be some adverse consequences for incentives to work, save, invest and the like, which have been well documented in the economics literature.
Professor McKibbin said:
I wish to comment on the principle of how to finance the cost of a natural disaster or any temporary negative economic shock. The main reason for focusing on this issue despite the relatively small amount of money involved in the current case is to make sure that important principles are in place for future disasters and future economic decisions which may be of significantly larger magnitude.
Most economists who study public finance would support the view that taxation is not the optimal way to finance the reconstruction of infrastructure after a natural disaster. The argument has a long tradition in economics.
The two economic experts that gave evidence to the committee made it very clear that, out of all the pathways available to government, this government’s choice was the least preferable. That is part of the reason that the coalition members formed the view that these bills should not be supported. In addition to that, unintended consequences were highlighted. It is clear, based upon the evidence that the committee heard, that among a multitude of foreseeable unintended consequences there also exists the very real likelihood that, as a result of the government imposing this new flood tax, next time—and there will be a next time, unfortunately—a natural disaster occurs Australians will be less willing to dig into their pockets to make a donation to support. The reason they will be less willing is the very realistic expectation that the government will impose a new tax or increase taxation as part of the relief and reconstruction effort. For this reason as well, the coalition members were unimpressed with the government’s path to imposing a new tax. Further to that, there are significant transaction costs associated with the new tax, which Professor McKibbin referred to. He said that he expected up to 10 per cent of the revenue from the tax could be lost through churn in collection.
In addition to that, an issue that concerned coalition members and senators is the moral hazard of the Commonwealth vis-a-vis the states. We heard from numerous witnesses, including Mr Bradley, the Queensland Under Treasurer, and the Insurance Council of Australia, that there is a very real moral hazard whereby, as a consequence of the natural disaster funding arrangements that exist in this country, the states are effectively underwritten by the Commonwealth government. Various states have taken different decisions in seeking reinsurance of public infrastructure. The state of Queensland took the decision not to seek reinsurance, arguing that it was uneconomic to do so. I sought advice from Mr Bradley, as the Queensland Under Treasurer, as to what the premium was expected to be and an answer was not forthcoming, unfortunately. That notwithstanding, what is clear and what is on the record is that Queensland took the decision not to undertake commercially available reinsurance because it knew that the Commonwealth would, in time of crisis, step in. The imposition of this new flood tax exacerbates that problem both politically and economically. Politically, we as coalition members feel the argument can already be made that for any state government the decision to go to the Commonwealth to seek reconstruction repair costs is enlivened by the fact that the politics and precedent that this new flood tax creates make it politically more acceptable for a state government to do precisely that.
The final argument that the committee had concerns about was those who will be paying for this new flood tax. The ACTU made the argument that those who can afford it should pay the tax. This is despite the fact that the flood tax kicks in at over $50,000 a year unless the recipient has received the Australian government disaster relief payment. As it currently stands, the average wage in Australia is $65,000 a year, so we already know those earning below the average wage will have to pay the tax. There is also, unfortunately, a high likelihood of inequities arising as a consequence of the design of this new tax. Professor McKibbin said:
I am sure that there are Queenslanders out there who had no insurance, who incurred significant damage and did not receive any assistance from the government. They will now be hit with the levy.
This reason more than any other highlights the gross inequity of this new tax, where those least able to afford it, those earning below an average wage and those who have suffered economic harm as a consequence of these natural disasters will now have that harm magnified as the government imposes this new flood tax on them. For all of these reasons, coalition members recommended to the committee that the bills be rejected and not supported through passage of this House.

(Mrs D’Ath)—Does the member for Dobell wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Committee</title>,Committees,24,1
"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the following reports of the committee, together with the minutes of proceedings of the committee: Advisory report on the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011, and Interim report: Review of Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010.

Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.
—by leave—The dimensions of the Queensland flood disaster have been staggering. Between 30 November 2010 and 24 January 2011, 35 people have died as a result of flood related incidents. This is the foremost tragedy of these events, and the committee unanimously extends its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families and friends of the victims.
From the end of November 2010 through to mid-January 2011, flooding occurred over large areas of South-East and Central Queensland, with areas such as Condamine and Chinchilla being flooded several times. In addition, in North Queensland the Herbert River flooded, with the town of Ingham being isolated. Almost every river in Queensland south of the Tropic of Capricorn and east of Charleville and Longreach, except for the south-east coastal fringe south of Maryborough, reached major flood levels at some stage between 26 November 2010 and 7 January 2011. From 10 January to 12 January 2011, floods affected South-East Queensland, causing major flooding of the Lockyer, Bremer and Brisbane rivers. These were the most destructive floods of the December-January period.
The loss of property has been devastating. As of 21 January 2011, an estimated 5,400 homes across Queensland saw flooding over the floorboards. The number of affected homes is 21,000, while a further 15,000 had flooding in their yards. Three thousand six hundred homes were evacuated and 5,900 people were evacuated. In response, the government established over 70 evacuation centres. The property damage has had a terrible effect on individuals and families. The Australian Council of Social Services stated:
Some of this will have an effect on people that lasts many years. Even though the flood itself was relatively short in duration, if your house and all your household possessions were destroyed—family records were often completely lost—that may have all sorts of impacts, material, emotional and psychological. In many cases it will take many years for people to rebuild their lives to the point they were before the flooding.
Of Queensland’s 73 local government areas, 51 have had a disaster declaration since the events started, and 14 of those local government areas have been severely affected by the flooding. Ninety thousand kilometres of local government roads have had some form of damage.
Cyclone Yasi ripped through the Queensland coast near Innisfail and Cardwell on the morning of 3 February 2011. Rated category 5, the cyclone featured extreme conditions such as wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour, a lowest air pressure of 929 millibars at Tully and a five-metre storm surge at Cardwell, just south of Mission Beach. The environment also suffered. Preliminary figures show that Cyclone Yasi destroyed 150 homes and left a further 650 uninhabitable. A further 2,275 homes were moderately damaged and tens of thousands of homes were without power for a long period of time.
At the same time, we saw floods in Victoria. At the end of January, the Victorian Department of Primary Industries calculated that the damage to agriculture could be as much as $2 billion. This includes over 41,000 hectares of field crops, over 51,000 hectares of pasture, 83,000 tonnes of hay and silage, and almost 2,000 kilometres of fencing.
In evidence before the committee, the Queensland Treasury outlined progress so far in that state. On 15 February, the Premier tabled the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill in the Queensland parliament. The new independent authority will manage and coordinate the government’s program of infrastructure reconstruction and recovery within disaster affected communities. It will be overseen by a Queensland reconstruction board which will be chaired by Major General Slater. The primary mechanism for responding to natural disasters is the Commonwealth-state natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. The Australian and Queensland governments are developing a national partnership agreement which is intended to further strengthen the governance and accountability provisions of the NDRRA. This will include detailed performance monitoring and reporting arrangements and new governance arrangements, including the establishment of the Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate.
There is a minority report in which members of the opposition say that it is unclear how or where the money will be spent. Quite clearly that flies in the face of the way in which this money is to be monitored and used and the purposes for which the money is being raised, and that is to make sure that we can rebuild Queensland and the areas that have been affected by the disaster.
We also heard evidence from the Insurance Council of Australia. They have allocated reserves of over $2 billion to meet costs arising from the Queensland floods, which comprise some 43,000 claims. For Cyclone Yasi, half a billion dollars has been allocated, comprising 30,000 claims. There were two issues that the Insurance Council identified. The first is developing a standard definition for ‘flood’, which needs to happen, and the second is developing publicly available flood data that insurance companies can use to accurately determine the flood risk for individual properties. There was some discussion and evidence from the Insurance Council about ways in which insurance could be better used more globally. The view of the majority on the committee was that natural disasters are a reminder that there are a range of significant policy issues in the insurance field that would benefit from a government sponsored review. The committee encourages the government to look at such a process.
The Commonwealth response to the floods is worth putting on record of course. On 27 January 2011 the Prime Minister announced a package to help rebuild flood affected areas. The government estimates that its contribution to the reconstruction of essential infrastructure would be $5.6 billion. This is made up of two-thirds coming from savings in government programs and one-third coming from the flood levy, which was the bill that the committee in particular was asked to look at.
What is interesting is the response of the markets once that announcement was made. The markets are very sensitive to public pronouncements in relation to the economy, and this was one of those. The markets made it quite clear—for example, Citi stated:
The package helps to moderate some pressures on inflation from the flood.
At the margin the package assists the RBA in managing the inflation impact from the rebuild.
The Commonwealth Bank said:
There are some attractive features to these proposals. Adding an (essential) rebuilding overlay to an economy already at full employment carries with it some inflation risks. Making room by lifting taxes and cutting spending looks appropriate even though the fiscal backdrop remains very good.
Christopher Joyce, the managing director of Rismark, said:
More specifically, the government is trying to reduce the inflationary consequences of the floods for fear of the influence they have on monetary policy. This makes sense.
Craig James from CommSec said:
… this is the right levy for the times—modest in size, temporary, progressive and applying to those on higher incomes …
The proposed operation of the bill is that it raises a one-off levy that applies to individuals’ taxable income in 2011-12. It is projected to raise $1.56 billion in 2011-12 and $235 million in 2012-13. Funds raised will be paid into consolidated revenue, where the arrangements that I have already mentioned come into place in terms of monitoring their spending. The levy does not apply if a taxpayer earns less than $50,000 annually. If the taxpayer earns between $50,000 and $100,000 in 2011-12, then the income above $50,000 is taxed at a rate of 0.5 per cent. If the taxpayer earns more than $100,000 annually, then they pay $250—the tax on their income up to $100,000—and then their income above $100,000 is taxed at one per cent.
With this structure, the levy is clearly progressive. In evidence, both the Australian Council of Social Security and the Australian Council of Trade Unions supported this feature. Certain classes of taxpayers can be excluded from the levy. This comprises those people who are affected by the natural disaster between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2012. In order for the exemption to apply, the Treasurer must make a legislative instrument to this effect.
It is worth noting that the total number of taxpayers earning in excess of $50,000 is 4.84 million. From this figure, we subtract the 185,000 people who are estimated to be declared exempt from the levy, which leaves about 4.66 million people who are expected to pay the levy. This is out of a total of 10 million taxpayers, so it is just under half of taxpayers.
By way of comparison, the committee asked the Treasury what proportion of taxpayers paid the one-off increase to the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent to help pay for the gun buyback scheme in 1996-97. The answer was that 6.9 million individuals paid the Medicare levy, so just over two million people paid the levy out of 8.6 million taxpayers. That made up 80 per cent of taxpayers at that time, whereas this levy only affects fewer than 50 per cent of taxpayers.
This is a levy that is required to make sure that we are able to meet the challenges of the rebuild in Queensland. Two economists appeared before the committee. Each of them had differing views in relation to how the funds could be raised, but neither of them said that raising the levy was a wrong option for the government to look at. Quite frankly, the markets have said that this is a response that we should and must take.
It is interesting also to note the response of the public. There has been poll after poll in relation to this, and they have shown overwhelming support for the levy. It is worth mentioning polls because the member for Moncrieff, the deputy chair of the committee, ran a poll on his website as to whether the levy should be paid. When we came into the House, I think it was running at around 70 per cent in support of the levy. Even those opposite know that this is a levy that is supported by the general public.
At a time of widespread tragedy and devastation, the broad spectrum of Australian society has responded to the floods and other natural disasters in a multitude of ways such as through donations of money or goods, giving others temporary accommodation, and clean-ups. Governments are repairing and rebuilding infrastructure. The question presented by the bill is how the government may pay for the rebuild. The committee is of the view that we can fund the recovery of essential infrastructure so as to reflect our wider response to the disaster. In evidence, the Australian Council of Trade Unions referred to our need to take collective responsibility for each other. They said:
… as a nation, we believe we need to take collective responsibility for each other’s welfare, particularly in times of disaster …
This is a levy that is required. It is something that is needed. The recommendation of the majority on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics has recommended that the House of Representatives pass this bill.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports</title>,Committees,24,2
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—by leave—I rise on behalf of coalition members to speak to the dissenting report that was put forward by the coalition members to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics with respect to the reference of the Income Tax Rates Amendments (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011.
All members of the committee are joined and united in the view that this summer was a time of trial and tribulation not only for Queenslanders but, indeed, across much of Australia. The summer of 2010-11 proved to be a very bad one indeed, and we have already heard the chairman outline a number of consequences where we saw extraordinary loss, damage and suffering—unfortunately not unprecedented, though, in this country. Australia has for many, many decades certainly been a country of extremes when it comes to weather. For those that have had their homes inundated in flooding—the 21,000 or so affected—to consider that in Queensland alone, for example, 51 of the 73 local government areas were declared areas of emergency just highlights that this was an incredibly bad summer. To compound the flooding that took place across parts of Queensland and Victoria, we also had, for example, Cyclone Yasi, which struck North Queensland and in particular the townships of Tully and Cardwell and surrounding communities.
That really is at the epicentre of what gave rise to the inquiry that was undertaken by the economics committee. On 27 January of this year, we saw the government announce its new flood tax. Estimating that it would be liable for repair and reconstruction to the amount of about $5.6 billion, the government announced this new flood tax in the context of saying it was necessary to raise money through taxation coupled with, at that stage, about two-thirds of the funding being sourced from spending cuts the government was making. Much of this has now been overturned, but I will go to that in a moment.
The coalition members of the committee were the ones who instigated this report. The coalition had concerns about the government’s continued predisposition to impose new taxes as part of its fiscal solution. The concern of the opposition—of coalition members—was that once again we saw Labor revert to form, seeing higher taxing and more spending as the way forward. So the coalition took the view that what we needed to do was to work in a cooperative way with the government, and we made a number of options available to the government. The first was that the Leader of the Opposition signified that he was willing to work with the Prime Minister in a constructive and bipartisan way to identify cost savings that could be achieved in the budget so that Australians did not have to face the prospect of yet another new tax under this government. That offer was rejected by the government.
So, as part of our attempts to ensure that we hold the government to account, we proposed—and referred to the economics committee—that these bills be subject to a short, sharp inquiry. We worked in a constructive way with the government for only a one-week time period for this inquiry, and indeed the inquiry itself took place over the course of one day. We felt as coalition members of the committee that it was appropriate that there be as comprehensive an investigation as possible—given the parameters and the time frames involved—for us to look at this new levy raising nearly $2 billion. It was disappointing, therefore, as part of the process and the investigation into this new flood tax, that after only 45 minutes, with a very clear need for there to be additional questioning of Commonwealth Treasury officials, the Labor Party gagged coalition members from seeking an extension of time with respect to questioning of Commonwealth Treasury officials. It seems entirely unnecessary when there were adequate breaks in the course of the day for the committee to continue questioning, and it raises the question of why the government refused to allow the additional questioning on a new $2 billion tax when it could easily have been accommodated in the work program that the committee had. But, that notwithstanding, that was an issue of process.
With respect to the merits or demerits of the new flood tax, the evidence is clear, and it is summarised in the dissenting report that coalition members put forward. The evidence is clear that the reason why this new flood tax is not the appropriate response to the natural disasters that we have had is that it creates a new precedent. First of all, we know that this new flood tax is unnecessary. It is entirely arbitrary and there is no connection that has been made by witnesses or indeed by the government about why, with $5.6 billion in estimated and forecast expenditure required by government for the repair and reconstruction effort, a flood levy of $1.8 billion needs to be raised. It is entirely arbitrary.
So we remain inquisitive as to why this amount was the amount that the government has decided to raise. Bear in mind that, when it was first announced on 27 January, the government said that two-thirds of the required expenditure would be found through savings, yet despite this much has actually been overturned. For example, the government announced the reversal of some $364 million under the Solar Flagships program and the National Rental Affordability Scheme to secure the support of the Greens. In addition to that, $50 million of funding cuts under the Australian Learning and Teaching Council have also been reversed, which was made necessary by the government attempting to buy the support of the member for Denison as well. These examples just highlight the fudgy figures this government works on when it comes to something as important as imposing a new tax on the people of Australia.
In addition to that, we raised our concerns about the fact that, had there not been billions of dollars of wasted expenditure previously, again this flood tax would not be necessary. This is a government that wasted over $2.4 billion under Building the Education Revolution, that wasted another $1 billion or thereabouts under the failed insulation program and that then says it needs to tax the Australian people $1.8 billion as part of a flood rescue tax, as it likes to package it. The reality—clear from the evidence—is that it would have been entirely unnecessary had money not been wasted to the tune of billions of dollars.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—Today is Groundhog Day with the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010. For me in particular a lot of time has been wasted to get us to where we are today. This bill moves to establish a national radioactive waste management facility for low-level and short-lived intermediate-level waste. While the bill seeks to repeal the coalition’s original act of 2005, it still maintains the basic crux of that legislation. I indicate to the House that the coalition will support this bill. This is one of the few good pieces of legislation we have seen come into this House in recent times and, unlike the Labor Party when they were in opposition and we moved a bill on this matter, we will ensure a responsible approach is taken.
This bill is well overdue; this facility is well overdue. We need to ensure that a repository is built as soon as possible, bearing in mind two basic facts. The first is that there is radioactive waste currently being treated overseas that has come from our Lucas Heights reactor, and which has to be accepted back into Australia in 2015. It is simply ridiculous to suggest that we will not take that waste, bearing in mind the commitments and contractual obligations that we have made.
But probably more important is the fact that around Australia, in highly unsuitable—yet so far safe—places, low-level nuclear waste is currently being stored. Where might that be? In shipping containers in car parks of hospitals, in basements of buildings in central CBDs and in hospitals, where state governments, who have abdicated their responsibility in this area, have no option but to maintain the waste in its current position.
For the 11½ years of the Howard government, the coalition sought to act in the national interest and construct this repository in a suitable location based on the highest level of scientific assessment and suitability. At every single opportunity the federal Labor Party and the state Labor governments opposed and hampered this process—every step of the way. They worked against establishing a waste repository. It gives me no pleasure to see the hypocrisy that is on show here today by those who sit opposite, who now realise that they could have saved 10 years of time by supporting the government of the day when we first put this forward.
In fact, the Labor Party attempted to hamper the process despite the fact that they themselves had begun this process. They themselves, under the then Prime Minister Paul Keating—by comparison a leader to what we have now—actually realised that something had to be done and trucked the first federal radioactive waste to Woomera. The Minister for Resources and Energy argues that this bill implements an ALP election commitment to repeal the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005. Whilst this bill does repeal that act, it does so merely by replicating the many clauses of the existing act in this current bill. Labor is simply trying to save face. All of this is a waste of time; we need to get on with it.
For all their bluster about the coalition currently being obstructionist, we are not as hypocritical—by any measure—as this current government were when they were in opposition and had to deal with this issue. In fact, we have always supported good policy, both previously when we were in opposition under the Hawke and Keating governments and now on those rare occasions when this government brings forward reasonable, well researched and well thought through legislation.
The coalition is supporting this bill, as it is really coalition policy in the first place, and always has been. But, of course, in supporting this bill we acknowledge that the Labor Party has had a conversion on the road to Damascus. If you look back at what was said in 2005 you realise just how big the hypocrisy is today when they put forward this legislation and ask us to support a bill which we have always supported; to support a principle which we have always supported and to support a principle which we have never politicked on, unlike those who sit opposite.
The coalition appreciates that most Australians benefit either directly or indirectly from the medical, scientific and industrial use of radioactive materials. I am but one of them, and without the benefit of radiation would not be here talking to you today. Some might see that as a blessing, but I am forever grateful.
While safe, the current storage of radioactive waste in this country is not ideal; in fact, to say anything of the kind would be an incredibly optimistic view. When I was the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources I remember the campaigns run by those who sit opposite when we tried to progress the issue in relation to the storage of nuclear waste and the proposals to give consideration to including nuclear energy in our future energy mix. I remember vividly the rubbish that was talked by those opposite, who were only interested in trying to scare people—they were not interested in finding solutions. They tried to twist and turn an argument for their own benefit when they knew, and certainly the health ministers, the resource ministers and premiers of those Labor states knew, that this waste was being stored right in the middle of cities. It is refreshing to see the honesty that those who sit opposite now have. It is refreshing to see they have capitulated and come to their senses.
We are also hearing some refreshing thoughts from the Minister for Resources and Energy, at last emboldened enough to out himself. We always knew he was a supporter of nuclear energy, and I do not in any way deride him for that. I congratulate him for his foresight, for his vision and for his understanding that if Australia wants to have clean baseload energy in the future, nuclear energy is an option we need to consider. Will the Labor Party have the courage to have the same debate on nuclear energy that they are now promoting on the storage of nuclear waste? Will the Labor Party have the courage to admit that if we do not have that debate in a honest, open and factual manner then we may leave Australia exposed in the future to a lack of clean energy, something none of us want?
We have seen an acknowledgement in their rush to impose a flood levy that the Labor Party are doing what the coalition had already decided to do, and lower their commitment to zero-emission coal. I suspect there are a number of reasons for that, and if they are the same reasons as ours then they are that that issue is progressing too slowly to be a viable alternative much before 2030. And the question remains: at what cost? Whilst the coalition still believe it is an area that needs to be pursued, we believe that the coal industry has more than ample capability to do the preliminary research and the building of the pilot stations themselves. I am sure, when we look at some of the record profits being turned in by the resource companies—which I welcome; I like to see companies making profits—that they could devote a little of those profits to the research and development area of clean coal.
With the Labor Party walking away from zero-emission coal, what is their alternative for low-emission electricity in a baseload sense? I suspect they do not have one. Apart from the minister for energy, they are still tied up in the same ideological debate that caused them to oppose this very bill when the coalition brought it forward in 2005. That same hypocrisy is still on show. There are people who sit on those front benches along with the minister for energy who, deep down inside, know that it is irresponsible not to consider nuclear energy, but they hide behind their political games. The day will come when people on that side of the chamber will have the courage of their own convictions and the courage that they should have as leaders of Australia to actually admit that nuclear power has fewer deaths per terawatt hour than any other form of baseload energy. May they come to that realisation as soon as possible. It is amazing that they could be so blinded in the 21st century.
Going back to the issue of the storage of nuclear waste, we have to make sure we have a long-term solution to this issue. Radioactive waste is a reality in Australia, for the reasons that I just outlined. It is because of radiotherapy, because of nuclear medicine and because we want to save the lives of fellow Australians. There is no point in delaying this. There is no point in putting up amendments to try and hold back the tide. The reality is that it is irresponsible not to proceed with this—with due caution but on the basis that it has to be built as soon as possible. The reason we are now jammed up against a deadline is, of course, because of those who sit opposite. They had their chance; they failed. They had a second chance, and the Prime Minister went to an early election. So here we are again, trying to debate legislation that was not needed in the first place and should have been acted upon earlier.
As we look at the requirements, Australia’s current radioactive waste totals around 4,020 cubic metres of low-level and short-lived intermediate waste, and about 600 cubic metres of long-lived intermediate waste, including 32 metres arising from the return of the reprocessing internationally of ANSTO’s spent research reactor fuel, which is due for return to Australia in 2015-16. That is four years from now. It is probably appropriate at this point that I also speak in relation to a foreshadowed amendment that I understand will be moved by the Greens. It is to delay this legislation further. I assure the House that the coalition will be voting with the government on this bill and against that amendment. There is simply no sense in delaying and no time to delay this any further. I say to those in the Greens who want to delay this: what is the alternative? Are you going to stop this research? Are you going to stop this nuclear waste building up? Are you going to tell Australians that they can die from cancer? Is that your solution? Or are you going to join the Labor Party in the end, who will eventually realise the error of their ways and say, ‘This is just nonsense. Let’s get on with it’?
It is sensible to find an appropriate site for the storage of this waste. There has certainly been a process which has been gone through. We did of course find a suitable site in 2002 in South Australia, where nuclear waste was already being stored in a suboptimum facility—an open-sided galvanised iron shed. It is still there, to the best of my knowledge, waiting for a proper site to be built. But guess what, Mr Deputy Speaker: another Labor premier showed that he is about politics and populism before pragmatism and reality. The Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, decided to stop that dump going ahead. He is a South Australian premier who has uranium mining in his own state and whose own people are benefiting from that uranium. His own people are benefiting from the medical research done that created the nuclear waste. It was double hypocrisy by the Premier of South Australia, and that is why the process then moved on.
There were two preferred sites, and a site of 40 acres on a pastoral lease 20 kilometres west of Woomera was named as the preferred site. But, of course, we had to abandon that site and look elsewhere, thanks to the hypocrisy and the obstructionism of the state Labor government. Luckily, parliament passed the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act in late 2005. It was opposed at every step of the way by the Labor Party. That bill then facilitated a search in the Northern Territory. In 2007, the Howard government announced that the Northern Land Council’s nomination of Ngapa land as a potential site for the Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility had been accepted, and so the process began again. Between 2007 and now, we have reached a an agreement between the Commonwealth and traditional owners which also permits the nomination of other sites by the Northern Land Council. They have agreed with the Ngapa site. Labor have indicated that they will honour this deed and the current bill permits this.
I conclude by urging everyone to talk sensibly about this issue. Frightening people for political purposes is not something I have ever engaged in in this House and, on a matter as serious and important as this, politics should be put to one side. What is required is strong and decisive action to get this radioactive waste out of the car parks, out of the basements and out of the hospitals and into a site that is purpose built to store it in absolute safety. The coalition will support this bill. As I have said repeatedly, we will ensure that Australia gets what it needs in this regard. But, once this debate is over, I hope the Labor Party looks at the issues that the Minister for Resources and Energy has already outlined with regard to where we go with baseload electricity in Australia: clean energy that we need if we are going to lower our emissions. I hope that we will again, just by chance, see the Labor Party engage in a debate, as they have on this since they have been in government, that has a scientific, factual base to it, and that we consider where nuclear energy fits in Australia’s future. I do not mean to embarrass the Minister for Resources and Energy by raising this matter twice in this speech, but unfortunately there are too few people of his calibre who sit on the other side and Australia needs to have a debate if we are to secure our clean energy future, just as we need to pass this legislation if we are to provide a safe repository for the radioactive waste that has come about simply by saving Australians’ lives. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-02-21,"—The National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 is about Australia’s first nuclear waste dump. This nuclear dump is dangerous and unnecessary. This nuclear dump is in the wrong place. This nuclear dump is opposed by the traditional owners. This dump is being rammed through the parliament against the wishes of Territorians.
I spoke at length this morning about the process chosen by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts for conducting its inquiry into this bill. The cynically short, non-consultative and closed process by which it ultimately recommended the bill be passed with no further delay was far from a useful use of House resources. It was a waste of time. The end result of the committee process is that members at this point have no more information before them with which to make a judgment on whether or not to give this bill a second reading than they did when the bill was referred to the committee in October.
However, the inquiry whitewash is nothing compared to the heavy-handed means adopted in facilitating the passage of this bill. Let me remind members what the Labor Party said about the Howard waste dump legislation when it first tried to dump nuclear waste in the Northern Territory. A joint release from the member for Kingsford-Smith, the member for Lingiari, Senator Carr and Senator Crossin stated that they were ‘profoundly disappointed’ by the legislation. They said:
The next chapter has opened in the Howard Government's nuclear waste dump fiasco, with the Government today accepting a highly controversial site nomination at the Northern Territory's Muckaty Station, before scientific testing of the area.
Labor called for consultation with the locals rather than bullying by the government and stated clearly that the traditional owners had been stripped of their rights and that they pledged to repeal the Howard laws. Now in government, Labor, under he tutelage of the Minister for Resources and Energy, has adopted the approach of the Howard government, as we have just heard so eloquently expressed by the member for Groom. The Labor-era waste dump legislation, like the Howard legislation, overrides state and territory laws, suspends the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, excludes the Native Title Act 1993 and suspends the Judicial Review Act 1991.
The Labor legislation, like the Howard legislation, gives extraordinary discretionary power to the minister and allows him to operate with an absolute minimum of transparency. The Labor legislation, like the Howard legislation, ignores any commitment to procedural fairness and all avenues for judicial review. The Labor legislation, like the Howard legislation, ignores best science available in order to fast-track the supposedly volunteered dump location. Minister Martin Ferguson’s legislation, like the Howard legislation, completely fails to uphold international best practice, particularly in relation to securing community acceptance of the waste facilities. Article 29 part 2 of the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states:
States shall take effective measures to ensure that no storage or disposal of hazardous materials shall take place in the lands or territories of indigenous peoples without their free, prior and informed consent.
Yet here is the minister mimicking the Howard government’s best efforts to dump nuclear waste facilities on a community of people who do not want it.
The last two governments didn’t listen to us—you must be different.
The locals wrote that to every member of this House late last year. They said:
We have been fighting for the last five years to say we don’t want the waste dump in the land.
…            …            …
Come and sit with us and hear the stories from the land.
All the while the minister is arguing that his consultations are complete. That is because he inherited the deal done between a select few individuals living in the area and the former government, enabling him to claim that his obligations are finished. As a result, the traditional owners are taking action in the Federal Court. The first hearings of this process are on Friday, which might explain the government’s desire to push this legislation through parliament so quickly.
How did we get to this appalling situation? How did we get from a situation where Labor in opposition claimed that the local community was effectively bribed into accepting the waste dump on their land to a situation where the minister in the Labor government is claiming that this bill is ready to pass while the traditional owners write heartfelt letters to all members of this place asking to have the minister come and meet with them? How is it that a Labor government is pointing to a few individuals with whom a deal has been struck, and using that to claim that the local communities have been consulted and are content with this proposal?
This parliament should be in no doubt as to the regard in which the minister holds its members. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee majority report of 7 May 2010 had as its first recommendation, that the minister:
… undertake consultations with all parties with an interest in, or who would be affected by, a decision to select the Muckaty Station site as the location for the national radioactive waste facility.
As recently as December, Senator Sherry, replying to a question on notice asked by my colleague Senator Ludlam in the October Senate estimates, reiterated what we already knew. He said:
The Minister has not met the Indigenous land owners who oppose the nomination …
I struggle to find a more brazen example of the disregard that a minister has for parliamentary process, consultative public policy and basic human rights. Labor, led by Minister Martin Ferguson, is putting a nuclear waste dump on the land of Territorians and Indigenous Australians, who do not want it. If we have any doubt as to what this bill is really about, we need only listen to the person who drafted it, the member for Groom, who spoke before and made the point very clearly that this is the first step in a debate about Australia having a nuclear powered future.
Given the disregard that this government through its spokesperson in the Minister for Resources and Energy has had for the parliament, evident in its stubbornly proceeding with the bill while simultaneously ignoring the recommendation of the Senate inquiry majority report, I move in the terms that have been circulated in this chamber:
That all the words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House declines to give the bill a second reading until the Minister for Resources and Energy acts on recommendation one of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee majority report of 7 May 2010, namely that the Minister ‘undertake consultations with all parties with an interest in, or who would be affected by, a decision to select the Muckaty Station site as the location for the national radioactive waste facility’.”
I ask all members, whether or not they support nuclear power, whether or not they support nuclear waste being dumped in Central Australia, to ask themselves how they can oppose an amendment that simply asks the minister to meet with the people in whose backyard this waste dump is going to be. I commend the amendment to the House.
 (Mr KJ Thomson)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.
—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Melbourne has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I am pleased to speak on the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010. We know that this current bill seeks to repeal and replace the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 and subsequent Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Act 2006. The National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 will enable a site that is volunteered for consideration for use as a national radioactive waste management facility.
I want to speak on this bill because I think we have to bring some common sense to this parliament and to this nation. That is what this bill does. You cannot be a miner and a user of radioactive material and then say, ‘But we don’t want to dispose of it after its use.’ It is bizarre. It is like a shipping coal to one of our export countries and them saying, ‘We don’t want to use that; we want to send it back to Australia because it might pollute our soil.’ It is a fatuous and silly argument and that is why I expect it is coming largely from the Greens, because on this issue both the Labor Party and the coalition are in agreement.
There has to be a proper management regime for nuclear material being used and properly disposed of. Australia has the capacity to do this. We are a massive nation with all the right ingredients to store the material that we produce and use in a responsible way. Like my coalition colleagues I obviously welcome the progress of this debate throughout the House in establishing a national management facility in Australia. We know that for some years the coalition has recognised the need for such a facility. We need an informed and responsible approach to managing Australia’s radioactive waste. You just cannot pretend that we do not mine it and do not use it.
A facility is crucial to a long-term strategy to managing radioactive waste in Australia and this needs to be gotten on with. For too long it has been dragging on. The Howard government introduced the original legislation in 2005 and here we are six years later in 2011 looking at a rejigged bill which the Labor Party in opposition totally slammed, opportunistically denied, tried to defeat and scared people with. Here today they have re-tweaked the Howard legislation into a bill. That is why we are supporting it: because it is legislation that has to happen, as is said here, in the national interest. We are not fairies at the bottom of the garden who are going to pretend that this is not something that happens in Australia and, if we shut our eyes for long enough and bury our heads in the sand for long enough, it will go away. We need to get on to it, particularly because we have something like 32 cubic metres of spent research reactor fuel returning to Australia in 2015-16 after being processed internationally.
Our hospitals and a whole range of other industries in Australia use radioactive isotopes for accurate cutting and measuring et cetera and those have to be disposed of. To stop them being stored in basements of hospitals and in containers at the back of industrial sites, we need a proper disposal management regime in this country to responsibly deal with the waste that we produce. You could draw a whole lot of parallels about the waste with coal and other fuels and try to relate them to this, but it is so wacky that we have been brought here today to debate this bill. The legislation will pass, no matter what the amendment is that the member for Melbourne has moved in this place, because there is a bipartisan approach to be responsible on this issue, whereas the Greens want to hang their hats on some sort of international scare campaign on nuclear.
Let us look at the wider philosophical debate. The Labor Party do not necessarily come to this issue with clean hands. They have tried for years and years to stick to the old three-mines policy generated back in the days of the Whitlam government and, at the same time, they have tried to rejig and morph the policy so that uranium can be mined at Olympic Dam in South Australia. That is still part of the three-mines policy, even though Rum Jungle in the Northern Territory, for example—which was one of the mines—no longer exists. We have this cute debate, which is ideologically driven, running in this country. Even though we have massive reserves of nuclear material—something like 40 per cent of the world’s known reserves of nuclear material—we are saying that we should not be exporting it. The Labor Party still will not deal with India because it has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, yet through the back door India is buying its uranium from countries like Kazakhstan. It is a ‘responsible’ country, of Borat fame, which is supplying material to India through the back door because it can, and we are missing the opportunity. How ridiculous is that! Australia is missing out on an opportunity where we would not only have some control over who buys it and who gets it but also have some control over what is done with it.
Every time you talk about nuclear in this country, the first things you hear about are Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Three Mile Island and Chernobyl happened decades ago. When people want to talk about them, remember that comparing those archaic facilities at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl with nuclear facilities today is akin to comparing an FJ Holden to a Lamborghini. They were FJ Holdens, and they broke up and fell apart, but nothing in any way like that has happened since. The modern nuclear reactor today delivers clean, unpolluted power. The Greens will say, ‘Shock, horror—nuclear power!’ but there are energy depleted countries in Europe such as France, 70 per cent of whose power generated for domestic use comes from nuclear reactors.
On a study tour I was fortunate enough to do in Italy, I went to the area around Milan and I was told that some years ago they had had a national referendum to ban any future nuclear power generation. Guess what: they are walking away from that now as they are going to build five new nuclear reactors in Italy. Obviously, one of the reasons for that is the games that were being played by the old Russia and its satellite states which cut off the gas to Italy. As a result, their industry came to a grinding halt and they realised that they could not be held to ransom by other states in Europe but had to generate their own power. Because they have no natural resources such as coal, gas and oil to generate power, they are off building new facilities.
Of course, Italy and other countries are going to face the same problems as we are—that is, where to store it. I know the argument about ‘Not in my backyard’. Nobody wants a nuclear reactor built in their backyard—in their electorate. Ask every one of the 150 members of this House, ‘Are you happy to have a nuclear reactor in your electorate?’ and they will say, ‘No way,’ but then behind their hands they will say, ‘But it’s a good idea—it would probably not be a bad idea if we actually had cleanly generated power delivered through a very, very low-cost fuel which Australia generates 40 per cent of.’ It would be the same with the storage. You could ask, ‘Do you want to store nuclear waste in your electorate—in other words, in your backyard?’ The answer would be: ‘Oh no, you can’t do it here.’ It would be terrible—you would have people marching in the streets led by, I expect, the Greens in their little pixie outfits and, as a result, it would not happen. But a solution was arrived at and, as the states reneged on this agreement to go forward, it was decided that somebody needed to volunteer and select the most appropriate site.
My colleague the Hon. Ian McFarlane, the member for Groom, the former Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and now the shadow minister for energy and resources, said that this bill seeks to find a national radioactive management facility for low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste. It is simply replicating what we have already done, and there is a need for a centralised long-term radioactive management plan and storage. That is simply being cut and pasted by the Labor Party, but the storage facility was eventually found in the Northern Territory at Muckaty Station. The Greens member of this House—who, as I digress, unfortunately got here on Liberal preferences, so we will have to do something about that next time; we saw what happened in Victoria last time, and maybe we should take note of that—just told the House that there is a ‘divided community’ at Muckaty Station.
Can I say to you, ‘Wake up, old son,’ because for all the native title issues throughout this country there can be a whole lot of claimants and title challenges from within the same family. You are seeing this regarding the facility that they want to build in the Kimberley for the processing of gas. One Aboriginal group, led by Mr Roe, is opposed to it, and the other side, led by Wayne Bergmann, who is trying to get decent jobs and income for his people in the region, has endorsed it. The courts endorsed him and two other members to go forward and negotiate before it is taken off them by the Western Australian state government. As a Western Australian, I feel quite passionate about this. We have the potential in our state to further develop the resources sector—the traditional mining of iron ore, gold and nickel; it is the richest mining province in the world—and add nuclear to that, because BHP’s Yeelirrie site is being progressed by a Liberal coalition government. It is sensible and in the national interest to get on with our resource that is used throughout the world for all the proper reasons. At Muckaty Station you will have somebody in the Aboriginal clan, or dynasty, who wants a better deal and wants to be in charge. They will go off to the High Court, as they do—they will probably get legal aid on the way—and will make sure that they string it out for as long as they can. But, at the end of the day, this is the most sensible place. Geologically, it is the most appropriate place. It is geologically stable, from a weather point of view it is dry and lacks in humidity, and no-one, to speak of, lives there. It has a very sparse population. Barely anyone lives in that arid and desolate part of the Northern Territory.
My colleague from the Northern Territory has a few issues with this because the old NIMBY issues come into her backyard, but, at the end of the day, the Commonwealth has found a site. We could look at other territories. I do not suspect that Cocos Islands, Norfolk Island or Lord Howe Island necessarily want to do a deal. They do not have the right geological framework to store this material. But, deep underground, with the technologies that are used now, this is an income for the local Indigenous people to make use of. It is only sensible and right that they are given the opportunity to do this rather than saying, as we hear in this place so often, ‘We know what’s better for you, you poor Indigenous people. You don’t know how to look after your affairs. We’ll look after them for you.’ We can see where that has got them—welfare dependency and all those sorts of things.
So, allow self-determination, allow an income for the people in this part of the world and allow a proper regime in this country that can be managed so that a facility can be built properly in order to get nuclear waste out of hospital basements and the backyards of industrial sites. We need a proper framework in place so that we can go forward. The Labor Party are supporting it and thumbing their noses at the Greens alliance that they are involved in at the moment, because they know that they will get this through the House. This side of the House supports sensible nuclear waste management. I endorse the bill.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—The purpose of the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 is to establish a facility for managing, at a single site, radioactive waste currently stored at a host of locations across the country. As has been said, in many capital cities, around hospitals and many other sites, we have a lot of radioactive waste. This bill will ensure the safe and responsible management of this waste arising from medical and industrial areas and the research of radioactive material in Australia. The bill ensures the Commonwealth’s power to make arrangements for the safe and secure management of radioactive waste generated, processed or controlled by the Commonwealth. This has to be done on a voluntary basis. No site can be considered a potential location as a radioactive waste management facility without the voluntary nomination of the site and the agreement of persons with relevant rights and interests.
The sites mentioned that have been considered before include the Harts Ranges, Mount Everard, Alice Springs and Fishers Ridge near Katherine. The bill no longer singles out the Northern Territory as the only location to be considered. The minister must first consider whether a facility can be built on land nominated by a land council in the Northern Territory, including the current nomination. For example, the land councils of the Northern Territory have been given the first opportunity to nominate land to see if it is suitable for a waste facility. If the minister believes that it is suitable, the minister can obtain more information about land rights and interests in the site and also look at the physical site itself. It includes the collection of water and soil samples to help make a decision. Once a site has been selected, it will be put forward for regulatory approval. However, this does not guarantee the establishment of a facility. When all of this has been done and the site fails in some way and it is not feasible, the minister may open the nationwide nomination process. This allows the Ngapa peoples to have procedural fairness in any decision to select a site, including the current nomination at Muckaty Station.
The bill repeals the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 and applies a decision-making process based on natural justice. Natural justice puts in place a code of fair procedure. At its core is the hearing rule: a right to be heard by the minister before a decision is reached. The bill also reinstates the Administrative Decision (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This will allow persons aggrieved by a decision to apply for judicial review and ensure a higher level of accountability for decisions. A facility will not be established unless it meets environmental and regulatory requirements under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Australian Radioactive Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. A regional consultation committee will also be established to communicate with local communities during the environmental and regulatory approval process and the construction and operational stages of the project. This open and informed process will help raise awareness through dialogue, address local concerns and ensure government transparency when establishing a national radioactive waste management facility.
I think we have to be realistic that nuclear waste needs to be stored. The safest way to store it is in our own backyard, as we will then be certain that all the standards for safety and security are met. Any facility built here will store radioactive waste generated, processed or controlled by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth entity. This is crucial to a long-term strategy for managing radioactive waste in Australia. Of course, that waste is generated in saving lives in hospitals, and it is generated in Australia. We have to take care of our own waste. This government’s intention is that the facility will manage Australia’s waste rather than just the waste from Commonwealth authorities. State waste will be accepted after detailed negotiations with the states have occurred. It is an improvement on our predecessors, who left the states and territories to make their own arrangements for managing these wastes, despite international best practice favouring centralised, purpose-built facilities.
I know there are many storage facilities in Tasmania. They are often the topic of conversation in the press when there is a scare, and there must be many others around this country. When the public becomes aware that they are just down the road, around the corner, underneath where they are working or whatever, people start to get a bit of an idea that there is something that this country must come to grips with, and that is the storage of its nuclear waste. This bill would allow it all to be put into one spot and will minimise the risk of any loss of control. It will help keep control of the radioactive material, therefore making it safer and more secure.
Two important facts provide compelling arguments as to why Australia should be at the forefront of nuclear spent fuel and waste storage research. Australia is a major exporter of uranium and nuclear power. It is the world’s largest and most promising source of low-carbon energy for most countries. In past public debates, proliferation has been the most important issue for objectors to nuclear power, while arguments about waste storage have centred on the technical questions of long-term stability and security of the storage systems. There are good reasons Australia should accept nuclear waste and store spent fuel prior to recycling. One reason is that Australia has a huge area suitable for long-term, relatively dry and geographically stable storage sites that meet that criterion. Most of them are remote from significant human habitation.
Another reason is that Australia is more politically stable than other countries that will inevitably attempt to enter the large-scale business opportunities of storage and handling systems. There is a very good reason why we should exploit our unique capacities in this activity. If we allow nuclear waste to come to Australia, not only do we make the world a safer place and protect our country from the major threat that nuclear waste poses to us but we could earn large sums of foreign exchange. As part of any plan, taking others’ waste could be an industry in itself for us into the future.
The argument about making the world a safer place by taking waste is also considerable. Nuclear waste stored below a desert in Australia is much less likely to become a dirty bomb than waste stored alongside a nuclear reactor in France or America. Making use of fuel rods or, in the future, fuel pellets would greatly reduce the chance of a dirty bomb exploding in a large city—and that is the major risk that waste poses for us. The natural causes of release of waste into the environment are easy to manage in Australia. We run a lower risk of radioactivity reaching our shores from a desert location inland from the Indian Ocean than from temporary storage facilities in California or Japan.
For our own good, we should offer a little patch of Australia to store nuclear waste. It is not a huge amount. Over 50 years Australia has accumulated a total of 4,020 cubic metres of low-level and short-lived intermediate and low-level radioactive waste. About 50 cubic metres is annually accumulated here. We do not produce any high-level waste. Other countries have a lot more, and maybe, in the long term, we might look at storing other people’s waste—of course, at a cost.
I do think that we have to get over the fear of nuclear materials and start understanding what risks there may or may not be by using it. There are fears about all sorts of things, and the best way to deal with that fear is to understand it. We need to understand what we are dealing with. We are beginning to understand a bit more about nuclear energy. New generations are coming to understand that, as we look at the need for a low-carbon future, we certainly have to have a debate on nuclear energy.
The only reason we have not had to do this in Australia is that nuclear is still very expensive compared to other power sources, such as coal. But there may be a day when we will have to consider it—and that day is getting closer all the time. Therefore, we need how best to use it and how to store and secure the waste safely. We need to work towards investigating ways to make the waste less potent and ways to more quickly break down that waste. It is important to have an understanding of the science and to have people with the necessary skill base.
This bill allows many options to be considered. There needs to be full consultation with the people and organisations that may have an interest in the location of such a waste site, and we need the proper checks and balances. This facility should be of great benefit to Australia in many ways. We need to have a debate about nuclear energy in Australia. We need to think about what will happen if we do not clean the coal that we have in the ground. We have 400 years of coal reserves based on present usage. Coal is a major, major fuel for us, but, if we do not find a way to clean it, we will need to look at another source. The Greens, who have spoken in this chamber, are opposed to nuclear energy and to coal. So we could be in trouble if they win the day. I support this bill. I believe it is a good bill and that it will take us forward as a nation.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to endorse the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 as a long overdue measure this parliament ought to take in implementing what I regard as a vital piece of our national infrastructure. I reject the proposed amendment by the Greens, and I will get to that in a moment. I endorse the comments of the member for Lyons. It is a brave man inside the Labor Party who stands up and calls for the use of nuclear power, and I encourage him to pursue that line. We have seen in recent times union leaders coming forward and saying that they feel that nuclear power is a good way for this country to proceed. We have seen more and more Labor members realising—after decades of inaction—that nuclear is a viable and long-term strategic option in Australia’s interests.
However, I do want to correct the member for Lyons on a couple of points that he made. He contended that the coalition had done nothing in government and that somehow we are here today because of coalition inaction. We are standing here today after 11½ years of coalition policy stating that we need a centralised waste management system because of the intransigence of the Labor Party in opposition. They opposed us in that endeavour. Why did they oppose us? They opposed the centralisation of waste management in Australia because they could not resolve their own internal political tensions. Labor, the Greens and the left of centre in Australian politics have always sought to create fear out of the nuclear issue. That is why I think the comments of the member for Lyons were radically different here today. I endorse his comments, because it is long overdue that the left of centre of Australian politics came to grips with technology and with the realities of the world in 2011.
I say to the member for Lyons that it is not that we are only now learning about the use of nuclear power and how valuable it could be. It has been in operation for decades. Australia has been mining uranium for decades. We have been using the benefits of nuclear medicine for decades. These benefits have been obvious to those people following and interested in the debates on nuclear power, nuclear energy generation and the use of nuclear technology in this country. These benefits have of course escaped the notice of the Labor Party.
In the 2007 election campaign the Labor Party sought to run a series of fear campaigns around this country on the siting of nuclear power plants. The front page of local papers in my electorate of Mitchell carried a big picture of a reactor tower and the words ‘Nuclear plant coming to Mitchell’. That might have been a plan proposed by the member for Werriwa—who I notice is here in the chamber—because that was certainly replicated right across this country, particularly in marginal electorates. I thought that was a shallow and defeatist set of campaign tactics. We have to seriously consider these very important technologies for the future, not cynically campaign politically on such an important and vital part of this country’s future.
We have one of the world’s largest reserves of uranium. We were held back for decades by Labor’s three mines policy. People talk about trade cartels. Labor had a three mines policy for so long in ignorance of the opportunities that we are provided by this fortunate land that we live in. The coalition’s longstanding position has been one of support for this concept, and we support this bill. We are behaving responsibly in opposition. We are behaving in the national interest. For 11½ years we sought to act in the national interest and construct a repository in a suitable location. I note that the member for Solomon is here in the chamber today. She is here in defence of her constituents—and I think she is doing a great job in that regard.
Years ago there was a proposal for a suitable site in northern South Australia. The only reason that facility did not go ahead was Labor Party intransigence by the Rann government. That is what we have seen from state Labor governments around the country: a lack of leadership and a lack of vision for their state and for their country. We have seen short-term temporary politics overtaking long-term national interest and decision making. People in this country are sick of it. No wonder every Labor state Premier is as unpopular as Captain Bligh in the rebellion. No wonder every state wants to reject them. We would have had a centralised waste management facility in a suitable location—which was identified in the report—in northern South Australia many years ago, and everything would have proceeded in a much safer way for ordinary Australians. Labor has been content to allow the storing of radioactive waste containers in car parks, hospitals and inner city areas all around the country—totally unsuitable arrangements. That is why this bill is important. It is why a centralised facility in a suitable location is important to all Australians. We do have to handle the waste that is generated by nuclear activity, and it is something that Labor has opposed.
I want to endorse the remarks of the member for Groom. I think he has a great understanding, as a former Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, of what this issue represents. In listening to what the member for Lyons had to say, it is interesting to note that, yes, we are a signatory to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and we do have obligations in this country. Yet it seems to me that the Labor Party and the Greens, in particular, are always talking about meeting our international obligations in relation to so many things. We have international obligations for the safe handling of nuclear waste and yet that has not figured in their policies nor in their campaigning for so long. That is why this parliament has to override by necessity—using its powers under section 51—state and territory laws in relation to waste handling. It has to do that. The member for Lyons’s comments, while welcome, are long overdue in this case. The irrationality that has pervaded this debate from members of the Labor Party has been extraordinary.
When you look at the benefits that nuclear technology has brought to us, nuclear medicine today enables doctors to produce quick and accurate diagnoses of a wide range of conditions and diseases in persons of any age. When we look at the provisions of this bill, in Australia we have to recognise that we do not deal with high-level waste. We deal with low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste. It makes sense to centralise, in a safe way, the waste and to have a facility for dealing with it. I think it is odd to hear the remarks in this place, especially by the member for Melbourne, about the benefits of nuclear medicine to increase the standard of health care for all of our citizens and about the benefits of nuclear technology in an advanced and modern society.
The position of the member for Melbourne is that the location in the Northern Territory would be the wrong one, but he has no proposal for where to centralise waste management in this country. It is absolutely unsatisfactory to come into this chamber and say, ‘It’s the wrong place,’ and to have no alternative. I think it is absolutely the wrong position to come in here and say, ‘I really want the benefits of nuclear medicine; I want the advances that come from nuclear technology’—we live in a society where people do enjoy the benefits of it—and then say, ‘We don’t like the waste.’ Radioactive waste is a very unfortunate by-product of this technology. It is the level of technology that we have reached at this time in human development. We have to deal with it in the best way we can and in the most advanced way we can. We cannot be half pregnant on this issue. We cannot have nuclear generating facilities like Lucas Heights in Sydney and hospitals that use nuclear technology and not deal with the waste in the most intelligent fashion that we can. We must.
It is vital that this bill is supported as quickly as possible, and that is why the opposition is moving to do so. I think that the Greens have not just missed the practical and common-sense arguments about the importance of this technology to our country’s health and other benefits; they have also missed their own arguments on climate change. It is no accident that countries like France have so many nuclear power plants and have no problems with nuclear power. With the advances in technology, with fourth and fifth generation plants, and the way it is moving and progressing all around the world, we can move down this path in a very safe fashion. It is not an accident that other countries have lowered their emissions. Australia is one of the highest emitters of carbon, per capita, in the entire world and it is primarily because of our power generation. Everything this government has attempted to do around the edges that has not dealt with power generation is a waste of our time. We have wasted so much time. We can tackle carbon emissions through the use of nuclear power, and we can do so intelligently, in a forward-thinking fashion that provides energy generation for Australians for a long time to come.
It would not be a surprise to those opposite that I am a supporter of nuclear power plants. It would not surprise the member for Werriwa—who may or may not have been the architect of the scare campaign all around Australia about nuclear power plants—that I was not a supporter of the one that was reported on the front page of my newspapers in Mitchell. Mitchell is an unsuitable site for a nuclear power plant, just by virtue of it being in a metropolitan area, and it was wrong of the Labor Party to try to scare my constituents into thinking that there was ever a plan to put a nuclear power plant in Mitchell. It was wrong of them to scare communities across this country that they may have had a nuclear plant coming towards them. That was a wrong thing to do. But I am a supporter of nuclear power. I think there are appropriate sites in a country so large and a population so small.
I think that many of the provisions of this bill are improvements. While it does call for the repeal of the coalition’s previous act, I do think that there have been some improvements made in this bill. However, I also note that much of the original legislation is replicated in the bill before us today. They have not reinvented the wheel. They have fulfilled their promise of repealing the previous act and they have used large sections of the act and added new provisions. So it is a little bit cute of the Labor Party to come in here today and say that the coalition did nothing for 11½ years when, at every turn, the coalition proposed to deal with radioactive waste in the very manner prescribed in this bill. The reason it never came to fruition is that Labor at federal level and state levels across this country opposed it, at every step of the way, for pure political interest. That is why we are here as an opposition behaving differently. We support this bill because it is the right thing to do. We support this bill because we do need a centralised waste management facility in this country to ensure the safety and security of Australians in our metropolitan areas and to ensure that waste is properly handled, sensitively handled, in the right way and the best way that we know how. That is why I support this bill.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I also take the opportunity to speak on and support the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010. As Chair of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, this morning I presented an advisory report on the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 to this House. I will take the opportunity to very quickly summarise some of the points I made when I presented that report, and in doing so I also hope to respond to some of the comments made by the member for Melbourne.
This morning I pointed out to the House that this bill in fact replaces the 2005 act introduced by the previous, coalition government—the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005. It is also a bill that was redrafted after having been presented to a Senate select committee early in 2010. Having been redrafted, it was presented to the House on 21 October last year at which time it was then referred to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts for consideration. There were no terms of reference for the inquiry, as is the case when a bill is referred to a committee, and so the committee determined the basis on which it would conduct its inquiry. In doing so, it looked at the very long history associated with the management of nuclear matters in this country. It ultimately made a report to the House.
The member for Melbourne was appointed as a supplementary member to the committee for the purpose of the inquiry into this bill. He in turn submitted a dissenting report. I say to the member for Melbourne: I respect his right to disagree with the work and findings of the committee. He is entitled to do that, but I believe he is wrong in attacking the members of the committee, who, I should point out, were unanimous in their recommendation to the House of the report that I presented this morning. In my view, the members of that committee did their work very diligently and took the matter very seriously. The fact that the committee was able to conclude its work within a four-week time frame in no way belittles the commitment of the committee or the work that was carried out.
The committee carefully analysed the matters that had taken place up to the point where this bill had been referred to the committee. Amongst those matters was the fact that since 2005 there had previously been on four occasions matters referred to a Senate committee associated with this very issue. On all of those occasions reports were brought back. I have done a quick count of the number of public submissions that were made in the course of those four reports alone, and there were something like 637 public submissions on this issue made prior to the committee making its decision.
Prior to that, there had also been a long-running history of public debate, public discussions and public consultations on a whole range of matters, again, very much associated with the matter that is before us. Having taken all of those matters into account, the committee determined that it would conduct its inquiry on the basis of three key areas. One was in terms of the very last report of the Senate select committee, which reported in May of last year, only some five or six months before the bill was reintroduced to the House. The committee determined to consider, firstly, to what extent the minister had taken into account the recommendations of that committee; secondly, the principle matters of concern raised in the dissenting report of the Senate select committee by Senator Scott Ludlam; and, thirdly, the critical issues associated with the differences of opinion with respect to the nomination of Muckaty Station as a site to be considered. On the basis of those three matters, the committee proceeded with its inquiry. I will take each of those matters separately.
In respect of Muckaty Station, the government was prepared to honour an agreement with the traditional owners of Muckaty in 2007; in fact, a nomination deed had already been signed with the traditional owners of Muckaty Station at the time. That deed still stands, and my understanding is that the minister met with a delegation of the Ngapa clan and executive members of the Northern Land Council in Darwin on 3 March 2010. At that meeting they confirmed their continuing support of their nomination. On that basis, it would seem clear to me that it would be in breach of an agreement properly entered into with a group of people for the government to do anything other than honour that nomination and agreement. Furthermore, the minister has made it quite clear that, should the matter of the Muckaty Station nomination being currently challenged in the Federal Court result in anything different, then the minister would honour the court’s decision.
I also stress the point that the nomination with respect to Muckaty Station is currently before the Federal Court. It was taken to court by an Indigenous person who claims that he was not properly consulted and not in agreement with the nomination. The committee considered that and the seriousness of that statement. In doing so, it felt that the appropriate place for such a matter to be resolved is in fact in the courts and not by a public inquiry of the committee.
I repeat what I said a moment ago: the minister has made it clear that the government will respect whatever the court’s decision is. Again I stress that whilst the committee in no way implied or intended to suggest that the nomination process was not being questioned, the committee also felt that the proper place for that to be resolved was in the courts and not by the committee, and that is exactly what is happening.
With respect to the other matters raised by Senator Scott Ludlam in his dissenting report, which have essentially been raised again by the member for Melbourne in his dissenting report to the report by the standing committee of this House that I presented this morning, they essentially come down to questions of safety matters associated with both the nuclear industry and the environment. Again, the committee quite rightly accepts that those are legitimate matters of concern. The committee, however, is also very conscious of the fact that this is essentially a three-step process: a site is nominated; the minister makes a determination as to whether the nominated site becomes selected after a process has been gone through; and then, if the relevant hurdles are overcome, a site is chosen for the development of a radioactive nuclear waste facility.
For the selection process, there are three critical acts that will come into play before a final decision is made. Nomination of a site does not imply, nor does it guarantee, that the site will in fact be chosen to establish such a facility. Prior to that occurring, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will apply with respect to protection of the environment, therefore any procedural aspects associated with public consultation, public submissions and environment protection matters are covered in the framework of that act. Secondly, with respect to radioactive matters and nuclear safety, both the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 also apply and both need to be complied with prior to a decision being made. If there are concerns about this site being suitable or that it may not meet international standards, then those concerns need to be addressed by implementing changes to those two acts, because they create the framework under which the approval will ultimately be granted. If there is a deficiency, the deficiency lies in those two acts, not in the act that we are currently debating. Therefore, again, the committee was satisfied that matters of nuclear safety and environmental protection were adequately covered in the process which follows the nomination process, because those acts are still relevant.
The third matter raised in the dissenting reports relates to judicial review and procedural fairness. In the revised bill that we are now debating, those matters have in fact been embraced by the minister. Certainly the procedural fairness does not apply retrospectively to the nomination of the Muckaty site. That matter has been dealt with and an agreement or deed has been entered into with the Ngapa people. With respect to any future nomination or any other nomination, judicial review and procedural fairness will apply. And judicial review and procedural fairness will apply once a nomination is made even with respect to the Muckaty Station site.
So the process from here on in provides for all of those matters to be taken into account. That is certainly my understanding. On that basis the committee felt that the bill as it currently stands should not only come to parliament but should be supported because the government has responded quite responsibly to the matters that were raised in the course of the public inquiries. In essence, we—the committee—accept that ultimately there will be differences of opinion about a range of matters and we accept that there will be ideological differences between people throughout the community and between members within this parliament. We also accept, however, that this matter has been ongoing for almost 11 years now, under the previous bill and now this bill.
We have some 4,000 cubic metres of low-level and short-lived intermediate-level-radiation material, which has accumulated over the last 50 years and is currently housed in various places around the nation. It is my view, as it has been the view of several other speakers here tonight, that it makes much more sense to have a properly constructed facility to store that material. That is exactly what this bill hopes to do. If the particular site that has been nominated falls through, then the process from here on in is that, firstly, it will be on the basis of a voluntary nomination, so a site has to be volunteered by a community. Secondly, anyone throughout Australia can nominate a site, whereas the previous act restricted it to the Northern Territory. Thirdly, once a site has been nominated, matters of judicial review and procedural fairness will entirely apply.
In his second reading speech the Minister for Resources and Energy went through, I believe quite thoroughly, each of the matters associated with this bill and why we need to proceed with it. We certainly will continue to accumulate nuclear waste. We certainly have had the debate about where it is best located—and, again, I accept comments by a previous speaker that nobody ever wants to have the nuclear waste in their backyard. The reality, however, is that it needs to be stored somewhere. It is my view that if you go through a thorough process, which this bill certainly does, both of complying with all the relevant acts and of ensuring you have a site that is best suited geologically for the storage of waste material, you should then proceed to develop a facility. That is what this bill does. It is my view that we should support the bill.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to speak in favour of the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010, which repeals the Commonwealth’s Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005. The bill will lead to the establishment of a facility managing in a single site radioactive waste. This is important because radioactive waste in Australia is currently stored in multiple sites, and this creates handling and storage concerns that could otherwise be allayed with the creation of the single secure repository. Over the last five decades Australia has accumulated approximately 4,000 cubic metres of low-level and short lived intermediate-level radioactive waste. In stark contrast, and as has been pointed out in this House, Britain and France produce on an annual basis approximately 25,000 cubic metres of such waste. Low-level waste, according to the second reading speech of the Minister for Resources and Energy, includes:
... lightly contaminated light laboratory waste such as paper, plastic, glassware and protective clothing, contaminated soil, smoke detectors and emergency exit signs.
Intermediate level waste arises from the production of nuclear medicines, from overseas reprocessing of spent research reactor fuel and from disused medical and industrial sources such as radiotherapy sources and soil moisture meters.
In the words of Dr Adrian Paterson, the CEO of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, who testified to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee:
The current situation where radioactive waste is held in over 100 separate locations around Australia is not conducive to the safety and security of that material, nor is it consistent with international best practice.
He goes on to say:
The opportunity that this legislation provides is for that management practice to now be established at a national level and to be available nationally to all of the small holders of these used sources and the orphan sources in Australia.
So here we have it, the technical experts and the people we trust to protect our safety advising us that this bill will make a positive difference. Critically, passage of this bill is urgent and the Greens tactics to delay it should not be supported because Australian spent fuel waste, which was transported to France and Scotland, will be transported back to Australia in 2015-16 and will need to be immediately and safely stored.
While the coalition supports this bill, it is important to acknowledge that during the years of the Howard government, when we advocated and legislated for a single national facility, the Labor Party at a federal level and Labor governments at a state and territory level put up obstacles at every turn and did their best to impede progress. The Rann South Australian Labor government in 2003 and the Martin Labor Northern Territory government made clear their opposition to coalition efforts to find a suitable central repository. Julia Gillard’s hypocrisy in taking to the election a policy that would repeal the coalition’s 2005 Radioactive Waste Management Act seems hollow in light of the bill that they have now put before the House.
This bill assumes many of the features of the coalition’s legislation and will still see Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory remain a potential site for radioactive waste. It is a site that was selected during the coalition government’s process after nomination, importantly, by the Northern Land Council. In the telling words of the Greens, Labor’s bill is ‘a cut and paste’ from the previous Howard government. This grandstanding from Julia Gillard and her party is both typical and cynical. But more dangerous than the ALP on this important issue is the Greens, who according to their election platform want to close down the reactor at Lucas Heights. This retrograde step must never be allowed to get traction.
Radioactive materials in Australia are being put to valuable use in the fields of medicine and industry. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is responsible for providing 85 per cent of nuclear medicines to hospitals in Australia and in so doing helping to treat patients who are suffering from a range of diseases, including cancer. According to the Minister for Resources and Energy, around 500,000 patients annually benefit from radioisotopes in medical procedures. These facilities are clearly important to our society and need to be continued and supported.
As has been made clear by the member for Groom in his statement to this House, the debate about this bill provides an important opportunity for the leadership of the Labor Party to declare itself in favour of a comprehensive and immediate debate about pursuing the benefits of a civilian nuclear power industry. As we all know, the member for Batman is ahead of the pack and leading his colleagues out from underneath their ideological covers. Bob Hawke, who said of nuclear power, ‘It is intellectually unsustainable to rule it out as a possibility,’ and that quotable AWU leader, Paul Howes, are among the other outspoken nuclear proponents. Nuclear power is a carbon neutral baseload energy source. With Australia’s energy needs to double in coming decades and our desire where possible to transition to a less carbon intensive economy, we must consider nuclear energy in the mix. The facts tell the story. Australia is home to 38 per cent of the world’s known recoverable uranium reserves and we export it to more than 10 countries, to which we should add India immediately.
With 31 countries hosting 440 reactors in the world today and more than 55 reactors currently under construction, nearly half of them in China alone, the international message is clear: get on board because you are already being left behind. New technology is getting more cost-effective and power plants quicker to build. Decades of experience since the explosions at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island indicate that reactors are inherently safer too. Ziggy Switkowski, the pre-eminent voice in the Australian nuclear debate and until recently chairman of ANSTO, believes Australia can have its first operating reactor by 2020 and 50 in place by 2050 providing 90 per cent of Australia’s energy needs. This message has already been heard loud and clear by the Democrat American President, Barack Obama, who recently committed $1 billion in federal loan guarantees for the next-generation reactors, and the former Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain, Gordon Brown, who described nuclear power as ‘a fundamental precondition of preparing Britain for a new world’.
If it was good enough for the American Democrats and the British Labour Party to enthusiastically embrace nuclear power, why is it not good enough for their left-of-centre political cousins here in Australia? To paraphrase Paul Keating, they are still back down in the time tunnel. Australia’s long-term energy future requires a comprehensive and bipartisan debate about nuclear power. This is long overdue. It is time Julia Gillard took the lead. So, too, is Australia overdue in finding an appropriate and secure facility to store our existing stockpile of radioactive nuclear waste. This bill meets this end and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—The National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 is intended to repeal the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 and put in place a proper process to establish a facility for managing, at a single site, radioactive waste arising from medical, industrial and research uses of radioactive material. I fully support the repeal of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005, which the Howard Government rammed through the parliament and which was described variously as ‘extreme’, ‘arrogant’, ‘heavy-handed’, ‘draconian’, ‘sorry’, ‘sordid’, ‘extraordinary’ and ‘profoundly shameful’.
In 2008, the Senate Environment, Communications and Arts Committee found that the CRWMA legislation was unfair and discriminatory, that consultations and decision-making processes should reflect the interests of all clan groups in the immediate area, that a new foundation for building Australia’s nuclear waste policy was needed and that the legislation should be repealed. There is now a new bill before the House which itself has been the subject of some debate.
The area in question is a place north of Tennant Creek known as Muckaty Station. It has become the proposed site as a result of an agreement between the Howard government and the Northern Land Council. I understand that the class of traditional owners is disputed and is the subject of a Federal Court action at the present time. There are nevertheless a number of Aboriginal communities from the Ngapa, Milwayi, Wintirku, Ngarrka and Yapakurla groups in the Muckaty area identifying themselves as the traditional owners of the Manuwangku/Warlmanpa Land Trust who strongly object to a nuclear waste dump in the vicinity of their land.
I note the concerns expressed about the bill by the former member for Solomon, Damian Hale, in a speech in this place on 18 March 2010, and by the member for Barkly in the Northern Territory, Gerry McCarthy, in a submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee dated 5 March 2010. In that submission, Mr McCarthy said he supported ‘the development of safe and secure processes for the transport and storage of Australia’s nuclear waste on a national level with reference to the security of our generation and our future generations’. However, Mr McCarthy also said: ‘If the decision is based on the testimony of an extended family group living far-removed from Muckaty Station then the total dislocation of the Waramungu and Warlmanpa tribal communities of the Barkly that I represent is at stake … Any determination to proceed without direct, open and accountable consultation with the wider contemporary Indigenous community representing the neighbouring clans, moiety and tribal groups of the central Barkly will effectively lead to generational division and conflict among the very people the Minister has set out to support.’
I am aware that the road to this point has been long and tortuous and that there is a desire to achieve a solution to the vexed issue of the disposal of nuclear waste produced in Australia. Nevertheless, a number of issues have been raised with respect to the bill and I would like to speak to some of them. The first is the issue of community consent. The international human rights principles set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, require the ‘free, prior and informed consent’ of affected communities. While the Northern Land Council signed off on this deal with the previous government some years ago in circumstances that are unclear, it is clear that the persons affected by a radioactive waste storage facility go well beyond persons who have a formal proprietary interest in the land on which the facility is constructed.
The bill allows ‘persons with a right or interest in the subject land’ to comment upon the proposed approval of a nomination and declaration of a selected site. It is indicated in the explanatory memorandum, and I am assured by the minister’s office that the phrase ‘persons with a right or interest in the land’ is to be interpreted broadly in accordance with normal administrative law and natural justice principles to mean all persons affected by the proposed approvals and declarations. Second, the bill provides that a failure to comply with the procedural and due process provisions in the proposed legislation, including requirements for consultation with affected communities, will not invalidate nominations or ministerial decisions. Again, I am assured by the minister’s office that these provisions relate only to technical breaches of the procedural and due process provisions and will not permit wholesale abrogation of the right of interested parties to be fully consulted. Further, concerns have been raised that the minister’s absolute discretion in relation to declarations and approvals is not required by the legislation to be constrained or shaped by criteria such as community consent or other scientific, environmental, social, cultural or economic considerations. I am, however, assured that all such considerations will be taken into account in the context of the required assessments under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
I conclude by making the general observation that we should always guard against the notion that remoteness equates to emptiness, which seems to be the view of the member for Canning who said, when speaking on this bill a little earlier today, ‘no-one lives there’. I am not at all suggesting that such a view informs this bill—I know it does not—but it is important to acknowledge that there are people affected by this proposed legislation whose geographical situation means, at the very least, that they tend to have less access to the nerve centres of policy and politics. That makes it critical that we acknowledge that such people have a deep and abiding connection to the land and that they are, and always be will be, entitled to have their views listened to and taken into account.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2011-02-21,"—I rise today during this debate on the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 to express my concerns about the proposed nuclear waste facility at Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory. My opposition to this waste facility is well known and it was a key issue in my electorate during the last election.
I oppose the placement of the proposed nuclear waste facility at Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory. My concerns relate to complaints by some of the traditional owners of a lack of appropriate consultation, and the minister’s failure to adequately respond to the Senate inquiry into the dump laws. The government has also failed to show the respect due to the traditional owners of the land, by not properly consulting them about plans for a nuclear waste dump at Muckaty Station north of Tennant Creek.
I understand that the minister is yet to meet with all of the Aboriginal people who claim an interest in Muckaty Station, or those who claim to be the traditional owners. Minister Ferguson should travel to the Northern Territory and meet them and hear their concerns and the concerns of all Territorians. I believe that the Gillard government is not showing sufficient respect for the views of the Northern Territory community about this issue.
From my perspective, the federal government is ignoring or overriding legislation which was passed in the Northern Territory parliament and which seeks to ban the imposition of nuclear dumps: the Northern Territory Nuclear Waste Transport, Storage and Disposal (Prohibition) Act 2004. Territorians and the people in my electorate want our concerns to be taken seriously and we want a proper consultation process with the local community most impacted by the decision to locate this waste facility at Muckaty Station. I do not believe these are unreasonable requests.
I am a committed team player and a strong supporter of the current leadership of Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop, and yet I must take a different position on this issue because I undertook to my electorate during the last election that I would stand up for them. I remain true to my commitment to the people of my electorate and I remain opposed to this decision.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I rise tonight to speak on the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010. I rise in support of the bill before the House. At the outset, though, I put on the record that I have no time for uranium mining or for the use of uranium as a form of energy source in Australia. So it is odd, in some respects, for me to be talking on a radioactive waste bill but I have been passionately opposed for a very long time to the mining and use of nuclear material because I do not think we have resolved what you do with the waste at the end of the day. This bill articulates the issues around the consequences of using nuclear material. This bill deals with safe, low-level waste. Across Australia there is a substantial amount of it stored in very vulnerable, unsafe situations. The majority of our public and private hospitals probably have some form of low-level nuclear waste sitting in storage somewhere and the people in those buildings do not even know it is there. Nuclear medicine is something that we have fostered, enhanced and utilised in Australia to great effect but the by-product of that nuclear medicine is low-level nuclear waste and at some stage we in Australia must take responsibility for that waste and put it into a storage facility.
This bill is about finally biting the bullet and saying, ‘We are going to have a sensible debate—a sensible discussion—about where that waste will be stored.’ We can procrastinate for yet more and more years. We can have more and more inquiries. We can agree with the Greens and conduct another endless inquiry—as the Senate has done on so many occasions that we are losing count—or we can finally say, ‘Yes, we accept that nuclear waste of low-level radioactive material must be placed somewhere,’ and put it into a safe depository.
Time is of the essence. In 2015-16 material that Australia has sent overseas for processing will be returned. It will be arriving on a ship on our shores sometime soon and it needs to be put somewhere safe. So I want us to have the discussion about where that ‘somewhere safe’ will be.
The act also quite clearly states that a decision that is made about a site is made on a voluntary basis with all natural justice issues being considered. We then go into a four- to five-year process of determining the environmental suitability of the site and ensuring that where the site is established there is community consultation. Once the site is approved there is then another four to five years of legislative framework to go through before a site can be established.
The previous speaker, the member for Solomon, was speaking up for her community and I commend her for that. I think that was a very brave stance. She is standing up for her community but she is a bit misled and a bit misguided, because it was the previous, Howard government that signed the deal with Muckaty Station. That was the deal that the Labor Party determined that we would not quash. We would not enter into an agreement with individuals and ignore that.
But the bill does not say Muckaty Station will become the depository site. It does not actually enact Muckaty Station. It very clearly states, ‘We will again start the process of looking for appropriate sites on a voluntary basis and we will then enter into community consultation.’ Unfortunately, I did not hear the other speakers—I was in the chair upstairs—but I am sure that other people have mentioned that the current Muckaty Station is, in fact, part of a dispute in the courts at this moment, and it would be highly inappropriate for members of parliament to influence that ongoing Federal Court dispute.
We need to at some stage say, ‘Yes, there is somewhere for the waste to go. There is somewhere sensible for the waste to be placed.’ We need to be making that decision so that we can go down the path of community consultation and environmental establishment and not put this off to the never-never on the NIMBY process.
I will be honest. As I said at the outset, I am totally opposed to uranium mining; I am totally opposed to the use of uranium as a form of energy within Australia. But I understand that we have a responsibility to the waste we already have—to manage that appropriately, to place it somewhere sensibly, and to ensure that we enter into a rational dialogue with the individuals who may be exposed to where this site is placed. We cannot put off that debate for ever and ever. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I welcome the opportunity to respond to what has largely been a constructive debate to what is a very important bill, the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010. I begin by thanking the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts for its advisory report into this bill, because it has very much been part of the debate before the House this evening.
As the committee noted, since 2005 radioactive waste management legislation has been the subject of four previous parliamentary inquiries, providing opportunities for consideration of evidence and submissions from members of the public. Members of the public were invited to comment on the bill last year during an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The report notes that ‘the government’s bill has substantially addressed the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee’.
Whilst I will not go into detail on the debate and the contribution by all members, I will spend a little more time responding to the dissenting report of the member for Melbourne and addressing some of the assumptions contained therein, including his contribution to the debate this evening. The honourable member and his party colleagues are playing an old political game. On the one hand they express support for establishing a single national radioactive waste facility and then with the other they erect every conceivable barrier to prevent this realisation. I simply note that the process leading to this bill in Australia commenced in 1988. It is time that we fronted up to our responsibilities.
Based on his dissenting report and subsequent media statements, and reinforced in his contribution this evening, the member for Melbourne does not support the concept of a national radioactive waste facility. For instance, the member for Melbourne suggests that this bill allows the minister to make a decision that is not scientifically informed. The truth is that the bill’s framework is solidly underpinned by sound science. In 2009, extensive biophysical studies were completed and presented to the government by Parsons Brinckerhoff on the current nominated site.
Under the bill, similarly detailed site studies will be conducted for any other land nominated and being seriously considered as a site before any ministerial decision to select a site for full regulatory assessment. Any selected site would be referred for assessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The facility will be subject to regulatory requirements of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 as well as those of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. The bill ensures that these fundamental requirements are not bypassed—nor should they be. Against this framework and given the undoubted intelligence of the member for Melbourne, it is tempting to conclude that ‘sound science’ is simply a euphemism for an outcome that he agrees with.
The member for Melbourne’s dissenting report also suggests that there is something inherently wrong with the Commonwealth passing laws within its legislative competence that are inconsistent with or contrary to state legislation. This is not a view of the writers of our Constitution, who made specific provision in section 109 to allow for the supremacy of this parliament’s laws. Some examples, for the information of the member for Melbourne, of Commonwealth legislation overriding state law are the Native Title Act, the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act and, of course, the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. Perhaps the honourable member for Melbourne could raise the repeal of these acts, particularly the latter, in his next party room meeting! Perhaps he now wants the Franklin River dam to actually be built!
It makes sense that these overriding provisions operate only to the extent necessary for the facility to be established and to operate as intended. Surely it is appropriate that an Australian government facility intended to benefit the whole of Australia should be regulated through Commonwealth laws and no single state and territory law should have the capacity to frustrate a benefit going to all others. The fact is that the member for Melbourne and his colleagues erect these straw men as arguments because of their ideological opposition to all things nuclear.
Perhaps, in terms of his argument about whether or not the Commonwealth should override state laws, he should also have a more detailed discussion with the member for Denison on his desire for the Commonwealth to legislate with respect to potentially overriding state and territory laws on the issue of gambling in Australia—proposed legislation supported by the Greens party room.
Need I point out that around 500,000 patients annually benefit from radio isotopes in medical procedures such as cancer diagnosis and treatment. Australians, including the Greens and the member for Melbourne, are responsible for creating nuclear waste from the use of mobile phones, iPods and computers. Accepting the benefit of these technologies means that we are all responsible for finding a safe location based on science to store Australia’s nuclear waste. As a community, we have failed miserably in this endeavour since 1988. As a 2010 Victorian Auditor-General’s report into hazardous waste stated:
… there is little assurance that hazardous waste is stored and disposed of appropriately.
The bill the government has introduced is aimed at ensuring that radioactive waste from the production and use of nuclear medicine and other essential applications is managed properly, subject to full scientific assessment and regulatory approvals. On this point, I also reinforce to this House that the intended facility will only store radioactive waste generated, possessed or controlled by the Commonwealth of Australia or a Commonwealth entity—no other country’s waste. The law of Australia prevents Australia from storing the waste of any other country.
In terms of the issue of Victoria, I simply say that the bill that the government has introduced is aimed at ensuring that radioactive waste from the production and use of nuclear medicine is appropriately stored. Indeed, the member for Melbourne ought to be aware of the following facilities in his own electorate, which neighbours my electorate of Batman in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, which use nuclear material in medical and other research: the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, the Royal Children’s Hospital, St Vincent’s Hospital and the University of Melbourne. Radioactive waste is stored at Peter MacCallum, right in the middle of Melbourne, and there is also a significant amount of material at Melbourne university. All four sites produce the same kind of waste, which will be managed under the provisions of this bill. This waste is therefore routinely transported throughout his electorate and many other electorates of the Commonwealth parliament—without, to my knowledge, any demonstrations against it by the honourable member or candidates from his party.
A national radioactive waste management facility is an essential element of a long-term strategy to manage Australia’s radioactive waste. Perhaps the most sensitive issue that has been exploited by the Greens and the Australian Conservation Foundation—who have been hand in glove with the Greens on this issue—has been their opposition to this bill in terms of traditional owners. I remind the House that traditional ownership of land in the Northern Territory is established through processes set out in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Generally, this involves the Aboriginal land commissioner conducting hearings and publishing a report which the relevant land council considers in reaching its conclusions on who are the legitimate traditional owners.
Muckaty is a large cattle station covering 238,000 hectares, with seven clans, each with traditional ownership of a separate and distinct area of land. In relation to the land presently nominated as a site for the national radioactive waste facility, following the well-accepted process I have outlined, the Northern Land Council concluded in 2007 that the traditional owners were the Ngapa clan. Under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act only traditional owners are empowered to consent to third party use of Aboriginal land. This was the basis on which approval has previously been given by groups other than the Ngapa people for a railway, a gas pipeline and mining projects on Muckaty Station.
Contrary to the suggestion by the Australian Greens and the ACF, it is inconsistent with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act to suggest that all traditional-land-owning groups on Muckaty Station must give their consent for all decisions about third party use of land on Muckaty Station. Against this background, it would clearly be inappropriate for a minister to treat a group of Indigenous people as traditional owners of a particular piece of land when an independent land council has made a different decision. One might say that it also flies in the face of Indigenous self-determination, something we on this side of the House long fought for.
I remind the House that there are Federal Court proceedings challenging the Northern Land Council’s consultation with traditional owners in nominating the land. I cannot speak for the honourable member for Melbourne, but the Gillard government will accept the court’s decision on this matter. However, we do know that throughout these court proceedings the Greens have consistently suggested that the Northern Land Council have got the wrong traditional owners and that the right traditional owners were not consulted. To present this as a matter of fact is to pre-empt the Federal Court’s decision.
As a former member of the Melbourne bar and officer of the court, the member for Melbourne should know it is unethical to pre-empt a decision of the court for political gain. It speaks volumes about the nature of his political ethics and those of the Greens and the ACF that each feel they can legitimately pick and choose who is and who is not a traditional owner. In the Labor Party we do not pick and choose traditional owners to suit our political circumstances or campaigns we seek to pursue for short-term political gain. We respect due process. We respect land councils. We respect Indigenous self-determination, which is facilitated by the Northern Land Council. The Greens respect only those that agree with them.
In conclusion, this bill will allow for the siting, construction and operation of a radioactive waste management facility. The legislative framework is based on volunteerism in identifying a site. Establishing the facility will be conditional on comprehensive environmental and other regulatory approval processes. These are conducted independent of the project proponents and ensure Australia adheres to international best practice. In commending the bill to the House, I indicate to the House that the government opposes the second reading amendment of the member for Melbourne.
If I were to undertake consultation as the minister at the present time, it would have to be pursuant to the terms of the existing act, which we seek to repeal this evening. I am not prepared to enter into negotiations with third parties on the basis of an act that does not allow procedural fairness and other protections, and whilst the Federal Court is considering issues associated with the determination of traditional ownership and the site nomination of the Ngapa. As I have indicated on many occasions, I await and will respect the Federal Court decision. As soon as this bill is passed and litigation concludes, I will consult widely with the parties that have rights, interests or legitimate expectations with respect to any nomination.
In actual fact, this bill for the first time gives me as the minister potential to actually consult beyond the traditional owners with what could be broadly described as affected parties. That capacity does not currently exist in terms of the act that operates with respect to the issue of siting a nuclear repository in Australia at the moment. Indeed, unlike the Howard government’s legislation that we are seeking to repeal, this bill will enable those consultations to occur subject to judicial review and procedural fairness.
Can I also say in response to some of the contributions that this debate is not about nuclear power; it is about our basic and fundamental responsibility to meet our international obligations to establish a single national nuclear repository in Australia in accordance with our international obligations.

Mr Wilkie interjecting—

Mr Bandt interjecting—
—Yes, the interventions speak in terms of what I regard as the rampant hypocrisy of the member for Melbourne, time and time again seeking to pursue short-term political activities using traditional owners to suit his own short-term political needs. He stands condemned. It is time for the Australian parliament to front up to its responsibilities and to actually ensure that we store our waste, which is basically used to look after the health and wellbeing of Australians, with half a million Australians per year benefiting from nuclear medicine. I commend the bill to the House and reject the amendment moved by the member for Melbourne.
 (Ms K Livermore)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Melbourne has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing 133(b) the division is deferred until 8 pm.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—by leave—I move:
That the time and order of business for the sitting tomorrow, Tuesday, 22 February 2011, be as follows, unless otherwise ordered:
the House, at its rising, adjourn until tomorrow at 12 noon;
government business have priority from 12 noon until 2 pm and from 9.30 pm until 10.30 pm; and
during the period from 12 noon until 2 pm any division on a question called for in the House, other than on a motion moved by a Minister, shall stand deferred until the conclusion of the discussion of a matter of public importance.
Speaking briefly to that, I do this as a courtesy to the House so that all members can be informed. I inform the House that tomorrow at 12 noon debate will recommence on the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011. This is important legislation which is a priority for this government and a priority particularly for those Queenslanders who need Queensland to be rebuilt, along with those who have been affected by the other natural disasters over the summer. In order to increase the time of the sitting, whilst minimising the extra sitting late at night, this is an appropriate measure.
I can inform the House that, in order to make up for the cancellation of the adjournment debate tomorrow night in this chamber—debate will continue on the flood reconstruction levy legislation until 10.30 pm and there will then be no adjournment debate, so the House will finish at its ordinary sitting time—there will be a one-hour adjournment in the Main Committee, which will balance up that change. This has been agreed to by the Manager of Opposition Business, and I thank him for his cooperation on this matter. There is a need for the government to have this legislation passed this week. We will endeavour to not have the parliament sit late on Wednesday night in order to pass this legislation, but we will do what is necessary to ensure that that can indeed be carried, because this is legislation which is vital for the interests of Queensland in particular and, I think, the interests of Australians who want to see us getting on with the job of reconstruction.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
This bill amends the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005. It allows the setting of additional criteria for registration of a product under the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme. To understand the context of the proposed changes I will first give an overview of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme (known as the WELS Scheme).
The scheme was established by the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005 and is part of the COAG agreed National Water Initiative. The WELS Scheme is also supported by complementary state and territory legislation to ensure comprehensive national coverage.
The WELS scheme’s objectives are to:
Conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption;
Provide information for purchasers of water-use and water-saving products; and
Promote the adoption of efficient and effective water-use and water saving technologies.
The scheme aims to achieve these objectives by requiring that all water using products specified under the scheme are registered and labelled to indicate their assessed water efficiency when offered for sale. The labels indicate the water efficiency rating of a product, on a scale from zero to six stars, with six stars being for the most efficient products. The labels inform purchasing decisions in the same way as energy rating labels on electrical appliances.
The minister determines which products are WELS products, and the standard to be met by them. I will now briefly explain the origins and intent of this bill.
While plumbing products included under the WELS determination are subject to the WELS Scheme, these plumbing products are also subject to the WaterMark certification scheme which operates under normal state and territory plumbing regulation.
WaterMark testing and certification is intended to ensure that products are fit for use and will not threaten the safety of the reticulated water supply. WaterMark certification is required before a plumbing product can be legally installed, while WELS registration and labelling is required before a WELS product can be legally sold.
This regulatory difference means that in some cases consumers can unknowingly purchase plumbing products that, while legally available, are not able to be legally installed. In addition, the presence of WELS labels on products which are not WaterMark certified may be misconstrued by consumers as suggesting that the products are broadly government endorsed and are fit for use. The proposed change to the scheme will remove this potential source of discredit to the WELS Scheme.
In 2007, following an extensive public inquiry, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage recommended in its report Managing the flow: regulating plumbing product quality in Australia that the Australian government:
… make the necessary legislative changes to establish WaterMark Certification as a prerequisite for compliance with the Water Efficiency Labelling Standards Scheme.
The government agreed in principle, subject to further examination as to how the recommendation could be most efficiently and effectively implemented. The government also wished to avoid inappropriately expanding the Australian government’s responsibilities relating to plumbing regulation. Following subsequent examination of these issues, I and the government are satisfied that the committee’s objectives can be achieved through this proposal.
The proposed amendment will introduce a general provision enabling additional plumbing requirements, such as those established by the states and territories, to be included in the WELS Scheme by ministerial determination.
Once the bill is enacted, a determination made under that provision will make WaterMark certification a prerequisite for all plumbing products required to be registered under the WELS Act.
The industry strongly supports this amendment, which will provide positive outcomes for consumers and plumbers, with only minimal impacts on the requirements for WELS registrants. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—In addressing the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment Bill 2010 I want to put the issue of water management into a broader context. The coalition has a proud role in having been the authors, the progenitors, and I was fortunate enough to have had a role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage at the time of the creation, development and passage of this bill. This bill and the notion of urban water efficiency fit into the three-taps approach which we take to water conservation and management in Australia.
The first of those taps is in relation to water efficiency. Water efficiency can be either urban—mostly the subject of this bill—or rural. I will deal with those two elements in a minute. The second of the taps is in relation to stormwater reuse and recycling. The third is in relation to the capture, management and harvesting of water in times of flood so as to ration that water for use in times of drought and to mitigate floods. Those three taps—water efficiency, stormwater capture and recycling and the potential for new dams—represent the essence and the heart of what we want to achieve with water conservation and management in Australia through Commonwealth action. The first of those goes to the heart of this bill.
This bill relates to water efficiency labelling and standards. In 2005, the coalition created the world’s first national Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme, the WELS Scheme. That dealt with water efficiency labels on shower heads, washing machines, toilets, dishwashers, urinals and taps. These labels give consumers a relatively easy-to-understand set of star ratings and water consumption information on the water efficiency of different products. The scheme has been widely supported through industry, though some view that the scheme has not been sufficiently stringent in dealing with noncompliant products—and I understand that. The 2007 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage review of plumbing standards found that the committee ‘shared HIA’s optimistic view that the WELS Scheme is an important step towards a nationally consistent water product labelling scheme’.
In addition, the WaterMark certification is a trademark owned by Standards Australia. Licensed plumbers are generally obligated to install only plumbing equipment which has WaterMark certification. We recognise that the overlap between the WELS Scheme and the WaterMark certification has caused some inconsistencies, and this bill seeks to overcome that problem by allowing the minister to make a requirement for the WELS registration to have WaterMark certification, simplifies the matter by ending the duplication problem and there is widespread support for it. This was a recommendation of the 2007 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage review of plumbing standards. In particular, Dr Mal Washer, the member for Moore, on our side has been instrumental in bringing these ideas to the fore, ensuring that they are on the public record and that there is generally bipartisan support. I acknowledge his role and accept that this is an area of common action with the government.
In the context of our three-taps approach, I note that, whereas there is strong agreement on this bill, there is deep disappointment that the national replumbing of rural Australia, which was championed with $5.7 billion under the previous government, has largely ossified under the current regime. There has been delay, denial and rejection of serious attempts to upgrade Australia’s irrigation infrastructure with potentially 600 or 700 billion litres of water savings per annum going begging as a result, whether for the Murray irrigation area, Coleambally, the farmers of Bourke or the farmers of the Murray-Darling Basin region of southern Queensland. There are areas throughout the Murray-Darling Basin where farmers have put together proposals which have been denied. In particular—and the member for Farrer is here—the Menindee Lakes project has been waiting for three years to begin. It was ready, it was on the table and it should have been upgraded and begun.
Having said that leads me to the second of the areas which constitute our three taps, and that is stormwater harvesting and recycling. Both of these are areas primarily of state jurisdiction, but for which there needs to be Commonwealth leadership. There has been very little done in South Australia, which has enormous stormwater harvesting potential, as is the case in Victoria.
We then move to the recycling component of that, and that is an element of personal passion. Whether it is the Gunnamatta outfall, which has recently been the subject of a commitment to close by the new Baillieu government in Victoria, or the hundreds of outfalls around Australia, this is a wasted resource. It is a source of pollution, and this is the moment in history when we should be gathering that water, recycling it and using it for industry and agriculture rather than using drinking water when a viable alternative is available.
Finally, we capture our water in dams. Our population has almost doubled since we had any serious work on dams over 35 years ago. Certainly on the eastern seaboard there has not been a major new dam in over 20 years, and we have had significant population growth. We need to look carefully at those places which could feasibly and environmentally be seen as places for capturing and storing water. The most likely option is the expansion of existing dam sites. That is a sensible way to go, and allows us to capture water in times of flood, to mitigate those flood actions—where possible—and to use that water in times of scarcity. That is what has always happened; it is what should happen and we should not be afraid of addressing an issue which is about ensuring that we have the adequate supply of water for the population that is real and in place in Australia today.
Having said that, we support this bill; we thank the government for their cooperation and we will offer it safe and swift passage.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment Bill 2010 amends the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005. It allows the setting of additional criteria for registration of a product under the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme.
The scheme was established by the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005 and is part of the COAG agreed National Water Initiative. The WELS scheme is also supported by comprehensive state and territory legislation to ensure national coverage.
The WELS scheme’s objectives are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for purchasers of water use and water-saving products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use and water-saving technologies. They are pretty good aims and objectives. The scheme aims to achieve these objectives by requiring that all water-using products specified under the scheme are registered and labelled to indicate their assessed water efficiency when offered for sale. The labels indicate the water efficiency rating of a product, on a scale from zero to six stars, with six stars being for the most efficient products.
The labels inform purchasing decisions in the same way as energy-rating labels on electrical appliances. Once enacted it is intended that the minister will determine the WaterMark Certification which will be required for the WELS registration. This will implement recommendation 2 of the House of Representatives inquiry report, Managing the flow: regulating plumbing product quality. The bill’s potential impact, however, is not limited to this proposed action.
Water conservation is becoming much easier with a number of gadgets—if I can use that term—coming onto the market as people try to save water as there is now a price on water use. It is certainly getting people to focus on how much water they use and to find products which can assist them. In fact, a number of people have brought pieces of equipment to my office to show what can be done to reduce water usage, particularly in our greywater systems.
For instance, a new idea was brought to me by Toby Meredith, who used to be one of my constituents and who has now moved into Hobart. He has been working with friends, David Fisher and Quentin Davenport, who invented the Drainwave. You may remember seeing them on The New Inventors on 18 November in 2009. They realised that although the installation of low-flow toilets has greatly reduced our water consumption, this positive outcome has had an unintended consequence: increasingly damaging our sewerage system, which is designed for significantly higher flush volumes.
This new idea, as I said, is called Drainwave, and it allows world’s best practice in flow fixtures to be installed without having any detrimental effect on plumbing systems. Using two inlet ports, the Drainwave collects greywater from general household use—sink, shower, washing machine et cetera—and combines this outside the house with blackwater from the toilet. When the water reaches 9.5 litres, the Drainwave self-activates to release a batch of water, which surges through the pipe network to the main sewer line to minimise blockages. The invention repeats the process between 16 and 34 times a day per person. It is an ingenious way of saving water, while making sure there are no blockages.
That is just one idea, and there are many others coming through to help people save water domestically. It is important that there are some regulations so as to know what exactly has been approved, for what use and to ensure the ideas perform in the way that they are supposed to and consumers get what they are paying for. The bill will help us achieve those goals. It would be good to see local government ensure that they start being more proactive in their water measurements. I know that there are some councils in Tasmania that still do not have water meters attached to their systems. Though the councils were the ones that failed to put those meters in place, there are now three authorities in the state which have to take over that work. It is hard to get the big picture of water use in different catchments and different cities without having some uniform measurements of water. We are still grappling with this in our country. We still need to do this, and there are all sorts of arguments being used as to why we should not. You only have to read the Mercury newspaper over the last couple of months to see that.
There are systems being developed to not only measure precipitation, water flows and domestic and industrial water use; there are also models one can use to measure different water uses and their runoffs, how much gets retained and how much is returned to the watertable. During the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industry and Resources inquiry into farming the future, we had representation from the Murray Irrigators Support Group regarding an invention by John Padman, called the ‘Padman Stop’, which is a 100 per cent watertight control structure used in conjunction with a fast watering system, also called low-energy irrigation, developed by the same inventor. As the report said, in the trial sites it was demonstrated that it is possible to control water application fairly accurately onto the bay, where it flows, and to achieve the highest efficiency possible. More research is being undertaken on application rates and frequency of irrigation. These sorts of schemes are vital knowledge that we need if we are to deal with the climate change scenarios that we have had presented to us.
These days you cannot just build a dam on a farm and think you have water storage. There are many aspects of water saving. They may include drip irrigation, measurement of soil water flows and even the takeup of water by different crops. So when we are considering these aspects of water savings, there must be an overall strategy to help all the different users of water to save or reuse the water they are allocated. There are many opportunities in this area, and into the future we must make sure that we have the proper processes and that people know what they are getting for their money. During the inspections of the committee, it was very interesting to note the amount of work going on in trying to minimise the effects of climate change, possible future droughts and any other natural or man-made changes to our lifestyles. We need to continue to reduce the amount of water we use for production or we will have to increase production with less water—great challenges for us as a nation. I am sure that we can get there by being innovative and using the intellects and the capacities that we have in our nation.
This legislation allows many of these inventions and new ideas to be assessed properly and given some efficiency tag that will allow inventions to gain value by being properly assessed for their efficiency. I support the bill.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I too rise to contribute to this debate on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment Bill 2010. There is probably no bigger demand in Australia than for water use efficiency, whether it is a case of urban consumption or food production. Of course, we also use an enormous amount of water in our mining activity, and where would we be without some of our freshwater fishing? The issue in Australia, as we face some of the biggest floods in European history in this country, is that we have an overabundance of water in some parts of the country from time to time but scarcity of water is in fact usually the order of the day in the most populated parts of the country. Therefore, one of the first things our pioneers set out to do was to make sure that there was enough water secured in various reservoirs and dams to tide us over when there was less rainfall. Australia therefore has, per capita, some of the highest levels of water stored in the world.
This particular bill is a very well-aimed attempt to make sure that a consumer can choose a product that they can be quite comfortable with in terms of its level of water consumption, whether it is a water-saving product or a water guzzler. However, there have been some complications over the years in trying to make sure the consumer has good information about the product. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, which met in 2007, had an extensive public inquiry and determined that there needed to be necessary changes to establish Watermark certification as a prerequisite for compliance with the WELS scheme. WELS, of course, stands for Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards.
There had been a complication where one of these means of certification was confused with the other, so we now have a situation where Watermark testing and certification—while it is intended to ensure that products are fit for use and will not threaten the safety of the reticulated water supply—are required before a plumbing product can be legally installed, while WELS registration and labelling is required before a WELS product can be legally sold. This regulatory difference means that in some cases consumers can unknowingly purchase plumbing products that, while legally available, are not able to be legally installed. The proposed changes to this scheme remove this potential source of confusion and potential discrediting of the WELS scheme, so it is a sensible move to sort things out and let the consumer be as fully informed as they need to be. I need to say, though, that we need to extend this capacity for consumers to understand the water savings of a product they buy.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I move:
That this House:
notes that:
Australia has an ageing population;
age discrimination exists within Australia and that this discrimination impacts on the strength of society, economy and the lives of older Australians;
ageing should not only be considered as an economic and social cost to government, rather, the positives of an older population should be recognised and promoted by government;
all older Australians deserve to live with dignity; and
the knowledge, life experience and skills of older people provide enormous benefit to Australia and the social fabric of the nation;
acknowledges that:
older workers have the ability to make an enormous contribution to the economic prosperity of Australia;
most volunteer work is undertaken by older Australians and provides an enormous economic social contribution to Australia; and
older Australians provide an enormous amount of child care which provides economic value to the nation; and
calls on the Government to consider:
new and innovative approaches to engage older Australians and address their needs;
encouraging Government departments to introduce senior friendly practices, such as dedicated seniors phone lines and customer service officers;
aged care accounts for all workers to fund their needs as they become older; and
highlighting and promoting the advantage of employing older workers.
Australia has an ageing population. It is not a phenomenon restricted to Australia—rather, it is a phenomenon that is being experienced by most developed countries. The general response is one of despair and hysteria at the cost of an ageing population and its impost on a country’s GDP. In Australia we have two reports that looked at our ageing population. The first was the Intergenerational report delivered in conjunction with the 2002-03 budget and the second was included in the Australia to 2050: future challenges report. Both reports highlight the cost associated with an ageing population, but neither discuss possible benefits.
In the Intergenerational report one of the first points that was made was that a steadily ageing population is likely to continue to place significant pressure on Commonwealth government finances. That shows right from the outset that the approach of the Howard government at that stage was towards looking at the cost, removing that cost and dealing with that cost.
Similarly, Australia to 2050: future challenges identifies ageing with spending pressures. It states, ‘Ageing of the Australian population will contribute to substantial pressures on government spending over the next 40 years.’ It goes on to project an increase to 27.1 per cent of GDP in 2049-50 on ageing related spending. It continues along the same lines as those of previous governments, highlighting the costs to Australia of an ageing population. It talks about issues such as health spending associated with an ageing population as well as other aspects that relate to it such as aged care spending.
I then looked at the Productivity Commission’s report Economic implications of an ageing Australia. Apart from a section on volunteering, it also concentrates on the cost to Australia of an ageing population. It talks about the percentage of Australians who will be over the age of 65 by 2044-45 and looked at the fact that improved life expectancy and control over our fertility was contributing to this ageing population. After reading all the reports that I managed to get my hands on, I could be forgiven for thinking that Australians being healthier and living longer is actually something that should be avoided. I mentioned that the Productivity Commission’s report referred to the fact that volunteering did make a contribution to our economy. It mentions the figure of $21 billion to $30 billion for volunteer work done within the community. The majority of volunteer work is performed by people over the age of 45. If you factor in the informal childcare arrangements, that figure goes up to $42 billion—quite a significant contribution.
It is little wonder, given these reports and the general attitude that exists, that ageism and age discrimination have become rampant in Australia. As a nation, we tend to look at negatives instead of promoting positives. I congratulate the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, and the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, for the creation of a full-time commissioner for age discrimination. This is the first step in addressing age discrimination. Ageism and age discrimination are very subtle. They are hidden barriers that work as major disincentives to older Australians continuing in paid employment and being able to enjoy the life choices and quality of life enjoyed by other Australians.
Ageism is based on stereotypes and so entrenched in our society that it is accepted as the norm. Young people are vital, vibrant, creative—what we all aspire to be. Industry advertising is based on making people look younger, whilst mature members of our society are portrayed as tired, worn out, inflexible and not having anything to offer. Implicit in this is the concept that young is good and something we should all aspire to, whilst old is bad and something that we want to avoid. When the new member for Longman was elected at the age of 20, it was hailed as a new era in politics. I wonder how the election of an 80-year-old to parliament would have been received. I suspect it would have got the opposite response. The COTA website lists some of the myths and realities about ageing, and I will share some of these with the House tonight. They include the following:
MYTH Ageing equals sickness, disability and dementia.
REALITY Two out of three people aged 65 years and over rate their health as good to excellent.
MYTH Older people are a burden on society.
REALITY 80% of people 70 years and over live independently without help from care services.
MYTH The ageing of the population is a looming crisis.
REALITY People are living longer, many enjoying an active and healthy older age.
The list of myths goes on, and I will seek to table it at the end of my speech. The challenge for our society is to put aside these myths and address this discrimination. I have worked to utilise and harness the valuable resources senior Australians offer our nation. The starting point is to end discrimination in the workplace. The majority of age discrimination complaints received by the Human Rights Commission in 2008-09 related to employment, and most of those related to the employment of people over the age of 45. It is important to note that unemployment is the greatest cause of poverty; so by denying employment to older Australians you are denying them financial security.
The ageist culture that exists in Australia makes it possible for employers and recruiters to discriminate against older workers. Recruiting companies usually place in employment workers under the age of 45. The employees of those companies invariably screen out mature workers, and this means that employers do not even get the opportunity to consider older workers. Older workers are deemed to have outdated work skills, to be unable to learn new skills, to be overqualified and too experienced, to be inefficient and to be at risk of developing a disability—which in turn is another form of discrimination.
I refer members to a paper published by the Australian Human Rights Commission titled Age discrimination—exposing the hidden barrier for mature age workers, as it details the issue more graphically. The government recognises that Australia is not harnessing the skills and the expertise of mature workers, and this recognition along with the appointment of an age discrimination commissioner are vital steps that will address the needs of older Australians. In the lead-up to the last election, the government committed to introducing a new, improved work bonus. This legislation has been introduced into the parliament, and the new, improved work bonus will commence on 1 July. The government has also delivered pension reforms, and in the lead-up to the last election it made a number of commitments to older Australians.
As our society ages, Australia needs to look at new and innovative ways to meet the needs of senior Australians. It is imperative that we develop a system that will ensure the long-term financial security of older Australians, which means greater emphasis on employment, superannuation and other financial initiatives. The long-term viability of our aged-care sector needs to be addressed and initiatives such as aged-care accounts, similar to the social insurance scheme that operates in Germany, should be considered. The establishment of dedicated lines for seniors in government departments has been successful in other jurisdictions and is worthy of investigation. There is a need for a government campaign to address ageism in our society and this needs to be included in our education system. It needs to be looked at from preschool to universities, where our doctors, lawyers and social workers are trained. They need to rid themselves of negative stereotypes. Finally, I would like to see Australia lead the push for a binding international agreement that deals specifically with the rights of older people.
 (Mr S Georganas)—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Older Australians</title>,Private Members' Business,29,1
"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I second the motion. I congratulate the member for Shortland for bringing this motion to the House. I know her passion for the seniors in our society is strong. It is great that we share a role in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, as we do with the member for Hindmarsh, who is sitting in the chair at the moment. It is great to be able to rise tonight and speak to this motion. Obviously, as the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I am pleased to speak on this motion. It provides a welcome reminder of the crucial role that seniors play in Australian society.
Australia has an ageing population. There is no doubt about that. The 2010 Intergenerational report, produced by Treasury last year, shows that Australia’s population of over 65s is set to increase from three million in 2010 to 8.1 million in 2050. Proportionally, this represents an increase from 13.5 per cent to 22.7 per cent. Almost one-quarter of Australians will be aged over 65 by 2050, and this should focus the attention of all members in this place. I think all of us would agree that the government’s current systems and structures are not capable of coping with such change. We are running out of time to get the structures in place. The demographic change is happening now. The Intergenerational report shows that by 2020 there will be an extra 1.2 million seniors and the proportion of over 65s will rise to 16.4 per cent of the total Australian population. We must prepare now. That is why I have kept a close eye on this government’s policies on ageing and, in particular, its aged-care policies.
It is important to discuss aged care when considering this motion because pressure on the aged-care system is perhaps one of the most talked about consequences of our ageing population. The distinction between community and residential aged-care concerns, as outlined in Grant Thornton’s Aged care survey, is well known and understood by the public. Most of my constituents tell me that they want to stay in their homes for as long as possible. I think the Howard government recognised this, acknowledging that the investment in community based aged care was as important as investment in residential aged care. Residential aged care is usually divided into low care and high care.
For a long time, controversy has surrounded the subject of issuing bonds for aged residential care. The recent crisis has stemmed from the fact that the government funding mechanism for residential beds no longer reflects the real cost of providing a bed in the 21st century. Year after year, government bed offers remain unallocated despite unprecedented demand for beds. This is because aged-care providers simply cannot afford to provide even basic care at the government subsidy rate. The situation is worrying seniors across my electorate of Swan and, I am sure, across most of Australia.
Recently an aged-care provider in my electorate, Swan Care, circulated a petition calling for residents to let Canberra know about the right of Australians to quality care. I support this petition and am pleased it has had a good response from residents in Victoria Park in the heart of my electorate of Swan. I understand this petition is currently with the Petitions Committee and the government will soon be required to respond.
Whilst there is certainly plenty for the government to do in relation to aged care, we must resist seeing an ageing population as a challenge or a problem. Instead we should see it as an opportunity. In the Intergenerational report the government used negative language, seeing seniors as a burden and a challenge that the government must find a solution to. We in the coalition take a different approach. We believe that people living longer and healthier lives should be a cause for celebration. Far from being a burden, all seniors are taxpayers, paying the GST and many other hidden taxes, and continue to contribute to the economy and to the welfare of all Australians. I note that the member moving this motion has acknowledged that the positives of an older population should be recognised and promoted by the government and I congratulate her for that.
The second part of this motion acknowledges the potential of older Australians to provide an enormous contribution to the economic prosperity of Australia. There are many seniors in my electorate of Swan that continue to work after the retirement age. This is commendable and a sign of things to come as we live longer and healthier lives. The Assistant Treasurer is in the House tonight. One of the things that many of the seniors in my electorate talk to me about is the fact that there is a disincentive for them to do part-time work. That is something that perhaps the Assistant Treasurer could look at. Seniors avoid doing work at universities and schools at exam times because of the penalties they face after earning a certain income over a certain amount of time. That work is not being done by seniors who are quite capable of doing it. I get the sense that many seniors do not re-enter the workforce, however much they might want to, because of a combination of age discrimination and regulations, which I just spoke about.
Age discrimination is a genuine problem that requires a genuine solution. During the 2010 election, the coalition announced the seniors employment incentive payment policy—a good initiative to tackle age discrimination in the workplace. The policy would provide a one-off payment to employees to help overcome their initial reluctance to appoint older job seekers. This was a genuine attempt to tackle age discrimination. The coalition should rightly take some credit for taking this proposal to the electorate and the government should take note of it.
Most members in this place would agree that if seniors want to work and contribute to Australian society they should be free and able to do so. Many retired people say to me that they are reluctant to get involved in the workplace again, however much they want to, for fear of losing their entitlements. This means that in some circumstances it makes no economic sense for some seniors to contribute to the workforce, even if they are available and willing to do so. At a time when skills shortages loom again, this seems a great shame. An example of what we could be missing comes from the work of Inge Dahners, a lady I nominated for the WA Senior of the Year awards. Inge’s efforts working for Southcare in Manning earned her the runner-up award. I also spent time with Maggie Richardson, who won a seniors award last year. Maggie is an important contributor to the local communities and associations in my electorate. The member for Shortland spoke about the value of volunteer work by the seniors in our population.
The overall complexity of the government system is a point that the member for Shortland has also picked up on, with part of her motion suggesting that the government consider aged-care accountants for all workers to fund their needs as they become older. This may well be a good idea: many elderly people come to my office for help in completing government forms. The complexity of getting older is perhaps something that the parliament needs to address.
The motion goes on to acknowledge that most volunteer work is undertaken by older Australians and recognises that seniors provide a significant amount of child care to the nation. Both these points are valid, especially within my electorate of Swan. As the federal member, I am fortunate to be able to visit many voluntary and charitable organisations in the electorate. The majority of the volunteers who put in the hard yards at these organisations are seniors. In fact, it would be fair to say that many voluntary organisations would not be able to function without seniors. It is certainly true that seniors play an important role with child care as well. This is plain to see at meetings of the Grandcare group, which supports grandparents who, for one reason or another, have the duty of raising their grandchildren. I always try to attend their events and am always impressed by their absolute and unquestionable dedication. Grandparents who have taken on the role of parenthood, some of whom are in their 60s and 70s, are not compensated by either the state or federal government.
In conclusion, I thank the member for Shortland for putting this motion before the House. Barring an unprecedented baby boom, Australia’s population is going to age. The fact that people are living longer and healthier lives should be a matter for celebration. However, we must plan for the future to ensure that all older Australians can live fulfilling and active lives and, most importantly, can live with dignity. I call on the government to provide this to senior Australians in my electorate of Swan and across Australia.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Older Australians</title>,Private Members' Business,29,1
"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I thank the member for Shortland for moving this motion on older Australians. We share a common border in some communities that contain some very impressive and dedicated aged communities. I also commend the member for Swan for his contribution. He is a man of great compassion and always makes a good contribution to debates on these types of issues and he did so again today.
My electorate is what Australia is going to be like in 20 years time. Over 25 per cent of the population in my electorate is over 65 years of age. So much of the debate that we hear in the media and in public about generational change and what is going to happen in the future is already happening on the Central Coast of New South Wales. We have some experience of that in fact. The Dean of the University of Newcastle medical school told me that our area is ripe for study by medical schools for the very reason that it is what Australia will look like in the future. The sorts of issues and problems we have in health care and aged care on the Central Coast can be studied because it mirrors the Australia of the future.
Before I get on to a little bit more detail about some of the issues that affect my electorate specifically, I will talk about federal Labor’s record. The member for Swan expressed some disappointment with this government’s performance, and I am a little bit disappointed in him about that. I think he should have been a bit more charitable, because this government has always stood for fairness for older Australians and has done more for older Australians in three years than the previous government did in 12. The Gillard Labor government is committed to a strong and secure economy so it can provide services such as world-class hospitals and aged-care facilities for older Australians. In relation to aged care funding, for example, the level of funding per resident has grown significantly faster than CPI due to indexation and policy changes. There has been a three per cent average annual increase in CPI—6.3 per cent average annual increases in funding per resident from all sources—over the last three years, but there has been a 20.1 per cent increase in income per resident over the last three years. We have put our money where our policy mouth is and made sure that those who are in aged care are being looked after and are being provided with more money than they were in the past.
We have also delivered one of the biggest reforms to the age pension in more than 100 years. Over the last year, our pension reforms have driven increases for pensioners: the age pension is now worth an extra $100 a fortnight for a single pensioner and an extra $74 for couples combined. We increased the utilities allowance by around $400 to provide support for the increasing cost of gas, water and electricity. New pension indexation arrangements will make sure that the pension keeps pace with the cost of living. Federal Labor has increased the single pension from 25 per cent to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings and will keep the benchmark at this higher level. We have introduced a new pensioner living costs index. Our changes are affordable and sustainable. The Commonwealth seniors card was introduced by a former federal Labor government, and the Gillard Labor government has continued to deliver for self-funded retirees. We have delivered a new seniors supplement for self-funded retirees who have a Commonwealth seniors card, now worth $795 a year. We have also delivered a national transport concession scheme to give state senior cardholders concessions when they travel interstate and provide more senior access to free internet in their community through a national rollout of our broadband seniors program. As part of our economic plan, Labor will also give seniors a tax break on savings accounts. A new, 50 per cent discount on up to $1,000 of interest earned by individuals, including interest earned on deposits held in banks, building societies, credit unions and annuity products, will benefit around 740,000 self-funded retirees and age pensioners.
To help mature age workers save for their retirement, federal Labor will allow individuals aged 50 and over with total superannuation balances below $500,000 to make up to $50,000 per annum in concessional superannuation contributions. This will start on 1 July 2012, and doubles the cap of $25,000 which was scheduled to apply. Federal Labor has also acted decisively to protect self-funded retirees from the full impact of the global financial crisis, providing draw-down relief for three consecutive years as well as economic stimulus payments.
When you compare that to the coalition’s record, you find the comments from the member for Swan quite surprising. The coalition failed to increase the base pension beyond indexation in 12 years. The Leader of the Opposition and the cabinet of the former coalition government actively rejected a proposal to increase the single age pension. When he was shadow minister, Tony Abbott said he thought federal Labor’s pension increase was not affordable—but he will make pensioners pay more for their groceries to pay for his unfair paid parental leave scheme. Tony Abbott’s new tax on thousands of Australian companies like supermarkets, petrol stations and power companies will increase prices for pensioners. Tony Abbott will scrap Labor’s reforms to superannuation, including lower fees, tax breaks on savings and incentives for mature age workers that will give more Australians increased support in their retirement.
The member for Swan quite rightly raised the issue of being able to work and earn money and not have that affect the pension—but it is Labor that has delivered in this area. It is an important issue for Australians generally, as our productivity growth has certainly been low in comparison to OECD standards and much lower than it was 10 years ago. Encouraging older Australians to work is important for the economy and provides opportunities for older Australians to contribute and provide valuable expertise in the areas that they seek to work. Many age pensioners take on part-time and occasional work, and they should be encouraged and rewarded for their valuable contributions to our community.
The work bonus allows pensioners to keep more of the money they earn from part-time work. It disregards an amount of employment income from the pension income test. The work bonus was introduced as part of Labor’s 2009 pension reforms. Many age pensioners want to undertake part-time, seasonal or contract work but are concerned about the impact on their pension. From 1 July 2011 the Gillard government will introduce a new, more generous work bonus for age pensioners. It will increase the amount an age pensioner can earn before affecting their pension. The new work bonus will allow age pensioners to earn up to $250 a fortnight without it being assessed as income under the income test. Under these changes, the work bonus can be annualised. This means pensioners will now be able to build up any unused amount of their $250 bonus every fortnight for up to 12 months. This actively encourages and enables more older Australians to work and contribute to the workforce.
In the time remaining I would like to talk about some local issues and particularly pay tribute to the Toukley senior citizens—with whom I know the member for Shortland has also had a very long and close relationship. Toukley used to be in the electorate of Shortland but is now in the electorate of Dobell. Under the stewardship of Bruce Kirkness at the Toukley and District Senior Citizens Club, we have an activity centre that provides a vast range of activities. It gets older Australians out of their houses, contributing to the community and being active, and they are made to feel part of our local community. At one stage the club had more than 5,000 members and was the largest seniors group in the Southern Hemisphere. It still has one of the largest memberships in Australia. The club does a fantastic job for the people of Toukley, Gorokan and the north of my electorate and those in the south of the member for Shortland’s electorate.
This is an important motion. We need to make sure that we provide every opportunity for older Australians to contribute to the Australian economy. We need to make sure that they are not discriminated against, that they have work opportunities and that they can play a part in our local communities. The member for Shortland should be commended for bringing this motion to the House. I seek leave to table a document on behalf of the member for Shortland.
Leave granted.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Older Australians</title>,Private Members' Business,29,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—In speaking to this motion, let me say at the outset how fortunate we are as a parliament that the member for Shortland has seen fit to bring forward this motion. It states some very obvious truths but also encourages our consciences to look at what we as a nation owe to those people who have contributed so much to make sure that our country, Australia, is such a wonderful place in which to live. The member for Shortland highlighted—through a very cleverly worded list of points in her motion—some of the challenges confronting older Australians. I think they are challenges that we collectively, as elected representatives, ought to try to make easier for older Australians to face.
We are as a nation extremely fortunate. We live in relative peace. Most residents are respectful of others and their rights. We have a wonderful lifestyle, and we have a laid-back appreciation for the many good things that we have. Older Australians, in particular, are extremely altruistic. While many of us tend to look at issues on the basis of the hip-pocket nerve, often older Australians will say, ‘This government decision is not good for us personally but it is good for our kids and our grandkids and therefore is good for the country.’ Older Australians have worked hard and have helped to encourage the world to recognise that Australia is a civilised country, a good international citizen and a country which, as the years go on, will play an increasingly important part in the world.
Despite hardships including the global economic crisis and, more recently, the terrible floods and Cyclone Yasi, which have brought real tragedy and hardship into the lives of many, as a nation we still do our best to keep a smile on our faces and look at the bright side of life. All of us would have seen on television the pictures of older Australians who had lived in their communities for their entire lives and who lost everything. We saw how cheerful they were, how optimistic they were and how, while they wanted some government assistance, they did not expect government to do everything for them. Older Australians are role models for younger Australians. They have values, they have standards, they have principles and they have ethics that younger Australians could, on many occasions, do well to emulate.
The tendencies and the characteristics of older Australians are those which we all admire and which make us proud as individuals and as a nation. Of course, we all recognise that one of the challenges that our nation faces is the increasing age of our population. We have a declining birth rate—which is, happily, not quite as declining as it once was—and we have an ageing population. We are also fortunate that we have a lengthening life span, and that, along with modern medicine, brings other challenges and opportunities. It can be extremely expensive for a community to meet the costs of medicine and technology which can prolong life and improve quality of life, but I think that we as a country really ought to do whatever we can, because we are in effect repaying a debt to people who have helped to make this nation as great as it is.
It is often said that compulsory superannuation will solve all of our problems; it will not. Compulsory superannuation will go some way towards meeting the costs of an extended life span, but it is important to recognise that not everyone has the ability to maintain the same standard of living in retirement that they enjoyed during their working lives. The term ‘ageing population’ is well known in discussion circles and in the media, and it is important to see our ageing population not as a problem but as a challenge. We need to make sure that we as a country engage as much as possible the very many talents of older Australians. As life expectancy extends, we need to encourage as much as possible those older Australians to continue to contribute productively to Australian society.
On the Sunshine Coast we have lots of older Australians who are retired and who are active and energetic. Frankly, without the input of older Australians on the Sunshine Coast, our volunteering organisations would not be able to perform as they do, they would not be able to do the wonderful job that they do, and our community would be very much for the poorer. Governments cannot afford to pay for every service, and older Australians, through their active involvement in community organisations, have an incredible ability, an incredible capacity and an incredible record in making sure that their fellow Australians enjoy a wonderful lifestyle and a wonderful standard of life. It is important that we never lose sight of the benefits and advantages of an ageing population that includes citizens who are sensible, mature, skilled, caring, responsible and respectable and who are still able to contribute much to our Australian society.
We have lots of seniors and retirees who want to be involved in charity work, and thank heavens that such a thing occurs in our society. Our community organisations need these older Australians, and they ask for very little. What we as elected representatives have to do—and I suggest this in a bipartisan way—is to recognise that contribution and at times give a little bit of extra assistance to people to whom we as a community owe so much.
In the time available to me, I would like to briefly draw attention to a number of hardworking senior members of the community in my electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast and highlight very clearly the value of our older residents. Dawn Chalkley and Eric Brusewitz, who live at Kawana Waters, have had years of experience in organising charity drives. In retirement they have continued to use their know-how to benefit the community in such matters. They launched and managed a collection drive in early 2009 to help the victims of the Victorian bushfires, and that successful campaign was followed by support for the flood victims. That campaign had a wonderful response and was extraordinarily successful. Eric and Dawn were passionate about the need and they were determined to make a difference. They worked hard despite some minor challenging medical conditions which made it extra difficult. They are examples of the value of the experience, wisdom and maturity of older Australians.
Another hardworking senior in our community is Florence Woods of Maleny. Mrs Woods was the recipient of the Fisher Citizen of the Year award on Australia Day this year for her efforts through various community groups. She has worked hard to make a real difference for her fellow citizens for over 25 years. In conjunction with the Fisher Australia Day Committee, I was pleased to be able to present this award to someone who is so passionate about staying active and helping her community. Mrs Woods has volunteered with the Maleny Show Society catering committee for 25 years, where she is regularly seen marshalling the troops at the annual show. She has also been the chairperson of the youth fellowships at her Presbyterian church for 20 years and president of Erowal Nursing Home auxiliary for 10 years. On top of that, Mrs Woods has been with the Maleny Hospital auxiliary for five years and the Maleny Busy Needles for the past three years. She has been an energetic and committed community worker and she has made an incredibly positive and practical difference to her fellow citizens in the Sunshine Coast hinterland.
These examples highlight the energy, commitment and willingness to help that is common among senior Australians. They highlight the value of older Australians and retirees who may be retired and no longer working for wages but who are still working to make a difference in the community. The knowledge, experience and skills of mature people like Dawn, Eric, Florence and many others in Fisher on the Sunshine Coast and around the nation provide a great benefit to the local community.
I think that volunteer work carried out by older Australians is volunteer work which we as an entire community should encourage, and we should facilitate other people to perform in a similar way. These people are altruistic, they love Australia, they have helped to make us great, and they want to make this nation an even more wonderful place in which to live.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Older Australians</title>,Private Members' Business,29,1
"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I commend the member for Shortland for her obvious dedication to improving the lives of our senior citizens as evidenced by this motion. There is no doubt that older Australians provide an invaluable source of wisdom and contribution in various ways to our community. Unfortunately, this contribution is not always appropriately recognised and encouraged. I believe, however, that the current government is on the right track towards recognising and improving the status of elderly Australians. The current work bonus giving incentives to senior Australians to encourage them to continue to participate in the workforce is particularly significant given the current dynamics of Australia’s ageing community. The initiative recognises that older people have a lot to offer, and it is important that we recognise that their contribution not only to the workforce but to the community in general is highly valued.
Federal Labor recently delivered what can only be considered the biggest reform to the age pension in more than 100 years. The reform, which increased the pension by $100 a fortnight to single pensioners, has truly made a difference in managing everyday living costs for those individuals. The recently introduced initiative to provide better aged-care facilities for elderly Australians of non-English-speaking backgrounds is a great step towards improving the quality of life for this unique group of Australians. Equipping aged-care service providers to deliver appropriate aged care to older people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds is extremely significant in my electorate, which, as you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, is the most culturally diverse electorate in Australia.
I have the distinct honour of having a very close relationships with a number of senior associations in my electorate, most of which cater to the members of different cultural groups. I wish to name a couple. Firstly, the New South Wales Vietnamese Elderly Friendship Association has over 2,000 members in south-west Sydney. It is one of the most prominent associations of its kind and a true role model for other organisations seeking to cater to the elderly from unique cultures. I have visited the organisation on a number of occasions and I was truly touched by the spirit of friendship and the general zest for life of its members.
The organisation, under the president, Mr Mieng Van Nguyen, a committed and highly motivated leader, provides members with various sources of entertainment but, more importantly, social interaction as well as education. The association is currently undertaking the ambitious task of setting up a library room to provide facilities for learning English as well as helping the seniors to develop their computer and internet skills so they can fully participate not only in the local community but also in Vietnam.
The Indo-Chinese Elderly Hostel with President Mr Harry Tang is another culturally specific aged-care facility in my electorate. Its members, as well as the management, were extremely grateful to receive recognition from the Commonwealth by being awarded 32 new aged-care beds as part of the government’s current round of aged-care approvals. The association’s role in ensuring that senior citizens in the broader Chinese community have access to quality aged care is highly commendable.
Another organisation I will quickly mention is the Cardinal Stepinac Village, an aged-care facility with a difference for elderly migrants from Croatia. I was particularly touched by the initiative of the CEO, Matt Smolcic, and the president of the board, Mr Milan Bogovich, to hold a fundraising evening to raise money for the Queensland floods. To take from one’s own pension and give to fellow Australians is a quality that younger generations can be truly inspired by. What really struck me from my visit to Cardinal Stepinac Village were the awards that they gave to staff, particularly volunteers. Oddly enough, as the member for Fisher just indicated, most of the volunteers are elderly people. A number were actually residents of the village as well as young people. The wisdom, the knowledge of life that is acquired with age is something our community should value.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to support the main points of the motion put forward by the member for Shortland. My electorate of McPherson has a significant number of older Australians and, in my opinion, they make a considerable contribution to our community. Today there are two specific issues outlined in the motion that I would like to address, the first being the contribution of seniors as volunteers. Volunteers are very important to local communities, and the southern Gold Coast is certainly no exception. In many instances it would be easy to miss their contribution as most are not out trumpeting their own successes; they are in the background working hard generally for no reward other than the satisfaction of helping a fellow human being. The bulk of our volunteers are senior Australians—retirees who, having left their paid work life behind, have begun another work life. There is no pay. The hours may be long and the work not glamorous, but the rewards are there in the sense of satisfaction in helping others and making a contribution to the wellbeing of the community.
I have firsthand experience of the operation of Scouts Queensland and know the extent to which that organisation relies on volunteers not just as scout leaders but to assist with administration, promotion, committee work and fundraising. Many of the volunteers in scouting contribute a huge number of hours and many of them are in the age bracket of 50 years and over. Without the contribution of the senior members of scouts, that organisation would struggle to continue to provide programs for today’s youth
Neighbourhood Watches operate successfully with the support and contribution of seniors, who are the backbone of the organisation. Community safety would surely be compromised without their dedicated contribution to their neighbours and to the residential areas in which they live. Volunteers in policing, veterans support groups, women’s shelters, playgroups, groups linked to our churches and, indeed, even organisations that focus on supporting seniors themselves would struggle without the participation of seniors. If volunteering were to diminish, there would be a significant social cost. The non-government organisations that utilise the efforts of volunteers would simply cease to exist if they were forced to rely upon paid employees.
The second issue I would like to address today is that of employment related age discrimination. Let me start by acknowledging that discrimination on the basis of age continues to exist in relation to employment and that this is to the detriment of those who are discriminated against and of employers who do not receive the benefit from the contributions that seniors can make to businesses. Those positive contributions include experience, a mentoring role, reliability and loyalty to work colleagues and to the employer.
Age discrimination does not necessarily start when a potential employee becomes officially a senior, or even close. It can start much earlier. Some organisations prefer to recruit juniors. Others prefer to present a youthful exterior to the marketplace and recruit accordingly. Sadly, there are industries that are reluctant to consider an employee who has not even reached middle age and, with this being the case, you can understand the struggle that someone who is perceived to be at the end of their working life faces. According to the National Seniors Association 2010 election submission:
In 2009 almost 60,000 Australians aged over 55 counted as discouraged workers, that is: they wanted to work but had stopped looking because no one would employ them. The main reason cited was ‘being considered too old by employers’.
We need to combat this, and we should be looking at ways to do so. The Henry review noted that, relative to OECD countries, Australia’s participation rates are low for men and women aged between 55 and 64 and that ‘incentives for existing workers to remain in work are critical’.
There are some positive things that we can and should be doing, and I will deal with just one of those. We should be encouraging employers to look at flexible working arrangements that would benefit both the employer and the employees themselves, particularly work patterns and the arrangement of working hours: for example, the organisation of part-time work, job-sharing arrangements and flexibility to look at part-time hours worked perhaps over five mornings or five afternoons rather than two to three eight-hour days.
Our seniors contribute in many ways that they do not realise. They deserve our respect and they deserve our support, just as they support the broader community.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—The government’s welfare payments for flood and cyclone victims is beginning to look like the latest multimillion-dollar administrative bungle of the Rudd-Gillard government. Early in the new year the Prime Minister announced payments of $1,000 for adults and $400 for children in areas affected by flooding. Later these benefits were extended to cyclone victims. When the Prime Minister announced the payments she outlined eligibility criteria which were very restrictive. Hardly anyone would qualify. Centrelink staff were dismayed because, after all the Prime Minister’s media hype, they were the ones who were going to have to tell desperate flood victims that they did not qualify. Within hours the Prime Minister was back to the media to say she had asked the acting Attorney-General to fix the problem. At his second attempt the eligibility criteria were relaxed to reflect those which applied in the flooding of early 2010. These criteria were very generous—probably too generous, considering the scale of the flooding and cyclone damage around Australia.
Your house did not have to be flooded or even get wet to qualify for these thousand-dollar payments. You did not have to be flooded in or flooded out. You did not have to lose any property. You did not have to lose any wages and you could still qualify for these thousand-dollar payments. If you were unable to leave your house for 24 hours; your suburb or town was cut off for 24 hours; or if you lost electricity, sewage or some other utility for 48 hours, you qualified for this thousand-dollar payment. On this basis much of Brisbane, Townsville, regional cities which had their power cut off or were isolated for a day or more—everyone living in those areas qualified for these grants. I estimate at least two million Australians would qualify. If your suburb was isolated, even if it was going about its normal business—the supermarkets were there, the food was still available to sell, the pub was still open and the poker machines were still running—you still could qualify for this thousand-dollar payment. If people were on holidays, unemployed, welfare beneficiaries or had awards that gave them paid leave in these circumstances, they still qualified for the thousand-dollar payment. Millionaires qualified. I was told of a lottery prize winner who had received the thousand dollars. You could qualify if you could not get home even if you did not want to go home. Indeed, the payments were available to a whole range of people who had suffered no personal hardship, very little disadvantage or very little inconvenience.
Of course, many people did not claim, because they felt guilty about asking for money in these sorts of circumstances, but already around $500 million or more has been paid out. Potentially around $1.5 billion will be paid. There are many people who did not claim who now want to because the government has said they do not have to pay the new flood tax if they get this benefit. So people who did not really need it or felt they did not deserve it now want to claim because that gets them off the new tax payment as well.
This has been an absolute nightmare for Centrelink, and I admire their staff. The government changed the guidelines at least four times and then repeatedly changed the interpretation. I had three cases last Friday where two members of a family were approved but another member who applied a few days later in exactly the same circumstances did not get the grant. There are now examples of Centrelink endeavouring to recover the money from many of these people even though they met the criteria. It was the fault of the criteria that people who did not need the benefit were paid the money rather than those who claimed according to the rules as they applied at that stage.
I have heard all sorts of stories about the fantastic days the pubs and poker machines had. One town is reported to have sold out of flat screen TVs. In addition to that I had a call from a local bank appealing to us to stop this because they had run out of cash in the bank to pay out these amounts. There are at least 1,400 cases of fraud that are being investigated. There are many people who deserved and needed this payment, but the government’s administration of the guidelines was so inconsistent that, indeed, many people who did not need it received the money.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Disaster Relief</title>,Adjournment,30,1
"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—The third Closing the Gap report was released by the Prime Minister last week. Looking through it for the outcomes that we, of course, expect to see in these reports but getting little more than inputs made me turn my mind to exactly what is happening with the health of Indigenous Australia. In the report there was just one precious phrase, which referred to petrol sniffing and volatiles abuse as having fallen. Apart from that, it was simply, three years after we started this process as a parliament, yet another dusty speech about inputs to the problem and precious little about outcomes.
Tonight I will focus on housing. We all know that from employment and housing come the hope of better health care and education, but it starts at home—with having somewhere safe, healthy and inspiring to live. Right now, the in some ways impressive amounts of money that are being injected into Indigenous housing are going the same way as all the money before them, because one simple, essential antecedent factor is being ignored: how do we involve Aboriginal Australians in the construction of their own housing? How has this government turned Indigenous housing into a spectator sport, where Indigenous Australians simply watch the white teams roll in, build the houses as quickly as they can and get out as quickly as they arrived? As long as Indigenous housing is something that drops in and is left behind with no maintenance plan and no Indigenous crews to look after it, we will have nothing more to look forward to than more degraded housing desperately in need of upgrade—and that can happen within months.
These are not small investments: we are talking $400,000, $500,000, $600,000 or, in some remote cases, $800,000 for a very modest two-bedroom dwelling. Indigenous families are crying out for a chance not to have 10, 12 or 14 people, on average, in their dwellings. There are communities that have up to 20 people living in a house. How can children hope to sleep at night and turn up at school when they live not only in that kind of overcrowding but in squalor? The answer is simple: there are enormous working-age populations in these communities that are completely disenfranchised from the idea of being able to move from school into a reasonable paying job that has a training component to it and a hope of a future. The opportunity is right there, with this focus on Indigenous housing, but it has been completely lost, and you need look no further to see this than Wadeye in the Northern Territory, where tens of thousands of dollars are being spent per day. That money is spent not on the houses but on the multilayered consultancies that are working out what home design and home colour we want. Those consultancies are not consulting at all about the basic premise: can any of these young Indigenous blokes pick up a spanner and give it a go, work on a housing site under supervision and call that house their own? It is as though this is some novel idea that has never been thought of or trialled before.
We in mainstream Australia have created the only culture in the world that relies on another culture to build shelter for it. Show me another place in the world where it has come to this. The money is now there, but, in the guise of having to rush out the housing as fast as we can, we are not waiting for Aboriginal townships and communities to build those houses and, with it, gain the experience these young Aboriginal males and females of working age need, just to have a chance at entering that career. They are not all going to be home builders—they may well move into other areas—but they will have had an opportunity to build 20, 40 or 100 dwellings. Once the job is finished they can build accommodation for the teachers, nurses, doctors and police who work in these communities; then they can build the civic centres. We need to turn it into a revenue model and make these properties valued. The best way to do that is to write the names of the people who built the houses on them. If you tear those apart, you are tearing down the work of your own brothers and your own skin group. But, no, we do not do that.
We have learned no lessons from the past but we forge ahead on this futile scheme of transferring surpluses to large building alliances that engage one, two or three Indigenous workers shovelling cement or sweeping down the slab. Let us create genuine training opportunities that can lead to a career. Let us not do job capacity assessments for an individual; let us do them for the entire community and not stop until every single Aboriginal person of working age has had the chance, like the rest of us, to follow a career and build a passion. Something happened in 2008: the member for Gorton, as the then Minister for Employment Participation, removed that tensioning spring—that drive to get involved in community activity—in his communication with his Centrelink line staff. As we dig deeper, we will find that that act in 2008 did more damage in this area than anything in the last 10 years.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Indigenous Housing</title>,Adjournment,30,2
"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—Murray Goulburn in my electorate have a very diverse customer base through exports and their local base. Having regard to what I said about the plight of dairy farmers last week, it is very important that we recognise that the farmers in Western Australia and perhaps some in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales are under direct threat from the price of milk being at $1. They are under direct threat because they do not have another market to sell into. They sell into the current milk market for consumption within Australia.
Only a few years ago, the major supermarkets said to Murray Goulburn, ‘Your Devondale cheese only has 17 per cent of the market; you’re out of here.’ Murray Goulburn said: ‘Fine. We are big enough and diverse enough. We will take our product out of your supermarket and we will sell to the independents and we will export it.’ And that is exactly what they did. The problem is this: if you are a farmer who is not connected to a major exporter that has a diverse range of opportunities for supplying the world, you are probably already finished if we have regard to what the two major supermarkets have decided to do.
I heard the Coles spokesman. I heard what he said about supplying the consumer with the best price, being competitive in the market and all of those sorts of things. But sometimes what we think is about to happen has actually already happened. What has already happened is that Coles have decided that milk in the litre line is going to be $1 in perpetuity. Therefore, they are condemning those farmers that now supply that milk market to oblivion. That has probably already happened. You are probably already gone if you are supplying that market and you are unable to diversify what you are selling.
I think this is a tragedy. I think the family farm is very important. I think that supplying fresh milk to our families and our children is very important in those states. What will they be doing in future? They will probably be buying it from Murray Goulburn in great truckloads and carting it interstate as the base milk product. The only answer is us as a collegiate of parliamentarians addressing the major problem. And that is that we have two major supermarkets supplying the market. That is a much bigger issue than that of the plight of dairy farmers, who are caught in between. (Time expired)

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—As I speak to this motion I thank my electoral neighbour the member for Mallee for supporting me in this motion. He, too, is most concerned about this issue.
On Sunday 30 May 2010, two young boys—nine-year-old Chase Robinson and seven-year-old Tyler Robinson—were found dead in their sleep in a rented family home in Mooroopna in Victoria, a tragedy that shocked that community. Their mother, Vanessa, the only other occupant in the house, was also very unwell. This motion also has a silent partner in the form of Vanessa Robinson, who is determined that the death of her two young sons not be in vain. She wishes to see something done seriously about the problem of carbon monoxide poisoning in Australia.
Investigations into the boys’ deaths found that a faulty gas wall heater had been operating all night. The boys had died quietly from carbon monoxide poisoning. Because of the widespread ignorance surrounding carbon monoxide poisoning, the earliest media reports suggested that Vanessa was somehow involved in a terrible murder-suicide pact. A few days later, on 3 June, Vanessa’s parents, Sue and Les Rowney, issued a plea for understanding in a press release:
At a time when our family has just lost two amazing and well loved boys, rather than be allowed to grieve in private and maintain a watch over our daughter in the Intensive Care Unit whilst she remained in an induced coma following the effects of the carbon monoxide, we have had to endure seeing the news and photos of our beloved Chase and Tyler splashed across the front pages of national and local newspapers and TV media with headlines linking their mother to their deaths. Her name, her identity, have been released and published (including photos), her reputation as a person and loving mother has been publicly and erroneously called into question. She had been reported as having been arrested when the truth was that she was too unwell to be interviewed by detectives let alone be arrested.
This tragedy and its aftermath could have been avoided if the public were alive to the dangers of leaking gas; if police and emergency workers knew more about it—its symptoms and its consequences; and if gas appliances were regularly checked.
There are currently no laws mandating regular safety checks for gas appliances fitted in homes, nor are gas detectors mandated. In the last 10 years there have been at least five deaths in Victoria caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. In fact, we are not sure how many there have been in Victoria or other states; too often deaths that occur in the very young or the very old go without a diagnosis that it was, in fact, carbon monoxide poisoning.
Both natural gas and LPG can lead to carbon monoxide production where appliances are misused, incorrectly installed or poorly maintained. Very recently carbon monoxide killed a 23-year-old man when fumes built up from a generator he was using under a house while sheltering from Cyclone Yasi near Ingham. Just a day or so ago a tragedy was averted at Nathalia’s Bridge Hotel. On Saturday morning carbon dioxide was released when a post mix machine, which mixes soft drink, leaked into the hotel cellar. Fortunately, a call for assistance was made and the fire authority attended the scene, and so disaster was averted.
The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often difficult for the public to detect. There is not sufficient public information or education about the dangers, and carbon monoxide is tasteless, colourless, odourless and invisible. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning vary, with tiredness, shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. The symptoms can easily be disregarded or misunderstood. In particular, the very young and the very old can be affected without anyone putting the gas wall furnace and the symptoms together.
Carbon monoxide detectors can be purchased in Australia for as little as $40 each, but we do not have Australian standards for these detectors—unlike the situation with smoke detectors. In other countries these standards do exist, and they are regulated. This motion calls for all new residential properties with gas appliances to be fitted with approved carbon monoxide detectors, and for rental properties to have gas detectors installed and checked biennially. We also need nationally consistent legislation for safety checks on gas appliances in homes and the installation of detectors, and the implementation of a national safety awareness program highlighting the dangers and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.
This motion is the first step in bringing about change which would need to come via the Australian Building Codes Board, ABCB. Template legislation or regulations need to be introduced in each state and territory. I acknowledge it may be a process best managed through COAG. The ABCB maintains and updates the Building Code of Australia. It provides the community with cost-effective and efficient regulations to aid the design, construction and use of buildings throughout Australia and it responds to government and industry calls for minimum necessary regulation to facilitate and not inhibit business. We are now making that call. I know that the member for Mallee and I will be following up on this motion to make sure that we see action to save lives. Beginning in 1994, legislation or regulations were introduced into each state and territory requiring that all homes be fitted with smoke alarms. An equivalent measure now needs to be implemented to deal with the equally deadly leaking of carbon monoxide from gas appliances which are found in most homes in Australia today.
I want to return to the words of Vanessa Robinson’s family. As I said before, Vanessa is a silent partner in putting this motion today. Vanessa has already had fundraising efforts with the father of the boys, Scott. She has also done a great deal herself to try to raise awareness of this problem. I understand that with the Victorian government she is hoping to put some community advertising through television into the broader Australian population so that more people are aware of just what can happen if you do not have properly maintained or installed gas appliances. This was written by her parents:
Throughout this and the ensuing backlash and animosity towards Vanessa in the local and national community the family has maintained a dignified silence whilst they assisted detectives with their enquiries and tried to make sense of what had happened. We wish the possibility of Carbon Monoxide poisoning had been investigated earlier and in parallel with the murder investigation, as we had raised concerns about this possibility with the police on Monday—
that was following the deaths.
We have also been appalled by the lack of medical attention Vanessa received during the initial hours of her being taken by the Police.
We are equally appalled by the lack of information afforded to us over our daughter’s condition especially during the time that her health began to rapidly deteriorate, forcing us to hire a lawyer in order to be able to find out its severity and whether we needed to immediately travel to Melbourne to be by her side. For a mother and father that had just lost two grandchildren and who was not been allowed to see their daughter or be informed of the severity of her deteriorating condition it is just not right.
…            …            …
Finally we would like to urge all families to ensure their heaters are serviced and checked to ensure there are no Carbon Monoxide leaks as this gas cannot be seen, smelt or tasted but it can result in a tragic loss of life as it has for our family.
As you can see, this is a matter which has led to the most sad and serious consequences for the Robinson family and it would have been totally avoidable if in fact that rented property had been inspected for gas leakage. We understand that the gas heater had been on the property for some seven years without any attention. Of course it is the case that we need to make sure that people who have gas appliances do not tamper with them themselves and always use qualified tradespeople when they are having their gas appliances examined, installed or in any way altered.
As members of parliament we need to work to we do all we can through this national parliament to ensure tragedies like the deaths of Chase and Tyler Robinson never happen again. It is also important that we look at international best practice. We note that in the United Kingdom there has been concern about gas leakage and the consequences for many years. They have legislation which makes sure that people are aware of the problem and there are mandated requirements in relation to detectors.
Given that detectors are quite a cheap piece of equipment, and given that retrofitting them in houses is not a difficult or expensive thing to do, I call upon this parliament to have a bilateral approach—as I am sure we will find in response to this motion today—to ensuring that one of these gaps that have occurred in our regulation of community safety is closed; that, as I said a minute ago, the deaths of young boys like Chase and Tyler Robinson have not been in vain; and that such tragedies never happen again.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Gas Appliance Safety</title>,Private Members' Business,32,1
"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—At the outset, I welcome the fact that the member for Murray has brought this resolution forward and has sought to put a spotlight on what would be a matter of concern to a large number of people. I was particularly moved by the points she raised in relation to Vanessa. It would be difficult not only to have to deal with that situation of the loss of two young lives but, on top of that, to have overlaid the suggestion of wrongdoing. I note that the member for Murray made reference to the fact that they maintained a dignified silence. I think many people in similar situations would be sorely tested to have to deal with two compounding and compelling issues: (1) the deaths and (2) the suggestion of something that was inappropriate.
I was going to make reference to smoke detectors. In my home state of New South Wales it is now, as a result of state legislation, compulsory to fit homes with smoke detectors, because it has been the silent killer of many that they have been unaware that their homes have been on fire and, as a result of carbon monoxide, they have been unable to respond to that fatal incident occurring in their homes.
It is interesting to note that there has not been any significant work done to study emissions that occur within homes and whether or not those homes are able to, through design, ensure adequate ventilation. I know that we are talking about detection and response, but another silent killer is the way in which homes have been constructed over the years and the way in which certain designs would, for example, encourage the retention of certain emissions that, of themselves, would cause harm over time.
It has been brought to my attention that the CSIRO has been involved and that there has been a study conducted through the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research. It was probably the first study done in Australia—because there had been no extensive studies of indoor air quality—to look at typical dwellings in Australia and to determine whether or not those dwellings are having an impact on the retention of certain emissions within homes. In particular, they found that, in the construction of homes that have garages connected with indoor access, the emissions themselves are higher because of, basically, the movement and retention of those emissions within homes, particularly during the morning hours between seven and eight, when obviously you have people departing for work, school or other activities and the operation of vehicles so close to those premises ensures the retention of those emissions within indoor premises. It is worth noting as well that this study was conducted over the winter of 2008, and there was further follow-up with a number of homes—40, off the top of my head—in 2009. So it is a relatively recent study which it has been important to conduct. They observed a number of pollutants—not just carbon monoxide but formaldehyde amongst others. They said that the concentration of indoor air pollutants observed in the study is comparable with concentrations observed in previous studies in Australia.
There were a number of purposes to the study. The first was to determine indoor air quality in typical dwellings. The second was to determine whether or not the proximity of dwellings to busy roads has an influence on indoor air quality. They selected two sets of dwellings—‘near road’ and ‘far road’. A number of statistical analyses were carried out to determine whether that had an influence. It was found that the only pollutants were closer to busy roads, which resulted in enhanced concentrations.
The third purpose of the study related to indoor quality, particularly with reference to the characteristics of the dwelling, the materials and indoor activities, with a particular focus on whether or not ventilation systems within homes were aiding by being able to get rid of those pollutants that were considered to have health impacts. It was noted—and obviously common sense would dictate this as well—that over the course of time, as architecture and home design have improved, with a focus on reducing the impact of heat and cold on homes, that has led to a focus on improving ventilation in homes. Over time, compared to older dwellings, there has been a propensity for newer homes to be able to expel those air pollutants, but it is still an issue.
I think a lot of people would be motivated by the concerns that the member for Murray has brought forward. I acknowledge that in her contribution today she has seen that a lot of this is state based and that is where the focus will need to be. However, I also recognise that in the mechanisms put forward by Dr Stone—sorry, the member for Murray; taking on board your previous advice to us, Mr Deputy Speaker—there is a need to determine how we are able to encourage national cooperation on this. Certainly a way that we can move forward is through the auspices of COAG. I think the issue will be determining how—obviously, given the number of national-state issues that are being coordinated through that forum—we are able to best progress on that.
However, I think it is important, and I certainly commend the fact, as I said at the beginning, that this has been brought forward. Frankly, with the construction of this new parliament and particularly with the changes to the standing orders, we need to take the opportunity to raise issues that, while they may be in local or state jurisdictions, have a national impact—and certainly this is one of those areas where that is the case—and then to determine the way in which we are able to progress on those issues. I am sure that in most households—and certainly in the electorate of Chifley, which I represent, where there are a blend of newer and older style premises—people would have concerns about whether or not indoor air pollutants are being trapped in this way.
The other thing to note, too, is that there are variations across states in heating. For example—and I take it that this is the case in rural Victoria—it is certainly the case, as I know from my previous experience working with an energy distributor, that on the south coast of New South Wales they do not necessarily have reticulated gas but will rely on bottled gas. Having said that, the network itself is one thing; another—and this was raised by the member for Murray—is the connections in the home, whether or not they are up to standard and whether or not they have been checked. These things need to be followed up. There is definitely merit in following up the issue that was raised by the member for Murray about national awareness campaigns as well.
It really comes down to how we progress this at a national level within COAG. The issue for us is seeing how we coordinate amongst states to deal with this issue, given that the relevant department at the federal level, the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, does not have the statutory power in regard to fitting the detectors. The department has funded research in the past on the health effects of air quality in homes with unflued gas heaters. Those heaters—and it is acknowledged—pose a risk of elevated levels of indoor pollutants, including carbon monoxide. I think the challenge has been thrown out by the member for Murray: how do we coordinate national action on this and encourage states to move on this in the way that they have with the fitting of smoke detectors? I will limit my remarks to those. Certainly, as I said earlier, there is a challenge that needs to be met in this area and in seeing we respond to this resolution.

"Forrest, John, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—I second the resolution. I am very pleased to have an opportunity to support my geographic neighbour, the fine member for Murray, in this resolution. Carbon monoxide poisoning has been a priority of mine for a long time. This goes back to my former life as a consulting engineer involved in building design and some of the things that the member for Chifley referred to. All of us need to pause for a moment and realise that the member for Murray’s resolution starts with her point number one. Her resolve and her desire to have something done about this comes from the tragedy of the loss of the two young Robinson boys. Any death is completely unnecessary. But deaths are more unnecessary when they involve young people, the richest resource that the nation has. I am particularly interested in supporting the member for Murray because I am very concerned about the lack of awareness about carbon monoxide. I support the other points in her resolution about encouraging building control boards to look at this issue and encouraging the use of detectors.
Carbon monoxide is a very insidious gas. We hear a lot about carbon dioxide, which is relevant to the discussion that occurs in regards to climate change. Carbon dioxide is the combination of a carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. It is detectable. The thing about carbon monoxide, which is a carbon atom and one oxygen atom, is that it is not detectable. That makes it very insidious. I encourage people when they are driving their motorcars, which I often do as I travel through my vast electorate late of night, to always drive with their window down, even if it is only an inch or two. You will notice if you are driving along, particularly in the winter and you are trying to keep the vehicle warm and you have the circulating air on warm, how drowsy one can become. That is the subtle, dangerous impact of carbon monoxide poisoning. If that feeling comes over you, you will be amazed when winding the window down and getting a sniff of good air how remarkably quickly one’s awareness returns.
I am particularly anxious to support the member’s resolution. The reason that I am harping on so much about awareness is that it will take a long time to get the states together through COAG. I am sure that the member’s resolution will get some action. But in the meantime we need to promote awareness. We as members of this place have the opportunity to promote through media comments the dangers of carbon monoxide.
Energy Safe Victoria have produced a brochure that is designed to make landlords aware of their responsibilities as lessors to vulnerable people who are not necessarily aware of this. They have made some very strong comments about carbon monoxide poisoning in this brochure. It says:
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a threat where internal gas appliances are misused, incorrectly installed or poorly maintained. CO poisoning can have symptoms similar to flu and can be fatal.
If people are not aware of what is happening to them, which is probably what happened with those two youngsters, fatality can be imminent.
I am particularly concerned about the use of mobile caravans and cabins. If a person wants to use gas for heating, they should never go to sleep with the gas appliance operating—never. I have seen incidents of that. I saw it happening in campervans when I was a young person backpacking through Europe. People with gas appliances in their campervans kept them on at night because it was chilly or icy outside. That is an absolute no-no. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a threat because the symptoms of overindulgence are symptoms that we come across in other illnesses, like flu. These include headaches, dizziness and nausea, which we do not necessarily link with a high concentration of carbon monoxide.
What I would like see in the meantime is that we encourage COAG and the states to see what they can do about appropriate detectors and ensuring that modern construction provides adequate warnings for gas appliances fitted to homes. We need to promote more and more of this style of brochure to every person who has a gas appliance in their home. I am supporting the member for Murray in that particular part of her initiative, because I just happen to know it will take some time to get the Australian Building Code changed. Despite the fact that there have been tragedies, it will take some time. I am hoping that other members will take up the cause here and warn people of the terrible dangers of carbon monoxide. It is insidious: you cannot smell it, and that makes it dangerous.
I am pleased to have this opportunity to support a good resolution and to see the parliament operating in the way it should. I think the energy of a non-partisan approach on this will ensure we get an outcome. We just do not want the nation to be deprived of the resources of youngsters, young teenagers, whose only fault was that they were not made aware of the risk they were taking in keeping a gas appliance operating all night.
With those few words, I offer a message of condolence to the Robinson family, for whom, whilst this incidence occurred in May last year, time will not heal the wounds and grief they feel at the loss of two youngsters. I share that condolence with them and through the member for Murray. I commend her on the resolution she has put before the parliament.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Gas Appliance Safety</title>,Private Members' Business,32,1
"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—Can I begin by thanking the member for Murray for bringing this matter to the chamber. It is indeed both a tragedy and an opportunity, and I would like to add my voice to the sentiments that have been spoken before me by the member for Mallee and my colleague the member for Chifley. We join with all members of this place in mourning the tragic loss of Chase and Tyler Robinson, who died at Mooroopna on 30 May last year. It was a terrible tragedy for their parents, Vanessa and Scott Robinson. I take this opportunity to pass my condolences on to Scott and Vanessa, who I am sure are still grieving.
We know that Energy Safe Victoria examined the house and that police believe a gas leak was directly responsible for the tragic deaths of these young boys. Indeed, inspections have revealed a faulty gas appliance, possibly a heater, was responsible for these deaths. It really is regrettable that carbon monoxide poisoning only comes to national attention following a tragedy like this. I guess I am like every other Australian who only focused their attention on this issue after this terrible tragedy. I am also a father of two young children, and we have an unflued gas heater in our house. So we really do hope that some good can come from this terrible incident.
The problem with carbon monoxide is that you cannot see it and you cannot smell it, but at high levels it is deadly. We know that carbon monoxide is produced whenever any fuel such as gas, oil, kerosene, wood or even charcoal is burned. It is important to note that an appliance that is properly installed and maintained, as the member for Chifley outlined earlier, will not present a hazard. However, if an appliance is not working properly or is used incorrectly or if there is poor ventilation then dangerous levels of carbon monoxide will result. This points to the fact that it should be incumbent on all landlords everywhere, as the motion points out, to be aware of this and to properly maintain the heating equipment in their properties and have it inspected on a regular basis And, as tenants, when we enter into a lease arrangement, we should ensure that we check on the maintenance of appliances more vigilantly and do our part to insist that this maintenance takes place.
Of course, it is not only here in Australia. We know that around the world each year hundreds of people die accidentally from carbon monoxide poisoning. Some more die from carbon monoxide poisoning outside the home and other buildings, such as in cars, as the member for Mallee has pointed out. Foetuses, infants, elderly people and people with asthma or a history of respiratory or heart disease are especially susceptible.
Some of the risks for carbon monoxide poisoning arise from commonly occurring situations, such as a blocked flue or a faulty cowl, damaged or corroded fluepipes, sealing up a fixed fresh air ventilator or using camping appliances indoors or in an improperly ventilated space. We should also all be aware that the threat from carbon monoxide is much higher if the appliance is in a very small room such as a toilet or bathroom—surprisingly, many gas heaters are still fitted in confined spaces such as these—or if you are sleeping in the same room as the appliance, such as in a tent or a caravan. The threat is also increased if ventilation to the appliance is absent or restricted or if the flue is in poor condition. It has been argued that the charcoal briquettes and portable barbecues should carry specific warnings about the dangers of burning charcoal in confined areas, and I agree that this is something that we should move on. These are risks that we should all be more aware of because of the everyday, commonly occurring situations where these risks arise. I believe that with the switch in consumption from electricity to gas heating in particular over recent years—a switch that I believe is only going to accelerate—this is a problem that we really do have to face as legislators.
Raised levels of carbon monoxide can have significant impact on human health, and the Australian government has taken steps to manage and reduce the amount of carbon monoxide that is produced. These steps include implementing national fuel quality standards, promoting alternative fuels and supporting the implementation of tighter vehicle emission standards. However, more needs to be done. Through the National Environment Protection Council, the Australian state and territory governments have also agreed on a national environment protection measure for ambient air quality. The measure includes national standards for six key pollutants, including carbon monoxide. The Gillard government is committing to working through the COAG framework to progress national action on a number of fronts. There is no doubt that lives would be saved if carbon monoxide detectors were fitted in homes with gas appliances and if states regulated to ensure that landlords were obliged to have qualified contractors inspect all gas appliances in rental properties on a regular basis. With these observations in mind, I have no qualms at all about speaking in favour of the motion and commending it to the House.
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Gas Appliance Safety</title>,Private Members' Business,32,1
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—I rise today to speak on an issue of major concern in Australia and in Australian agriculture, that of foreign ownership of agribusiness and agricultural land. The debate very much centres on the fact that, in recent times, deregulation and other issues have meant that what used to be foreign investment—which has been very good for Australian agriculture both in land and in agribusiness—has become foreign takeover of agriculture and agribusiness in particular.
While currently we export the majority of produce from broadacre agriculture, we are very much dependent on domestic production for much—in fact, most—of our food. For example, 98 per cent of fresh fruit and vegetables bought and eaten by Australian consumers are grown in our country. The fact that the world population will grow from around 6½ billion to nine billion by 2050 gives a different outlook on it. If you understand that other countries are already preparing for tighter food supply by strategically buying into agricultural supply chains around the world; and if you take into account the fact that the new giants of the economic world, India and China, and the sleeping giant, Brazil—which is no longer asleep—now have money to invest around the world, you start to realise that, over the past five years or so, food security has become an international issue. Global companies as well as nations themselves are very aware of the need to secure their supply lines. Today, countries that once did not have money for foreign investment now do. If you couple that with a tenfold increase in reported foreign investment in the agricultural sectors over the last three years or so since Labor have been government, you begin to see the nature of the problem.
As I said, foreign investment has been good for agriculture. In fact, it has been great for building the industry that we now have. However, in recent times, Labor have continued to cut spending on agriculture, cutting R&D, biosecurity and other programs, giving Australian investors less confidence than they once had to invest in their own industry. In this environment, there has been a marked change in activity by foreign companies—from investment in agriculture to ownership and control of supply lines. Look at Viterra and Cargill in the grain industry, Swift in the meat industry and National Foods in the dairy industry. There has been Singaporean investment in the timber industry. There is the proposed takeover of the rice industry in the member for Riverina’s electorate, in which it basically rests.
Many farming industries—for example, dairy, with the buyout of cooperatives—have found out that the short-term financial gain to individual members is outweighed by long-term impacts such as reduced farm-gate prices through loss of market power and/or loss of competition. While the decision comes down to individual companies and their investors or grower shareholders, farmers should recognise that, once they lose majority control, the focus of these operations will shift to the interests of the overseas shareholders.
With these factors as outlined, it is evident that we need to look at our food security in a way we have not done before. The current rules for foreign investment are outdated and do not address the issue of food security. The $231 million trigger for a review by the Foreign Investment Review Board for agricultural investments is almost never triggered because, obviously, there are almost no farms in Australia that make that much. If we do not put in place sensible safeguards, it will be difficult for governments to manage foreign ownership to ensure that our food security interests are looked after in the future. Even when it comes to agribusiness, the $231 million trigger is, most often, not activated.
That is why the coalition has tabled a notice of motion outlining a comprehensive policy approach to the issue. The notice of motion will task the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Bureau of Resource Economics to gather and clarify information on foreign investment in agribusiness and agricultural land and then task the Productivity Commission with a review to recommend safeguards for national food security interests by evaluating not only individual investment but also the cumulative impact of foreign ownership—in other words, what do you put together to create a trigger mechanism of $231 million or whatever might be appropriate? A parliamentary committee could then consider the recommendations.
The government has been asleep at the wheel on this issue. Now the Gillard government has released plans for yet another review of foreign ownership. But what the government—and, I believe, the minister—is not looking at is the agribusiness side of this. Agricultural land is the land that pulls at the heartstrings of Australians. Australians do not want to see the farm being sold off. In actual fact, agribusiness is the much bigger issue at this time. You cannot take the farm overseas, or the water that it uses, but you can take the productivity overseas. We need better information on the levels of foreign ownership of agribusiness and agricultural land. We need a national test for food security on foreign investments examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board. We need to be aware that the level of investment examined by the review board nearly always allows agriculture to fall under the level. The board needs to be able to look at the cumulative impact, as I said earlier.
It does not really matter whether or not you are in agribusiness or in agriculture. Think about the reason agribusiness is so important in this issue. Picture yourself as a foreign investor from a land that is probably nowhere near as tough as Australia is about what agriculture cannot do—what a farmer cannot do. If you come from China, India or Brazil and you have money to spend, are you going to buy 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 farms to ensure your supply line, having to deal with the myriad regulations that Australia puts on farmers—what you can clear, what you can do with water, what you can do with chemicals and all those things we do in a very exacting degree? Are you going to live with that and try to run those 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 farms? Almost certainly you will not. You will go and buy the agribusiness, like SunRice in the case of the rice industry and like the abattoirs who do the killing for meat, or like the grain trader. You will go and buy the trader, the processor or the wholesaler, because you still have your supply lines and you do not have to run the farm.
Agribusiness is the real issue here. Yes, they can buy agriculture, and there is a limit to what we would want to see in foreign hands, but the much bigger issue here is the extent to which the businesses who actually process, who actually trade and who actually export are in foreign hands. As I said earlier, we have moved from foreign investment to the foreign takeover of Australian agribusiness. As time goes on this will become a bigger issue, because they do not only buy. Potentially, once a global company or a company with a national bent that wants to protect either its global supply lines or its national supply lines buys one of our companies with a history of selling around the world, it has bought not only the supply line but potentially the customers. If the company wants to switch the supply from an Australian farm to another farm somewhere around the world, it can do it. So it does not only affect what we own; it affects our ability to sell.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land and Agribusiness</title>,Private Members' Business,33,1
"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—An iron law of populism is that, while Australian businesspeople investing abroad are portrayed as job-creating entrepreneurs, foreign investors in our country are depicted as rapacious robber barons. And so it is with the latest campaign against foreign investment. As sometimes happens, the campaign started in the tabloids. Under headlines such as ‘Chinese buying up our farms’, ‘It’s time to stop selling off the farm’, and ‘It’s time to save our farms from foreign investors’, News Ltd tabloids have recently embarked upon a fear campaign against foreign investment in Australian agriculture. With anecdotes taking the place of statistics, foreign investment has been described by the tabloids as ‘a dramatic global land grab’, fed by ‘a looming global food shortage’.
Most ironic about the recent tabloid campaign against foreign ownership in agriculture is the fact that the newspapers responsible are themselves owned by US citizen Rupert Murdoch. Indeed, if a campaign were to be waged against foreign ownership in the media industry, you would expect these newspapers to be among the first to describe it as economic populism. It is funny what happens when the pitchfork is in the other hand.
Now, the opposition appears to have decided to jump on the populist bandwagon. After a few months in which members of the frontbench have questioned the need for a floating exchange rate, an independent Reserve Bank and a migration policy that does not discriminate by religion, it is perhaps no surprise that the opposition is tempted to campaign against foreigners buying our farms—not surprising, but odd all the same. After all, Australia’s agricultural sector has benefited substantially from foreign investment. In 1855, British investors helped kick-start our local sugar production industry when they established CSR, originally Colonial Sugar Refinery. In 1877, American firm Schweppes opened its first Australian factory—as did Kraft and Kellogg’s in the 1920s. Japanese investment in Australia’s beef cattle sector has been important since the 1970s. Today, the largest foreign investors in Australia are still Britain and the United States.
As a resource rich nation, Australia has traditionally looked abroad to fill the investment gap. On one estimate, one in eight workers is employed by a foreign owned firm. If we were to ban all foreign investment tomorrow, wages would fall and unemployment would rise. An Australia without foreign investment would also risk missing out on the latest overseas know-how. From technology adoption to business practices, foreign firms can often help spur innovation by changing the way that things are done.
In moving this motion, the member for Calare expresses concern over the risks to Australia of ‘foreign investment’. Yet he has previously spoken in favour of greater investment in Australian agriculture. On the floor of this parliament, he has repeatedly called for more investment in the forestry sector, more investment in farm productivity, more investment in agricultural research, more investment in new plant varieties, more investment in rural telecommunications and more investment in rural infrastructure. What he seems to fail to realise is that investment is not a magic pudding. Restricting foreign investment in agriculture will result in less investment in agriculture, and that is bad news for people who are employed by a foreign owned firm or who might have otherwise been employed by a foreign owned firm that is deterred from coming here.
Of course, while Australian investors are playing a role in our economy, our agribusinesses are creating jobs in other countries too. In countries like New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Singapore, Australian firms are helping to show local companies a new way of doing business. In the process, Australia’s overseas investors are helping to raise living standards in those countries.
As the mover of the motion presumably knows, Australia has long had restrictions on foreign investment. Formalised by the Whitlam government in 1975, the national interest test applies to a wide range of investment classes across the economy. The Foreign Investment Review Board, or FIRB, must approve foreign investment that exceeds 15 per cent where the firm is worth $231 million or more. In the case of real estate, nonresidents cannot buy existing properties and FIRB must sign off any time a temporary resident wishes to buy property. Importantly, FIRB has had a veto right over any investment by a foreign government, including farms. In addition, banks, media outlets, airports, Qantas and Telstra are subject to special rules. FIRB can reject applications outright or provide an approval subject to particular conditions.
In thinking about how strict our foreign investment review processes should be, it is useful to look at how other developed countries operate. While any such comparison is obviously limited, work by the OECD’s Takeshi Koyama and Stephen Golub suggests that Australia’s foreign investment review regime is at least as stringent as, perhaps more so than, the approach that prevails in the typical developed country. For decades Australia’s economic policymakers have recognised that our nation’s prosperity relies on being enmeshed with the world. Since the time of white settlement, immigration and trade have been a part of Australia’s social fabric. Australia has been engaged with our region and the globe and this engagement has helped to shape our society—a nation in which one-quarter of the population are born overseas and exports make up one-fifth of the economy. Integral to an outward-looking Australia must be an appreciation that well-regulated foreign investment brings significant benefits to Australia.
Lastly, I cannot help mentioning the issue of food security. It is one of those slippery phrases that people seem to invoke when they do not want to say precisely what they mean. Since I have not seen anyone, including the shadow minister for agriculture and food security, being clear about this, let me hazard a guess at two possible explanations. One possibility is that when people say that we need to ensure food security they mean we need to ensure that if Australia were cut off from the rest of the world we would not starve. Given that Australia continued to trade with other countries even during the depths of World War II, this is a bit like worrying about whether Dubbo has a plan to protect against tidal waves. But, in case anyone is wondering, the answer is yes. Australia sells more food to the rest of the world than it buys from the rest of the world. So if we were to be cut off from the rest of the world we would not starve.
The other possibility is that food security means we need to make sure that agricultural prices do not go up and down. It is certainly true that in recent years food prices have been unusually volatile. For example, since 2007 some world food commodity prices have doubled, halved and doubled again. Economists are not sure why, but possible explanations include climate change, increasing meat consumption throughout the world, biofuel subsidies and a reduction in food stockpiles. In some developing countries there is a real concern that changing food prices will push people into starvation. For Australia the effects are more modest, but you can still see them in the data. For example, in 2006 food prices grew about four per cent faster than the prices of other goods. In 2010 the reverse was true: food prices grew about one per cent slower than the prices for other goods.
People sometimes make the mistake of thinking that if we imported no food this volatility in food prices would disappear. That is wrong. Australian food prices also move when world prices change because Australian farmers sell into the world market. So, to insulate ourselves from volatility in world food prices, we not only need to stop importing food; we need to stop exporting food. I do not hear anyone calling for that. My fear is that, for at least some people, food security is merely code for a return to protectionism, which would be a great mistake. By all means, let Australia produce the foodstuffs that suit our land and our skills. But it does entrepreneurs and workers no favours to encourage Australian agriculture to expand into areas that do not suit our geography and our talents.
There are plenty of challenges facing Australian agriculture. But, while Labor are focusing on water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin and addressing climate change, the coalition’s plan is to defer water buybacks and pretend that climate change does not exist. At the same time, the shadow agriculture minister is moving a private member’s motion aimed at reducing investment in Australian agriculture. It might feel good to pander to populism, but let us not pretend that it is helping farmers.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land and Agribusiness</title>,Private Members' Business,33,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—The opposition are in disarray: they bring motions to the parliament which they claim to be important but cannot organise speakers to speak on those motions. That shows the level of support they have in thinking about a vision for the future of agriculture in Australia, as my honourable friend the previous speaker has said. I hope the member for Calare has discovered who the responsible minister is that he is directing the motion to, because when I looked at his motion that seemed to be something else that he did not understand.
I am aware there are some community concerns, as you would be, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, regarding foreign investment in Australian agricultural land and businesses. Australia has well-established arrangements under which foreign investments are examined. This is not something that just happens. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 empowers the Treasurer to examine all significant investment proposals in Australian businesses by foreign interests to ensure they are not contrary to the Australian national interest. Based on those examinations, the Treasurer can reject or impose conditions on proposals that are considered to be contrary to Australia’s national interests. That is as it should be. All foreign governments, their agencies or state owned enterprises must notify the Foreign Investment Review Board and receive an approval before making a direct investment in Australia, whether it is for $1 or $1 billion. The government has already made important improvements in the foreign investment framework that are very much in the national interest.
When you look at the supply chain in agricultural industries you will see that there is a lot of foreign money in that supply chain. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, National Foods had some difficulties with its suppliers in the milk industry in Tasmania a year or so ago. A Japanese company with Japanese capital took over that company, and they are going through other changes. I wish them well in that and I hope they continue to invest in our milk industry, in processing, in Tasmania because we need that capital. You cannot expand without capital in your supply chain.
I do not know if Mr Cobb is saying that we do not need any foreign investment in any of our industries. Go and have a look at the car industry. Go and have a look at our mining industry. We raise capital from all over the world; that is how our systems work. So it is difficult to see where Mr Cobb is coming from, other than just trying to make a political point, I suppose, around National Party branch meetings and stirring up some of their members out in the bush to say that the country is going to be overrun by foreign money.

Mr Simpkins interjecting—
—Are you one of those who go around doing that?

Mr Simpkins interjecting—
 (Mr S Sidebottom)—Order! I remind members that you speak to the chair.
—He used to be the editor of a newspaper running the same line, churning it out without any vision, without looking to the future. I think we all realise on the government side that there are national interest principles to improve transparency around how the national interest test is applied and an easy-to-read version of the policy to further improve the transparency of the regime. I think that is important.
Of course there will be concern. As I said when I started these words, of course there is concern. People do not want overseas capital coming in and buying great tracts of Australia. They need to know about that. We need to have a process that allows them to see that. That will occur under this Labor government. It did not occur under governments where the National Party held ministerial positions or the deputy prime ministership. I guess that is why they are getting a bit toey and why they have to try to justify their existence with motions like this one.
The Australian government, like previous governments, is committed to a case-by-case approach to considering foreign investment proposals to maximise investment flows while protecting our core interests. Using the capital in the interests of the nation is what it is about, and we need to make sure that we do that. I was looking only recently in Tasmania at the irrigation schemes coming on board with state and federal money to help enhance our rural sector and to help us go in new directions and find new ways. But, in that sense, it takes opportunities to borrow money. I was looking at what the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research had to say. It said that in Tasmania we grow around $1 billion of our current food, fibre and poppies. It says that for the industry to expand it will require financial resources.
Of course it will. There are only two ways that that can occur. That is either by debt into the industry or equity through investment, houses and corporate agriculture. Some of that might be foreign money that comes into the agricultural sector like it comes into the processing sector or the mining industry. So to expand we will need money. We need money to do that. Those points are very good. Those points, when we talk about looking at a case-by-case approach to considering foreign investment proposals, are what it is all about. Investment flows need to be looked at and so does protecting our core interests.
Given the longstanding success of the foreign investment screening regime, we on this side of the House see no reason to change it by placing blanket bans or restrictions on particular types of investment. The government welcomes foreign investment. It has helped build the Australian economy and will continue to enhance the wellbeing of Australians by supporting economic growth and prosperity, as it has done in the honourable member for Riverina’s seat. I do not know who owns some of the production and supply chains within his electorate. It might be interesting for him to tell us. I am sure he is well aware of who they are. That economic growth and prosperity will continue with investment. We need to make sure that we look at it, that the general public can have a good understanding of how it operates and that we have transparency around that so that we do not have hysteria whipped up by the National Party for their own political interests.
Thousands of rural and regional communities around Australia whose economies rely on agriculture and food production benefit greatly by foreign investment. I do not think we would want to see international sources of support for the bush discouraged or threatened. At times we need to have foreign capital to assist our industries to grow. As I said, in Tasmania we are certainly looking for new investment. We just lost McCain’s at a processing plant in the Smithton area. We are looking for the ways in which we will process our food into the future. We need to be sensible about this and go forward in a proper manner. (Time expired)

"McCormack, Michael, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—I thank the member for Lyons for filling the breach in place of the member for Forrest, who was in the main chamber speaking about an issue very important to the coalition’s heart—the youth allowance and the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 [2011]—which has been most unfairly dealt with by this Labor government, who do not have a great appreciation or respect for regional areas. Given the fact that she cannot be in two places at once, I am stepping in for the member for Forrest to give her speech on this motion about foreign ownership of land. The member for Forrest says that, in seconding this motion, she does not automatically oppose foreign ownership of agricultural land in Australia but she does oppose the foreign acquisition of Australian rural land in secret or by stealth.
Her office has tried on numerous occasions to compile information on foreign ownership of agricultural land in Australia and has been continually told that that there is no comprehensive source of this information. The other problem that it has encountered is that agricultural land is not separately reported by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which classifies agriculture, forestry and fishing into one category. The member for Forrest notes with interest the 2010 announcement that the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in conjunction with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, ABARE, would survey the foreign ownership of agricultural land. As the ABS identifies in its explanatory document:
Currently there is very little information available on the level of foreign ownership of agricultural businesses, land and water rights within Australia. Therefore the ABS proposes to collect data on the following:
Direct foreign ownership of agricultural businesses in Australia
Direct foreign ownership of agricultural land in Australia
Direct foreign ownership of water rights (used for agricultural purposes) in Australia
This proposal is to be commended.
Under the current regime, a foreign purchase of agricultural land or business has to exceed a $231 million threshold before the Foreign Investment Review Board must be notified. The current debate on foreign ownership requires accurate data on foreign ownership of rural land and agribusiness. At a Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Related Industries hearing last year, the Foreign Investment Review Board confirmed that it is possible that a foreign entity could go down to the Murrumbidgee River today and buy every property and not even trigger the interest of their board. That is a reflection on this parliament.
The world population is expected to grow from around six billion today to over nine billion by 2050, with Australia alone set to increase its population by between 35 and 40 million by 2056. With this population growth, cities and urban development will continue to take up more and more of the prime agricultural land. This is of particular concern to the member for Forrest, as a food producer. Given the future challenges of feeding the world, it is vitally important for Australia to have accurate records of who is buying and acquiring our food-producing agricultural land and precious water resources.
This motion is necessary to guide the foreign affairs and trade negotiations of Australia’s future. One of the threats faced by our agricultural sector, if we get this policy wrong, is that of a worsening of an already uneven playing field in world trade. We must avoid situations where foreign owned farms are being granted access into markets that are denied to Australian producers or where Australian farmers and investors are being priced out of the market.
We must also be aware of the closed loop—where a foreign entity or quasi government owned entity buys up tracts of food-producing land and water and restricts the sale or provision of that produce to their own market. There has been a change in focus from foreign investment to foreign ownership and, as a result, many farming industries—for example, dairy with the buy-out of cooperatives—have found that the short-term financial gain to individual members is outweighed by long-term impacts such as reduced farm gate prices though loss of market power.
The Daily Telegraph reported in November last year that foreign investors have snapped up $10 billion of Australia’s prime agricultural land and rural enterprises ‘and no-one is keeping watch’. It also stated:
Australia, with its rich and fertile land and sophisticated farming techniques, is a target for some of the world’s biggest agricultural enterprises.
This is further reasoning that it is time to consider greater supervision of rural land and water sales to overseas interests. In conclusion, I repeat that this motion is not about banning foreign ownership; it is about protecting Australia’s sovereignty and food security by including our agricultural and water resources on the radar of the Foreign Investment Review Board.
 (Mr S Georganas)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land and Agribusiness</title>,Private Members' Business,33,1
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—It is a pleasure to rise and join with other members on this motion that was moved to take note of the statement made by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in the main House on 9 February. It is a motion to commemorate the second anniversary of those tragic bushfires. It is a time to remember. It is a time to reflect. It is also a time to look forward now with the benefit of two years behind us.
At the outset, I pay tribute to the minister for her words in the main chamber and to the shadow minister, the member for Menzies. I think both members encapsulated what occurred on that tragic day and what occurred in the hours and days afterwards and has occurred since. As I said, it is natural for us to remember and reflect. All of us—particularly Victorian members like you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou; the member for McEwen, who is here; the member for Kooyong; and the member for Wannon, who has just joined us—remember that day—the heatwave, the weather and the wind. All of us had that fear that something terrible could happen, but I think all of us hoped and prayed that the day would just pass as the previous couple of days of the heatwave had.
When the news that fires had broken out was heard on the radio and on our televisions, we as Melburnians instinctively thought the worst. When we thought the worst, we thought of Ash Wednesday, which was our previous reference point for the worst. I think intuitively none of us thought it could be worse than that because that was the boundary psychologically. As I have said before in the House, I remember opening the curtains of our house, which is just on the edge of the Yarra Valley near Lilydale, on that afternoon and seeing the mushroom clouds down the Melba Highway, which must have been at Kinglake and then approaching Yarra Glen. Of course all Melburnians know the Dandenong Ranges and the Yarra Valley. Pretty much wherever you are in suburban Melbourne you can see them. What unfolded over the next hours and the next days was truly tragic, and I think the minister and the shadow minister captured that.
In remembering Black Saturday, we think of the families who lost loved ones. We remember the 173 who died, those who were injured and all the families who were affected. We think of the communities affected. Wherever those communities are, we Melburnians know them even if we do not live in them. We have been there on school camps as kids and on family outings. That it as true of Kinglake as it is of Marysville and the other towns. We also reflect, as I said, on the incredible efforts of our emergency services personnel and the incredible efforts of members of the community.
To speak of those events two years on brings back memories of the many efforts at so many levels. We are right to feel sympathy for the heartbreak and heartache of those who we know are suffering so much at this time and simultaneously to feel pride in the community spirit and in those who helped so much. I say that because it has become fashionable at times for commentators to say that we have lost our sense of community spirit in the last 40 or 50 years. While that might be true at a superficial level, instinctively we suspected that was not the case and we know it is not the case from what we have seen.
I cannot possibly mention everyone, but I do want to mention a couple of people. One of them is Lex de Man from the CFA—and I know the member for McEwen will have heard of Lex. A loyal senior officer for many years, he retired recently.
—I met him on Sunday.
—The member for McEwen says he met him on Sunday. I wanted to mention him. As I said, it is difficult to single out people, but I do want to mention Peter Montgomery from Yarra Glen as an example of some of the great work that was done. He instigated the Adopt a Container Project, which within a year saw 170 shipping containers provided to affected families to store their belongings and give a sense of belonging as they rebuilt. He was rightly chosen as the Shire of Yarra Ranges Citizen of the Year last year. That project is still going and still expanding.
Of course, I want to mention the previous member for McEwen—and I know the current member will support this—Fran Bailey, who worked so tirelessly in those tragic days, weeks and months after the fires. The minister rightly mentioned Fran in her speech in the House. I also want to make mention of the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd. At that time of tragedy, he performed in an exemplary way. He was in constant contact with Fran Bailey, and his efforts and his dedication to every aspect where he could possibly make a difference were well known to those closely involved. I want to pay tribute to the former Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, who similarly spent every waking minute making sure that whatever needed to be done was done.
I said it is a time to remember and a time to reflect. I also said it is a time to look forward. In doing so, it is a time also for some candour because, two years on, we can make a lot more sense of the tragedy. We know we will never stop bushfires, but in our hearts we want to know that we can always do better. Two years on, the words of the former member for McEwen, in her final speech to this House, bear repeating. She called for a program of sustained fuel reduction, a state-of-the-art early-warning system, safe shelters and better use of early fire detection technology. I want to see the new state government of Victoria working as hard as they can to make a real difference and, where we can, to leapfrog forward in those areas, particularly on early fire protection technology.
Another former member of this place, the former Labor member and Hawke government minister Barry Cohen, has written passionately about the possibilities of some of the new early fire detection technologies. He has written in the Australian about the FireWatch technology, which can precisely detect the existence of smoke and its location before a bushfire has taken hold, enabling emergency services to deploy the resources to extinguish the fires. This technology consists of a camera unit with a sensor that can scan an area of 400 square kilometres and rotate automatically through 360 degrees every six minutes 24/7. It can detect the difference between smoke, cloud and mist. With recently added night vision, it can provide precise details of fires around the clock. This technology is being used in Germany. It was developed by the German aerospace industry and NASA as part of the Mars Pathfinder mission.
There were some trials of this technology with funding from the federal government, but that appears to be somewhat caught in bureaucracy. But today is not the day to go through that in detail. Today is the day for me to say on behalf of those in the Yarra Valley that we want to see that technology thoroughly trialled and we want to see the best possible technology in use. The next time this sort of fire tragedy happens—and it might be the difference of time between Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday, but it could be next year—we want to know that when our emergency services confront it they will have better technology and better preparation and that we have done more because we have learnt more, so that we can make a difference on the ground for those communities affected.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commemoration of the 2nd Anniversary of the Black Saturday Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,35,1
"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—Saturday, 7 February 2009 was a day in our nation’s history that we shall never forget. Effectively, it was the day that hell visited Victoria and left a permanent scar on its departure. My community was ravaged by an inferno of flames faster and more powerful than anything we had ever seen before. Helen Kenny, the captain of the St Andrews CFA, said it was a day they had trained for but a day they had hoped would never happen. She said that, in the days leading up to it, they knew it would be bad, but they had never dreamed that they would face such a fire of fury.
It was nightmare which left people dead, injured, homeless and hurt. Ordinary Australians defended their homes as best they could. Some were successful; others were not. Many were caught trying to escape the heat and ferocity of the flames as Mother Nature proved to be too fast, too strong and too vicious. Trapped and confused, some had no option but to sit and wait for the flames to engulf their homes and everything they owned.
We lost 173 people on that day. They were family, they were friends and they were neighbours. But we must not forget those who died following the fires as a result of its impact, whether it be physical, psychological or emotional. There was eerie silence on the landscape after the fires. There were no birds and no animals, only the smell of destruction and carnage to fill your senses. In its wake, the fires left homes burnt out, schools destroyed and communities devastated. It looked like a war zone and it smelt like a war zone—because it was a war zone.
John McCrohan, President of the Hurstbridge RSL, gave an address on Anzac Day. He said:
I would like everyone to remember soldiers of a different war. A war caused by man’s efficiency and nature’s wrath. Black Saturday.
The soldiers of this war were CFA, the SES volunteers, police, ambulance and more importantly, bushfire victims who lost their homes and belongings.
Even more importantly, those who lost their lives. Mums, dads, boys and girls. They should be remembered alongside our gallant diggers of past conflict.
After wars, as we know them, soldiers returned to their homes and loved ones and, with their support, tried to forget the death and destruction. But the scars always remained.
After the War of Black Saturday some victims will rebuild and start a new life.
So I ask you today to remember these soldiers of Black Saturday, along with the fallen soldiers of past conflicts.
People walked out of that death and destruction, proud and bewildered, with little more than the clothes on their backs and the thongs on their feet, but they were filled with a spirit that only Australians can muster. Looking back to the days following the fires, I can remember through the darkness and destruction of my community how the colour and strength of our national flag shone through. Through the wind, the Southern Cross was strongly waving throughout many homes and the townships across the scorched and blackened landscape. One flag I can recall was damaged by the fires, but it was still standing, waving proudly in the winds that followed Black Saturday and telling Mother Nature that despite her power we would not be beaten. To me, that flag symbolised the true Aussie spirit and resilience: we were wounded but not beaten. It showed that we would never give up hope.
The people of McEwen are real fighters. In the days and the months and the two years since that terrible day, we have witnessed the best of human strength, spirit and resilience. Local halls, sporting clubs and community centres were turned into relief centres, which were quickly inundated with volunteers and goods. People from all walks of life and from all points of the state and the nation donated their goods, their time and their money to support those in their darkest hour.
My sincere thanks go to the CFA, the Victoria Police, the State Emergency Service, the Department of Sustainability and Environment, the Department of Primary Industries, the paramedics, the Australian Defence Force, all the local clubs and auxiliaries, the Red Cross, St Vinnies, the Salvation Army and particularly the army of volunteers across the country who came and gave all. Selfless acts of heroism are what we saw consistently on that day and in the days that followed.
There are probably no words big enough or strong enough to thank the CFA volunteers for what they went through. I also remember Danielle Green, the state member for Yan Yean, and Ben Hardman, the former member for Seymour. They were both on strike teams at the fire front from the moment it started and they continued until the fire had passed their areas. To try to put it into context, I think it is appropriate to use the words of Winston Churchill following the service of airmen during the Battle of Britain when he said:
Never was so much owed by so many to so few.
On behalf of all members of this place, I say thank you to the army of volunteers in my community. Thank you for everything you have done to support our communities.
From the tragedy came opportunity—an opportunity to learn and an opportunity to share and understand that loss, grief and devastation are universal. Students and staff at the Diamond Valley College used the power of education to share their experience and to inspire others. Together with students from the International School of Kabul, in Afghanistan, they published a book titled 1000 Pencils. It is a journey of connectedness from Kinglake to Kabul. In his foreword, Principal Greg Williams wrote:
In the post devastation silence they are the voices of promises and hope.
The students who had lost so much wrote:
We know our disaster is nothing compared to 30 years of war in Afghanistan, but it has helped us to understand and care for others.
They have now published a second book, titled From Kinglake to Kabul, which was launched on 13 February. I was proud to be there for the launch and I can say, after just reading the book, that the stories the children have written themselves—their own personal recollections—are very powerful, very raw and very honest. The book is worth reading and it was a pleasure to meet the students there, from Kabul and from Diamond Creek, who had put pen to paper. As I said, the book—the words of those students from year 8 and year 9—is very powerful.
Many locals in our area have devoted themselves to the recovery of bushfire affected communities and the landscape, helping those around them, some of whom they have never me, despite having lost so much themselves. People like Alex and Julie Sutherland, with the VFF, have coordinated thousands of volunteers to the affected properties to help clean up fences and erect new ones. Julie and Alex made the decision to deploy me and a group of Young Labor volunteers to a property in St Andrews to help with rebuilding. The property was once a home to Felicity and Peter Wiltshire, volunteers from the St Andrews CFA, before it was burnt out by the fires. Peter had been a volunteer with the CFA for over 23 years and Felicity had established a local Fireguard group, a group of young people concerned about fire prevention, protection and management. As we put up the fences, I knew that we were helping people who had devoted their lives to helping others, although the hours that we spent there would never amount to the hours they had given in their time with the CFA.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 4.47 pm to 5.04 pm
—As I was saying, we were deployed by Alex and Julie Sutherland and the VFF to go out and help rebuild fences in bushfire affected areas. Peter has been a volunteer of the CFA in St Andrews for 23 years and Felicity established the local Fireguard group—a group of local people concerned about prevention, protection from and management of fires. We put up new fences and I knew that I was helping people who had devoted their lives to helping others. Although the hours we spent there would never amount to the hours they had given to the local CFA, we knew it was of some assistance. We knew that the fences were an everlasting reminder of our commitment and support, because we were united in the belief that we would rebuild.
Although communities are starting to get back on their feet, there is still a long way to go and much more work to be done. Today I would just like to remember some of the towns that were affected, such as Strathewen, St Andrews, Arthurs Creek, Kinglake, Kinglake West, Pheasant Creek, Whittlesea, Humevale, Marysville, Narbethong, Buxton, Taggerty, Flowerdale, Glenburn, Strath Creek, Upper Plenty, Clonbinane, Redesdale, Reedy Creek, Castella, Wondong, Heathcote Junction, Healesville, Chum Creek, Toolangi, Yarra Glen, Dixons Creek, Steeles Creek and Christmas Hills—and others that were affected as well.
I am also reminded of what local resident Gary Hughes wrote, when he said:
BLACK Saturday survivors know calendars lie. They might chart the passage of days, weeks, months and years, but they do not record the passing of time.
That is why Black Saturday happened only yesterday, as far as survivors are concerned. And it will always be so, no matter how many weeks, months or years the calendar insists have passed since February 7, 2009.
Black Saturday is a constant companion. It is there haunting your thoughts when you are awake. It is there stalking your dreams when you try to sleep.
Like other survivors, we have tried to move on. Physically, we have partly succeeded. We have swapped our blackened 8ha hilltop at St Andrews for a charming 60-year-old renovated house with an equally charming, lush green garden in Melbourne’s inner northern suburbs.
There are no gum trees. We decided we could not face those future summers, when the hot, dry northerlies inevitably reignited the fears and brought back the trauma of Black Saturday. We could no longer face that annual routine of bushfire preparations. And we were not prepared to live our lives as seasonal gypsies, packing boxes of important papers and precious possessions into cars and leaving home on every high-risk day. (After our experiences on Black Saturday, staying again to defend would never be an option.)
We know we are lucky.
He went on to say
In some cases families have been torn apart over this decision.
We are full of admiration for those determined to rebuild. But to us, that blackened and bare hilltop will never be the same.
These personal stories are echoed right across the scarred landscape from Clonbinane to Marysville. From Flowerdale to St Andrews and all points in between ordinary Australians are wrestling with the demons that this fire brought upon them. It is important to recognise and acknowledge everyone’s individuality when facing the challenges of recovery. Surviving this traumatic experience has changed many lives in our communities forever, leaving many struggling to return to normality as they face the challenge of learning to live with what we call ‘the new normal’. This will not happen overnight. People will do it, but they will do it in their own time, at their own pace and in the their own way. Our obligation is to be there with them as they recover and rebuild.
On the second anniversary, Cathy Soulsby from Clonbinane wrote a wonderful poem, Recovery Rainbow, that, with your indulgence, I would like to read. I think it goes a long way to describing the thoughts and feelings that people are having since this tragedy.
In this summer of green and gold,
Dark memories of that day we hold
Deep within, for the scars remain
Like a tattoo, a permanent stain.
That day which threw our lives off track
We went out of the red and into the black,
We stood on the rim of a bottomless pit
Then we climbed our mountains bit by bit.
It’s hard to believe two years have passed,
To me, at least, it’s travelled so fast,
Now the bush rebounds with verdant passion
In a kind of jungle fashion.
So as we journey into the pink
It’s a time for reflection, a time to think,
A time to rejoice in what we’ve achieved,
A time to surrender all we have grieved.
I think that is a beautiful poem that goes to the very heart of the things that people are facing.
I could never name the volunteers and the people who have been so special to the community since that time, but I think it is important to thank the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, for everything she has done following on from the work of the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and Bill Shorten as the Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction. I know with Bill that just about every day I would get a phone call from him to say, ‘We are going to do this. Come and see what is going on.’ And we would sort of tick tack across the electorate to find ways that we could cover as much as we could to help as many people as we could who were recovering and were suffering during that time.
Two years on, we have come a long way. We know there is a long way to go. I certainly hope for our Queensland friends and those affected by the floods that the lessons we learnt during Black Saturday and afterward will go a long way to helping their recovery, helping them get back to normal as quickly as possible knowing full well that ‘normal’ will never be normal again.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commemoration of the 2nd Anniversary of the Black Saturday Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,35,1
"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—I rise to support this motion of commemoration. This week marks the second anniversary of the terrible natural disaster now forever known as the Black Saturday bushfires, an event more devastating than the tragedies of Ash Wednesday in 1983 and Black Friday in 1939.
Between 7 and 9 February 2009, under a combination of high temperatures, strong winds and tinder-dry forests, a series of devastating bushfires—more than 300 across the state—raged throughout Victoria, ravaging woodlands, tearing through towns and tragically taking 173 precious lives, including 23 children, and injuring more than 800 people, many suffering serious burns. The fires that started on that hot, 40-plus-degree day ended after consuming more than 2,000 properties and destroying 430,000 hectares. Hundreds of businesses were lost or damaged by the flames.
Every Victorian has been affected by the fires of Black Saturday. I remember the day vividly: the intoxicating heat hitting one like a wall. One can only imagine the intensity of the heat in the fire zone and its thunderous roar. And every Australian has been shocked by the devastation caused by fire, created either by intent or by accident and assisted by the natural environment. It is difficult to comprehend the horror of the situation which so many Victorians, so many Australians, found themselves facing while the fires raged. Unfortunately the ferocity of the fires on Black Saturday was of such a nature that the best laid plans were just not enough. The rage of the fire caught people off guard and people perished in homes that they were unable to defend from oncoming flames and in cars while they were trying to escape.
Over those terrible three days, locations such as Flowerdale, Kinglake, Kinglake West, Marysville, Narbethong and Strathewen were left unrecognisable. Around 78 Victorian townships were directly impacted in the consuming path forged by the fires. We will not forget the devastation caused to Bendigo, Buxton, Callignee, Churchill, Coleraine, Dixons Creek, Drouin West, Heathcote Junction, Horsham, Humevale, Koornalla, Longwarry, Mittons Bridge, Mudgegonga, Narre Warren, Reedy Creek, Smiths Gully, St Andrews, Steels Creek, Strath Creek, Taggerty, Toolangi, Upper Plenty, Wandong, Whittlesea and Yarra Glen. The story told by survivors tells of a fire they barely saw coming, of a fire they never knew had arrived. They tell of a fire that moved at lightning speed and of a fire that leapt forward and soared high. And they tell of family, friends, neighbours and whole communities lost. But they also tell a tale of survival.
I want to acknowledge the wonderful work of the SES and CFA volunteers, the police, the fire brigade and ambulance services, the Defence Force personnel, the Red Cross and thousands of other volunteers for their work in assisting those affected. I also want to acknowledge the leadership of the former member for McEwen, Fran Bailey, the current member for McEwen, Rob Mitchell, the member for Indi, the member for McMillan, the member for Casey and the member for Bendigo for the incredible work they did in assisting their local communities to rebuild. I also want to acknowledge our then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and our then opposition leader, Malcolm Turnbull, for their efforts.
It is also heartening to hear of the progress made by the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority. Over 700 building permits have been issued, over 90 per cent of fences have been repaired and direct financial assistance has been provided to nearly 60,000 families and individuals. And it is heartening to hear of the new initiatives announced by the Baillieu government, including the new Fire Recovery Unit located within Regional Development Victoria and the new Bushfire Communities Support Program with a personal support helpline and other services for those in need. With over 300 families continuing to access counselling and other related assistance, the importance of these services cannot be overstated.
We must pay tribute to the strength of those who survived the fires of Black Saturday and continue to provide support to the very people and communities who lost so much, as they, now more than two years on, rebuild their lives and their homes and heal their souls. Their courage, the courage of all the communities affected by Black Saturday, continues to be a great inspiration to me and to all Australians. We have done and will continue to do all we can to assist them in their recovery. It is our duty.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commemoration of the 2nd Anniversary of the Black Saturday Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,35,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I commend all speakers on their contributions to this debate. The Australian government has joined with Victoria and the rest of Australia in marking the second anniversary of the devastating Black Saturday bushfires. Those bushfires were Australia’s worst fire disaster since Federation, claiming 173 lives, devastating entire towns and communities, destroying more than 2,000 homes and leaving thousands of residents homeless. Black Saturday, 7 February 2009, will be forever etched in the nation’s memory as a day of mourning but also one of tremendous spirit and inspiration. This has been commented on by former speakers. The tragedy brought out the best of the Australian character and inspired countless acts of bravery, heroism and generosity. It also brought to the forefront the courage of the Australian people, the local leadership and the spirit and resilience of local communities. Our thoughts are with the survivors of the bushfires as they remember the people they lost and they work to rebuild their lives and their towns. This anniversary reminds us all of how hard it is and how long it takes for individuals and communities to recover from devastating events such as Black Saturday.
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the tireless and selfless efforts of volunteers supporting affected communities. The strong local trait of independence, commitment and self-determination has ensured the recovery of the communities of Victoria. I would also like to formally recognise volunteer employers and self-employed volunteers. Many employers of volunteers have contributed and continue to contribute direct and indirect time and also resources to emergency management and recovery organisations. As I mentioned during the motion of condolence in respect of the Queensland flood victims, no other country in the world has so much of its emergency management capability based on volunteerism. That is something that we should be proud of and that would not be possible without supportive employers. The Australian government has stood side by side with local communities, the Victorian and local governments, businesses and non-government organisations in the effort to rebuild bushfire affected communities. More than $468 million has been provided by the Commonwealth government to assist and support the reconstruction.
On 31 July 2010 the Australian government welcomed the final report of the Victorian bushfire royal commission. The report contained 67 recommendations, of which five were primarily directed at the Commonwealth. These relate to bushfire awareness and research, Commonwealth firefighting resources, bushfire arson and environment protection legislation. The Commonwealth strongly supports each of these recommendations. The government has already implemented a number of recommendations from both the interim and final reports and is committed to continuing its cooperation with the Victorian government and the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority to ensure the needs of local communities are met.
More than $1 billion has been invested across bushfire affected areas under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, generating significant economic activity and employment opportunities for the community. The government remains dedicated to supporting those affected by this terrible disaster and working with the Victorian government to assist in the implementation of recommendations made by the commission. In cooperation with states and territories, the Australian government has supported a range of measures to ensure that Australians are better prepared for bushfires. This has included, for example, the provision of $26 million for the development of a national telephone based emergency warning system, Emergency Alert, and convening the inaugural bushfire preseason briefing for emergency management officials. I am informed that in excess of six million SMS messages have gone out on Emergency Alert to date.
Today, in a country where extreme weather conditions and the continuing risk of bushfires are a reality, the tasks faced by our firefighters, volunteers, communities, government and industry are more challenging than ever. In the midst of the worst flooding and cyclone season that Australia has faced, the communities in Perth also faced extreme fire conditions, resulting in the destruction of a significant number of properties. In 2009, Victorian bushfires reinforced this message all too clearly. The devastation of this event was a reminder of the impact that fire can have on all of us regardless of where we live.
As the Council of Australian Governments has recognised, climate change will increase the intensity and extent of many extreme weather events. Events such as the recent Queensland and Victorian floods and Tropical Cyclone Yasi are unavoidable and will be an inevitable part of our future. We also acknowledge that, in the face of a likely increase in the frequency and impact of natural hazards, protecting communities from the impacts of these threats is a shared responsibility. It cannot be borne by a single agency, organisation or sector in isolation. Rather, an integrated approach to managing emergencies and disasters across all levels of government, the private sector and the community has been adopted. This ensures Australia is better able to withstand a crisis and have enhanced ability to recover from impacts—that is, to make a resilient community.
The Council of Australian Governments has now adopted a National Disaster Resilience Strategy involving all arms of government and the private sector. The government is both strengthening national partnerships for emergency management and encouraging communities to take a more hands-on approach to developing self-reliance. The reality is that governments have finite resources to protect our country and its diverse and greatly dispersed population, so it is imperative that we work together in partnership to ensure everyone can be better prepared in times of these inevitable crises. Above all, the government remains firmly committed to assisting the states and territories to improve emergency management arrangements by enhancing Australia’s resilience to disasters. We aim to do that community to community.
The recent natural disaster events in the states of Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales demonstrate that we have learned from Black Saturday and that the Australian spirit continues to shine. The anniversary of the Black Saturday bushfires represents an important opportunity to reflect on the terrible tragedy but also, as former speakers have acknowledged, to admire the courage and spirit of Australians and to acknowledge the critically important work of our emergency services and volunteers and the generous support of the Australian community in helping those in need.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commemoration of the 2nd Anniversary of the Black Saturday Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,35,1
"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—No-one can deny that the events of Black Saturday and the bushfires of this period will go down in Australian history as a most tragic and heartbreaking experience. Sadly, the death and injury toll will always remain as stark reminders of this. The fires were the worst that Victoria, and Australia, have ever seen. It is in recognition of this great tragedy and its immeasurable losses, as well as with a sense of pride in the community response, that I stand with the parliament today in support of this motion. My electorate of Wannon was touched by this tragedy. The people of Coleraine had reason to fear that lives may be lost when a fire ignited on a day when temperatures in excess of 40 degrees were recorded. Fortunately, this did not occur. It did, however, burn 800 hectares on the outskirts of Coleraine and 1,300 hectares in Camperdown. While arising out of the most dire circumstances, the example of resilience and the sense of camaraderie which Australians showed in response should not go unnoticed, nor should the severe injuries that were suffered by one Coleraine resident in defending against the fires.
My predecessor, the Hon. David Hawker, spoke of the contribution of a family from the town of Heywood, in my electorate, not long after the fires took place. The family selflessly contributed $950, from the then recent economic stimulus package, to support the Red Cross bushfire appeal. Such generosity is a symbolic reminder of the goodwill which exists in the Australian nation. In addition to acts like these, we cannot forget the volunteer firefighters, the SES, the police and the Red Cross, who braved extremes of temperature for what they saw as being the right thing to do on that tragic day.
This community spirit is still reinforced after two years by the actions of those in my electorate and others. It must have been difficult for Coleraine’s residents to handle the burning down of its avenue of honour, erected in 1919 in commemoration of those who fought in the First World War. It is with great pride, though, that I can report on an event which took place in the town to commemorate what has happened. Two weeks ago the people of Coleraine unveiled a plaque and sign, as well as the replanted avenue, to commemorate not only those who suffered in the bushfires but also those lost in World War I and all wars which have since taken place.
I am told that this has been a whole-of-community effort—and I have witnessed that—led by the local RSL club and with input from the Coleraine community as a whole. It has involved schoolchildren in the planting—and I was fortunate enough to attend on the day when the plantings took place nearly a year ago today—as well as donations and support from the townspeople. Their effort and resilience is to be applauded. This is the stuff that makes you proud of the spirit of generosity that we have in this country. These examples make me, as a member of this place, profoundly humble.
While this may show a most decent side to the responses of our community, it does not diminish the immense tragedy of Black Saturday, nor does it console those whose losses will be felt forever. It cannot. Electorates other than Wannon, most regrettably, were not so fortunate in the toll of people’s lives. Although I cannot speak of the immense grief with which many have been so affected, I, like other members of this place, have met with family members of those lost. I sincerely feel for them and for others in those electorates who have been affected by this tragedy. It is with great sadness that I remember the funeral I attended of a Liberal Party member who lost his life in the Black Saturday tragedy. A mother, father and brother were lost, leaving surviving twins. As the three coffins were taken into the church that day, the grief knew no bounds. For me, this will always be a very, very sad and stark reminder of the toll that the fires took on Black Saturday.
In remembering this, I particularly note the members of the electorates of Bendigo, Gippsland, Indi, Mallee, McEwen and McMillan. I would like to take this opportunity to remember the previous member for McEwen, Fran Bailey. I had the distinction and honour of being Fran’s chief of staff and I cannot speak highly enough of the way that she comforted and nurtured people and dealt with the tragedies that took place on that day and helped her community begin the process of recovery. I can say with great confidence that all of those electorates will be doing what they can and will have done what they can to commemorate and honour those who were affected at those times. Listening to the new member for McEwen in this House just before, I can see that that is taking place.
The statistics from Black Saturday are staggering—173 lives lost, over 400 people injured and 450,000 hectares burnt. As I have said, the statistics almost beggar belief. But statistics cannot measure the loss experienced by those affected. One hundred and seventy-three people lost their lives in the fires, many more lost a member of their family and many more again lost a friend. Many lost more than one. These are not numbers but lives, not hectares but properties and livelihoods.
The week before last I spoke in this parliament on the issues of the reconstruction of local roads and infrastructure following the recent floods, which also touched my electorate. As I said, the damage to property resulting from disasters such as these does not disappear overnight. After two years, the sense of deep loss cannot be underestimated. It is at this time that we need to pause to reflect and offer our sympathies to those whose loss cannot be regrown and make it clear to them that they remain in our thoughts. It is for this reason that I stand in support of this motion, offering my condolences to all those affected by the events of Black Saturday. On this occasion I can only reflect on this great tragedy and say that I and the electors of Wannon have not forgotten those who suffered so tragically two years after the time that it passed.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commemoration of the 2nd Anniversary of the Black Saturday Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,35,1
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—in reply—On 21 February 2009 I paused to reflect on the devastation wrought by the Black Saturday fires on Victorian towns and on the collective heart of Australia. I promised then that those affected would not be alone, that they would not be forgotten and that we would rebuild. One year on in February 2010 as Prime Minister I reflected on the magnitude of the loss. One hundred and seventy- three Australians lost their lives and more than 800 others were injured, some with a horrific burns. More than 1,800 homes were destroyed and more than 15,000 people registered as affected by the fires at relief centres and other official areas in the days after the firestorm.
Donations of clothes and food flooded in, driven by a truckies who simply got into their rigs and drove for hours and, in some cases, right across the country—I remember meeting one of them at the time who had driven all the way from Perth—with one simple thing in mind: to help their fellow Australians. As a Queenslander I have experienced a lot of that just recently. It is the same Australia, the same spirit of reaching out to one another when the elements turn against us. We did then and we will do so again. Let us not forget that $318 million was donated to the Red Cross Victorian bushfire recovery appeal. That was one year ago.
Two years on, we reflect once again on that tragedy, the effects of which rippled through our nation and across the ocean. Today I would like to reflect on some individuals. Stephen Lackas, self-employed stonemason, was the first fatality, I am advised, of the Black Saturday fires. When fire threatened Upper Plenty, Stephen sent his wife, Sandra, and son, Bailey, to safety while he remained to stand and fight. Like many, Stephen was not able to adequately assess the danger because of the thick smoke that shielded the flames. By the time he was ready to concede, the flames had surrounded him. Two years on, Sandra and Bailey are symbols of hope. They have rebuilt on their land a home that Stephen envisioned for the family. Their horses survived—they have even thrived—and Bailey takes great delight in caring for the new foals. He is a little boy but a very big hero in my books. Not content to rebuild their own lives, Bailey and his mum will travel to Queensland, my home state, to help in the wake of the devastating floods. Sandra was adamant that, to repay the goodwill that had supported them in their bleakest hours, it was right to pass it on to others.
In the weeks immediately after the fires, I met Ziad Ghobril, a local sparky and a member of the recovery effort. Ziad and his team of 30 worked with the Army and other authorities to restore power, provide emergency generators and reconnect power lines to communities decimated by fire. Ziad exemplifies the Australian spirit. When the blaze was at its peak, Ziad rang his employee, Jason Lynn, and urged him to flee to safety. But Jason was not ready to abandon hope. Jason battled resolutely to save the handcrafted furniture and tools his late father had bequeathed him. Jason was also among the many who underestimated the ferocity of the fires that Black Saturday. After the flames consumed his home and his shed, Jason fled with his life, only to collapse on the outskirts of the property. Startled awake by the mobile phone, Jason took heed of Ziad’s advice to him to get to the dam. With Ziad’s voice to keep him company, Jason lay semiconscious in the shallows of the dam, the screaming of animals in nearby paddocks ringing in his ears. Ziad raised the alarm with Whittlesea fire station and a CFA team was dispatched. Jason was ferried to safety.
In nearby Kinglake, as the flames licked the fringes of their property, a young couple bundled their two children into the car and attempted to negotiate a road blanketed by thick smoke. As the husband and father concentrated furiously on the white line dividing the road, cars on either side exploded in flames or careened into trees. The wing mirror liquefied in the heat of the encroaching flames and a burning man thumped wildly on the car window, begging for salvation.
These are truly horrible scenes, not from an apocalyptic film but, rather, from what we saw on Black Saturday. This is the horrifying recollection of Darren Wakelin from the day the Black Saturday fires engulfed his property. Darren, his wife, Bronwyn, and their two children were lucky to survive. After a period of solemn reflection, they determined to rebuild in Kinglake. Their return was marked by a chorus of car horns from the close-knit community. Like many others, the support shown by local, national and international communities has given the Wakelin family the strength to rebuild.
The Davey family were not so lucky. Rob and Natasha Davey were soul mates, with a relationship spanning almost 20 years. Rob was confident that the fire pumps, poses, mops and buckets on hand would be ample to save the family home on Bald Spur Road. But nothing could have prepared the young family for the onslaught on Black Saturday. Rob, Natasha and their infant daughters, Alexis and Jorja, perished in the ferocious fires that tore through Kinglake. Further up the hill on Bald Spur Road—renamed ‘Bald Spur cemetery’ by locals—Graham McKee looks down on the ruination. The Davey home is marked by two dead flowers fastened to a post. Sixteen of Graham’s neighbours perished on a stretch of road he still cannot bring himself to traverse.
A year after the fires, small shrines were erected outside flattened family homes, relatives unable to move forward. In other parts of the town, hammers and saws rent the air, signs that some folk were ready to move forward. Kinglake pumpman Ross Buchanan was ready to defend his home from the fires that threatened his town. He dropped his two kids Neeve and Mackenzie at the home of his in-laws for safety. With the support of his neighbours, both equipped with fire hose reels, Ross triumphed and his home was saved. He returned to find his mother-in-law in intensive care with severe burns and news that his children had perished. As a father I really cannot begin to fathom this pain; I do not dare to.
One year on, with remarkable spirit and humanity, Ross orchestrated a thankyou concert to acknowledge the efforts of the millions who had helped devastated communities recover. That is very much the Australian way. It is good to see it at work today. Where ash covered the land, bright green shoots have pushed through the surface. Bright green moss has emerged and ferns have sprung to life. Eucalypts sport new growth to nourish their stricken communities. Folks have returned, businesses have reopened and families have rebuilt. Schools have reopened and the community has regained a routine and a semblance of normality in the wake of this most extraordinary of tragedies. With a long way to go, the healing process has begun.
The fire ripped the guts out of these communities. For those of us who saw it at the time and for those who supported local families at the time it leaves an indelible impression on your mind, your heart and your memory. But that is for one who just visited, not for one who was among it. To be among it, I marvel at the courage of those who have come through. To banish those memories from your mind is near impossible and to now fashion new hope and new life, particularly with little kids at stake, takes courage beyond all measure. So for all those good people of all those great towns which make up the fabric of rural Victoria and rural Australia: we remember you on today’s date. We remember you on this commemoration. We remember you because what you went through was just plain unfair and this is a time for remembrance.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commemoration of the 2nd Anniversary of the Black Saturday Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,35,1
"Chester, Darren, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—I join with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Griffith, in his contribution to this debate, particularly in the context of his role at the time as the Prime Minister. The member for Griffith called me on the phone the day after Black Saturday, as I was driving between Rosedale and Sale. He said, ‘It’s Kevin—Kevin Rudd.’ I said, Sure, Kev, how ya going?’ assuming it was one of my mates from the function I had been at the night before. He said, ‘No, Darren, it is Kevin.’ So I pulled over to the side of the road, as I was having a bit of a panic attack, thinking, ‘What does the Prime Minister want with me?’ I thank you, Member for Griffith—when you were Prime Minister at the time—not only for the compassion you showed the people of Gippsland but also for the energy you had for the task in making people feel confident that the nation was behind them. I still remember your comment about rebuilding the community ‘brick by brick’. I think the people in the most adversely affected areas appreciated the support you gave them at that time. I certainly cannot find any fault with the way you conducted yourself as our national leader at that time. The parliament itself performed at its best in the aftermath of the bushfires. I had enormous support from not only my colleagues on this side of the House but also those on the other side. I greatly appreciated that at what was a very emotional time for many people.
In joining the debate I want to commend all other members who have already spoken on their contributions. I thank them for making sure that the victims of the 2009 bushfires are not forgotten in this place. As the years pass and the memories for those of us who were not directly in the firestorm may fade, the recollections for many people in the community are as vivid as though it happened only yesterday. In my community it only takes a forecast of a hot northerly wind or a forecast of a summer day of 42 degrees to remind people of the pain and suffering that our community felt and then endured on Black Saturday. Many of the survivors I have spoken to over the past two years have told me that they just have to smell wood smoke and it is enough to spark some unwelcome memories for them and trigger a nervous reaction. But as the bushland is regenerating in Gippsland and as homes and public buildings have been constructed we need to remember that many people still face enormous personal battles as they rebuild their lives. As I said at the outset, we must never forget them and we must support them as they recover at their own pace from this disaster. As the member for Griffith indicated, this will be very much a defining moment in people’s lives. They will define their lives from what they did before the bushfires to what they have done after the bushfires. I think some people will not completely recover; others will recover at a different pace. But we need to be with them and support them in that process.
The bushfires of 2009 claimed 173 lives across Victoria, including 11 Gippslanders in very small communities like Callignee, Koornalla, Traralgon South, Hazelwood and Jeeralang. These were small communities where a lot of people knew the victims very well, so it was a blow to their families, to their friends and to a much wider community of people who were directly affected by the personal losses. I do not want to dwell too much on the past today, but it is important to remember the lives that we lost, the enormous destruction of homes and public facilities and just the sheer scope of the disaster as it spread right across Victoria.
In addition to the Black Saturday fires, my community suffered the previous week with 30 homes and 79 sheds destroyed in the Boolarra fire, which is often forgotten about by people outside Gippsland. By any estimation, the Boolarra fire itself was a terrible event which struck right across that district, but the size and scope of the disaster which followed just seven days later dwarfed the tragedy in Boolarra.
On this, the second anniversary of the bushfires, however, I can report plenty of positive news in my community. In Boolarra itself I recently attended the official opening of the new CFA sheds. It was a great tribute to the hard work of the local community and businesses which helped to sponsor the project. I wish we had the people of Boolarra building some of our other public projects throughout Victoria, because they achieved an enormous amount of value for money for their work. The way they pulled together and were able to build that facility is a real credit to the whole community. The official opening was a huge community occasion and a real celebration for the Boolarra district.
That has probably been the biggest positive to arise from the ashes of Black Saturday in Gippsland. Our communities really have pulled together. We have seen an enormous unity of purpose and community spirit on display across our region. We have certainly been challenged by the fires, but by no means have we been beaten. I would like to reflect on the words of some of the local people who have been directly involved in the recovery from the disaster, in some quotes from them on the second anniversary of Black Saturday. Ange Gordon, who is the former Traralgon South and District Community Recovery Committee chair, told the local media:
At the end of the day, you can reflect back (on the past two years) and say it has been long and hard but here we are and you can get bigger and stronger communities out of going through these adversities …
In a similar theme, Tineke Westwood, from the Traralgon South area, whose home was actually destroyed by the fires, said:
It’s not a fake positivity, I could be upset and cry and sulk, but what’s the point?
She said:
We’re a very lucky family because we’re alive, we got out on time.
Finally, the eastern region task force leader, Anthony Matters, who is assisting with the flood recovery efforts in Queensland, said:
It feels like we are part of a bigger community to lend a hand to those across the other side of the state …
He said:
Members came to our aid during the fires … it is fulfilling to be able to lend a hand.
In the time I have available I would also like to note the contribution by my state colleague the member for Morwell, Russell Northe. Russell’s efforts during the Black Saturday bushfires, the response phase and the long months of recovery have been quite extraordinary—an outstanding service to his electorate. I think that was reflected in the support he received at the recent state election. Often you do not know what to do as a local member in these situations. My heart goes out to the members from Queensland who experienced Cyclone Yasi and the flooding, along with the member for Mallee, in northern Victoria, and other members. When you have these natural disasters you really do not know what to do as a local member. Russell Northe was able to just be there for his people. Morwell is quite a small electorate, but he was able to be there for the people and offer them support, follow up on their concerns and chase down any assistance that was required, perhaps when it was not provided quickly enough. He did a power of work for his community, and I commend him for that. Russell recently spoke also in state parliament on the anniversary of the bushfires, and I will just reflect for a moment on a couple of comments he made. He said:
… I am absolutely filled with pride at the generosity and goodwill that has been displayed 1000 times over by so many wonderful people in the Gippsland community, to the extent that now many of those people are also extending their offer of support to those impacted by the floods in Queensland and Victoria.
That is something that we are very proud of. The people of Gippsland, despite the adversity they have been through, are now actively participating in the disaster recovery efforts around the state.
I would also like to commend the other members—the member for McEwen, who is in the chamber, and his predecessor, Fran Bailey, as well. I congratulate him, naturally, on winning the seat but I would also like to recognise the work that Fran did in probably one of the worst affected parts, if not the worst affected part, of the state. I know that a couple of times I had the opportunity to meet with Fran and other affected members, with the Prime Minister, and I can reassure the people of McEwen that they had a real champion in the room. She was very dogged in her pursuit of making sure that her community’s concerns were heard.
I would also like to commend my neighbour in Gippsland, the member for McMillan. He is another man who was very dogged in his determination to make sure that the people of McMillan were never going to be forgotten in the aftermath of the bushfires. And in his presence, I note the member for Maribyrnong who had charge of the bushfire reconstruction in a ministerial capacity. He also did a very good job in presenting the views of the Victorian community to the federal parliament. In many ways the recovery effort has become a guidebook on how to go about some of these things. I think we learned a lot as a nation on how to go about a disaster of this scale. I know the member for Maribyrnong believes that it has probably assisted him in his current role of dealing with flood disasters. We have learnt a lot from that experience and I will talk little bit about that in a few moments time.
I would also like to recognise the member for Indi and the member for Bendigo, whose electorates were also directly affected. I would also acknowledge the member for Wentworth, who at the time was the opposition leader, who came to Gippsland and spent several hours with me going around talking to people who were directly affected. There were no TV cameras or newspaper photographers there. It was just a matter of going out to meet with the affected communities and helping them gain some understanding. I know that he was struck by the ferocity of the fire. At one place, in Callignee, we came across a four-wheel drive where, on one side of the vehicle facing the fire front, the alloy wheels had melted and were lying on the ground in a pool of silver. On the other side of the car, not in the direct line of the fire front, there was still rubber on the tyres. It just goes to demonstrate that the radiant heat must have been extraordinary. Seeking any form of shelter for people caught in those fires would have been extremely difficult. I know the member for Wentworth was certainly struck by the extent of the damage and the ferocity of the blaze that had gone through the Callignee area.
I believe that the members of both sides of parliament were very strong in adversity but they only had to look at the communities across Victoria to draw inspiration. We had people who were doing such extraordinary things. The Minister for Foreign Affairs talked a moment ago about the number of people prepared to drive long distances just to be a part of it, just to provide some support to their fellow Australians in need. Everyone simply wanted to do their bit. This summer, we are again seeing people who are determined to assist the people across Queensland and northern Victoria who have been affected by flooding.
I still believe we have a long way to go though. On the second anniversary the rebuilding of private homes is continuing, but many families have suffered relationship breakdowns in the aftermath of the tragedy. The social costs that we are starting to see in our communities is something that perhaps goes unnoticed in this place. You can see a house rebuilt, you can see a community hall rebuilt, but the lives of families that have been directly affected are very difficult to repair. Some families have been torn apart in the aftermath of the tragedy.
We do live in a very fire prone environment in Victoria and there will always be days of high fire risk and summers which are hotter and drier than the one we are currently experiencing. But even during this comparatively mild summer there is a fire risk. Gippsland this year has experienced one major outbreak on 11,000 hectares, which burnt two houses and some sheds in the Tostaree region of East Gippsland. Thankfully though, there was no loss of life. I thank the firefighting personnel for their efforts in extremely difficult conditions on that day.
We will continue to experience bushfires in the future and it is up to governments, I believe, to do everything in their power to help prevent outbreaks wherever possible, to minimise the impacts of fires when they occur and to assist the communities as they recover—as we have done over the past two years. We simply must learn the lessons of 2009. One lesson which is patently obvious to me is that there needs to be an increased focus on fuel reduction burning. I note the commitment of the new Victorian government to treble the amount of burning it undertakes across Victoria. Fuel reduction burning will not prevent fires but it will reduce their intensity. Some extreme elements of the Greens have in the past opposed fuel reduction burning and the tragedy of Black Saturday seems to have silenced a lot of them. We need to undertake an extensive program of burning right across regional Victoria and on the suburban interfaces to protect life and property and to sustain the environment—and that is a point that is well worth making. The bushfires which raged across Victoria in 2009 were extraordinarily hot. They scorched the earth and devastated the natural environment as well as man-made structures in their path. The impact on wildlife will be impossible to calculate. As an environmental measure and for the protection of life and property we must commit ourselves to delivering an extensive fuel reduction program across Victoria and across our nation.
I am also concerned about the development of early warning systems. I believe we have to be very careful in the way that we portray these early warning systems to the broader public. We need to make sure that these systems, which have great merit, are not something that the public become dependent upon. They cannot be allowed to get to the situation where they believe they are going to get a warning of when to evacuate, that they are going to get some sort of message on their mobile phone telling them where the danger is and when they have to get out. It is simply not going to be achievable in much of the environment across Victoria. In many parts of Victoria we have mobile phone black spots where text messages, particularly in the most fire prone areas, simply will not get through. So we need to be very careful in the expectation we raise in the community about early warning systems.
I also think we need to make sure we do not scare people away from regional areas. Much of the commentary in the media in the aftermath of the bushfires was so extreme, warning of catastrophic days and extreme weather events as if you simply cannot visit parts of regional Victoria. I think that is a message that we need to be very careful about. We run the risk of destroying small business, destroying our tourism industry and scaring the tree changers—the people interested in moving to regional communities. We run the risk of scaring them away with some of these messages. You can live in regional Victoria. You can have a great life in regional Victoria. We need to make sure that people are well prepared for bushfire events, that they understand the risk but that we do not scare them away.
I also think that we need to remain vigilant and impose some very severe penalties upon those who deliberately light fires on days of extreme danger. I do not believe we have gone far enough with our efforts to protect the community from arsonists. I have sought a national database of arsonists to ensure that people who have committed such crimes in the past are subjected to increased monitoring in the future. These particular individuals are known to wait for the right conditions to light fires. If they are caught, part of their punishment needs to be ongoing scrutiny. It may sound draconian to some, but I would have no hesitation in supporting the development of a national database of high-risk offenders, including monitoring and surveillance measures and the use of electronic devices to track their movements for the rest of their miserable lives. The pain and suffering caused by deliberately lit fires demands extreme action to help protect our community from such criminal acts in the future. I urge both state and federal governments to think very seriously about how we are going to make sure that people who have committed such crimes in the past are constantly monitored, particularly on days when extreme fire events are possible. As we reflect on the 2009 bushfires, we must commit ourselves in this place to learning from the experience and doing everything in our power to prevent such a tragic loss of life in the future. I believe we owe that much to 173 victims and their families.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commemoration of the 2nd Anniversary of the Black Saturday Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,35,1
"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I would like to acknowledge the words of the member for Gippsland, who just spoke then, and put on record that he, along with other members of parliament, has worked continuously since the Black Saturday fires to help these communities reconstruct and recover.
On 30 July 2009 I described Black Saturday in this place as without a doubt the greatest peacetime disaster in Australian history. So it remains. Today, with this muddy wretched summer of 2010-11 still fresh in so many of our minds, it would be more than understandable for many Australians to be focused almost entirely on the natural disasters which we are still only cleaning up from and rebuilding. While all of us in this place have spoken formally to the condolence motion and what we have seen in recent times across much of Australia, the profound and enduring view remains in our society that the Victorian bushfires and the destruction of two years ago still remain the greatest peacetime disaster in Australian history.
It is fitting that parliament is formally remembering those whom we lost in the Victorian bushfires. I had the privilege to attend the second anniversary ceremony in Federation Square, and it was very well done. I believe that for many of the people who attended it was an opportunity to take another step on their personal paths to recovery. But in speaking here, and speaking softly, I am in firm admiration of the courage of the 33 distinct and very different Victorian communities representing 78 towns across Victoria who faced the wrath of Mother Nature as she tore through our beloved bushlands, towns and neighbourhoods.
A melancholy lesson for me in all this black horror of the bushfire tragedy was that the concept of a community itself perhaps has never been stronger, more evident or more inspiring than when a group of good people face great trauma, emotional and physical loss and acute economic stress. I speak here of many communities, each of whom experienced this disaster in its own different way. In doing so, I think at this point I would also like to acknowledge other members of parliament I worked with directly: the member for Ballarat, the member for McMillan, the member for Mallee, the former member for La Trobe and the current member for La Trobe, the former member for McEwen and the current member for McEwen. There was also, of course, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs; the former Prime Minister; and many at the state and local level who I will refer to later in my presentation.
But the community I most recall in all of this is of course the community of the bereaved. No fewer than 173 of our fellow citizens died in these fires; 40 were very injured. But each of the 173 whose lives were lost left behind them families and friends, workplaces, sporting clubs, classrooms and community groups that they had belonged to. These loved ones and local brethren who were so abruptly left behind still mourn and ponder and recover as individuals. But they also do this today as a very special community in and of themselves, and I do respect and revere each of them for their enduring resilience.
I said that there were 33 separate geographic communities. In their own distinguishing ways they comprise 78 towns that have had so many months and years of sifting through memories from ashes and recalling faces that are now gone. The towns and villages and many of the farms are still there, as are the roads and the yards and the hills and the creeks where people played and grew up, but there are things that are no longer there that are important too. It is not just the houses, but homes, and not just buildings, but livelihoods. These are now gone and these communities and their citizens are still finding their proper feet in so many different ways.
The rebuilding and the getting on with it in so many of these places have been a great credit to these districts and I think it honours the pioneering history of so many of the region’s ancestors. Again, I want to record my respect for each of these communities for their strength in adversity in testing times. With all this, these towns have re-affirmed the meaning of community and what it is to be good neighbours and each of them has helped their friends get on and travel through the darkness of the last two years.
There is another community which is central to this motion of condolence, and that is the volunteer community. It does not matter whether it was the SES or the CFA, the Lions and Rotary clubs or the other service groups, the Scouts, the Guides, the football and netball clubs, the various and vibrant people power of these Victorian communities has helped wage the battle and they helped pick up the pieces once the inferno passed. These volunteers have been great ambassadors for their communities and all together form a community of their own for which I have enormous admiration and gratitude.
While hearts and heroes of Black Saturday are the typical modest Australians too many to name, please let me also say that I believe that the leadership of Premier John Brumby in the aftermath of the event remains an example to all of us. I am pleased to have had the opportunity and the privilege in my former role as Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction to help make a contribution in the communities to which I have spoken. Many have made this contribution and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge Christine Nixon, who was the Chair of the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority, and her husband, John, who was beside her throughout all the long kilometres travelled and the meetings held.
I have referred to the bereaved community, but I should also acknowledge Carol Matthews’s leadership, and that along with her committee. There were over 30 community recovery committees established and all of them deserve recognition. I particularly recall some of the creative exchanges with people from Flowerdale and the people from Kinglake. I recall the hard work done at Callignee and at Traralgon South by those committees. I look at the work done at Marysville by Tony Thompson. I look at the work of David McGahy, the captain of the CFA brigade at St Andrews. I look at the work of Jenny Beale, who worked hard in the Kinglake community, and the work done by the community radio people and the Mountain Monthly.
I would also like to acknowledge some individuals whom I had the chance to work with. Ian Archibald from Labertouche worked very hard, and he is still doing it hard, I might add. I look at the remarkable Val and Vern Brown. Val has passed away since the fires, but Val and Vern worked and organised, and the work continues, with their beautiful granddaughter Madison, who lost her parents and sister in these terrible fires. Madison is recovering well but she has a tremendous battle. I would also like to acknowledge Koula Alexiades and the team at the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction Agency, who work so hard, and there were so many people there.
So many of these people I have mentioned—and there are so many more I should have mentioned but have not yet mentioned because time does not permit—on this journey of reconstruction, I believe, help underline what it means to be Australian. Coincidentally, a person who shares the surname with what was left behind so universally after the firestorm, the late Arthur Ashe, the former tennis great and social advocate, once said:
True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost.
I think many of us would agree that two years on from that terrible and terrifying day the many communities of the 2009 Victorian bushfires have served each other remarkably well with significant courage and now have found hope in the future, from the work of the Red Cross and the appeal fund now chaired by Pat McNamara through to every individual who has tried to make recovery. As the phoenix continues to rise over the Yarra Valley, the Dandenongs, Gippsland, the Victorian Alps and so many of our plains and forests, let us never forget what happened. Let us learn from the experience to protect ourselves from the inevitable recurrence of bushfire. Let us honour the fallen as we embrace those who are still with us.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I am very pleased to rise and speak in support of the Screen Australia (Transfer of Assets) Bill 2010. The purpose of this bill is to amend the name of the National Film and Sound Archive to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia. The bill also transfers part of Screen Australia’s film library and associated assets and liabilities to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia.
Following the establishment of Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive in 2008, it has become clear that the functions associated with Screen Australia’s film library and related sales and digital learning functions are best placed with the National Film and Sound Archive. Whilst this may appear to be an administrative change, I believe this will have significant benefits for Australia’s film industry. It will enable the NFSA to be internationally recognised as Australia’s premier audiovisual collecting institution. Anything that enhances the image of Australia’s film industry I believe is worth pursuing. As the immediate past chair of Screen New South Wales, formerly the New South Wales Film and Television Office, I strongly believe the Australian film industry is deserving of government support through a variety of measures and represents a valuable investment in both monetary and non-quantifiable terms.
It is useful to revisit first principles when we consider the role of government in the screen sector. A useful starting point is the statutory functions of Screen Australia. I refer to section 6 of the Screen Australia Act 2008, which includes amongst the functions of Screen Australia being to support and promote the development of a highly creative, innovative and commercially sustainable Australian screen production industry; to support or engage in the development, production, promotion and distribution of Australian programs and the provision of access to Australian programs; and to support and promote the development of screen culture in Australia. The charter and values of Screen New South Wales also neatly capture the contribution of the screen industry to both our culture and our economy. To paraphrase, the screen industry makes a significant contribution to our society socially, culturally and economically. Development and support of the screen industry is a necessary part of maintaining the vitality of our economy as a whole. Diversity in screen content, culture and creation is important. It is an important part of working towards creating opportunities for the widest possible diversity of people to participate in the making, viewing and appreciation of screen content. We live in the digital age. The world no longer sees screen as purely film or television. People now make, share and see moving images on digital formats and platforms at home, at work, at school, in the cinema and on the move in cars, planes and trains. We need to be flexible to adapt to the implications of the digital age. Our role is to stimulate compelling screen experiences and provide high-quality service to screen practitioners.
The Australian government has a comprehensive package of measures aimed at boosting support for the Australian film and television industry, of which the Australian screen production incentive is its primary mechanism. This provides tax incentives for film, television and other screen production in Australia and is available in three streams: the producer offset, to encourage the production of Australian film and television projects; the location offset, which is a 15 per cent rebate which supports the production of large-budget film and television projects shot in Australia; and the PDV offset, a 15 per cent rebate which supports work on post, digital and visual effects production, or PDV, in Australia regardless of where a project is shot.
There were two important changes to the offsets contained in the 2010-11 budget, a reduction in the minimum qualifying expenditure threshold for the PDV offset from $5 million to $500,000 and the removal of the requirement for production spending between $15 million and $50 million in Australia to spend at least 70 per cent of the total production budget in Australia in order to qualify for the location offset. Like, I am sure, those speakers who will follow in this debate, I am passionate about Australian film. I am sure we all have our favourites. They have made an important contribution to our cultural identity, from Breaker Morant to Picnic at Hanging Rock to Gallipoli, to name a few. In recent years, during my role as the former chair of Screen New South Wales, there have been some of the most beautiful and moving pieces that I have seen, such as Ivan Sen’s Beneath Clouds, Blessed by Ana Kokkinos and, from the 2010 Sydney Film Festival, Wasted on the Young—which I thought was the standout film. Then there are documentaries, television series and features and the burgeoning digital effects sector, for which Australia has rightfully earned a reputation for excellence.
A case in point is Animal Logic, the producers of the Oscar-winning Happy Feet. The 2009 DBCDE paper, Australia’s digital economy: future directions discussed Animal Logic as a case study of success, tracking its beginnings in advertising to attracting the best human capital, the necessary creativity and the right people of talent. It also discussed the issue of broadband. In the future directions paper’s interview with Greg Smith of Animal Smith, he said the following under the heading ‘how broadband changes the game’:
The continued growth of broadband infrastructure complements and supports Animal Logic’s business growth. In its ongoing advertising work, broadband capability allows commercials at a higher resolution and quality, which facilitates greater creativity and production values. When online advertising was primarily banner advertisements there was less scope, but with broadband, advertising can be the same or close to broadcast quality, which increases the creative potential.
This is important. He goes on to say:
With the rollout of high-speed broadband as part of the National Broadband Network, the ability to improve content production quality will only increase. Bandwidth requirements always grow to fill the available capacity. It can also give the company greater flexibility in how it manages its production facilities.
With high-speed broadband, Animal Logic’s work could, for example, be carried out seamlessly by pods working in different locations. It makes sense for Animal Logic to maintain its base in Fox Studios because it is convenient for the director and others shooting a movie nearby to quickly drop by and see how the visual effects are developing. However, allowing people to work in other locations around Sydney can increase the talent pool because it gives people greater choices in terms of cost of living, and travel time. Locating teams away from the inner-city of Sydney can also reduce business costs.
I regularly engage with practitioners in film industry circles who are excited about what the NBN will do to envigorate the sector. The case study of Animal Logic encapsulates some of the very real benefits that will be derived from the NBN for the arts sector.
As someone who remains passionate about the Australian film industry, it would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to acknowledge the present challenges being faced by the sector, particularly in the current climate of parity or near parity of the Australian dollar with the American dollar and the impact of that on the industry’s global competiveness. It is an unfortunate downside of the combination of our high dollar and our competitors matching or exceeding Australia’s production incentives. According to AusFilm, which commissioned an economic impact study of the Australian Screen Production Incentive program, $2.2 billion of inward investment has been generated in Australia under the scheme. Unfortunately however, today it is becoming, and in some cases it has become, financially unattractive for high-end international feature production in Australia. The result is a downsizing of the domestic industry, with wide-ranging negative impacts on everything from the skilled crew base to caterers to local impacts, particularly when you consider the boost that can be generated to local economies—particularly regional towns—by onsite filming.
I look forward to what I understand will be a comprehensive review of the offset scheme to address these very real concerns. Indeed, I note the announcement by Minister Simon Crean of 17 February at which he released his review of the independent screen production sector. It found significant improvement in the Australian screen and television industry and a major lift in government investment—in fact, government support has trebled from $136.7 million to $412.1 million in three years since the introduction of the Australian Screen Production Incentive.
However, the review also identifies several challenges and highlights that there are opportunities to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the screen tax offset in some areas. I also look forward to this review gathering as many submissions as possible from the sector and also from people like me who are passionate about film. Comments are invited until Friday, 11 March.
One thing is also clear, and I get this a lot from industry: international production crews love coming to Australia. I want to stress that because it is unfortunate that when it comes down to it money is the bottom line, not the quality of our crews and not the quality of our industry in Australia.
The second element of this legislation provides for the transfer of Screen Australia’s extensive archive of documentary films to the NFSA. Currently, Screen Australia’s film library includes over 5,000 films produced by its various predecessor agencies. The transfer of these assets is important because the NFSA has the professional archiving experience and facilities to preserve, curate and exhibit these films.
It is useful to remind ourselves of what we are dealing with when we consider the NFSA. It has more than 1.6 million items—over 330,000 audio recordings, over 440,000 moving images and over 870,000 associated documents. Some of these are of priceless national and cultural significance, such as the earliest surviving footage of the Melbourne Cup from 1897 and The Story of the Kelly Gang from 1906, which was indeed the first acknowledged feature film in the world. There is also the Indigenous collection. One of the very important functions of the NFSA is to collect, preserve and effectively manage the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures depicted through film and sound.
I want to tell a particularly pertinent story about film archiving. It is the story of the classic 1971 film Wake in Fright, directed by Ted Kotcheff, and how it was rediscovered. This film is the story of schoolteacher John Grant, who has an alcohol fuelled descent into hell one weekend in an isolated outback town. By the late 1990s the original negatives were thought to be lost. In 1996 the editor, Anthony Buckley, started searching for them. He located them in a bonded warehouse in London. But when he arrived to collect them he found that unfortunately the week before the canisters had been shipped to the US. He kept searching and eventually found the canisters of the original film in a set of dump bins, and 263 cans of film finally arrived at the NFSA from the US in two separate shipments in September 2004. A significant amount of work needed to be done on them to reconstruct and preserve the film. The NFSA did a fantastic job in undertaking this preservation work and in fact it was at the Sydney Film Festival in 2009, I believe, that it had a redigitised screening to a rapturous response. I was very fortunate to be there for that momentous occasion.
A large proportion of the NFSA material is stored as online education resources, which are a very effective tool for use in classrooms across the country. One of the most exciting parts of being a member of parliament is the opportunity to visit schools across one’s electorate. I have been fortunate to experience the benefits of an interactive classroom. The use of audiovisual material is becoming an increasingly important feature of education in the 21st century and, for this reason, it is essential that the NFSA is given the resources it needs to archive and preserve audiovisual material. It is essential that appropriate recognition is afforded to the authority so that it can continue to preserve an audiovisual record of our past, be it in films, television, news stories or documentaries. This is why this is an important piece of legislation, and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>SCREEN AUSTRALIA (TRANSFER OF ASSETS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I speak in support of the Screen Australia (Transfer of Assets) Bill 2010, which will transfer Screen Australia’s film library and related sales and digital learning functions to the National Film and Sound Archive, consolidating these collections. This bill deals with consequential and transitional matters relating to the transfer of staff, assets, liabilities and other matters to the NFSA. The bill also changes the name of the NFSA to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia.
As is well known, the Australian film and television industry has made an enormous contribution to the cultural life of our nation. The impact of quality cinema and television on the Australian community and the perceptions that the world has developed of our nation from exposure to this product cannot be overstated. Quality local television and film ensure that Australian children grow up watching local shows and films or at least have the opportunity to on our particularly good services such as ABC3. I recommend that all parents steer their children, if they watch TV, in that direction because there is a lot of Australian content there.
I think a frustration of many parents is that their children too often watch on TV imported product. While some of that is good, I think it is also very important from a parent’s viewpoint that children are exposed to their own country’s output. Australian children’s TV and films, both short and long, are some of the best in the world. I think they compare more than favourably with any of the imported products that come along. The other thing of course is that local production means jobs for people in Australia. The more locally made films and TV shows are promoted and shown at cinemas or on TV, the better it will be for people in the industry.
Films like Crocodile Dundee and television shows like Neighbours have made long-lasting impressions on the rest of the world of the Australian nature and character. Sometimes it is a little extrapolated but many times they get across the quirks that make our country the best in the world. Films that portray Paul Hogan as Crocodile Dundee live long in the memory. They have been used to advertise Australia year after year. Although some people might say that they are not the bee’s knees in arts films, they are certainly culturally important to Australia.
This bill is about the cultural heritage for current and future generations. Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive were established as separate statutory authorities on 1 July 2008. The agencies have completed over two years of operation as separate statutory authorities and in that time it has become clear that certain functions associated with Screen Australia’s film library and related sales and digital learning functions would be best placed within the National Film and Sound Archive. The film library of Screen Australia contains substantial archival resources. The National Film and Sound Archive, as Australia’s premier collecting institution for audiovisual material, is the agency that would best preserve and support the development and exploitation of this fantastic resource.
Screen Australia’s library has a collection of approximately 5,000 films and associated material produced by the former Film Australia Ltd and its predecessor agencies or acquired from third-party producers. I am sure we have all seen over the years many films that have been financed with the help of Film Australia. The library collection also has over 60,000 items on film, video, sound and digital file formats and 150,000 stills, which the Commonwealth owns the copyright of.
Spanning a century of Australia’s history, it is one of the largest and most historically significant sources of archival, documentary and Indigenous footage and stills. Providing support to the independent documentary sector, Screen Australia offers a zero-fee licensing initiative, offering all media worldwide in perpetuity rights for up to 10 minutes of footage and 40 stills of Screen Australia’s copyright materials without fee. During 2009-10, 36 local documentaries accessed footage and stills under the zero-fee licensing scheme. This greatly assisted our local industry. This support to the local industry and the preservation of this cultural heritage will be continued at the NFSAA.
The National Film and Sound Archive is the Australian government’s collecting institution for the nation’s audiovisual heritage. This national collection includes more than 1.6 million items. So, in addition to the disks, films, videos, audiotapes, phonograph cylinders and wire recordings, the collection includes supporting documents and artefacts such as photographic stills, transparencies, posters, lobby cards, publicity, scripts, costumes, props, memorabilia including sound memorabilia and video and film equipment. That is a very extensive collection, and of course no collection of that size can ever be totally put on public display. But it needs to be stored, it needs to be catalogued and it needs to be accessible one day so that Australian people can see it and see what our history actually contains.
The NFSA provide their collection for loan and conduct a number of preservation projects, searching for lost films and preserving our film and sound heritage. Through cutting-edge research and preservation practices, the National Film and Sound Archive has become internationally recognised as a centre of excellence for restoration and preservation of audiovisual material. The National Film and Sound Archive has leading-edge technical facilities and teams of expert technicians skilled in handling all audiovisual media. Although in these days of digital production and digital storage it is far too easy to burn things onto your own computer and have a back-up file somewhere, in many cases the materials that our old films and images are stored on are quite volatile and must be stored with proper archival practices; otherwise they can be gone for good.
Screen Australia is the key federal government funding body for the Australian screen production industry. Its functions are to support and promote the development of a highly creative, innovative and commercially sustainable Australian screen production industry. Screen Australia and the industry I would say have been enjoying not only recent success but ongoing success. In 2009, 1.4 million more Australians went to the cinema to see Australian films than in 2008—a 45 per cent increase—and that momentum continues. Screen Australia invested in several distinctively Australian films that performed well at the box office—films such as Bran Nue Dae, The Kings of Mykonos, Beneath Hill 60 and Animal Kingdom. These successes reflect Screen Australia’s focus on audience engagement, creative storytelling and increased screen business viability. In the two years since its inception, Screen Australia should be proud of its impact on the Australian film and television industry. Noting the success of Screen Australia and its core duties, it has become apparent that the role of maintaining a film and sound collection does not appear to be a core activity of Screen Australia, so, by transferring its collection to the National Film and Sound Archive, Screen Australia will be contributing to the expansion of the NSFA’s collection and will retain its focus on supporting the Australian screen production industry. The 60,000 films, documentaries, stills and other shows currently held at Screen Australia will significantly add to the collection at the National Film and Sound Archive.
The Screen Australia (Transfer of Assets) Bill 2010 also deals with staff and administrative matters related to the transfer of the collection to the NSFA. Any assets and liabilities specified by the minister at transition time will cease to be assets and liabilities of Screen Australia and will become assets and liabilities of the NFSA. The bill will ensure the transfer of relevant Screen Australia employees currently working in connection with the film library and will ensure that all their entitlements transfer over to the NFSA. It is very important that that is done properly when you are dealing with skilled people, especially in an area such as this, where there is a worldwide demand but not many opportunities for training to get new people into the industry. Current Screen Australia staff are non-APS employees engaged under the Screen Australia Act 2008. They will be transferred to the NFSA, subject to the Public Service Act 1999, all accrued staff entitlements to annual leave, personal leave and carers leave will be transferred to the NFSA, and staff will retain continuity of service.
In addition to moving the cultural collections to the NFSA, this bill will have the effect of changing the name of the NFSA by adding ‘of Australia’ to the end of it.
 (Ms AE Burke)—It being 6.30 pm, the debate is interrupted. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member may seek to continue his remarks at that time.",REPS,<title>SCREEN AUSTRALIA (TRANSFER OF ASSETS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I move this motion with much glee. In 1992 the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy sang: ‘Television, the drug of the nation. Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.’ I will give you the drum on this concept later in my speech. It is not news to people who know me—and my neighbours—but I am a strong supporter of the arts, especially writing and music. I am co-convenor, with Julie Owens, of the Labor Friends of the Arts. My bookshelves are packed to the rafters and my iPod has music from the four corners of the globe and includes all types except house. I say this to explain some of the history behind this motion.
For many years my good wife and I were addicted to a television police show from the United Kingdom, shown on ABC1 on Saturday nights. The show stretched right back to 1983. We have been clean for a while now. In fact, we went cold turkey on 16 October 2010. Our modern family is using my rehab journey to avoid all television and to rush out to engage with our local performers, our local artists and our local writers. Consequently, I encourage all Australians to turn off their TVs, to turn off Iron Chef or The Simpsons or Spicks and Specks or RocKwiz or MasterChef or Top Gear—whatever you are watching—to get off the couch and get closer to your local live performers. Do it today, tonight, tomorrow.
—Live theatre! Hear, hear!
—There will be singers in your local pub or actors in your local theatre. See a play. School ruined drama for many, but live theatre is well worth the effort, I am assured by the member for Braddon. So you think you can dance? Well, there is good live music just waiting for you to rage to right now at the end of your street. You will be the biggest loser if you do not act. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am not just talking about your generation; I am also talking about all ages. We should all get immersed in the arts and tell our offspring, our brothers and our sisters that from sunrise to Sunday night there is something for everyone.
The Australia Council for the Arts published a report last year called More than bums on seats: Australian participation in the arts. This report gave a good insight into the level of our engagement with the arts. It found that in 2009 nine out of 10 Australians had participated in the arts—either by creating the arts, like the member for Braddon, or appreciating them. Literature is the most popular, with 84 per cent of Australians reading novels or poetry, but fewer Australians are familiar with the performance arts. About 16 per cent of Australians participate in creative writing, seven per cent in writing a novel or short story and five per cent in writing poetry. Thankfully, more than half of all Australians attend live music performances. About 22 per cent attend musical theatre. Thirteen per cent attend classical musical performances and eight per cent attend the opera. About one in four Australians attend theatre, with 19 per cent attending contemporary theatre and 10 per cent physical theatre or circus. Sixteen per cent attend ballet or classical dance.
Smart insiders know that we need to increase these percentages. This is not just about keeping up with the Kardashians. Rather, it is about valuing the contribution of the arts and how they help to shape our nation. Whatever our customs, the arts help us understand who we are, from creek to coast, and tell our Australian story through drama, dance, opera and music—whatever the medium. Make no bones about it, through the arts, and particularly the performance arts, we are challenged, entertained and inspired, and we value this gift to the nation.
British arts administrator Sir John Tusa said it best:
The arts matter because they embrace, express and define the soul of a civilisation. A nation without arts would be a nation that had stopped talking to itself, stopped dreaming, had lost interest in the past and lacked curiosity about the future.
Australia’s got talent out there. You only have to go down to your local pub or theatre and you will find people who have put in the hard yards and are able to make a contribution, and they need an audience. We should all get away and enjoy these people’s performances. Last week James Jeffrey, a writer from the Australian, poked fun at part of this motion in the Australian newspaper. Hopefully, if he now sees the full context of the motion, he will agree that it totally fits the bill.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Australian Arts Community</title>,Private Members' Business,37,1
"McCormack, Michael, MP",NATS,2011-02-21,"—For decades, Saturday nights have found many of us called to the television. The familiar sounds of sirens, flashing blue lights, theme music and the iconic pictures of two police officers walking towards the screen could only mean one thing: The Bill was starting. The Bill, an English police drama which ran for 27 years, was once Australia’s most watched television drama. It stood the test of time as great shows before it slowly lost against the more popular reality TV. However, sadly in July last year England’s ITV announced that Sun Hill police station would be emptying their cells, removing their police uniforms and shutting their doors permanently. There was no fire, no terrorist attacks and no mass murder. The show, as simply as it started, ended.
During the eighties and nineties, when The Bill was in its heyday, it became a real family affair. Children were allowed to stay up longer, dessert was allowed in front of the TV and even the family pet was sneaked in to sit around and watch the latest events occurring in and around the fictional suburb of Sun Hill, set in the rather realistic backdrop of east London. The Bill started at a time when television drama was at its peak, competing with great Australian shows such as A Country Practice and The Sullivans and following on from great British comedies such as Are You Being Served? and Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The British writers went out on a limb to provide a different type of drama. Thus The Bill was born—a bird’s eye view into the goings-on of a busy London police station.

The Bill was not an obvious hit. It was decidedly unglamorous, featuring leaden skies and dingy council estates. It was only signed on to 12 episodes, as the BBC was unsure that the audience would take to seeing the happenings inside a police station. But fans were gripped by the lives and exploits of the officers of Sun Hill police station and the series drew praise for its suspense filled story-lines and tight scriptwriting. Unlike many TV shows today, the story-lines had depth and feeling and the puzzle was not solved in an instant. The characters built relationships with the audience, and many of the names and faces of The Bill’s past will be embedded in the minds of many Australians. Names such as PC Tony Stamp, Sergeant June Ackland, DC Tosh Lines, DS Jim Carver and DC Mickey Webb entered our living rooms so often and for so many years they became a part of the family’s Saturday night rituals. I always used to know that The Bill was starting because my mother-in-law would cut short teatime to go home and watch The Bill in the comfort of her own lounge room, and now I am going to have to endure my mother-in-law for longer, God love her, because there is no excuse to go home anymore.

The Bill served as a starting point for many English actors, as Neighbours and Home and Away do for Australians. However, for an Australian to portray a character in this drama was a rare yet significant move, and it is worth mentioning here one Australian actor, City Homicide’s Daniel MacPherson. The axing of The Bill is the final nail in the coffin for shows which do not have to run off short, quick story-lines to grab the audience’s attention. Two one-hour episodes per week was a sufficient amount of time to watch the Sun Hill crew work their way through a kidnapping, a murder or a drug charge in the Canley borough operational command unit in east London. Had they been solved in the mere half-hour that most dramas are allowed today, the depth of story would be lost.
Saying goodbye to The Bill for many Australians was like saying goodbye to an old friend. It was a poignant television show which became the mother of all police dramas, both Australian and English, that have branched from its concept. It seems that none that tried following in its footsteps did quite as well. Twenty-seven years for one show is no mean feat. I would like to see if any of the reality TV shows that we have to endure today will do nearly half as well.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Australian Arts Community</title>,Private Members' Business,37,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2011-02-21,"—I congratulate the members for Moreton and Riverina for their contributions. To be able to talk about the arts is a fantastic thing. We do not do enough of it in this parliament. I say to the Member for Moreton, to be criticised by some journalist for appearing to be flippant with this motion totally misses the point. I love the arts. I think if I had my life again, if I had enough talent, I would devote it to the arts. I might not be very rich in terms of money but I would certainly be very rich in terms of the spirit. In fact, I am currently directing my 16th musical, and I look forward to that going on in budget week whilst trying to match all the other responsibilities I have.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Tasmanian Regional Arts. It plays an important role in supporting both regional and community based arts practices in my home state of Tasmania. The organisation is unique in that it is the only state-wide arts service organisation in Australia funded by the Australian government’s Australia Council that is located in a regional centre—indeed, in the historic township of Latrobe, in my electorate of Braddon.
As a membership driven organisation, Tasmanian Regional Arts aims to excite and inspire regional communities through its work. The Tasmanian Regional Arts program of activities in 2011 is significant for what it does with limited resources. For example, the organisation provides information and advocacy support services; delivers an access and touring program to a wide variety of non-managed community run venues throughout Tassie; provides information and community arts support staff in our three major locations throughout Tasmania; and administers the important Commonwealth Regional Arts Fund.
In 2010 TRA brilliantly proved it could also produce significant arts products when it staged the seventh Regional Arts Australia national conference in Launceston. This conference, the largest arts conference in Australia, also played host to the Junction Arts Festival, where more than 47 major exhibitions, performances and activities engaged the host community and visitor alike and provided an economic boost of nearly $3 million to Tasmania’s regional economy.
Tasmanian Regional Arts intends to continue to develop on the Junction 2010 legacy in the state’s north through future participatory arts festivals of the highest calibre. Tasmanian Regional Arts plays a key role in the delivery of Commonwealth support to the regions through its management of the Regional Arts Fund. Indeed, this program supports local and regional artists to access resources through a three-tiered program of assistance that is both relevant and cost-effective in its delivery. I have been advised through representations from Tasmania Regional Arts that through its national agency, Regional Arts Australia, the organisation believes the current delivery mechanisms for the fund through the state agencies is a preferred delivery model for the fund and that the Regional Arts Fund, along with other programs such as Playing Australia and Festivals Australia continue to be delivered under current arrangements.
Tasmanian Regional Arts recognises the need to diversify and expand its income and revenue streams in response to the limitations facing all levels of government in supporting the arts. I strongly commend TRA for its success in securing a broad range of state and local government partnerships, as well as significant philanthropic support and sponsorship for its program of activities. Through the delivery of initiatives such as the Regional Arts Fund, ongoing festival and event developments, a strong and creative touring program and the provision of the regional arts development offices, Tasmanian Regional Arts has played and continues to play a significant role in arts and cultural development across my state. I thank TRA for the excellent work it does on what is a limited budget.
Finally, I would like to thank all of those artists in Australia who provide entertainment and their skills for us. Indeed, they are a conscience and a mirror of what makes Australia what it is. I would like to thank in particular all those artists who live in regional Australia and provide their services and their skills to those of us in regional Australia. I know regional Australia is very much like where I live: very talented people enjoying their lifestyle and supporting their communities. We, as the government, should do all we can to support them and to make their job a lot easier. I thank them for their contribution.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Australian Arts Community</title>,Private Members' Business,37,1
"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—It is my pleasure to take this opportunity to speak on a subject that I am extremely passionate about—that is, the promotion of the arts. It takes me back to my childhood days, in particular some of the first television shows that I recall on Australian television. I remember a small town community production, and the television show was called Bellbird. It was about a small town community and nothing much happened in Bellbird. It was a show about nothing but it captured the minds and the souls of everyone here in—do I keep going?
 (Ms AE Burke)—You keep going. The member for Wannon has missed his call and will not get an opportunity to speak. The member for Dawson has the call.
—Wright.
—It is a lesson for us all!
—I recall back in my youth watching the Australian production of Bellbird. I recall fondly that we used to use the characters as role models. Some of the characters elude my mind now, but I remember watching the show in black and white, before colour TV came out, with anticipation. Later on, as we step forward probably 10 to 15 years—and I do not know what category this show would fall into, but it was also another Australian production and one of the leaders of its time in variety or quiz shows—I take your minds to Blankety Blanks, a panel show of Australian celebrities hosted by a number of artists—
Honourable members interjecting—
—Yes. Graham Kennedy and Ugly Dave Gray—it takes my mind to a spot where Ugly Dave Gray would often hold a large Cuban cigar in his mouth while at production, a far cry from the television that we watch today.
Ladies and gentlemen, I share with you also with reference to my own family and person. I have a 14-year-old daughter, and sometimes I become disillusioned with Australian television and, in particular, international television, where sometimes it is difficult after 7.30 of an evening to find a show where someone is not getting shot or murdered. Sometimes you cannot find a television show where someone is not being cut up on an operating table, if that is not your thing. Whilst we do have some good Australian dramas—with reference to operating, RPA is an Australian one, and I think that one goes all right—

An honourable member—The Young Doctors.
—The Young Doctors is another good one from many years ago, and Matron Sloane played the role extremely well.
With reference to the promotion of the arts here in Australia, not only do we have television but we also have some of the classics of screen and theatre. Who in this generation does not remember or has not seen the production of Mad Max? It is the film that launched the career of Mel Gibson.
—What a fine actor!
—A fine actor, indeed so. He has launched his career onto the international stage, on which he has done Australia extremely proud in some of his productions. Some of his personal attributes off screen have not been too much, but when he is doing good things he is Australian and when he is playing up he is—
—American.
—American, absolutely! Again with reference to the arts, I want to support some of the more subdued films that are the old classics of Australia, such as Picnic at Hanging Rock. It was one of the first productions that gave us the capacity to see inland Australia and regional Australia.
—Gallipoli.
—Gallipoli was one of the all-time greats, along with Breaker Morant.
—Priscilla!
—The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. I have time to tell you a quick story about Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
—Steven Ciobo nominated that one.
—Order!
—As far as the arts go, with reference to the wonderful crews and everything that are a part of this industry, in 2000 there was the Year of the Outback muster from Birdsville down to Marree. The catering team that worked on that drover’s camp worked out of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert’s bus. It is a catering bus now, and it worked on the McLeod’s Daughters set in South Australia. It is a catering bus that now works in the Australian film industry promoting the arts. Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for your indulgence—
—I thank the member for Wright for his entertainment this evening! The time allocated for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Australian Arts Community</title>,Private Members' Business,37,1
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2011-02-21,"—Tonight I raise a grievance on behalf of the people of Port Stephens in relation to aircraft noise. They have been promised so much by Gillard Labor, but it has failed to deliver time and time again. When the Australian government decided to deliver the new Joint Strike Fighter to RAAF Williamtown, planning was started to test the impact on nearby residents and the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast 2025 was promulgated. This noise map had major implications for residents of Port Stephens who live within proximity of the air base. Not only did it show that noise levels would increase, it placed many properties within restrictive zones that would affect their ability to build. Because of the ANEF 2025, many people will not be able to build on their own blocks without insulation, which costs tens of thousands of dollars. Many will not be able to extend. Some will not be able to build at all, which means that if their house burns down they will be left with a property they can never live on again. So when I talk about the impact of the ANEF I am talking about people’s livelihoods. A house is the most valuable asset most people own. To have its value stripped is devastating. It is even more devastating when the government just does not seem to care that there are other options available. This currently seems to be the case with Gillard Labor.
I do not say this without just cause. In fact, the Gillard Labor government has such a long list of failures on this issue that it would be laughable if it were not so tragic for those affected. Allow me to illustrate. Firstly, the ANEF 2025 was released. This is a binding document used for planning decisions, which means it is affecting people’s properties now even though the Joint Strike Fighter will not be delivered for at least three years. Soon after, the 2010 federal election campaign began. Jim Arneman, Labor candidate for Paterson, issued a joint press release on 2 August with then Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, Dr Mike Kelly. It pledged that a re-elected Gillard government would ‘review and replace the current 2025 ANEF with a new ANEF to be issued before the end of the year’. Julia Gillard stood on the floor of parliament and recommitted to that promise on 24 November, saying, ‘I am very happy to stand by local promises we made.’
The Prime Minister also visited Lakeside Tavern in my electorate and told journalists she would honour her promises for Paterson. She enjoyed a beer at the tavern with the defence minister himself, while close to a thousand people gathered at the Raymond Terrace Bowling Club for a public meeting on this issue literally down the street. That meeting and many before it was attended by hundreds of people, and I thank Paul LeMottee and the SAFE-EARS group for organising the forum. Despite repeated assurances from the endorsed Labor candidate, the parliamentary secretary and the Prime Minister herself, the ANEF 2025 has not been lifted to this day. That means that, not only has Labor misled my constituents, it has misled the parliament. That is broken promise number one. I will move on to number two.
In early October we were advised that a new Australian Noise Exposure Concept had been generated. The new ANEC took into account more flights over the ocean rather than homes, as a direct result of a different instrument landing system. Labor had not even suggested that Defence examine the viability of such an ILS before I suggested it to them after consultation with local experts. I was advised at the Williamtown Consultative Forum that the ANEC would be released by 15 October, but when October came and went, Labor still had not released the map. It sat on someone’s desk until the 12 November. But that is not even the worst part. Next, Senator David Feeney, who has been placed in charge of this issue, told media that the release of the ANEC fulfilled Labor’s pre-election promise to replace the ANEF. The Newcastle Herald reported on 1 January:
A spokeswoman for the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, said the concept map fulfilled the Prime Minister’s promise.
That is simply not the case. To clarify: the crucial difference between an ANEC and an ANEF is that an ANEC is a scenario based concept draft, while an ANEF is an official forecast of noise exposure patterns on which planning authorities base their controls. An ANEF also affects things such as property valuations and 149 certificates. Therefore, an ANEC is never a suitable substitute for an ANEF. The fact that Senator Feeney thinks so shows that he does not understand the issue at all. Either he cannot understand or he cannot be bothered to understand.
Now to broken promise No. 3. I have been contacted by thousands of constituents over this issue. I have spent countless hours researching, reading, talking to people, making maps, hosting meetings, discussing solutions, making representations and generally doing everything I can to understand the issues. That includes understanding the intricate differences between the impact on Oyster Cove, Medowie, Medowie East, Medowie West, Lakeside, Riverview Ridge, Raymond Terrace, Brandy Hill, Grahamstown and Salt Ash. I believe that is nothing more than my responsibility as the member for Paterson.
As a result, I arranged to meet with Senator Feeney to explain the myriad different issues. At that meeting Senator Feeney pledged to work with me. He has spoken many times since about working in a bipartisan manner to achieve a solution. Yet it is now clear that was another commitment Labor never intended to keep. When Senator Feeney visited my electorate last Thursday, 17 February, to talk about this issue he never even advised me of the meeting, let alone invited me along to the meetings with my constituents. If the senator had contacted me, I would have been able to explain to him the difference between an ANEC and an ANEF and their effect on my constituents. I would also have been able to explain the latest crucial need of my constituents, which is an extended consultation period for the Williamtown RAAF Base environmental impact statement. The EIS affects the future introduction of the JSF and it is therefore crucial that locals get the chance to comment, yet many people found out about it just days before the consultation period was due to close. It was not even advertised in local media. Senator Feeney came, he talked and he left. He did not use the visit to lift the ANEF as promised, nor did he use the visit to extend the EIS consultation period. So much for working together to do what is in the best interests for local people. Labor is fantastic at saying what it thinks people want to hear. Unfortunately, it is not so good at achieving outcomes. Sadly, this is not unique to federal Labor.
The Labor candidate for the state seat of Port Stephens also seems intent on talking up the issue, without actually taking any action. Kate Washington has repeatedly promised to do whatever she can to alleviate the effects of the Joint Strike Fighter. Yet not only has she supported the Kings Hill development, which jeopardises future changes to the flight path, she has also failed to do anything to pressure her own colleagues who are in the government in New South Wales. Those colleagues have the power to change state planning laws to allow grandfathering. The grandfathering rule would allow current property standards to remain in place, even after the introduction of the Joint Strike Fighter. It is heavily supported by my constituents. I have seen many press releases from Ms Washington’s camp, based on council issues which she has absolutely no control over whatsoever. Yet I have not seen one in which she asks her own state colleagues to examine planning laws. Clearly, Kate Washington is following the line of her federal colleagues, saying what is popular but not doing anything to actually help people. She is not part of the solution; she is part of the problem.
My intention today is to hold Labor to account and to call on it to take some much-needed action. The people of Port Stephens deserve much more than is currently being offered. Those who have worked tirelessly on this issue also deserve better. In particular, I thank Andrea Pitt of Save our Castle; Paul LeMottee of SAFE-EARS; Scott Broadhead and Sue Hirsh of the West Medowie group; and members of Save Oyster Cove, including Brian Coleman.
It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people in Port Stephens do not want Williamtown RAAF Base moved and they know how important it is to our local economy. They simply want what is fair. After all the hours they have put in on behalf of their neighbours, after hundreds of representations made to the Minister for Defence, they deserve nothing but full commitment from those elected to represent them. At the very least, they deserve to be able to trust their state and federal governments—trust that, when they make a promise, they will follow through on it.
During the first sitting of this parliament, after Julia Gillard was elected Prime Minister, I hand-delivered to her office a letter detailing my four-point plan on aircraft noise. I remain committed to that plan and, despite everything that has happened, I am still more than happy to put politics aside and help resolve this issue that is important to my constituents. Senator Feeney, you are welcome in my office at any time. I look forward to your visit. If that is too much trouble, I am happy to meet with you in your Senate office to resolve this issue for my constituents of Paterson.
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—I was reluctant to interrupt the member for Paterson, but I draw his attention to standing order 64 and the fact that he ought to refer to the Prime Minister by her title and not by her name.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Airport Noise</title>,Grievance Debate,38,1
