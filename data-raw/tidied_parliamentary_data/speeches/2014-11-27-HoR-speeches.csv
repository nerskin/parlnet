Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (09:39):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee's report on foreign investment in residential real estate together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.




Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).





Ms O'DWYER:
  by leave—I am very pleased to be presenting the economics committee report on foreign investment in residential real estate. Residential housing has been, and will always be, an issue that is at the forefront of community debate and discussion. Owning your own home is part of the great Australian dream. For many, it represents the opportunity to build a future. It represents connection with community and security for family. Buying into the Australian dream does not come cheap. According to a recent International Monetary Fund report, the current ratio of housing prices in Australia to average incomes is 31.6 per cent above the historical average. Is it any wonder then, that many Australians now worry that home ownership may be out of reach for them, their children, or their grandchildren? At the same time, Australians worry about rental and interest costs, and their impacts on the cost of living.


There is no one simple explanation for the decline in housing affordability, although lack of land supply, underdevelopment, state planning laws and regulations, local council red tape, and stamp duty and tax arrangements likely all play a part.


Over the years, however, many in the community have asked the question: what role does foreign investment play in residential real estate? It was timely then that on 19 March this year the Treasurer, the Hon. Joe Hockey MP, commissioned the House economics committee to examine: the benefits of foreign investment in residential property; whether such foreign investment is directly increasing the supply of new housing and bringing benefits to the local building industry and its suppliers; how Australia's foreign investment framework compares with international experience; and whether the administration of Australia's foreign investment policy relating to residential property can be enhanced.


Under our current foreign investment framework, as it applies to residential real estate, foreign investment is channelled into new housing so that more homes, units and apartments are built—meaning more opportunity for people to purchase. It also contributes directly to economic activity, generating employment for builders and suppliers.


When it comes to existing homes, there are generally prohibitions and restrictions. Non-resident foreign investors are prohibited from purchasing an existing home, and temporary residents—on visas of more than 12 months—can purchase just one existing home to live in while they are resident in Australia, but must sell this home on their visa expiring. All purchases, whether new or existing homes, are required to be prescreened by the Foreign Investment Review Board, supported by the Foreign Investment and Trade Policy Division of Treasury.


According to FIRB statistics, in the first nine months of this financial year, FIRB approved foreign investment into residential property of around $24.8 billion—44 per cent higher than the $17.2 billion approved during all of 2012-13.


Much of this investment is concentrated in the Melbourne and Sydney markets. Most of the increase is attributable to proposed investment in new property, which at $19.3 billion for the first nine months of 2013-14 is 79 per cent higher than 2012-13. The total number of established property approvals for the first nine months of 2013-14 is 5,755 compared to 5,101 for 2012-13.


Over six public hearings, and after considering more than 92 submissions, the committee has four key findings that translate into 12 practical recommendations. First, there is no accurate or timely data that tracks foreign investment in residential real estate. No-one really knows how much foreign investment there is in residential real estate, nor where that investment comes from. A national register of land title transfers that records the citizenship and residency status of all purchases of Australian real estate would fix this and would allow facts to be injected into discussions about foreign investment, rather than just 'best guesstimates'. A national register would also help with compliance and enforcement with the foreign investment framework, allowing data to be compared more easily. Other relevant government information should also be captured and made available to FIRB. At present, FIRB cannot access data from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection on departing visa holders. Given the government has this information, this makes no sense. Together, these initiatives would allow authorities to track departing visa holders who may have purchased an existing home but who, under current rules, need to sell that home within three months of leaving.


Second, there has been a significant failure of leadership at FIRB, which was unable to provide basic compliance information to the committee about its investigations and enforcement activity. During the course of the inquiry, it came to light that no court action has been taken by FIRB since 2006. During the entire Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, not one divestment order was issued, which means not one government sale of illegally acquired property was made. This compares with 17 divestment orders between 2003 and 2007, when foreign investment in residential real estate was at much lower levels. FIRB was also unable to provide basic data on voluntary divestments. It defies belief that there has been universal compliance with the foreign investment framework outlined above since 2007. The systems failure at FIRB needs to be repaired and new resources need to be injected into FIRB to ensure better audit, compliance and enforcement outcomes.


Third, if you are not prepared to enforce the rules, then it is less likely that people will comply with the rules. This is especially true if the consequences of a breach are not meaningfully adverse. The ability to more easily sanction people who have breached the foreign investment framework is critical. Hence, the need to bring in a civil penalty regime for breaches of the foreign investment framework, along with the need to capture those people who have previously stood outside the framework but who materially impact the integrity of our foreign investment regime—for instance, third parties who knowingly assist foreign investors to breach the rules.


Currently, non-resident foreign investors can profit from the illegal purchase of property. Given this, the current financial penalty that can be applied to a property, regardless of its value, is seen by many as simply the cost of doing business. Fines and pecuniary penalty orders should directly relate to the value of the property concerned. Furthermore, investors who breach the framework should not be able to profit.


Fourth, currently the Australian taxpayer foots the bill for the administration of the FIRB and FITPD, not foreign investors applying for approval. This has, arguably, contributed to underinvestment in FIRB's audit, compliance and enforcement activities. Just as other regulators adopt a user-pays model, the committee recognises that a modest administration fee can be implemented to fund enhanced audit, compliance and enforcement capacity within FIRB, as well as other new measures outlined in the recommendations.


The Parliamentary Budget Office analysis suggests that a modest application fee of $1,500 would generate revenue of $158.7 million over four years, yet amount to 0.27 per cent or 0.20 per cent of the purchase price for an average home in Melbourne and Sydney respectively. These practical measures will send a strong message about Australia's commitment to its foreign investment framework in practice as well as in words.


This is important. Too often, the signals in recent years have been in the opposite direction. For instance, in 2008, then Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Chris Bowen MP, removed the requirement for temporary residents to notify FIRB of all residential purchases. This rule change allowed temporary residents to purchase existing homes without notifying FIRB. Perhaps recognising that this neutered FIRB's capacity to monitor compliance with the sale on departure condition under our foreign investment framework, his successor, Senator the Hon. Nick Sherry, reversed the change and, in the lead-up to the 2010 election, announced a range of proposed measures to tighten monitoring and enforcement. Some of them are not dissimilar to those being recommended by the committee. Regrettably, most of those announced measures were not pursued by his successor, the Hon. Bill Shorten MP, nor by any of the subsequent assistant treasurers in the last government. The committee strongly recommends that the government pursue the package of measures canvassed in this report. 


Given the recent successes in delivering free trade agreements for the benefit of Australia, lest there be any confusion it is important to note that residential property has never been part of any free trade agreement. Accordingly, none of the recent agreements with Japan, South Korea and China impact the screening arrangements for residential property.


In conclusion, the committee found that the current foreign investment framework should be retained. In practice, the framework has been undermined due to poor data collection, along with a lack of audit, compliance and enforcement action by FIRB. Australians are entitled to expect that the rules are properly enforced, and our committee recommendations strengthen the ability to do this.


I would like to acknowledge and thank all of those people who have helped inform this inquiry. In particular, I thank those people and organisations that made submissions and presented evidence; those who sent letters and provided their views; the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Budget Office for their efficient professionalism; and of course, members of the committee, who took a very collegiate approach to this task. Special thanks go to committee secretary, Mr Peter Banson; inquiry secretary, Dr Kilian Perrem; and the House Standing Committee on Economics secretariat team for their diligent work on this report and their willingness to assist both the chairman and committee members to enable the report to be as comprehensive as possible. Finally, I give a thank you to my incredibly hardworking staff, Tania Coltman and Sarah Nicholson, for their consistently excellent work.


I look forward to the government's response to this report and the many practical recommendations that are contained in it. I commend the report to the House.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (09:50):  by leave—I also extend my thanks, on behalf of members of the Standing Committee on Economics, to the committee secretariat for all their hard work and their continued diligence. It is very much appreciated. However, I must say the one good thing about this inquiry is that it is over. It was an inquiry less focused on good policy and more on glaring publicity. Three things underpinned it. Firstly, there was a highly questionable and alarmist report by Credit Suisse into projected levels of Chinese foreign investment in residential property; secondly, there was a constant attempt to prove that there were systemic flaws within the way FIRB was enforcing compliance with investment laws; and thirdly, and levering off this last point, there was an obsessive drive to introduce a new tax on foreign investors at a time when the focus should be on improving trade and investment relationships.


Inquiries can be very useful means to spotlight areas demanding reform or improvement, but they need firm foundations to achieve this. This inquiry was sparked by an exaggerated publicity-seeking report by a firm you would expect better of, Credit Suisse. In March, Credit Suisse issued claims that inflated the projected scope of likely Chinese investment in residential property. When the committee sought to question them on the report, they had to be dragged to the inquiry to appear, which is not surprising, because they were no doubt embarrassed by their own claims. They used flagrantly emotive language in their report, including claims that 'The Chinese want to buy your house' and 'The dragon discovers the quarter acre dream'. This fanned reporting of contestable claims that $44 billion of Chinese investment would be ploughed into Australian residential real estate. After sustained questioning at a public hearing we learnt that Credit Suisse had included in its calculations purchases made by permanent residents who were of Chinese background. A lot of people would wonder how permanent residents can be classified as foreign investors. It defies belief.


The problem is that this type of hype reporting helped prompt this inquiry, and the inquiry then became a launching pad for a new tax grab. Make no mistake, the coalition wanted to grab a much bigger tax slice out of foreign investors than was finally recommended. You only have to refer to the media coverage generated during the course of the inquiry to know this to be the case. The new tax has been scaled back for now. What this inquiry heard on countless occasions was that foreign investment adds to housing supply in this country. It generates demand, spurs growth in jobs and economic activity. It is beneficial to the nation and our economy.


The rules around foreign investment in residential real estate are clear-cut. It is permissible for new developments, and strict rules prohibit the purchase of existing residential property other than for temporary residence. Whilst some marginal changes can be contemplated to these rules, there was little evidence submitted to the inquiry of widespread, systemic noncompliance. This is despite the fact that FIRB's compliance capabilities were subjected to regular public criticism by the coalition and little procedural fairness was extended to FIRB to put public criticisms directly to them and allow them to respond. It was extraordinary that the minister with direct oversight of FIRB and Treasury, no-one less than the Treasurer himself, either failed to defend them from these criticisms or he was happy for his coalition colleagues to launch them. Even more extraordinary was that after the coalition levelled those criticisms the report acknowledged that FIRB has an advisory role, and Treasury needs to shoulder more responsibility for compliance.


The concerns about compliance are being used to justify an up-front impost on investors. I would make a number of points about this. First, the government has to work out if it is in favour of foreign investment or not. It has driven foreign companies, such as Holden's, out of the country, it has blocked investment proposals, such as GrainCorp, and now it wants to siphon funds out of foreign investors. No-one for one minute should be fooled by the words used in this report of a 'modest application fee', which, by the way, the coalition tried to suggest would be between $500 and $1,500, and today it is a firm $1,500.


You cannot trust that this government, which has introduced a range of surprise new taxes or sudden tax increases, will not be tempted to milk revenue out of these investors at a higher rate down the track. The coalition argue that they will use the funds raised by the impost to improve compliance. This does not stack up. There is scope for the Australian National Audit Office, for example, to be engaged to review compliance processes and procedures utilised by both Treasury and FIRB. ANAO can and does conduct performance reviews and could have easily been engaged, and recommended to have been engaged, to assess the way that both Treasury and FIRB undertake compliance and determine if resource allocation for this activity is appropriate. In fact, it should be recommended that ANAO consider doing this as a matter of course ahead of the imposition of any new fee or tax. I would certainly urge them to consider this. They can undertake the activity and they, again, should consider to do so. But all of these reasonable suggestions have been ignored by a coalition determined to find new taxes.


Some of the other recommendations will have questionable effect. The big issue with data in this space is time lag—the distance between an intent to purchase and construct and then the actual construction occurring. A new national register that simply logs residential status of investors will probably do little to alter or change the impact of data lags in this area. While some good might have a chance to emerge from the inquiry, and some modest compliance measures might see the light of day, one hopes this report dissolves from memory, and fast.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra—Chief Government Whip) (09:57):  I rise to speak to the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The government has introduced a package of reforms to the Corporations Law to reduce regulatory burden and improve productivity and competitiveness. What I really want to talk about is why this bill is part of an overall package and why it is of fundamental importance to the future of this nation.


I listened to some comments in another context by one of my colleagues, and I am very worried about the personal future of members of the opposition. I am very worried about whether or not they will be able to continue to play a role in public life in this country if they pursue in their personal affairs the arrangements they want this nation to pursue. They see it as being desirable that we should budget for consumption and spending where we do not have the income available. They want us to essentially go out to dinner every night and simply put the tab on our bank card or on our mortgage. If you conducted your personal affairs in the way in which they want the affairs of the nation to be run, you would not be able to survive. When I make this point about their personal affairs, let me just say I am reasonably satisfied that in their personal affairs they would try to ensure that they live within their means, but when it comes to the nation it is regrettable that we do not see the same approach being taken. 


I speak to many people around my electorate and they do appreciate very much that the country has to live within its means. In looking at that issue, it is not just how much you spend that is relevant; it is how you go about the earning of your income that is equally important. They are concerned in their businesses about unnecessary costs which make them less competitive and make their businesses more difficult to sustain. I must say that, in my own electorate, people are gratified that we have been able to make some changes in relation to the carbon tax. They are glad that it has gone, because that has made their businesses more competitive. But, equally, the sorts of measures that are contained in this legislation are absolutely important to them, because they find that a lot of the reporting that they have to make builds costs into their businesses, and that makes it extraordinarily difficult for them to be able to effectively carry out those businesses. 


In my 41 years in this House, I have never seen such a determined approach by a government to reduce the regulatory burden. What we have seen with the removal of regulations is the freeing up of businesses to be able to do what they do best. I commend the member for Kooyong, the parliamentary secretary, for the work that he is doing in this regard. He is committed to tackling the volume of regulation, which is already too high. It is essential that we do ensure that our businesses remain competitive. I would simply say that this is not a job that has been finished. In an earlier life I was the Attorney-General of Australia, and I was able to work with the states to put in place a single defamation code. The importance of that was that it stopped forum shopping around Australia. When it was put in place, it meant that the volume of litigation was significantly reduced. I am a lawyer. I do not mind litigation, but sometimes litigation can be very unnecessary and very unhelpful. 


I was very much focused on personal property securities. We had something like 80 different pieces of legislation across all the states and territories of Australia for personal property securities. You can think of them: bills of sale, hire purchase, maritime liens and floating charges. When you put the myriad different forms of personal property securities across all the states and territories it meant that businesses trading across state and territory boundaries would often have to get complex legal advice about floating charges that they might have over their stock. I can remember a firm that ran a hotel in Mount Gambier and a hotel in Geelong, and they had to get advice because the floating charge over their stock-in-trade was different under South Australian and Victorian law. We are, I might say, somewhat belatedly now—I do not think I have been the Attorney for seven years—seeing a single scheme of personal property security being implemented. 


I would encourage the government to continue looking not only at its own regulatory burdens that it imposes upon people but also at the multiplicity of regulatory burdens that are as a result of our Federation. I do not think our Federation arrangements were intended to inhibit successful businesses operating in Australia or to reduce their economic competitiveness, but I suspect that a lot of the regulatory burden which is so often unnecessary imposes those costs. So I do commend the member for Kooyong for his hard work in addressing these issues. 


I think this bill, which I will go to, deals with a number of issues that will help to improve our economic competitiveness. If we improve our economic competitiveness, businesses are more successful. Hopefully, they end up paying more taxes. That is helpful for the Commonwealth. It helps our budgetary position. It enables the government to more effectively live within its means. I think we ought to be talking about how governments can live within their means, and I think we need to be quite lateral in the way in which we do it. We need to look at our expenditures. I encourage members of the opposition to come forward. I listen all the time to hear from them as to ideas they have about the way in which we can structure our budget more constructively. I do listen. I don't hear it.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  You don't hear very much. 




Mr RUDDOCK:
  No, I don't. I do listen. But it is also important that they support measures of this sort that will help boost our economic competitiveness. This bill is about reducing business compliance costs by something of the order of $14 million per year. It contains measures to improve the efficiency of those processes which companies have to meet. They will better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with the company and the costs of companies being required to call and hold general meetings. It will improve the remuneration reporting requirements. It will clarify the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months. It will exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. It will improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel. It will extend the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration setting responsibility to include certain statutory bodies. 


If I can go to some of those particular measures, there is the abolition of the 100-member rule. The government is removing the requirement for directors of a company to hold a general meeting on the request of 100 shareholders. It seeks to strike a better balance between the interests of minority shareholders and the shareholders as a whole, because all of these meetings involve costs which can be quite significant. In large corporations the 100-member rule allows groups holding less than what we can call one per cent of voting shares to force a company to incur significant costs in holding meetings. That has to be questioned. This particular issue is supported by both industry stakeholders, including the Institute of Company Directors, the Governance Institute of Australia and the Business Council of Australia, as well as shareholder groups such as the Australian Shareholders Association. The measure is expected to save businesses around $1.5 million per annum in compliance costs. Isn't that a desirable outcome? 


In relation to remuneration reporting, the government is improving the disclosure of executive remuneration information in Australia by ensuring that it is provided in a form that is useful to shareholders and investors. The measure removes the requirement for unlisted disclosing entities to prepare a remuneration report. This measure is estimated to save unlisted entities from disclosing about $8.5 million in compliance costs. The remuneration report is simply not relevant to those agencies, but it is a regime that imposes very significant and unnecessary costs.


In issues relating to auditor-appointing requirements, the government is removing the nonsensical requirement for certain companies limited by guarantee, which are not required to undertake an audit, to appoint an auditor—that is, you are not required to audit, but you have to appoint an auditor. How ridiculous! Currently all public companies are required to appoint an auditor, even if they are not required to conduct a full audit of their financial reports. This unnecessary regulatory burden imposes $4 million of compliance costs on business. This change is expected to predominantly benefit companies that have a not-for-profit focus.


You can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, why this legislation is of fundamental importance in addressing issues that do go to the costs of running businesses in Australia. Inevitably, it will help in small measure to improve their international competitiveness. We ought not through our regulatory regimes impose costs on businesses in Australia that are quite unrelated to the costs others abroad may face, because that is essentially imposing upon them and their employees a penalty in terms of their competitiveness. This legislation is an important deregulatory package; it is part of a continuing process in which this government is involved. As I said, I commend the member for Kooyong, who has had the responsibility for progressing these issues, for his determination in identifying measures that can effectively reduce compliance costs and that will ensure a far more competitive environment without reducing proper responsibility. This measure deserves support, and I hope that the opposition will have some regard to my earlier observations about the importance of ensuring that we not only live within our means, but also put in place a more productive economy through the sorts of measures that are contained in this legislation.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:11):  Labor supports this bill and I am pleased to offer my contribution in supporting this bill passing the parliament. I do wish to make some comments about the comments just made by the member for Berowra, though I am conscious of his points about reducing red tape, which I find somewhat ironic, given that earlier we had the member for Higgins introduce the report of the economics committee. It actually advocates increasing red tape for foreign investment in Australian property by imposing a proposed levy. I understand that the economics committee discussed a figure of between $500 and $1,500; today we learnt that the committee is now proposing the higher end of the range, $1,500. When we talk about reducing red tape it is easy for those opposite to adopt a holier-than-thou approach on these issues, but we need to be conscious that there was some hypocrisy in the comments of the member for Berowra. Nevertheless, Labor is pleased to support these reforms because they are sensible—they make a sensible addition and sensible changes to our corporate landscape. 


Labor has a proud record of improving corporate governance, transparency and accountability in decisions of government, particularly with respect to their obligations to shareholders, workers, customers and the general public. In the course of the last Labor government, a number of reforms were introduced that not only improved safety for workers and the public, ensured greater competition in a number of industries and Australia generally, but also provided reliable accounts and information, particularly on executive remuneration. Over a number of years we have seen outrage in the community from not only shareholders but the wider community about some of the ridiculous remuneration packages and bonuses that were paid to corporate leaders in this country and throughout the world. Through such measures, Labor introduced a corporate regime that is one of the most robust and responsible anywhere in the world. This bill meets those conditions and on that basis we are pleased to offer support.


Items 1 and 2 of schedule 1 of the bill amend the Corporations Act to better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company against the cost to companies of being required to call and hold general meetings. This relates to the so-called '100-member rule', which creates an obligation on a corporation to hold a general meeting if requested to by 100 or more shareholders. That requirement will be removed by this bill. The requirement that a general meeting be held if requested by five per cent or more of shareholders will remain. 


Importantly, the proposed amendment does not affect the right of 100 shareholders to put up a resolution to be considered at a general meeting or to distribute a shareholder statement with the notice convening that meeting. So the changes do not affect the ability of 100 or more shareholders to engage in activism. That is very important and that is the way it should be, because shareholder activism is an important component of corporate governance. What these amendments do is ensure that the operation of this provision does not burden companies with the cost of having to hold extraordinary general meetings where this is unreasonable. There have been examples in the past. Woolworths was required to call an extraordinary general meeting on the issue of $1 limits on poker machines—and the cost of convening that meeting was close to half a million dollars. Over many years the NRMA had to call a series of extraordinary general meetings. It is estimated that the cost of those meetings was in the millions of dollars. The proposed amendment is a sensible reform, one that ensures that an appropriate balance remains between the right of shareholders to put resolutions at general meetings and the need to ensure that, in doing so, the costs imposed on the companies involved are not unreasonable.


The second element of these reforms is improving remuneration reporting. Years ago in Australia, shareholders became increasingly concerned, even outraged, at the size of executive remuneration packages—pay, bonuses, shares and share options. These were being paid even where executives were, by any reasonable measure, failing in their duties, as reflected in the performance of their companies. We saw situations where executives presided over falls in the share price and/or falls in the profitability of their companies yet still commanded outrageous remuneration. This created angst within the community, particularly amongst shareholders. Many saw the outcomes as being unfair and unreasonable. 


Labor acted on those concerns. It responded by implementing a fairer system that put shareholders, particularly institutional and mum-and-dad shareholders, first. The current shadow Treasurer, then the Assistant Treasurer, introduced reforms in July 2011. They became known as the 'two-strikes rule', which holds directors accountable to shareholders for executive salaries and bonuses. These reforms have led to a much more responsible and reasonable approach to executive remuneration being taken in this country. I think it is fair to say that the system has worked. 


The way the system works is that companies have two opportunities, from the perspective of accountability to shareholders, to get their executive remuneration right. If a company's remuneration report receives a shareholder no vote of 25 per cent or more at an annual general meeting, that is the first strike. If there is another strike in the second year—if the company's subsequent remuneration report again receives a no vote of 25 per cent or more—there can be a vote to spill the board. In other words, there can be a vote on whether or not all directors need to stand for re-election. That subsequent vote to require a re-election of the board needs a majority of 50 per cent plus one to pass. If it does receive that majority, the election for directors has to be held within 90 days. As I said, this is a model which has worked. It has seen companies take a much more reasonable approach to executive remuneration. The stories of outrageous executive salaries and packages have dissipated—and that is a positive thing. Labor is very proud of its record of improving remuneration reporting and dealing with executive remuneration. Concerns were raised by shareholders and users of remuneration reports and we dealt with them. 


Labor also supports removing the unnecessary requirement for unlisted disclosing entities that are companies to prepare a remuneration report. Unlike listed entities, they are not required to have their remuneration report adopted by shareholders through a non-binding resolution and they are not subject to the two-strikes test. In this respect, the reform in this bill is supported.


This bill also makes changes so that listed disclosing entities that are companies must disclose the number of options that lapse during the financial year, as well as the financial year in which those options were granted, for each member of the key management personnel. There will, under the changes introduced by this bill, be no obligation to disclose the value of options that lapse or the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel. Again this is a sensible reform that has Labor's support.


The bill makes an number of amendments that will improve the value of the information in remuneration reports. This goes to item 6 of schedule 1 of the bill, which clarifies the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months. There is confusion about conditions under which directors may determine that a financial year is shorter than 12 months, and these reforms clarify that.


Finally, in respect of the appointment of auditors, items 7 to 9 of schedule 1 of the bill amend the Corporations Act to exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. Currently all public companies, including companies limited by guarantee, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. This bill amends this so that small companies limited by guarantee, and those companies limited by guarantee that have their financial reports reviewed, are not required to appoint or retain an auditor. This means that companies that are not required to undertake an audit no longer have to retain an auditor. Again, this is a sensible reform that Labor is pleased to support.


The bill also amends the ASIC Act in respect of the operation of the Takeovers Panel. Labor sees this as an improvement and is happy to support it.


On the whole, these are sensible amendments to Australia's corporate landscape. They build on Labor's achievements in government of making our corporate legislation more representative of the interests and aspirations of shareholders, of workers, of customers, of clients and of the Australian public. We believe that these sensible reforms and the Labor reforms that were put in under the previous government should make Australia a more attractive place to invest. On that basis I am happy to commend the bill to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:24):  I am pleased to speak on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulation and Other Measures) Bill 2014. This bill forms part of our government's commitment to repeal counterproductive, unnecessary and redundant legislation and regulations. I would like to start by giving an example from my electorate of Hughes of some of those burdensome regulations that tie the hands of small business. This example in the retail sector shows the absurdity of this regulation, the stupidity of it, and the big task that we have of working through and repealing this red tape to free the hands of entrepreneurs in this nation.


There is a shopping centre in my electorate called the Homemakers Centre, at Warwick Farm. It is on the Hume Highway and has six lanes of road on either side. Opposite is Warwick Farm racecourse. In the front of the shopping centre there are two large takeaway outlets. There is a very large car park. There are a lot of shops in there. Next door is the Masterton Homes display village, and on the other side of this is a small motel. It is an ideal location for a shopping centre.


A few regulations were put on that centre at a few retailers. I would like to compare the regulations in my electorate to the regulations in Afghanistan under the Taliban's control. I will quote from a 2001 article by Amy Waldman published inTheNew York Times. It is a story from Herat in Afghanistan. It says:


Hefozullah, a seller of cooking oil, was arrested at the marketplace for keeping his shop open during Friday prayers. He was sent to jail for four days and became No. 3,183 in a registry of arrests at the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.


The article goes on and talks about 'the penal code promulgated by the Taliban's leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar', which sets out in copious detail what retailers in Herat—in Taliban controlled Afghanistan—can and cannot sell. I will quote directly from the article. It says:


Those who fly pigeons—a favorite Afghan pastime—will be imprisoned until ''their pigeons disappear from their home.''


Then it goes on and lists all the things that are banned from sale from retail shops. It says:


A kite seller will be imprisoned for three days.


It lists other things that are banned:


… cinematography, any equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computer, VCR's, televisions … wine, … nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.


It goes on:


Nothing was left to chance or the imagination under the Taliban. Merchants importing products like shampoo would find that Taliban customs officials had gouged out the eyes of the female models on the boxes. The merchants were then required to display the products with black tape over female faces, or be subject to a beating or jailing.


The journalist goes on:


It is no wonder that residents here react as if waking from a grotesque dream.


Compare that list of things that were banned under the Taliban from being sold with the recent court decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court. Whereas the Taliban had a Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice enforcing those red-tape regulations, our similar regulations are being enforced by the Land and Environment Court and the New South Wales Court of Appeal.


The case was the Warehouse Group (Australia)—they were the appellant—versus those champions of free market competition, Woolworths Limited. This was a case where three senior judges were involved in the Court of Appeal with Queen's Counsel—a platoon of legal experts—working out what a retail shop in my electorate could and could not sell. There were many days of court hearings and a rather lengthy decision.


I will read through some of the list of things that were banned, not in Taliban controlled Afghanistan but in the electorate of Hughes, which I represent. There is a list here of over 40—it is in roman numerals. It goes to over 50 separate items. I would like to go through a few of them. Item (i): floor coverings were banned from sale. Small plastic containers were banned from sale. Garbage bins were banned. Paint was banned, as were paint accessories—it goes on—dust masks and paint scrapers. Dangerous items that need government control such as kitchen implements, mashers, vegetable peelers, kitchen hand food storage containers, curtains and accessories were also banned. Curtain tassels were banned—we must have laws in this country to control the sale of dangerous curtain tassels! Item (xxx) on the list of banned items is baby goods. Baby bibs were banned from sale, along with baby strollers, baby prams and baby car seats, and item (xxxv) on the banned list is child's potties. In this country we have such red tape and such regulation that we are required to have in the New South Wales Supreme Court Court of Appeal three distinguished and learned judges and a platoon of lawyers making a decision that a retail shop in my electorate should be banned from selling child's potties.


The list goes on. Other things banned included dog toys—we cannot have anyone selling dog toys! And there are bird cages. While the Taliban would ban the sale of pigeons or anything related, we just ban the sale of bird cages. Toys are banned. Item (xlvii) is sheets. Again, while the Taliban Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice would simply ban any equipment that reproduces the joy of music, at least our court of appeal detailed those things that reproduce the joy of music that are banned. Prerecorded videos were banned, prerecorded CDs, prerecorded audiotapes, blank videos, blank CDs and, item (lix), blank audio tapes. They were all banned from sale. On the Taliban list of banned items it was simply Christmas cards, but of course our New South Wales Supreme Court was able to do better than that—they set out the things that were banned from being sold in a retail shop in my electorate: Christmas goods, Christmas trees, Christmas decorations and, just like the Taliban, Christmas cards. We simply cannot have shops in Australia being unauthorised sellers of Christmas cards. How would we get on without this red tape? At least in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan retail shops could sell bottles of shampoo as long as they gouged the eyes out of the women on the boxes or put black tape over them. In my electorate, thanks to the decisions and the red tape and regulation we have, we simply banned it altogether. 


This is just an example of the regulation and red tape that we have. Other parts of my electorate fare even worse. It is not a matter of just having a list of things that they are not allowed to sell—dangerous goods such as potties and Christmas cards and things that reproduce the joys of music. We had in my electorate what was known as the Orange Grove shopping centre. On one side of Orange Grove Road we had a big Officeworks and on the other side a big Harvey Norman complex. Do we know what happened to Orange Grove shopping centre? They did not have a list of goods they were banned from selling—they were simply banned from operating. The red tape and regulation by the then New South Wales Labor-controlled state government simply banned them from operating and selling anything. That was done when former senator Bob Carr was New South Wales Premier—better known now as the senator who complained about not having silk pyjamas on an international flight; he complained about how unfair it was that he had to travel business class and about the quality of food and the types of music he could listen to. The very same Senator Carr was the one who banned a complete retail shopping centre from selling any of those goods. Silk pyjamas were banned, food was banned and of course the sale of any musical item was banned—the very things that Senator Carr complained about when he was forced to put up with the hardship of travelling in business class. These are just some examples of the red tape we have in this country.


This bill is estimated to reduce business compliance costs by around $14 million. The measures in the bill provide a better balance between the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company and the costs to companies required to hold a general meeting. The bill will improve and reduce remuneration reporting requirements, clarify the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months, exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor, improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel and extend the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration setting responsibility to include certain statutory bodies. 


There is some urgency in this action we are taking because we have some serious difficulties in this country. We face the problem of an ageing population. Commodity prices for our largest exports of coal and iron ore that were quite high under the previous government's term are coming back. Perhaps the biggest problem we have to deal with is servicing the interest on Labor's debt. For the past six years the previous Labor government simply—and this is the best way to explain it—ran this country at a loss. In each of those six years they spent more money than they raised.




Mr Bowen:
  How are you going?




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I note the shadow Treasurer at the table, and I am sure he is familiar with the figures that the government of Australia now has to finance because of the interest bill on their debt. It is $13½ billion a year. To put that in context, that is $570 for every man, woman and child in this country—and that is just for the interest bill that has to be paid. For every family of four the annual interest bill that we must now pay is $2,280. 


We can break it down over periods of time. Every month it is $1.125 billion. That is $1,125 million that flow out the door. That is the obligation that we have in interest just in one month. In a week it is $260 million. In a day, today, it is $37 million. On this day, this government will need to find $37 million just to pay the interest. In the next hour it is $1.5 million. That is the obligation that this nation has—to pay interest on a debt that this previous Labor government left.


Why is there some urgency about this? The money that is borrowed to pay for the six years of losses during the Labor government is done through the sale of government bonds. Whether through good luck or good management, we are currently in a period where global interest rates are at record lows. We have been able to borrow most of that money at around 3.5 per cent. The problem is that, even though we have that interest obligation, if we do not only address the interest but pay that debt down, who knows where interest rates will be in 10 years time, when a lot of these government bonds fall due and we have to refinance them. It may not be 3.35 per cent. We know that it could be double. And therefore, rather than having that $500 cost for every man, woman and child, it could be double. That is the urgency; that is the problem. That is why we must repeal red tape and free the hands of our entrepreneurs. I commend this bill to the House.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (10:39):  The Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014 amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. Items 1, 2 and 10 of the schedule to this bill amend the Corporations Act 2001, and their intent is to better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company and the costs of companies that have been required to call and hold a general meeting. It would repeal the so-called 100-member rule which creates an obligation on a corporation to hold a general meeting at the request of 100 or more shareholders.


These meetings are often called for protest purposes and almost always, particularly in the case of larger corporations, create a very significant cost to business. For example, Woolworths was compelled to call an extraordinary general meeting in relation to $1 limits on poker machines. Whatever one's views about the worth or otherwise of imposing a $1 limit on poker machines, it can be seen that this was very much a political action using corporate rules. What it did was to impose on Woolworths, as a very direct cost, about $500,000, which was the cost of notifying its shareholders for that extraordinary general meeting. The resolution when put to the extraordinary general meeting, despite the political action behind it, received just 2.5 per cent support of those attending the meeting.


No-one objects to the fact that people might have different views. No-one objects in any way to the expression of those views. Indeed, shareholders should be able to legitimately raise concerns about the affairs of companies in which they hold shares, through a number of mechanisms, but they should not be permitted to do it at a significant cost to other shareholders. It is not appropriate that a very small number of shareholders be able to impose costs at that level simply for the purpose of making a political point. You could cite as another example that in the two years from late 1999 to late 2001 the NRMA in New South Wales was forced to call 12 extraordinary general meetings to consider resolutions removing directors, each of which incurred several million dollars in costs, and in no case were any of the relevant regulations that were the supposed purpose of those extraordinary general meeting passed by the members of the NRMA.


The proposed changes do not remove the ability of 100 or more shareholders to add items to scheduled annual general meetings and to instigate debate as an agenda item at these meetings. This retains the right for 100 or more members to raise issues of concern, without the often significant cost to shareholders of scheduling extraordinary meetings under the current acts. Shareholder activism is a component of corporate governance. Shareholders should be able to put issues on the AGM agenda and should be able to instigate debate at the meeting. The right is of particular importance to retail shareholders, who have limited opportunities to meet with the company prior to the AGM. These rights will not change with this proposed legislation. 


Australia is currently alone in providing for a shareholder test that applies regardless of how much capital the requisitionists hold. It is more common to require that requisitionists must hold at least five to 10 per cent of the shares before they can call a general meeting. Again, no-one disputes the fact that shareholders have a right to question directors and decisions made by a company, but it should not be at a cost to other shareholders. Labor supports this change.


Items 3 to 5 and 10 of schedule 1 to this bill amend the Corporations Act 2001 to improve and streamline remuneration reporting requirements. Currently, disclosing entities that are companies must disclose the value of options that lapse during a financial year for each member of the key management personnel. Disclosing entities that are companies must also disclose the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel. This bill makes changes so that listed disclosing entities that are companies must disclose the number of options that lapse during a financial year and the financial year in which those options were granted for each member of the key management personnel. There will be no obligation to disclose the value of options that lapse. Under this bill there is no obligation to disclose the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel.


 Also currently, all disclosing entities that are companies are required to prepare a remuneration report, regardless of whether they are listed or unlisted. This bill changes that so unlisted disclosing entities that are companies are no longer required to prepare a remuneration report. Listed disclosing entities continue to be required to prepare a remuneration report.


Labor supports improving the disclosure of executive remuneration information in Australia. There have been concerns raised by shareholders and users of remuneration reports that currently the reports contain some information that was of limited benefit or can be found at other places in the annual report. Labor also supports removing the unnecessary requirement for unlisted disclosing entities that are companies to prepare a remuneration report. Unlike listed entities, they are not required to have their remuneration report adopted by shareholders through a non-binding resolution and are not subject to the two-strikes test.


Item 6 of schedule 1 to this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to clarify the circumstances under which a financial year may be less than 12 months. There is confusion about the conditions under which directors may determine that a financial year is shorter than 12 months. Currently, section 323D sets out how companies, registered schemes and disclosing entities may determine the length of their financial year. While an entity's financial year is expected to be approximately 12 months long, entities can determine otherwise in cases where an entity needs to modify its financial year by up to seven days to accommodate week based internal reporting frameworks or an entity needs to synchronise its financial year in order to prepare consolidated financial reports.


However, subsection 323D(2A) allows entities to determine that their financial year is less than 12 months if none of their previous five financial years have been less than 12 months, the shorter financial year commences at the end of the previous financial year and the decision is in the best interests of the entity. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the interaction between this provision and the operation of subsection 323D(2), which requires that a financial year is 12 months long, unless determined by the directors to be a period that is longer or shorter than 12 months by up to seven days.


There is confusion surrounding whether taking advantage of the flexibility in section 323D(2) would trigger the five-year period in which an entity is precluded from accessing the benefits offered by section 323D(2A). Similarly, subsection 323D(3) requires an entity to synchronise its financial year end with that of its parent entity when it becomes a controlled entity. Again, stakeholders have raised concerns that this provision may trigger the five-year period in which an entity is precluded from accessing the benefits offered by section 323D(2A).


The bill seeks to clarify that directors may determine that a financial year is shorter than 12 months by more than seven days irrespective of whether during an entity's previous five financial years the directors have determined that the financial year is shorter than 12 months by up to seven days or determined to synchronise the financial year to prepare consolidated financial statements. Labor supports the amendments in this bill that clarify the circumstances and conditions under which directors can determine the financial year is shorter than 12 months by more than seven days. This removes the unintended confusion arising from changes made in 2010 intended to make it easier for directors to alter financial year end dates.


 Items 7 to 9 of schedule 1 to this bill amend the Corporations Act to exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. Currently, all public companies, including companies limited by guarantee, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. This bill changes this so that small companies limited by guarantee and those companies limited by guarantee that have their financial reports reviewed are not required to appoint or retain an auditor. This means that companies that are not required to undertake an audit are no longer required to appoint and retain an auditor. All other public companies are required to appoint and retain an auditor, as is current practice. Labor supports these changes that remove unnecessary costs on business by removing the requirement for companies to appoint and retain an auditor, even if they are not required to conduct an audit. The change is expected to provide the greatest benefit to not-for-profit community organisations, allowing them to better service the community.


Part 1, items 1 and 2 of schedule 2 to this bill amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel by allowing takeover matters to be dealt with more efficiently. Currently, the president and members of the Takeovers Panel may only participate in proceedings if they are within Australia. These changes mean the President of the Takeovers Panel may give a direction in respect of members who are to constitute the panel whether or not the president is in Australia. Further, members of the Takeovers Panel may participate in proceedings whether or not the members are in Australia. As technology improves and the world becomes ever more connected, it is sensible to alter legislation to reflect that change. This bill will allow members of the Takeovers Panel to participate in proceedings if they are physically located outside of Australia at the time. Labor supports this sensible change to allow the more efficient resolution of disputes.


Part 1, items 3 to 8, and part 2, item 9 of schedule 2 to this bill amend the ASIC Act to extend the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration-setting responsibility to include certain Corporations Act bodies. Currently, the ASIC Act provides that the responsible Treasury portfolio minister determines the terms and conditions—including remuneration—of the chairs and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the FRC; the Chair of the Australian Accounting Standards Board, the AASB; and the Chair of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, the AUASB. The ASIC Act also provides that the FRC is responsible for determining the terms and conditions, including remuneration, of the offices held by the members of the AASB and the AUASB.


This bill brings responsibility for determining the remuneration and full-time member recreation leave entitlements of the chair and member positions of the FRC, the AASB and the AUASB within the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Remuneration Tribunal has specialist skills in reviewing and determining remuneration and is therefore better placed to determine the remuneration of these offices. Moreover, it will ensure consistency in the remuneration setting arrangements between the three bodies and other statutory office holders.

Labor supports the provisions in this bill that bring responsibility for determining the remuneration and full-time-member recreation leave entitlements of the chair and members within the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction. There is no question that that is the best place for them and where they ought to be. The changes that are contained in this bill are supported by Labor. They were changes that Labor was progressing through in government and matters that had been worked on with bipartisan support across both sides of this chamber, and within the industry and the sector itself. It is good, sensible policy. I offer Labor's support for these measures and commend the bill to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:53):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014and indicate that the Labor Party and I will be supporting this government legislation that amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. With the Minister for Small Business and the shadow Treasurer in the chamber we would be quick to acknowledge the important role that corporations play in Australian society, in the protection of the individual and the mustering together of an appropriate response to the risk that comes with business. In fact, much of the development of modern Australia can be traced back to corporations, with people pooling their money and not having an individual risk.


Corporations have evolved over time. Not everything that applies to a corporation is covered in the corporations legislation. Modern corporations are aware of their social licence. It is not something that is written in any particular section of the corporations legislation, but they must have a strong connection with their community and earn the right to carry out things that they do, whether it be the tasks they do, the products they make or sell or the role they play in the community.


Items 1, 2 and 10 of schedule 1 to this bill amend the Corporations Act to better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with the company and the cost to companies of being required to call and hold a general meeting. I focus particularly on this because of the point I made earlier about social licence. Obviously, shareholders of the company have the ability to give input at an annual general meeting of a corporation, and say, 'This is what we are concerned about.' But it costs money to set up an annual general meeting and to notify all the shareholders. Even in these days of electronic communications it still costs money to hold such meetings. This amendment to the Corporations Act repeals the so-called 100-member rule, which created an obligation on a corporation to hold a general meeting at the request of 100 or more shareholders. These meetings are often called for protest purposes. I am not saying that those purposes are not legitimate, but there can be significant costs that have to be met by every shareholder in the corporation, and such meetings do create a significant cost to business. These proposed changes do not remove the ability of 100 shareholders to add items to the regular, scheduled annual general meeting. Obviously, shareholders always have the right to instigate debate as an agenda item at any of these meetings. They still have a chance to have their concerns heard as an item at the annual general meeting, whether their concerns are about the financial governance of the organisation or some of the social licence matters. This legislation retains the right of 100 or more members to raise issues of concern, but without the often significant costs to shareholders of scheduling these extraordinary meetings, as exists under the current act.


The 100-member rule is not linked to having five per cent or 10 per cent of the value of a corporation, which is what happens in several countries. For example, for a significant company like Woolworths, only 100 shareholders would be required to compel the company to call an extraordinary general meeting. That is actually what happened with Woolworths when it came to debating $1 limits on its poker machines. The cost to Woolworths of notifying its shareholders of the meeting was $500,000. When it hosted the meeting the motion received only 2.5 per cent support. Perhaps it might be said that if the motion to put a $1 limit on poker machines had received 10 per cent or 50 per cent support it might have been worthwhile. Irrespective of the merits of the reason for the shareholders calling the meeting in the Woolworths example, Labor has seen that we need to be more sensible about this and not have unnecessary costs attached to corporations. The other example mentioned by the shadow minister, Bernie Ripoll, was the example of the NRMA—



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  Sorry, the shadow assistant—




Mr Bowen:
  He's the shadow minister for financial services.




Mr PERRETT:
  The shadow minister for financial services—thank you, shadow Treasurer—and member for Oxley. He is my next-door neighbour and a great guy. He gave the example of the NRMA, which in two years was forced to call 12 extraordinary general meetings to consider motions about removing directors. The meetings cost several million dollars and resulted in none of the directors being removed from the NRMA board. It is hard to justify such behaviour.


Items 3 to 5 and 10 of schedule 1 of this bill amend the Corporations Act to improve and streamline remuneration reporting requirements. Currently, disclosing entities that are companies must disclose the value of options that lapsed during a financial year for each member of the key management personnel. So disclosing entities that are companies must also disclose the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel.


Item 6 of schedule 1 of this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to clarify the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months. This sounds like something out of Yes Minister, but it is actually good business practice every now and then to change the year. There is confusion about the conditions under which directors may determine that a financial year be shorter that 12 months. Currently section 323D sets out how companies, registered schemes and disclosing entities may determine the length of their financial year. While an entity's financial year is expected to be approximately 12 months long, entities can determine otherwise in cases where an entity needs to modify its financial year by up to seven days to accommodate week based internal reporting frameworks or an entity needs to synchronise its financial year in order to prepare consolidated financial reports.


Items 7 to 9 of schedule 1 of this bill amend the legislation to exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. Obviously there are significant costs associated with auditors. They perform an important role. Normally when companies get into trouble you find that the auditor has not been doing an appropriate job. Currently all public companies, including companies limited by guarantee, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. This bill amends this so that the small companies limited by guarantee and those companies limited by guarantee that have their financial reports reviewed are not required to appoint or retain an auditor. This means that companies that are not required to undertake an audit are no longer required to appoint and retain an auditor. All other public companies, however, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. So the public has that security, knowing that auditors will be looking through the books of those companies.


Part 1, items 1 and 2, of schedule 2 of this bill amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act to improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel by allowing takeover matters to be dealt with more efficiently. Currently the president and members of the Takeovers Panel may only participate in proceedings if they are within Australia. This bill makes amendments so that the president of the Takeovers Panel may give a direction in respect of members who are to constitute the panel whether or not the president is in Australia. Further, members of the Takeovers Panel may participate in proceedings whether or not they are in Australia.


Part 1, items 3 to 8, and part 2, item 9, of schedule 2 of this bill amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to extend the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration setting responsibility to include certain Corporations Act bodies. The ASIC Act currently provides that the responsible Treasury portfolio minister determines the terms and conditions, including the remuneration of the chairs and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the chair of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the chair of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The ASIC Act also provides that the FRC is responsible for determining the terms and conditions, including remuneration, of the offices held by the members of the AASB and the AUASB.


This bill brings responsibility for determining the remuneration and full-time member recreation leave entitlements of the chair and member positions of the FRC, the AASB and the AUASB within the Remuneration Tribunal's direction. The Remuneration Tribunal has specialist skills in reviewing and determining remuneration. It looks after members of parliament's remuneration as well, and it does a good job. It is therefore better placed to determine the remuneration of these officers. Moreover, it will ensure consistency in the remuneration setting arrangements between the three bodies and other statutory office holders.


One of the controversial items in this legislation which has bipartisan support will be the one about 100 members. I revisit that item because so many campaigns are organised when a corporation is perhaps doing something that people are not happy with. We have seen it with union campaigns in the past where perhaps inappropriate workplace practices are taking place. We have seen it when corporations are selling something, farming, mining or doing something that members of the community are not happy with. The 100 shareholders practice has often been used in the past in these cases. I want to stress again that, when compared with other common law jurisdictions that utilise corporations or even civil countries that use corporations and all the benefits that come with corporations, Australia has been a bit stand-alone in letting 100 shareholders, as I said, irrespective of the value of the shares held by those 100 shareholders, take control and basically impose a cost on other shareholders.


That would be the more controversial point, but the other aspects, such as improving remuneration reporting, clarifying the financial year, streamlining the auditor appointments, improving the efficiency of takeover panels and improving the government remuneration process, are not particularly controversial. This is normal, run-of-the-mill government business. I am happy to support this legislation before the chamber.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (11:06):  I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. This bill makes a number of amendments designed to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses operating in Australia. Schedule 1 of this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to reduce the cost to businesses operating in Australia by removing the ability for 100 members of a company to request a general meeting. While this change ensures company resources are no longer spent on meetings requested by only a very small minority of shareholders, we have also made sure important shareholder rights are retained. This change will not impact on the right of a member or members with at least five per cent of the voting shares to request a general meeting. Nor will it impact on the right of 100 members of a company to place items on the agenda of a general meeting.


This bill simplifies remuneration disclosures in Australia. Unlisted disclosing entities will no longer be required to prepare a remuneration report. This bill clarifies when entities can change their financial year end dates. Stakeholders have been calling for this clarity since an amendment to permit companies greater flexibility to change their financial year end date was inserted into the Corporations Act in 2010. Entities will finally be able to access this flexibility with confidence.


Finally, schedule 1 of the bill removes the requirement for companies limited by guarantee, that are not required to undertake an audit, to appoint an auditor. This primarily benefits smaller companies limited by guarantee who feel the burden of the existing requirement most acutely.


Scheduled 2 of this bill amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to improve the efficiency of government processes, reflecting the government's commitment to identifying cost savings and efficiencies within its own processes. Schedule 2 also improves the efficiency of the operation of the Takeovers Panel. It further extends the remuneration-setting responsibility of the Remuneration Tribunal to the Financial Reporting Council, the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.


In summary, the amendments made by this bill will reduce the costs borne by Australian businesses because of government regulation. It will permit business to focus on what it is they should be doing—running their business. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra—Chief Government Whip) (09:57):  I rise to speak to the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The government has introduced a package of reforms to the Corporations Law to reduce regulatory burden and improve productivity and competitiveness. What I really want to talk about is why this bill is part of an overall package and why it is of fundamental importance to the future of this nation.


I listened to some comments in another context by one of my colleagues, and I am very worried about the personal future of members of the opposition. I am very worried about whether or not they will be able to continue to play a role in public life in this country if they pursue in their personal affairs the arrangements they want this nation to pursue. They see it as being desirable that we should budget for consumption and spending where we do not have the income available. They want us to essentially go out to dinner every night and simply put the tab on our bank card or on our mortgage. If you conducted your personal affairs in the way in which they want the affairs of the nation to be run, you would not be able to survive. When I make this point about their personal affairs, let me just say I am reasonably satisfied that in their personal affairs they would try to ensure that they live within their means, but when it comes to the nation it is regrettable that we do not see the same approach being taken. 


I speak to many people around my electorate and they do appreciate very much that the country has to live within its means. In looking at that issue, it is not just how much you spend that is relevant; it is how you go about the earning of your income that is equally important. They are concerned in their businesses about unnecessary costs which make them less competitive and make their businesses more difficult to sustain. I must say that, in my own electorate, people are gratified that we have been able to make some changes in relation to the carbon tax. They are glad that it has gone, because that has made their businesses more competitive. But, equally, the sorts of measures that are contained in this legislation are absolutely important to them, because they find that a lot of the reporting that they have to make builds costs into their businesses, and that makes it extraordinarily difficult for them to be able to effectively carry out those businesses. 


In my 41 years in this House, I have never seen such a determined approach by a government to reduce the regulatory burden. What we have seen with the removal of regulations is the freeing up of businesses to be able to do what they do best. I commend the member for Kooyong, the parliamentary secretary, for the work that he is doing in this regard. He is committed to tackling the volume of regulation, which is already too high. It is essential that we do ensure that our businesses remain competitive. I would simply say that this is not a job that has been finished. In an earlier life I was the Attorney-General of Australia, and I was able to work with the states to put in place a single defamation code. The importance of that was that it stopped forum shopping around Australia. When it was put in place, it meant that the volume of litigation was significantly reduced. I am a lawyer. I do not mind litigation, but sometimes litigation can be very unnecessary and very unhelpful. 


I was very much focused on personal property securities. We had something like 80 different pieces of legislation across all the states and territories of Australia for personal property securities. You can think of them: bills of sale, hire purchase, maritime liens and floating charges. When you put the myriad different forms of personal property securities across all the states and territories it meant that businesses trading across state and territory boundaries would often have to get complex legal advice about floating charges that they might have over their stock. I can remember a firm that ran a hotel in Mount Gambier and a hotel in Geelong, and they had to get advice because the floating charge over their stock-in-trade was different under South Australian and Victorian law. We are, I might say, somewhat belatedly now—I do not think I have been the Attorney for seven years—seeing a single scheme of personal property security being implemented. 


I would encourage the government to continue looking not only at its own regulatory burdens that it imposes upon people but also at the multiplicity of regulatory burdens that are as a result of our Federation. I do not think our Federation arrangements were intended to inhibit successful businesses operating in Australia or to reduce their economic competitiveness, but I suspect that a lot of the regulatory burden which is so often unnecessary imposes those costs. So I do commend the member for Kooyong for his hard work in addressing these issues. 


I think this bill, which I will go to, deals with a number of issues that will help to improve our economic competitiveness. If we improve our economic competitiveness, businesses are more successful. Hopefully, they end up paying more taxes. That is helpful for the Commonwealth. It helps our budgetary position. It enables the government to more effectively live within its means. I think we ought to be talking about how governments can live within their means, and I think we need to be quite lateral in the way in which we do it. We need to look at our expenditures. I encourage members of the opposition to come forward. I listen all the time to hear from them as to ideas they have about the way in which we can structure our budget more constructively. I do listen. I don't hear it.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  You don't hear very much. 




Mr RUDDOCK:
  No, I don't. I do listen. But it is also important that they support measures of this sort that will help boost our economic competitiveness. This bill is about reducing business compliance costs by something of the order of $14 million per year. It contains measures to improve the efficiency of those processes which companies have to meet. They will better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with the company and the costs of companies being required to call and hold general meetings. It will improve the remuneration reporting requirements. It will clarify the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months. It will exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. It will improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel. It will extend the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration setting responsibility to include certain statutory bodies. 


If I can go to some of those particular measures, there is the abolition of the 100-member rule. The government is removing the requirement for directors of a company to hold a general meeting on the request of 100 shareholders. It seeks to strike a better balance between the interests of minority shareholders and the shareholders as a whole, because all of these meetings involve costs which can be quite significant. In large corporations the 100-member rule allows groups holding less than what we can call one per cent of voting shares to force a company to incur significant costs in holding meetings. That has to be questioned. This particular issue is supported by both industry stakeholders, including the Institute of Company Directors, the Governance Institute of Australia and the Business Council of Australia, as well as shareholder groups such as the Australian Shareholders Association. The measure is expected to save businesses around $1.5 million per annum in compliance costs. Isn't that a desirable outcome? 


In relation to remuneration reporting, the government is improving the disclosure of executive remuneration information in Australia by ensuring that it is provided in a form that is useful to shareholders and investors. The measure removes the requirement for unlisted disclosing entities to prepare a remuneration report. This measure is estimated to save unlisted entities from disclosing about $8.5 million in compliance costs. The remuneration report is simply not relevant to those agencies, but it is a regime that imposes very significant and unnecessary costs.


In issues relating to auditor-appointing requirements, the government is removing the nonsensical requirement for certain companies limited by guarantee, which are not required to undertake an audit, to appoint an auditor—that is, you are not required to audit, but you have to appoint an auditor. How ridiculous! Currently all public companies are required to appoint an auditor, even if they are not required to conduct a full audit of their financial reports. This unnecessary regulatory burden imposes $4 million of compliance costs on business. This change is expected to predominantly benefit companies that have a not-for-profit focus.


You can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, why this legislation is of fundamental importance in addressing issues that do go to the costs of running businesses in Australia. Inevitably, it will help in small measure to improve their international competitiveness. We ought not through our regulatory regimes impose costs on businesses in Australia that are quite unrelated to the costs others abroad may face, because that is essentially imposing upon them and their employees a penalty in terms of their competitiveness. This legislation is an important deregulatory package; it is part of a continuing process in which this government is involved. As I said, I commend the member for Kooyong, who has had the responsibility for progressing these issues, for his determination in identifying measures that can effectively reduce compliance costs and that will ensure a far more competitive environment without reducing proper responsibility. This measure deserves support, and I hope that the opposition will have some regard to my earlier observations about the importance of ensuring that we not only live within our means, but also put in place a more productive economy through the sorts of measures that are contained in this legislation.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:11):  Labor supports this bill and I am pleased to offer my contribution in supporting this bill passing the parliament. I do wish to make some comments about the comments just made by the member for Berowra, though I am conscious of his points about reducing red tape, which I find somewhat ironic, given that earlier we had the member for Higgins introduce the report of the economics committee. It actually advocates increasing red tape for foreign investment in Australian property by imposing a proposed levy. I understand that the economics committee discussed a figure of between $500 and $1,500; today we learnt that the committee is now proposing the higher end of the range, $1,500. When we talk about reducing red tape it is easy for those opposite to adopt a holier-than-thou approach on these issues, but we need to be conscious that there was some hypocrisy in the comments of the member for Berowra. Nevertheless, Labor is pleased to support these reforms because they are sensible—they make a sensible addition and sensible changes to our corporate landscape. 


Labor has a proud record of improving corporate governance, transparency and accountability in decisions of government, particularly with respect to their obligations to shareholders, workers, customers and the general public. In the course of the last Labor government, a number of reforms were introduced that not only improved safety for workers and the public, ensured greater competition in a number of industries and Australia generally, but also provided reliable accounts and information, particularly on executive remuneration. Over a number of years we have seen outrage in the community from not only shareholders but the wider community about some of the ridiculous remuneration packages and bonuses that were paid to corporate leaders in this country and throughout the world. Through such measures, Labor introduced a corporate regime that is one of the most robust and responsible anywhere in the world. This bill meets those conditions and on that basis we are pleased to offer support.


Items 1 and 2 of schedule 1 of the bill amend the Corporations Act to better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company against the cost to companies of being required to call and hold general meetings. This relates to the so-called '100-member rule', which creates an obligation on a corporation to hold a general meeting if requested to by 100 or more shareholders. That requirement will be removed by this bill. The requirement that a general meeting be held if requested by five per cent or more of shareholders will remain. 


Importantly, the proposed amendment does not affect the right of 100 shareholders to put up a resolution to be considered at a general meeting or to distribute a shareholder statement with the notice convening that meeting. So the changes do not affect the ability of 100 or more shareholders to engage in activism. That is very important and that is the way it should be, because shareholder activism is an important component of corporate governance. What these amendments do is ensure that the operation of this provision does not burden companies with the cost of having to hold extraordinary general meetings where this is unreasonable. There have been examples in the past. Woolworths was required to call an extraordinary general meeting on the issue of $1 limits on poker machines—and the cost of convening that meeting was close to half a million dollars. Over many years the NRMA had to call a series of extraordinary general meetings. It is estimated that the cost of those meetings was in the millions of dollars. The proposed amendment is a sensible reform, one that ensures that an appropriate balance remains between the right of shareholders to put resolutions at general meetings and the need to ensure that, in doing so, the costs imposed on the companies involved are not unreasonable.


The second element of these reforms is improving remuneration reporting. Years ago in Australia, shareholders became increasingly concerned, even outraged, at the size of executive remuneration packages—pay, bonuses, shares and share options. These were being paid even where executives were, by any reasonable measure, failing in their duties, as reflected in the performance of their companies. We saw situations where executives presided over falls in the share price and/or falls in the profitability of their companies yet still commanded outrageous remuneration. This created angst within the community, particularly amongst shareholders. Many saw the outcomes as being unfair and unreasonable. 


Labor acted on those concerns. It responded by implementing a fairer system that put shareholders, particularly institutional and mum-and-dad shareholders, first. The current shadow Treasurer, then the Assistant Treasurer, introduced reforms in July 2011. They became known as the 'two-strikes rule', which holds directors accountable to shareholders for executive salaries and bonuses. These reforms have led to a much more responsible and reasonable approach to executive remuneration being taken in this country. I think it is fair to say that the system has worked. 


The way the system works is that companies have two opportunities, from the perspective of accountability to shareholders, to get their executive remuneration right. If a company's remuneration report receives a shareholder no vote of 25 per cent or more at an annual general meeting, that is the first strike. If there is another strike in the second year—if the company's subsequent remuneration report again receives a no vote of 25 per cent or more—there can be a vote to spill the board. In other words, there can be a vote on whether or not all directors need to stand for re-election. That subsequent vote to require a re-election of the board needs a majority of 50 per cent plus one to pass. If it does receive that majority, the election for directors has to be held within 90 days. As I said, this is a model which has worked. It has seen companies take a much more reasonable approach to executive remuneration. The stories of outrageous executive salaries and packages have dissipated—and that is a positive thing. Labor is very proud of its record of improving remuneration reporting and dealing with executive remuneration. Concerns were raised by shareholders and users of remuneration reports and we dealt with them. 


Labor also supports removing the unnecessary requirement for unlisted disclosing entities that are companies to prepare a remuneration report. Unlike listed entities, they are not required to have their remuneration report adopted by shareholders through a non-binding resolution and they are not subject to the two-strikes test. In this respect, the reform in this bill is supported.


This bill also makes changes so that listed disclosing entities that are companies must disclose the number of options that lapse during the financial year, as well as the financial year in which those options were granted, for each member of the key management personnel. There will, under the changes introduced by this bill, be no obligation to disclose the value of options that lapse or the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel. Again this is a sensible reform that has Labor's support.


The bill makes an number of amendments that will improve the value of the information in remuneration reports. This goes to item 6 of schedule 1 of the bill, which clarifies the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months. There is confusion about conditions under which directors may determine that a financial year is shorter than 12 months, and these reforms clarify that.


Finally, in respect of the appointment of auditors, items 7 to 9 of schedule 1 of the bill amend the Corporations Act to exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. Currently all public companies, including companies limited by guarantee, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. This bill amends this so that small companies limited by guarantee, and those companies limited by guarantee that have their financial reports reviewed, are not required to appoint or retain an auditor. This means that companies that are not required to undertake an audit no longer have to retain an auditor. Again, this is a sensible reform that Labor is pleased to support.


The bill also amends the ASIC Act in respect of the operation of the Takeovers Panel. Labor sees this as an improvement and is happy to support it.


On the whole, these are sensible amendments to Australia's corporate landscape. They build on Labor's achievements in government of making our corporate legislation more representative of the interests and aspirations of shareholders, of workers, of customers, of clients and of the Australian public. We believe that these sensible reforms and the Labor reforms that were put in under the previous government should make Australia a more attractive place to invest. On that basis I am happy to commend the bill to the House.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:24):  I am pleased to speak on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulation and Other Measures) Bill 2014. This bill forms part of our government's commitment to repeal counterproductive, unnecessary and redundant legislation and regulations. I would like to start by giving an example from my electorate of Hughes of some of those burdensome regulations that tie the hands of small business. This example in the retail sector shows the absurdity of this regulation, the stupidity of it, and the big task that we have of working through and repealing this red tape to free the hands of entrepreneurs in this nation.


There is a shopping centre in my electorate called the Homemakers Centre, at Warwick Farm. It is on the Hume Highway and has six lanes of road on either side. Opposite is Warwick Farm racecourse. In the front of the shopping centre there are two large takeaway outlets. There is a very large car park. There are a lot of shops in there. Next door is the Masterton Homes display village, and on the other side of this is a small motel. It is an ideal location for a shopping centre.


A few regulations were put on that centre at a few retailers. I would like to compare the regulations in my electorate to the regulations in Afghanistan under the Taliban's control. I will quote from a 2001 article by Amy Waldman published inTheNew York Times. It is a story from Herat in Afghanistan. It says:


Hefozullah, a seller of cooking oil, was arrested at the marketplace for keeping his shop open during Friday prayers. He was sent to jail for four days and became No. 3,183 in a registry of arrests at the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.


The article goes on and talks about 'the penal code promulgated by the Taliban's leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar', which sets out in copious detail what retailers in Herat—in Taliban controlled Afghanistan—can and cannot sell. I will quote directly from the article. It says:


Those who fly pigeons—a favorite Afghan pastime—will be imprisoned until ''their pigeons disappear from their home.''


Then it goes on and lists all the things that are banned from sale from retail shops. It says:


A kite seller will be imprisoned for three days.


It lists other things that are banned:


… cinematography, any equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computer, VCR's, televisions … wine, … nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.


It goes on:


Nothing was left to chance or the imagination under the Taliban. Merchants importing products like shampoo would find that Taliban customs officials had gouged out the eyes of the female models on the boxes. The merchants were then required to display the products with black tape over female faces, or be subject to a beating or jailing.


The journalist goes on:


It is no wonder that residents here react as if waking from a grotesque dream.


Compare that list of things that were banned under the Taliban from being sold with the recent court decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court. Whereas the Taliban had a Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice enforcing those red-tape regulations, our similar regulations are being enforced by the Land and Environment Court and the New South Wales Court of Appeal.


The case was the Warehouse Group (Australia)—they were the appellant—versus those champions of free market competition, Woolworths Limited. This was a case where three senior judges were involved in the Court of Appeal with Queen's Counsel—a platoon of legal experts—working out what a retail shop in my electorate could and could not sell. There were many days of court hearings and a rather lengthy decision.


I will read through some of the list of things that were banned, not in Taliban controlled Afghanistan but in the electorate of Hughes, which I represent. There is a list here of over 40—it is in roman numerals. It goes to over 50 separate items. I would like to go through a few of them. Item (i): floor coverings were banned from sale. Small plastic containers were banned from sale. Garbage bins were banned. Paint was banned, as were paint accessories—it goes on—dust masks and paint scrapers. Dangerous items that need government control such as kitchen implements, mashers, vegetable peelers, kitchen hand food storage containers, curtains and accessories were also banned. Curtain tassels were banned—we must have laws in this country to control the sale of dangerous curtain tassels! Item (xxx) on the list of banned items is baby goods. Baby bibs were banned from sale, along with baby strollers, baby prams and baby car seats, and item (xxxv) on the banned list is child's potties. In this country we have such red tape and such regulation that we are required to have in the New South Wales Supreme Court Court of Appeal three distinguished and learned judges and a platoon of lawyers making a decision that a retail shop in my electorate should be banned from selling child's potties.


The list goes on. Other things banned included dog toys—we cannot have anyone selling dog toys! And there are bird cages. While the Taliban would ban the sale of pigeons or anything related, we just ban the sale of bird cages. Toys are banned. Item (xlvii) is sheets. Again, while the Taliban Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice would simply ban any equipment that reproduces the joy of music, at least our court of appeal detailed those things that reproduce the joy of music that are banned. Prerecorded videos were banned, prerecorded CDs, prerecorded audiotapes, blank videos, blank CDs and, item (lix), blank audio tapes. They were all banned from sale. On the Taliban list of banned items it was simply Christmas cards, but of course our New South Wales Supreme Court was able to do better than that—they set out the things that were banned from being sold in a retail shop in my electorate: Christmas goods, Christmas trees, Christmas decorations and, just like the Taliban, Christmas cards. We simply cannot have shops in Australia being unauthorised sellers of Christmas cards. How would we get on without this red tape? At least in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan retail shops could sell bottles of shampoo as long as they gouged the eyes out of the women on the boxes or put black tape over them. In my electorate, thanks to the decisions and the red tape and regulation we have, we simply banned it altogether. 


This is just an example of the regulation and red tape that we have. Other parts of my electorate fare even worse. It is not a matter of just having a list of things that they are not allowed to sell—dangerous goods such as potties and Christmas cards and things that reproduce the joys of music. We had in my electorate what was known as the Orange Grove shopping centre. On one side of Orange Grove Road we had a big Officeworks and on the other side a big Harvey Norman complex. Do we know what happened to Orange Grove shopping centre? They did not have a list of goods they were banned from selling—they were simply banned from operating. The red tape and regulation by the then New South Wales Labor-controlled state government simply banned them from operating and selling anything. That was done when former senator Bob Carr was New South Wales Premier—better known now as the senator who complained about not having silk pyjamas on an international flight; he complained about how unfair it was that he had to travel business class and about the quality of food and the types of music he could listen to. The very same Senator Carr was the one who banned a complete retail shopping centre from selling any of those goods. Silk pyjamas were banned, food was banned and of course the sale of any musical item was banned—the very things that Senator Carr complained about when he was forced to put up with the hardship of travelling in business class. These are just some examples of the red tape we have in this country.


This bill is estimated to reduce business compliance costs by around $14 million. The measures in the bill provide a better balance between the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company and the costs to companies required to hold a general meeting. The bill will improve and reduce remuneration reporting requirements, clarify the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months, exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor, improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel and extend the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration setting responsibility to include certain statutory bodies. 


There is some urgency in this action we are taking because we have some serious difficulties in this country. We face the problem of an ageing population. Commodity prices for our largest exports of coal and iron ore that were quite high under the previous government's term are coming back. Perhaps the biggest problem we have to deal with is servicing the interest on Labor's debt. For the past six years the previous Labor government simply—and this is the best way to explain it—ran this country at a loss. In each of those six years they spent more money than they raised.




Mr Bowen:
  How are you going?




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I note the shadow Treasurer at the table, and I am sure he is familiar with the figures that the government of Australia now has to finance because of the interest bill on their debt. It is $13½ billion a year. To put that in context, that is $570 for every man, woman and child in this country—and that is just for the interest bill that has to be paid. For every family of four the annual interest bill that we must now pay is $2,280. 


We can break it down over periods of time. Every month it is $1.125 billion. That is $1,125 million that flow out the door. That is the obligation that we have in interest just in one month. In a week it is $260 million. In a day, today, it is $37 million. On this day, this government will need to find $37 million just to pay the interest. In the next hour it is $1.5 million. That is the obligation that this nation has—to pay interest on a debt that this previous Labor government left.


Why is there some urgency about this? The money that is borrowed to pay for the six years of losses during the Labor government is done through the sale of government bonds. Whether through good luck or good management, we are currently in a period where global interest rates are at record lows. We have been able to borrow most of that money at around 3.5 per cent. The problem is that, even though we have that interest obligation, if we do not only address the interest but pay that debt down, who knows where interest rates will be in 10 years time, when a lot of these government bonds fall due and we have to refinance them. It may not be 3.35 per cent. We know that it could be double. And therefore, rather than having that $500 cost for every man, woman and child, it could be double. That is the urgency; that is the problem. That is why we must repeal red tape and free the hands of our entrepreneurs. I commend this bill to the House.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (10:39):  The Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014 amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. Items 1, 2 and 10 of the schedule to this bill amend the Corporations Act 2001, and their intent is to better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company and the costs of companies that have been required to call and hold a general meeting. It would repeal the so-called 100-member rule which creates an obligation on a corporation to hold a general meeting at the request of 100 or more shareholders.


These meetings are often called for protest purposes and almost always, particularly in the case of larger corporations, create a very significant cost to business. For example, Woolworths was compelled to call an extraordinary general meeting in relation to $1 limits on poker machines. Whatever one's views about the worth or otherwise of imposing a $1 limit on poker machines, it can be seen that this was very much a political action using corporate rules. What it did was to impose on Woolworths, as a very direct cost, about $500,000, which was the cost of notifying its shareholders for that extraordinary general meeting. The resolution when put to the extraordinary general meeting, despite the political action behind it, received just 2.5 per cent support of those attending the meeting.


No-one objects to the fact that people might have different views. No-one objects in any way to the expression of those views. Indeed, shareholders should be able to legitimately raise concerns about the affairs of companies in which they hold shares, through a number of mechanisms, but they should not be permitted to do it at a significant cost to other shareholders. It is not appropriate that a very small number of shareholders be able to impose costs at that level simply for the purpose of making a political point. You could cite as another example that in the two years from late 1999 to late 2001 the NRMA in New South Wales was forced to call 12 extraordinary general meetings to consider resolutions removing directors, each of which incurred several million dollars in costs, and in no case were any of the relevant regulations that were the supposed purpose of those extraordinary general meeting passed by the members of the NRMA.


The proposed changes do not remove the ability of 100 or more shareholders to add items to scheduled annual general meetings and to instigate debate as an agenda item at these meetings. This retains the right for 100 or more members to raise issues of concern, without the often significant cost to shareholders of scheduling extraordinary meetings under the current acts. Shareholder activism is a component of corporate governance. Shareholders should be able to put issues on the AGM agenda and should be able to instigate debate at the meeting. The right is of particular importance to retail shareholders, who have limited opportunities to meet with the company prior to the AGM. These rights will not change with this proposed legislation. 


Australia is currently alone in providing for a shareholder test that applies regardless of how much capital the requisitionists hold. It is more common to require that requisitionists must hold at least five to 10 per cent of the shares before they can call a general meeting. Again, no-one disputes the fact that shareholders have a right to question directors and decisions made by a company, but it should not be at a cost to other shareholders. Labor supports this change.


Items 3 to 5 and 10 of schedule 1 to this bill amend the Corporations Act 2001 to improve and streamline remuneration reporting requirements. Currently, disclosing entities that are companies must disclose the value of options that lapse during a financial year for each member of the key management personnel. Disclosing entities that are companies must also disclose the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel. This bill makes changes so that listed disclosing entities that are companies must disclose the number of options that lapse during a financial year and the financial year in which those options were granted for each member of the key management personnel. There will be no obligation to disclose the value of options that lapse. Under this bill there is no obligation to disclose the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel.


 Also currently, all disclosing entities that are companies are required to prepare a remuneration report, regardless of whether they are listed or unlisted. This bill changes that so unlisted disclosing entities that are companies are no longer required to prepare a remuneration report. Listed disclosing entities continue to be required to prepare a remuneration report.


Labor supports improving the disclosure of executive remuneration information in Australia. There have been concerns raised by shareholders and users of remuneration reports that currently the reports contain some information that was of limited benefit or can be found at other places in the annual report. Labor also supports removing the unnecessary requirement for unlisted disclosing entities that are companies to prepare a remuneration report. Unlike listed entities, they are not required to have their remuneration report adopted by shareholders through a non-binding resolution and are not subject to the two-strikes test.


Item 6 of schedule 1 to this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to clarify the circumstances under which a financial year may be less than 12 months. There is confusion about the conditions under which directors may determine that a financial year is shorter than 12 months. Currently, section 323D sets out how companies, registered schemes and disclosing entities may determine the length of their financial year. While an entity's financial year is expected to be approximately 12 months long, entities can determine otherwise in cases where an entity needs to modify its financial year by up to seven days to accommodate week based internal reporting frameworks or an entity needs to synchronise its financial year in order to prepare consolidated financial reports.


However, subsection 323D(2A) allows entities to determine that their financial year is less than 12 months if none of their previous five financial years have been less than 12 months, the shorter financial year commences at the end of the previous financial year and the decision is in the best interests of the entity. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the interaction between this provision and the operation of subsection 323D(2), which requires that a financial year is 12 months long, unless determined by the directors to be a period that is longer or shorter than 12 months by up to seven days.


There is confusion surrounding whether taking advantage of the flexibility in section 323D(2) would trigger the five-year period in which an entity is precluded from accessing the benefits offered by section 323D(2A). Similarly, subsection 323D(3) requires an entity to synchronise its financial year end with that of its parent entity when it becomes a controlled entity. Again, stakeholders have raised concerns that this provision may trigger the five-year period in which an entity is precluded from accessing the benefits offered by section 323D(2A).


The bill seeks to clarify that directors may determine that a financial year is shorter than 12 months by more than seven days irrespective of whether during an entity's previous five financial years the directors have determined that the financial year is shorter than 12 months by up to seven days or determined to synchronise the financial year to prepare consolidated financial statements. Labor supports the amendments in this bill that clarify the circumstances and conditions under which directors can determine the financial year is shorter than 12 months by more than seven days. This removes the unintended confusion arising from changes made in 2010 intended to make it easier for directors to alter financial year end dates.


 Items 7 to 9 of schedule 1 to this bill amend the Corporations Act to exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. Currently, all public companies, including companies limited by guarantee, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. This bill changes this so that small companies limited by guarantee and those companies limited by guarantee that have their financial reports reviewed are not required to appoint or retain an auditor. This means that companies that are not required to undertake an audit are no longer required to appoint and retain an auditor. All other public companies are required to appoint and retain an auditor, as is current practice. Labor supports these changes that remove unnecessary costs on business by removing the requirement for companies to appoint and retain an auditor, even if they are not required to conduct an audit. The change is expected to provide the greatest benefit to not-for-profit community organisations, allowing them to better service the community.


Part 1, items 1 and 2 of schedule 2 to this bill amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel by allowing takeover matters to be dealt with more efficiently. Currently, the president and members of the Takeovers Panel may only participate in proceedings if they are within Australia. These changes mean the President of the Takeovers Panel may give a direction in respect of members who are to constitute the panel whether or not the president is in Australia. Further, members of the Takeovers Panel may participate in proceedings whether or not the members are in Australia. As technology improves and the world becomes ever more connected, it is sensible to alter legislation to reflect that change. This bill will allow members of the Takeovers Panel to participate in proceedings if they are physically located outside of Australia at the time. Labor supports this sensible change to allow the more efficient resolution of disputes.


Part 1, items 3 to 8, and part 2, item 9 of schedule 2 to this bill amend the ASIC Act to extend the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration-setting responsibility to include certain Corporations Act bodies. Currently, the ASIC Act provides that the responsible Treasury portfolio minister determines the terms and conditions—including remuneration—of the chairs and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the FRC; the Chair of the Australian Accounting Standards Board, the AASB; and the Chair of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, the AUASB. The ASIC Act also provides that the FRC is responsible for determining the terms and conditions, including remuneration, of the offices held by the members of the AASB and the AUASB.


This bill brings responsibility for determining the remuneration and full-time member recreation leave entitlements of the chair and member positions of the FRC, the AASB and the AUASB within the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Remuneration Tribunal has specialist skills in reviewing and determining remuneration and is therefore better placed to determine the remuneration of these offices. Moreover, it will ensure consistency in the remuneration setting arrangements between the three bodies and other statutory office holders.

Labor supports the provisions in this bill that bring responsibility for determining the remuneration and full-time-member recreation leave entitlements of the chair and members within the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction. There is no question that that is the best place for them and where they ought to be. The changes that are contained in this bill are supported by Labor. They were changes that Labor was progressing through in government and matters that had been worked on with bipartisan support across both sides of this chamber, and within the industry and the sector itself. It is good, sensible policy. I offer Labor's support for these measures and commend the bill to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:53):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014and indicate that the Labor Party and I will be supporting this government legislation that amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. With the Minister for Small Business and the shadow Treasurer in the chamber we would be quick to acknowledge the important role that corporations play in Australian society, in the protection of the individual and the mustering together of an appropriate response to the risk that comes with business. In fact, much of the development of modern Australia can be traced back to corporations, with people pooling their money and not having an individual risk.


Corporations have evolved over time. Not everything that applies to a corporation is covered in the corporations legislation. Modern corporations are aware of their social licence. It is not something that is written in any particular section of the corporations legislation, but they must have a strong connection with their community and earn the right to carry out things that they do, whether it be the tasks they do, the products they make or sell or the role they play in the community.


Items 1, 2 and 10 of schedule 1 to this bill amend the Corporations Act to better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with the company and the cost to companies of being required to call and hold a general meeting. I focus particularly on this because of the point I made earlier about social licence. Obviously, shareholders of the company have the ability to give input at an annual general meeting of a corporation, and say, 'This is what we are concerned about.' But it costs money to set up an annual general meeting and to notify all the shareholders. Even in these days of electronic communications it still costs money to hold such meetings. This amendment to the Corporations Act repeals the so-called 100-member rule, which created an obligation on a corporation to hold a general meeting at the request of 100 or more shareholders. These meetings are often called for protest purposes. I am not saying that those purposes are not legitimate, but there can be significant costs that have to be met by every shareholder in the corporation, and such meetings do create a significant cost to business. These proposed changes do not remove the ability of 100 shareholders to add items to the regular, scheduled annual general meeting. Obviously, shareholders always have the right to instigate debate as an agenda item at any of these meetings. They still have a chance to have their concerns heard as an item at the annual general meeting, whether their concerns are about the financial governance of the organisation or some of the social licence matters. This legislation retains the right of 100 or more members to raise issues of concern, but without the often significant costs to shareholders of scheduling these extraordinary meetings, as exists under the current act.


The 100-member rule is not linked to having five per cent or 10 per cent of the value of a corporation, which is what happens in several countries. For example, for a significant company like Woolworths, only 100 shareholders would be required to compel the company to call an extraordinary general meeting. That is actually what happened with Woolworths when it came to debating $1 limits on its poker machines. The cost to Woolworths of notifying its shareholders of the meeting was $500,000. When it hosted the meeting the motion received only 2.5 per cent support. Perhaps it might be said that if the motion to put a $1 limit on poker machines had received 10 per cent or 50 per cent support it might have been worthwhile. Irrespective of the merits of the reason for the shareholders calling the meeting in the Woolworths example, Labor has seen that we need to be more sensible about this and not have unnecessary costs attached to corporations. The other example mentioned by the shadow minister, Bernie Ripoll, was the example of the NRMA—



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  Sorry, the shadow assistant—




Mr Bowen:
  He's the shadow minister for financial services.




Mr PERRETT:
  The shadow minister for financial services—thank you, shadow Treasurer—and member for Oxley. He is my next-door neighbour and a great guy. He gave the example of the NRMA, which in two years was forced to call 12 extraordinary general meetings to consider motions about removing directors. The meetings cost several million dollars and resulted in none of the directors being removed from the NRMA board. It is hard to justify such behaviour.


Items 3 to 5 and 10 of schedule 1 of this bill amend the Corporations Act to improve and streamline remuneration reporting requirements. Currently, disclosing entities that are companies must disclose the value of options that lapsed during a financial year for each member of the key management personnel. So disclosing entities that are companies must also disclose the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel.


Item 6 of schedule 1 of this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to clarify the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months. This sounds like something out of Yes Minister, but it is actually good business practice every now and then to change the year. There is confusion about the conditions under which directors may determine that a financial year be shorter that 12 months. Currently section 323D sets out how companies, registered schemes and disclosing entities may determine the length of their financial year. While an entity's financial year is expected to be approximately 12 months long, entities can determine otherwise in cases where an entity needs to modify its financial year by up to seven days to accommodate week based internal reporting frameworks or an entity needs to synchronise its financial year in order to prepare consolidated financial reports.


Items 7 to 9 of schedule 1 of this bill amend the legislation to exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. Obviously there are significant costs associated with auditors. They perform an important role. Normally when companies get into trouble you find that the auditor has not been doing an appropriate job. Currently all public companies, including companies limited by guarantee, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. This bill amends this so that the small companies limited by guarantee and those companies limited by guarantee that have their financial reports reviewed are not required to appoint or retain an auditor. This means that companies that are not required to undertake an audit are no longer required to appoint and retain an auditor. All other public companies, however, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. So the public has that security, knowing that auditors will be looking through the books of those companies.


Part 1, items 1 and 2, of schedule 2 of this bill amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act to improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel by allowing takeover matters to be dealt with more efficiently. Currently the president and members of the Takeovers Panel may only participate in proceedings if they are within Australia. This bill makes amendments so that the president of the Takeovers Panel may give a direction in respect of members who are to constitute the panel whether or not the president is in Australia. Further, members of the Takeovers Panel may participate in proceedings whether or not they are in Australia.


Part 1, items 3 to 8, and part 2, item 9, of schedule 2 of this bill amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to extend the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration setting responsibility to include certain Corporations Act bodies. The ASIC Act currently provides that the responsible Treasury portfolio minister determines the terms and conditions, including the remuneration of the chairs and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the chair of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the chair of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The ASIC Act also provides that the FRC is responsible for determining the terms and conditions, including remuneration, of the offices held by the members of the AASB and the AUASB.


This bill brings responsibility for determining the remuneration and full-time member recreation leave entitlements of the chair and member positions of the FRC, the AASB and the AUASB within the Remuneration Tribunal's direction. The Remuneration Tribunal has specialist skills in reviewing and determining remuneration. It looks after members of parliament's remuneration as well, and it does a good job. It is therefore better placed to determine the remuneration of these officers. Moreover, it will ensure consistency in the remuneration setting arrangements between the three bodies and other statutory office holders.


One of the controversial items in this legislation which has bipartisan support will be the one about 100 members. I revisit that item because so many campaigns are organised when a corporation is perhaps doing something that people are not happy with. We have seen it with union campaigns in the past where perhaps inappropriate workplace practices are taking place. We have seen it when corporations are selling something, farming, mining or doing something that members of the community are not happy with. The 100 shareholders practice has often been used in the past in these cases. I want to stress again that, when compared with other common law jurisdictions that utilise corporations or even civil countries that use corporations and all the benefits that come with corporations, Australia has been a bit stand-alone in letting 100 shareholders, as I said, irrespective of the value of the shares held by those 100 shareholders, take control and basically impose a cost on other shareholders.


That would be the more controversial point, but the other aspects, such as improving remuneration reporting, clarifying the financial year, streamlining the auditor appointments, improving the efficiency of takeover panels and improving the government remuneration process, are not particularly controversial. This is normal, run-of-the-mill government business. I am happy to support this legislation before the chamber.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (11:06):  I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. This bill makes a number of amendments designed to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses operating in Australia. Schedule 1 of this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to reduce the cost to businesses operating in Australia by removing the ability for 100 members of a company to request a general meeting. While this change ensures company resources are no longer spent on meetings requested by only a very small minority of shareholders, we have also made sure important shareholder rights are retained. This change will not impact on the right of a member or members with at least five per cent of the voting shares to request a general meeting. Nor will it impact on the right of 100 members of a company to place items on the agenda of a general meeting.


This bill simplifies remuneration disclosures in Australia. Unlisted disclosing entities will no longer be required to prepare a remuneration report. This bill clarifies when entities can change their financial year end dates. Stakeholders have been calling for this clarity since an amendment to permit companies greater flexibility to change their financial year end date was inserted into the Corporations Act in 2010. Entities will finally be able to access this flexibility with confidence.


Finally, schedule 1 of the bill removes the requirement for companies limited by guarantee, that are not required to undertake an audit, to appoint an auditor. This primarily benefits smaller companies limited by guarantee who feel the burden of the existing requirement most acutely.


Scheduled 2 of this bill amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to improve the efficiency of government processes, reflecting the government's commitment to identifying cost savings and efficiencies within its own processes. Schedule 2 also improves the efficiency of the operation of the Takeovers Panel. It further extends the remuneration-setting responsibility of the Remuneration Tribunal to the Financial Reporting Council, the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.


In summary, the amendments made by this bill will reduce the costs borne by Australian businesses because of government regulation. It will permit business to focus on what it is they should be doing—running their business. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (13:29):  What a shambolic day it has been for this coalition government. When it comes to the GP tax, probably one of the least popular policies in the history of the Federation, we have had the Prime Minister telling journalists that there would not be a GP tax and we have had the Treasurer telling people that they still intended to bring the GP tax before the parliament. They still wanted to bring the GP tax before the parliament. Don't we know what a rotten policy this is and how much people hate it! I have to say, in my by-election earlier this year, the Prime Minister came to town and the foreign minister came to town and said, 'There's not going to be a GP tax—it is all scaremongering on the part of this woman.' My electorate was told it was all scaremongering. What did we see? We saw the Commission of Audit recommend a GP tax. Then we saw a budget in which this government said that there would be a GP tax. And haven't they looked ridiculous, to the point where one of their own senators is saying that he might cross the floor if the GP tax does go back to the parliament. We have the health minister saying, 'We might do it by regulation.' He is refusing to rule out doing it by regulation. It is an absolute mess. It is an absolute disgrace. 


Who are the people who are affected by this shambolic government's uncertainty? They are the consumers of this country, people already trying to bear the cost-of-living pressures that they already face. It is the Abbott government policy to tax people every time they go to the doctor, with $3.5 billion worth of taxes on people when they go to the doctor. Someone in this government surely knows what is going on— (Time expired)

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:16):  This government has reached a tipping point in what has been the worst week so far in the life of the Abbott government. Australians know that the Abbott government have let them down, and 446 days after they were elected there is a mood of national disappointment in the conduct and the decisions of the Abbott government. This has been a week of chaos and lies. We see the communications minister contradicting the Prime Minister. We see a hypothetical defence minister cutting the pay of our Defence men and women and defaming thousands of people who work at the Submarine Corporation. And then we see the Prime Minister's performance in question time all this week as a metaphor for a government adrift. They have had an opportunity to talk about their vision for the future; instead, they have descended into petty politics. 


We have seen the veneer of civilisation slip from the Prime Minister's mask, and we have seen old Tony come back—the man more happy being in opposition than being in government. Life was simple when he was the opposition leader. All he ever had to do was oppose. But upon coming to government we have seen confirmed that this is a  government bereft of vision. It is bereft of a plan. In May of this year they brought down arguably the most unfair budget in living memory. For six months this government has flailed around trying to put propositions to the Australian people which the Australian people will not accept. 


Then this week we saw the farcical situation of the government announcing for the sixth time that they are going to reboot the budget. They had a council of war. They are going to de-barnacle the hull of the budget. They are going to remove the obstacles. They are going to get back to basics. But, in fact, what we have seen about their hateful ideology for this country, their unfair approach, is that last night the Prime Minister's Office had their media spinners talking to the people in the press gallery, saying: 'We've got this all under control. This is not the Titanic. We've got it under control.' What they said last night to the media is: 'We're going to drop the GP tax for now. We're going to drop it. We're not going to talk about it now.' No doubt, there were 30 or so marginal-seat members breathing a sigh of relief. But this is such a confused, chaotic and incompetent government that, this morning, out rushed the notorious charm offensive of the government! For Australians who do not know whom I am referring to, I refer to Senator Eric Abetz. That would be the triumph of hope over experience, sending him into charm people! He said, 'No, we're sticking to our policies.' Then, of course, you have got the worst health minister in living memory coming forward and saying, 'We are going to do whatever it takes.' He said that, whatever it takes, they will get the GP tax. What Labor informs Australians is that, even if this government does change its tactics, it has not changed its mind. It wants to make Medicare not universally accessible. We listened in question time to this hypocritical Prime Minister say that he is the best friend Medicare has ever had. With best friends like that, you do not need enemies. 


It has not just been their backflipping, their uncertainty, their chaos and their inability to line up their ducks when it comes to the issue of the GP tax. We hear rumours that the backbench members of the government do not like this idea of $100,000 university degrees. Well, do you know what? They are right. Australians do not like the idea that their university fees will double and triple. They do not like the idea of 20 per cent of the universities' budgets being cut, and they certainly do not like the idea of $100,000 degrees. Australians do not like the idea that women who go to university and who will have broken service in their working careers because they choose to raise their children and take time out of work are going to be in debt for the rest of their lives to Christopher Pyne. Why would you like that idea? 


So it is not just the GP tax where this government has got the wrong idea for the future of this country, and no vision. It is not just on higher education that this government cannot be trusted with the future of Australia. We saw them this week have a ridiculous argument about: 'Are they cutting the ABC? Is it an efficiency dividend? Did Tony Abbott lie?'—all of the issues. We saw our poor Prime Minister tie himself up in knots because he just cannot be straight with the Australian people. The poor old member for Wentworth was left holding the proverbial 'ABC baby'. He said, 'Well, yes, it's not an efficiency dividend; it's a cut.' I give him points for honesty. The poor old member for Wentworth lost to the Prime Minister on the republic, he lost the leadership and now he has lost the ABC fight. He is forced to be just a rubber stamp for Tony Abbott's cruel cuts to the ABC. 


This is a government that is adrift domestically, and everyone knows that the minibudget which the Treasurer has to bring down in December is the last shot in the locker for 2014 for this government. This is the government that has wasted a year and a quarter of government. This is a government that has done little, but we hear them talk about the G20. Saturday a week ago the Prime Minister had the opportunity, scripted by Wayne Swan, Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, to address the leaders of the world. Labor wanted the nation to perform well. The Prime Minister of Australia, the chief spokesperson for Australia, had an opportunity to demonstrate that Australia is a forward-thinking, visionary country with a plan for the future. What did he say for eight excruciating minutes? For eight excruciating minutes Tony Abbott had a cry about the fact that Australians do not like the GP tax and they will not back the higher education reforms. It was cringeworthy, weird, bizarre and a missed opportunity. Even more than that—




Ms Henderson:
  On a point of order, Madam Speaker: I would ask that the Leader of the Opposition refer to members by their correct title.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will refer to people by their correct title.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Thank you for your guidance, Madam Speaker. The Prime Minister missed the opportunity of peacetime foreign policy in Australia, the like of which we will not see again in this generation. Instead of talking about climate change—which he never wanted to do—he never saw President Obama walking away and having a policy on the future, unlike the 'little Australia' mentality of this current government. He blew the opportunity; instead he was like one of those carnival show or sideshow-alley hucksters, barking, 'Roll up, roll up.' Let us see Australia's pathetic answers on climate change. 


What he did was give the Australian people a bad character reference. He complained about the Australian people to the rest of the world. Who is this Prime Minister to complain about the Australian people when they do not like his GP tax? Who is this Prime Minister to complain about the Australian people to the rest of the world to say that we are anti reform and anti change and that we do not have a vision for the future? And that is all because he broke his promises before the last election.


This is a government adrift in every sense of the word. Have a look at this debacle over Defence. I know the jungle drums are beating within the government: 'Who will get Senator Johnston's spot?' I know the Prime Minister is stubbornly refusing to give him up, but we on this side predict that it is only a matter of time before we have a new Minister for Defence in this country, as we should. The pay of our Defence Force is not keeping pace with real wages and real prices, and that is an effective pay cut. We also know that, when it comes to dealing with all of the issues, this is a government adrift: the budget is adrift; the GP tax is a rotten idea going nowhere fast, even if the government want it; higher education policies in this country are adrift. We know that the treatment of pensioners in this country is adrift, with the cut to the indexation rate of pensions. Every government member knows that their budget is adrift. They have no domestic policy. On the world stage we missed the opportunity of the G20; the nation missed the opportunity of the G20. I admit that the member for Kooyong got his head on TV during the G20—he personally had a good G20—but the government and the nation had a very bad G20.


The difference with Labor is that next year we will demonstrate what a plan should look like. We will demonstrate the power of positive ideas. We intend to win the next election, not because we are not the government, not based on the list of the government's lies, but because we have a view about the future and we have faith in the Australian people. We will keep defeating your rotten measures this year and next year, right up to the next election.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (15:26):  It was the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, who said:


You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.


That is what explains the result of the 2013 election, because the fraud and the failure that is today's Labor Party saw them get the worst defeat in the history of our Federation, the lowest primary vote in 100 years—worse than Scullin in 1931, worse than Whitlam in 1975, worse than Keating in 1996. What explained that result? The debt and deficit disaster of the Labor government—the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd experiment. They saddled the Australian people with $667 billion worth of debt, $25,000 for every man, woman and child, and an interest bill of $1 billion a month, climbing to $3 billion a month. This is despite the member for Lilley standing at this dispatch box claiming that he was announcing four years of surpluses.


It is that fiscal record that saw 21,000 cheques of $900 sent to dead people; that saw 21,000 additional regulations strangle small business; that saw 400,000 jobs lost in small business; that saw free trade agreements stay on the side bench not being concluded by a government that did not care about the trading opportunities in our region; that gave us a carbon tax that nobody asked for and nobody wanted; that gave us a mining tax that was projected to produce $49.5 billion worth of revenue but only produced a few hundred million dollars of revenue and introduced the dark spectre of sovereign risk. 


Of course the member from Maribyrnong raises the issue of Defence. The record of those opposite on Defence is second to none in being derelict in their duties to protect the Australian people. In fact, Defence spending went down to its lowest level since 1938, at 1.56 per cent of GDP. What about the NBN?, the NBN that started out as a $4.7 billion federal commitment signed on the back of a coaster when Senator Conroy had to hop on a plane with Kevin Rudd just to get a minute of his time? In six years of Labor, we saw a rollout that did not even reach three per cent of Australians. 


That is the record: 21,000 cheques to dead people; 21,000 additional regulations; a carbon tax and a mining tax; hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in small business; the IMF, the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Commission of Audit saying to us that we cannot continue with business as usual; and this ballooning, growing budget deficit and its associated debt—the intergenerational theft that the Prime Minister talks about. Today's children will be paying off Labor's debt of yesterday. There is what is called a Burkean compact. It is a 'partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living and those who are dead, and those who are to be born'. Labor effectively broke that compact through its fiscal mismanagement. 


We are today debating not just our record in government but also the legacy of debt and deficit that Labor left us. I was at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry dinner last night when the chairman got up and said that, by any fair benchmark, the Abbott government has achieved much in its first year. Let us start with the free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China which the Labor Party failed to conclude because it is beholden to vested interests. 


We are proud of the fact that we are getting access to the markets of these huge economies. China has 1.2 billion people, is moving 10 million people from its regions to its cities every year, has more than 90 cities with more than five million people and already has more fast rail and autobahns than the entire European Union. We now have access to that market that every other Western nation dreams of having. We already have two-way trade of $150 billion with China, and that will go from strength to strength under this free trade agreement. The agreement gets rid of tariffs on many of our resources. The tariff on coking coal, for example, goes immediately, while the tariff on thermal coal will go over the next couple of years. We have ensured that our agriculture, whether it is beef, dairy or horticulture—mangoes, potatoes and nuts—will get straight access into the Chinese market. And what about services? Services make up 70 per cent of today's Australian economy but only 17 per cent of our exports. Now we will get into the Chinese market, a massively growing and lucrative market, because of the work that Andrew Robb and the Prime Minister have done to get that free trade agreement. 


What about the success of the G20? The Leader of the Opposition referred to the G20. It was a golden period, the goldene medina for Australian foreign and economic policy. Eighty-five per cent of the world's GDP was represented here in Australia, as well as 75 per cent of the world's trade and two-thirds of the world's population. Concrete agreements were reached, including a commitment to an extra two per cent growth which, when implemented, will create trillions of additional dollars for the world economy and millions of jobs for Australians and for others around the world. 


What about the infrastructure hub that will be established in Sydney? We will bring together information about the pricing, construction and prioritisation of infrastructure projects. What about the discussion on tax and the proper treatment of multinationals? What about shadow banking and over-the-counter derivatives—and what about trade and rebooting the multilateral trade round? Bilateral trade agreements are only insurance for when multilateral trade liberalisation stalls. That is what was agreed in Brisbane; that is what our Prime Minister, together with the Treasurer, led on from the front; and that is why we are very proud of our record.


What about what we are doing to get rid of red tape? We have announced more than $2 billion worth of savings, after the Labor Party gave us an additional 21,000 regulations. What about infrastructure? What about the East West Link, which is going to produce 7,000 jobs in Victoria? What about WestConnex in New South Wales? What about the decision to build a second airport at Badgerys Creek, after 50 years, half a century, of indecision? That is something the member for McMahon and his side could never have achieved, but we on this side have achieved it. 


What about the hard, hard task of budget repair? It has only been given to us because Labor could never do it. Through our budget announcements, we are trying to ensure $300 billion worth of fiscal consolidation over the next decade. We are trying to introduce an earn-or-learn strategy. With our medical research fund, we are trying to boost innovation and entrepreneurship in this country. We want to create the jobs of tomorrow, not just the jobs of today. We want to unshackle small business through, for example, our decision to ensure that nearly half a million small businesses do not have to participate in the PAYG system. We are removing that red tape. More than 40,000 small businesses will no longer have to complete a BAS, because they are not paying any GST. Those are just some of the measures we have announced.


We have a forward-looking agenda. Our federalism white paper will be aimed at making the federal-state compact work much more effectively, and the Prime Minister has already reinvigorated COAG. We will be doing a tax white paper. Ken Henry came up with a number of good ideas, but the Labor Party only picked one, and that was the disastrous mining tax. He found that there were 125 taxes in Australia and that 115 of those taxes were producing just 10 per cent of the revenue—10 taxes were producing 90 per cent of the revenue—so there is a lot we can do there. Then there is the Harper review into competition policy. That is extremely important. It is going to give us a way forward to boost competition, to boost jobs and to boost growth in this country. In addition, the Commission of Audit has given us a blueprint for the consolidation of government entities and the like. 


We are so proud of what we have done in just one year, but it is only the start. I know that the next speaker from our side, the member for Bennelong, as well as the member for Robertson, the member for Mallee and the member for Reid are just as proud of what we have achieved. (Time expired)

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:36):  The people of Australia look to their federal government for a vision, and they look for that government to be competent in delivering that vision. When they look at this government, they see a government whose vision is for every Australian to have to pay to go to the doctor; whose vision is to rip up the universality of health care, to wreck Medicare, that great social compact; to give Australia's pensioners, who have worked hard all their lives, an unfair system of indexation; to take $80 billion out of the health and education systems of Australia; to deliberately create an underclass of Australia's young people by denying them access to Newstart; and to rip away family tax benefits. That is the extent of the vision that this government intends to give the nation. And it is even incompetent in delivering that cheap and nasty vision for the nation.


This is a government which likes to talk about being calm and methodical. We hear it all the time: how calm and methodical this government is. The last 24 hours have been about as calm and methodical as schoolies week on the Gold Coast! We have had chaos in policy implementation. We had the Prime Minister's office last night fanned out across the building, talking to journalists, saying: 'You can write with great authority that the GP tax is dead. Tony Abbott's killed it.' You can just imagine them over there in the Prime Minister's office saying: 'We've got an election on Saturday. You know what we do about election time? We mislead people about our intentions. That's what we do at election time in the Liberal and National parties. Let's brief out that we're killing the GP tax, authorised by the Prime Minister's office, talking to journalists right across the building.' There was only one little problem. Nobody told the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance, the Leader of the Government in the Senate or the Minister for Health, apparently. 


Calm and methodical? This bunch, this cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, are marauding about, attacking the social compact of Australia, attacking those things which have been part of our social compact for 40 years—a 40-year community standard in Medicare. This gang of marauders cannot even shoot straight. They cannot even shoot straight in their attack on Australia's social compact. If you give us a cheap and nasty vision, at least be competent as you implement it. At least provide a bit of consistency and a bit of logic as you implement it. But the government cannot even do that. They cannot even trash Medicare competently. They cannot even abolish universal health care with the degree of competence that the Australian people look for.




Mr Giles:
  They have been trying for 40 years now.




Mr BOWEN:
  For 40 years they have been trying. You would think they would get it right. This is a community standard which even John Howard did not attempt to attack, which Gough Whitlam implemented against huge opposition from the predecessors of the members opposite, which Bob Hawke and Paul Keating implemented against opposition from John Howard and the Liberal and National parties. But even John Howard, who once declared that he would destroy Medicare, came to accept that community standard. Even he said: 'I accept that I've lost the debate. Medicare is here to stay. Universal health care is here to stay.'


Medicare is important to the nation that Australia has become and aspires to be, but this Prime Minister just does not get it. He says: 'No, I'm going to out-conservative John Howard. I'm going to rip up the social compact that is Medicare.' But he cannot even do it competently. And when he backtracks, when he tries to admit defeat, it lasts less than 24 hours, and you have the Treasurer out there countermanding the Prime Minister and saying, 'No, the Prime Minister's wrong.'


This Treasurer stood at that dispatch box and brought down that unfair budget when he considered himself a substantial figure, and he was seen as the substantial figure of the government, the person providing the government's narrative backbone—remember that? Actually, it was not that long ago. It was not that long ago when he was the government's most substantial figure. Now the Treasurer is in danger in a slight breeze! That is how substantial he is these days. You have got to hope they have got him tethered down! Senior Liberals are speculating that he might not make it to the election as Treasurer because of his incompetence. He says: 'No, we're sticking by it. We've got an alternative vision for the nation.' He says, 'Just because you lose in the Senate, you don't let a little principle like that get in your way; you keep going.'


They have an alternative vision for the nation, and it is a cheap and nasty one. It involves making people pay to go to the doctor. It involves ripping off pensioners. It involves cutting $80 billion out of health and education. It involves ripping away Newstart benefits from young people. They will not accept it in the Senate. When the parliament and the people say no, they say, 'No, we're going to keep going.' That is what they say. This is what they say to the Australian people: 'We might not be able to implement it now.' But we know what they want to do in their hearts. They are making it very clear. If they ever have the numbers in the other place as well as in this, we know what they want. We know what they want to implement, and it is a very poor vision for Australia. (Time expired)

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (15:41):  Australia is a great country. As someone who has travelled widely and lived overseas for a good portion of my life I am able to say this with some authority. We have been the Lucky Country from riding on the sheep's back and through mining booms. The tyranny of distance at times has been our best friend, but now the world is a smaller place and more competitive, and it is now up to us to make our own luck. Australia is a great country, a lucky country, but can we withstand bad government and bad leadership? The governing of a country is a serious business. It impacts every one of us and can impact generations to come. The government can change the direction of the very future of our country and our people. We have suffered six years of irresponsible and wasteful government, littered with poor judgements, motivated only by tomorrow's headlines. Short-sighted in the extreme, Labor's only concern was their popularity—no concern about how much that might cost.


On election night our Prime Minster announced that Australia was under new management, open for business, and would provide stable and certain government for business and all Australian families: 'We will build the roads of the 21st century. We will be a government of infrastructure.' The moment of elation was followed swiftly by attack after attack. He, as he did in opposition, worked with his team, and what a team it is. It is a team that reflects the very definition of 'team': a group of people with a full set of complementary skills required to complete a task, a job, or a project. Team members (1) operate with a high degree of interdependence, (2) share authority and responsibility for self-management, (3) are accountable to the collective performance and (4) work towards a common goal and shared rewards. A team becomes more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual commitment creates synergy, thus generating performance greater than the sum performance of its individual members. This is a pretty apt description of our team, our government. 


In the face of adversity and criticism of work undertaken, our policies have been implemented—policies that were reduced to a few words and ridiculed but that have in fact stopped the boats and rid us of the carbon tax and the mining tax. In the face of tragedy, our team leaders have maintained their calm and their dignity and have represented us on the world stage in a way that made all of us proud and comforted us during these times of distress. During all of this, our team have put the foundations in place for a golden era, with free trade agreements with our most important trading partners in the region—Korea, Japan and China. In this short period our team has rebuilt the live cattle industry and restored our tattered reputation for sovereign trust—a reputation hard-earned but so easily sullied and harmed by the previous government. Our team has also worked to repair the damage done by the previous government in installing the ambitious NBN program, now on track.


I know our Prime Minister in a number of ways. He is a loving and considerate husband; he is a loving and caring father. He is highly intelligent and educated, and he is a very hard worker—and one hell of a tough competitor. He provides his party with leadership that inspires. He has not sold his achievements well enough. In the party room the other day, he said, 'I do not have a degree in skiting.' I would much rather have hard work, intelligence and results than empty promises of things that never eventuate.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (15:47):  I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance, which is about the chaos, incompetence and broken promises of the Abbott government. There has been no clearer display of that than what we saw this morning. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister's office briefing senior journalists—very serious journalists—in our press gallery that the GP tax was dead. This policy has been around for 12 months, the news broken first by Samantha Maiden in December last year that the government was contemplating it. The government denied it, it went back and forth forever and finally it was announced in the budget, the government coming clean with the Australian people. Here we had the Prime Minister's own office briefing senior journalists. They do not just make stuff up. There were senior journalists reporting this morning that the Prime Minister's office had said that the GP tax was dead. 


What an absolute debacle we had this morning. The Minister for Health was nowhere to be seen anywhere in the media—it was left to Minister Abetz to go out there and try to clean things up. We had the Prime Minister last night saying that the GP tax was back on and that they think it is the best thing since sliced bread, and we then had the Minister for Health, Peter Dutton, out there saying that they were going to proceed with this and would do anything to get it through; they would take any measure possible to get it through. We then had the Treasurer saying that they were going to go through the parliament and would only do it by parliamentary means; they would only do it through legislation. Then we had the Assistant Minister for Health over in the Senate during question time saying that they will do it anyway—they might do it by regulation but they will do it anyway. I felt sorry for the poor old member for Gippsland during an interview on ABC. In an interview on his local radio station he was left hanging out there, having to say, 'Look, I really don't know what is going on; I am sure someone will tell me at some point.' How embarrassing—a senior, long-term member of the government left out there hanging this morning, unable to say whether the government was finally going to have the ticker to get rid of its GP tax. What an absolute chaos of a government we saw this morning.


The member for Bennelong was saying it is all about messaging and that the Prime Minister is sorry he has not got his messaging right, but it is not the messaging that is wrong; it is the policy. Why does this government fail to understand that this is not health policy? This is about taxing people who go to the doctor. This is about putting a barrier in the way of the most efficient part of our health system, the part of our health system that has not experienced this blow-out in growth. Yes, it is steadily growing, but not beyond any sustainable means. The MBS item for doctor visits is sustainable, so why would you put a barrier in the way of the most efficient part of the health system—going to see a doctor?


The Australian public do not like this policy, and nor do the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Doctors Reform Society, the Nurses and Midwives Foundation or health practitioners across the country. It is not just about general practitioners: it is about, for example, radiography. Every time you go for an X-ray, an MRI or a PET scan, every time you go for a blood test or other pathology test, it is a tax on every single primary care part of our health system. That is what the government wants to do—tax you every time you go to the doctor, go for a blood test or get an X-ray. 


What sort of government is it that has as almost its sole health policy blocking people going to a general practitioner? This government has decided that there are a million visits a year that should be stopped. That is its health policy. What sort of chaotic, irresponsible government is it that thinks it is decent health policy to stop people accessing a general practitioner? We have been encouraging people to go to the doctor to manage their chronic disease, to prevent ill-health, to go and find out what they need to do to keep well and to manage episodic illness. It is the part of the system that keeps Australians well and that has been serving this country for over 100 years. General practice visits are an important part of our healthcare system. Yet here we have this chaotic government that, it is suggested, cannot get its messaging right. But it cannot get its policy right. This policy stinks to high heaven. Everybody in the healthcare sector, anyone who knows anything about health, knows that the government should ditch this policy. They have been told to ditch this policy, but we know the only way to ditch it is to ditch this government. (Time expired)

 (Reid) (15:52):  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, on indulgence—whilst we have been sitting here, the tragic news has broken that Phillip Hughes, the cricketer that was hit in the back of the head with a cricket ball a couple of days ago, has passed away. What a tragedy. I am not much in the mood to argue politics. It was his birthday on Sunday; he would have turned 26. I met him a few times in my former job. My family own hotels; Carlton & United Breweries is a large company that we buy a lot of beer through, and they are major sponsors of cricket. I had the opportunity to interact with Phil on a fair few occasions.


You would not meet a better young guy. He had his whole life in front of him, and I just cannot imagine what his family must be going through this afternoon. Twenty-six on Sunday. It puts life into perspective. My heart goes out to his family. My heart goes out to his friends—his cricket friends and his friends right across the board. My heart also goes out to Sean Abbott, the young New South Welshman who was the bowler.


Phil played 25 tests for Australia and 26 one-day internationals. I remember when he blazed onto the scene as a youngster, on a tour, and there were centuries galore. They could not work out how to get him out. It was the South African tour. They just could not work out how to get him out. He had such an aggressive style of play. He literally lived and died by the fact that the best form of defence was attack, for him.


I would just like to take this opportunity to throw my thoughts to his family, to acknowledge his life and his passing today, and to pass on my best wishes to all involved. I cannot begin to imagine, thank goodness, what they are going through, but my heart goes out to them. I would like to ask the House for a minute's silence.

):  I respect the member for Reid's call. I think this is something that would want to be taken up by the whole parliament with the Leader of the House, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I think that a moment probably will be accommodated. I cannot, from this place, anticipate that. I allowed indulgence during MPI for those comments. I think we are all shocked at the tragic loss of a wonderful young Australian who had so much potential, and I really respect your call, but I think I should leave it to the Leader of the House. We would want all in the parliament to have an opportunity to participate in sending a message to the family.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (15:52):  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, on indulgence—I appreciate the sensitive way that you have dealt with this matter. Can I just foreshadow that, at the appropriate time, members of the opposition wish to make appropriate comments on this matter—hopefully, this afternoon. In the meantime, we associate ourselves with the comments of the member for Reid.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I did allow indulgence in the MPI and I will now return to the MPI. I call the member for Scullin.

Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (15:56):  I start by echoing the very eloquent and moving contribution of the member for Reid and take this opportunity to extend my condolences to the family and friends of Phil Hughes. Member for Reid, I thought it was important that you acknowledged the terrible circumstances that Sean Abbott must also be facing at this time. If he and those close to him can understand that in this place we are thinking of him, I think that is a useful contribution we can all make. I am a cricket follower and have had the pleasure also of watching Phil Hughes play. Regardless of his status as a sportsman, I think the thing we should all be reflecting on is the tragedy of a young life full of promise, full of aspirations—aspirations that are very public, having regard to the nature of his calling and his talents—very tragically cut short. I am sure, as you have noted, Deputy Speaker, and the member for Throsby as well, that there will be an opportunity for us to appropriately recognise the tragic events that the member for Reid has brought before us today.


Having said that, we are here to debate a matter of public importance, and it is a matter of genuine public importance. I would like to raise one critical question that I believe underpins the matter before this House: can it be said that the grown-ups are in charge of Australia's government today? Today we had an extraordinary question time, which followed what has been an extraordinary week in Australian politics. What I think this week shows us about 14 months into the life of this government, what it emphasises, is that after hubris must come nemesis. Pride always comes before a fall. 


When I think of members opposite talking about the age of entitlement, I think really of the behaviour of members opposite, in particular the now Treasurer when he made his infamous speech in London on this topic, their entitlement to rule. While it has been said often that this is a government that said one thing before the election and another after, I think the failings of this government are much, much worse than that—for all their arrogance, their sense of entitlement, this born-to-rule attitude, seems to exist only in the hearts and perhaps in the mirrors of government ministers. The record now speaks for itself. We have before us a litany of failure, as highlighted most effectively in the health portfolio this week—I was going to say by my friend the member for Ballarat but really it has been done by the full range of government ministers and members, from the Prime Minister down. We have seen the chaos and confusion extend to broken promises and misunderstandings between the Prime Minister and senior ministers over the status of decision making in relation to the national broadcaster. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about a mood of disappointment in the community, but in this I fear he was being very generous.


I asked whether the grown-ups are in charge. The evidence this week is pretty clear, but I will add to that. Being grown-up should mean being able to admit to mistakes and being able to say sorry. Clearly, members opposite have had plenty of practice and plenty of opportunities to learn this lesson. Sadly, practice has not made perfect.


I want to touch very briefly on the two additional matters beyond incompetence that this matter of public importance puts before the House—firstly, broken promises. It is extraordinary how this government has sought to rewrite the history of its commitments to the Australian people prior to the election. I do not want to touch on the specific commitments, all of which I think have been broken, but I do want to speak on the biggest broken promise of all, which is the now Prime Minister's insistence that he would restore trust in politics. He spoke at great length on this. By the standards of this week, we might call these 'rhetorical flourishes'. Since then we have seen the eroding of trust every day, the eroding of faith in politics. This is a government that has become mean and tricky very early. This is compounded by the contempt it shows not just for the Labor Party but for this parliament and, through it, for the Australian people.


But the biggest failing of all is the poverty of this government's vision, shown on the world stage at the G20, where the Prime Minister chose to whinge about the attitudes of the Australian people rather than be a constructive middle power and global actor. In this government they are indeed rebels without a cause, defining themselves by what they are against, which is the modern Australian social compact.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (16:01):  I, too, would like to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Reid and the member for Scullion on the passing of Phillip Hughes. It is a very sad day for Australia.


But I am glad that the opposition has put forward this matter of public importance today, because it gives me the opportunity not only to refute it but also to place on record the coalition government's achievements since we came to office just over a year ago. Several excellent members on this side of the House have already outlined during this debate that we are not only committed to but are already delivering on many of our election commitments, and we are demonstrating great leadership as a government, led by a great Prime Minister, Tony Abbott—great leadership of this country that Labor never showed.


Great leadership impacts the everyday lives of Australian people and businesses, particularly people in my electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, the best region of the best country in the world in which to live. These same people were so sick of the complete failure of the Labor Party during their six years in government that they voted them out. I am sure that members opposite love to keep saying that only Labor offers people a grand vision—a grand vision like returning the budget to surplus, except of course they did not; or whacking the world's biggest carbon tax onto families and businesses; or opening Australia's borders to more than 50,000 illegal boat arrivals. I could go on and on about this, but of course history speaks for itself. We know that the people of the Central Coast in Robertson and Dobell, and indeed right around Australia, rejected Labor and its incompetence, its broken promises and its complete and utter failure to provide real leadership and real vision for our nation.


Instead, people voted for positive change. While Labor talk about their vision and their leadership, the coalition government, led by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, is getting on with the job of actually doing it. We have scrapped the carbon tax and delivered Australian families and businesses the biggest drop in electricity prices on record. Overall, households on the Central Coast are forecast to be $550 a year better off now that the carbon tax has been repealed. We are creating around 8,700 jobs per year due to the construction of the M1-M2 missing link, which will start next year. It is a vital piece of road infrastructure that will save the average commuter in Robertson 30 minutes a day travel time to the Sydney CBD. This is a commitment that was talked about for years by Labor, but which we are already delivering.


Unlike those opposite we believe in the future of the Central Coast as a region of excellence and opportunity and we are investing in this belief with a purpose-built building for the ATO and other Commonwealth agencies, with 600 new jobs right in the heart of Gosford. It is a real game-changer for our region, and a key election commitment that we are delivering on. But all we have heard from Labor so far is a refusal to back these 600 jobs for Gosford, and constant criticism of the Central Coast. In contrast, our policies, our leadership and our commitments are backed by our community. In fact, just yesterday, TheDaily Telegraph called our commitment a 'wave of jobs for the Coast'. The coalition make no apologies for our determination to methodically deliver what we committed to in our growth plan for the Central Coast, which was more jobs, better infrastructure and a stronger future for our region.


But perhaps members opposite are thinking, 'What about the NBN? What about a vision for a connected Central Coast?' In my view, actions speak far louder than words. While I know the former member for Robertson loudly trumpeted to all and sundry that only Labor could deliver the NBN for the Central Coast, the facts, quite sadly, tell a different story. After six long years of talking about and promising the NBN, how many households and businesses on the Central Coast did they connect to the network? Was it 10,000, you ask? Was it 5,000? Was it 500? No, sadly, the fact is that, despite Labor's fanfare, all the people of the Central Coast got after six long years was 203 premises connected to the NBN. But I am pleased to say that since then we have been working to get the NBN to homes and business that need it the most. And, again, we are delivering. We are now rolling it out to more than 50,000 premises across the Central Coast in my electorate using the right mix of technologies to get the NBN delivered sooner, more cheaply to taxpayers and more affordably to consumers.


I conclude this contribution by reflecting on a very important principle—that it is our job as elected representatives to represent the hopes, concerns and aspirations of the people who live in our communities, and it is the government's role to create the best possible environment for them to succeed. Thanks to the Abbott government, we are doing just that. After six long years, finally the people of the Central Coast are seeing a government deliver on what is most important, and what they so richly deserve.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:06):  There are moments in this House when all of us are called to order in the things we are talking about and in the way we are behaving. We get to have a moment when we remember what is really important and what matters to us and to the Australian people. This is one of those moments. I want to associate myself with the comments of the member for Reid in expressing my condolences to the family of Phil Hughes and to Sean Abbott.


I do not pretend to know a lot about cricket—it is not something in my past—so I will not be speaking at length about his performance as a batsman. But I would say that it is a tragedy for any family to lose a young man of 25, in the prime of his life and with a future ahead of him—none of us will never know now what he would have achieved. I feel so bad for his family, for his parents. It is a tragedy for anyone to lose a young man like that. I am very sorry that this has occurred.


For those who do not know, an MPI is often a bit of a rambunctious occasion for the House to trade a few jibes across the chamber. Obviously that is not appropriate today and we will not conduct the rest of the debate in that way. I will just say that I think that the preference of both sides of the House would probably be that this debate not continue, but it has to continue—that is the request of the House. In that vein, I will make a few comments about some of the things that have happened this week in politics, as insignificant as they now seem to those around Australia who are mourning that loss.


It is my belief that this past week has been a little bit of a tipping point in Australia. For a year now, the Australian community has been trying to make up its mind about this Prime Minister and what it is that this man is made of. There are two incidents in the past week that I would point to that I think have been quite decisive in Australians making up their mind. The first was the announcement about making cuts to the ABC and SBS. I believe the ABC and SBS provide essential services. Representing a community that is as multicultural as mine is, I see SBS on television screens very frequently right across my electorate, and we know the important role the ABC plays in protecting Australians against natural disasters and in representing rural and regional communities. There are many Australians who are not SBS and ABC viewers—I accept that—but the really important issue is that this went right to the heart of the question of trust. Many Australians will have watched the 15 seconds of footage of Tony Abbott on the night before the election making a series of promises that there would be no cuts to education, no changes to health, no changes to the pension, no changes to the GST and, of course, no cuts to SBS or the ABC. This week we went through to the last of those. Every single one of those promises has been broken. I really think that this was the straw that broke the camel's back, as it were, for the Australian community.


I also want to make mention of the G20. What a missed opportunity it was. This was Australia's big chance, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to have global leaders come to our beautiful country and hear our big ideas for the future of the globe and our nation. What Prime Minister could not make this into a huge win for the country? Instead, we saw someone who thought it appropriate to raise political issues that were so domestic and so small-minded in nature when he had the eyes and ears of these global leaders who are so important to driving Australia's future. We saw the Prime Minister and other leaders of the government desperately trying to take climate change away from the agenda, yet because climate change is so important and so crucial to Australia's future and to the world's future it was right there in the centre of the agenda. Instead of Australia being part of that conversation and helping to shape and drive it we were left out in the cold. We had Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, bragging about the great leap backwards on climate change while two of the biggest economies in the world made a profoundly important deal on cutting carbon emissions. I contrast him with US President Barack Obama, who has, probably, similar polling problems as the Prime Minister, but that guy has got some guts, he has some energy, he has some leadership. He was willing to stand out there in front of Australians, saying what the Prime Minister should have been saying—that is, that we need to have some vision and leadership on these important issues. I conclude my comments there.

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2014-11-27,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (16:11):  I would like to associate myself with the words of the member for Reid. My sincere prayers and condolences go to the family of Phillip Hughes. They are very interesting words to put in an MPI: 'failure to provide leadership'. I remind those on the other side of the chamber of something about leadership. John Curtin once campaigned on the most controversial issue in the Australian parliament, conscription, and went to the parliament saying he would be vehemently against conscription. When he became Prime Minister, John Curtin—arguably Australia's greatest Prime Minister—introduced conscription, because the person who represented the seat I now occupy crossed the floor to the Labor Party. That is how history defines leadership: someone who did something that was contrary to what they believed but knew they had to do it for the benefit of the country.


We took government thinking that we had an $18 billion deficit in our operating budget. It turned into a $30 billion deficit. Then, when the figures came in, it worked out at $48 billion. We hear a lot about cuts to the ABC. We hear indignation about trying to find $50 million of savings out of our public broadcaster. The irony of it all is that $50 million will only pay the interest on our national debt for 33 hours. Think about that for a moment. The challenge we have is to get our economy back on track. A strong economy affords us the opportunity to build a great society. What separates the people who have a Conservative understanding, and an understanding of business, from those who do not is that we know that money does not grow on trees. We have to pay for it. We have to have a strong economy so that we can grow, develop and deliver things we want. A great society is one that has a good defence system. A great society is one that provides for those who are unwell. A great society is one that provides education for our children. A great society is one that believes in, looks after and honours individual achievement, individual freedoms and individual endeavour. We want to build that great society, but we know that we can only do that if we have a strong economy.


Those opposite claim there has been a 'failure to provide leadership'. When I look at what the Prime Minister of this country, Tony Abbott, inherited compared to what Prime Minister Kevin Rudd inherited, I would argue that he has provided leadership. Sometimes it has been on things that I as a backbencher have not always approved of. Sometimes it has been on things that I know are unpleasant for the Australian people. But has he provided leadership? There is no doubt about that. Leadership is about taking the people with you on a journey through something that is difficult. Leadership is about facing the challenges and saying, 'We can do this together.' Leadership is not whingeing and moaning. Leadership is not shirking your responsibilities. Leadership is making hard choices.


I remind those in the Labor Party that their greatest Prime Minister had to go against everything he originally stood for to provide leadership at the time of Australia's greatest crisis. We are not in a war, but we are in an amazingly difficult financial situation. It is a situation we have never found ourselves in before, with a national debt we have never seen so big. It is the leadership of Prime Minister Tony Abbott that is going to lead us through that. I think it would be very fair to say that we have adults in the room, adults who know that strong leadership is about making hard choices, not just making populist choices.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (16:16):  on indulgence—Labor is shocked and saddened, as I am sure members of the House and the Australian community are, by the tragic news of the death of Phillip Joel Hughes today. The circumstances around Phillip's injury and death have deeply touched not just the Australian community but also the international community. The outpouring of expressions of support and grief for Phillip Hughes and his family has touched all of us. The great character of Phillip and the friendships he enjoyed have  been well recognised, as has been the respect for him from his fellow cricket players, particularly through the support Phillip received from his South Australian teammates and the broader cricket community from around the world. I want to express the Labor Party's deepest sorrow. I am sure that in the coming days the parliament will fully express its condolences also. His death is a great loss for Australia and cricket and an even greater loss for his family. Our thoughts are with them.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:29):  After 18 months on kidney medication, Patrick's teeth had been all but destroyed. He was 39 years old, and he:


… grew a five-inch beard to hide his mangled mouth; his four children were embarrassed about the way he looked.


Patrick was ultimately the beneficiary of a dental program put in place by a Salvation Army worker by the name of Liz Dawson. Liz saw Patrick not as somebody to be feared but as somebody to be helped. That is the way she was: helping Canberrans wherever she could. In another of her projects, she enlisted the help of her own hairdresser, Angelo Cataldo, to provide free haircuts to those who could not afford them in order to make a difference to their self-esteem. One of the hairdressers, Sheldon Brown, said:


You forget how important [it is] and how much your hair and your appearance affects how you feel as a person and gives you the confidence to overcome challenges.


When she was made a state finalist for the ACT for Australia's Local Hero in 2012, Liz Dawson's citation mentioned her work as a speech therapist, a teacher, a public servant and a counsellor; her work on providing dental treatment to clients on pension cards; her work with free haircuts; and, critically, her work in bringing the Common Ground project to Canberra.


Liz never stopped. She was an inspiration to so many of us. In trying to bring Common Ground to Canberra, she once stood outside Old Parliament House knowing that then housing minister Brendan O'Connor would be arriving to speak at a breakfast. It was one of those sub-zero Canberra mornings, with everyone else huddled inside, but Liz, cancer already advancing, stood outside in the freezing cold with her cane—which she called Emily—until she had a chance to speak with Brendan and make the case to him for a Common Ground in the ACT. She did so too with Prime Minister Julia Gillard, and ultimately the funding was provided, and Common Ground Canberra will open next year.


Liz asked people for things and, because of who she was, she delivered. In fact, at her funeral, one of the eulogies noted a comment by Liz: 'The great thing about having terminal cancer is no-one ever says no to you.' She tasked my landscape architect wife, Gweneth, with getting a bit of advice on the gardens around Common Ground, and she formed a choir by asking every musically inclined person she knew to join her. She wrote a book called Where is My Left Eyebrow?, talking about her battle with cancer and her loss of 96 per cent of her sight. She wanted to tell her story and speak to others.


Liz was always engaged in politics. As a life member of the Labor Party, she was constantly asking questions. Even when I went to visit her in Clare Holland House just a few weeks ago, she was interested in what was happening in this place. Liz was just a firecracker for change. She was constantly working to make Australia and Canberra better. She fought for smaller class sizes here in the ACT, she fought for opportunities for the most vulnerable and she epitomised what Franklin Delano Roosevelt apparently used to say to progressives who would come to him in the White House and ask for change: 'Go out and make me do it.' Liz would go out and make people do it. She saw that parliamentarians were not to be feared but were to be used. Katy Gallagher, at Liz's memorial service, spoke about how Liz kept on turning up at every opportunity. Eventually Katy Gallagher realised she was not going to get away from Liz until she said yes to the social justice project Liz wanted.


Ultimately Liz's cancer took her life. It is a great loss, but she is so greatly remembered, of course, by her family: Kate, Julie, Sophie, and her extraordinary husband, Peter, who is in his own right a great Canberran and a great campaigner for change here, documenting the innovative businesses here in Canberra. Liz enriched our lives and made us better parliamentarians and individuals in Canberra. May she rest in peace.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (09:30):  I want today to take the opportunity to talk about a very important project in my electorate funded under the previous Labor government's Better Futures, Local Solutions. Unfortunately, that has been terminated by the present government, but this particular project, Expanding School Community Hubs into Secondary Schools, recently received an award from the Hume City Council. The project was initiated in May last year with 12 months seed funding under the Local Solutions Fund. I am very pleased that it was formally recognised as the winner of the Outstanding Team category for the Hume council 2014 Teachers' Scholarships. 


The scholarship awards, presented on 13 November, are a key part of the Hume council and the Hume Global Learning Village priority for lifelong learning. That comes under the banner of the Hume City Horizons 2040. Maria Axarlis Coulter, former government action leader of the fund, was a member of the judging panel who chose the winning project. Maria was able to describe the absolute joy and thrill of the principals from the Ilim Islamic College, the Penola Catholic College, and the Mt Ridley P-12 College, who were very grateful to receive the $4,000 prize money. This money, together with dedicated internal resources, will sustain the secondary hubs initiative and allow it to continue to focus on improving student's education, retention and attainment.


This award was the first of its kind—a cross-sector initiative—and was noted as making a difference to the students and the broader community. The award money will contribute to the planning for the inaugural 2015 interschools student leadership forum. The schools award reinforces the importance of place based funding to support the harnessing of local expertise and energy for better futures for local students, particularly those who are vulnerable, such as many of the students in my electorate. 


The expanding school hubs program will be featured along with other local, national and international projects as part of the major Hume conference on education, which is due to take place in my electorate in early June next year. 


Last week I also had the great privilege of welcoming the Labor shadow minister for foreign affairs, Hon. Tanya Plibersek, to my electorate to attend a very big luncheon that was organised with women in my electorate. The theme of the luncheon was the notion of women coming together to get to know each other and to help in developing a more cohesive and peaceful community.

"Hutchinson, Eric, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (10:01):  It is a pleasure and an honour to be able to speak on the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014, which is probably not the most auspicious piece of legislation that I will have an opportunity to debate; nevertheless, remembering the sacrifice that so many over so many years have made for our country in the field of war, in the role of peacekeepers, in support roles and in active service is something that every Australian and future generations would do well to contemplate from time to time.


The Australian War Memorial is truly an icon in Australia. My family, my brother and his wife and daughters recently visited Canberra and as a family we went to see the War Memorial. Whilst it was a venue to enjoy a lunch, for me it was quite intriguing to watch the reaction of my young boys in particular to the amazing collection they have at the War Memorial. It was interesting to see the vividness of the display at the back of the War Memorial—the lights, the activity and the interactive display they have there—and observe the impact it has on young people. We are often critical of young people about living in a different world and about the way they engage with the community and with others. They move through life perhaps at a faster pace that you and I might have. For me it was truly eye-opening to see the way they were absolutely captivated by the images and the stories they were seeing.


Another recollection I have of that day was the absolutely broken wreck of an aircraft that forms part of a display in the War Memorial. Indeed, it compels you to contemplate the time and the place and how that came to be. It was special. I think it is something that every Australian should do. They should take the time. We did not give it enough time, but we will make sure that we have an opportunity at some point in the future to revisit that amazing memorial to people who served, many of whom gave their lives for the sake of this country.


The bill itself is about ensuring that there will never be the ability to charge parking fees at the War Memorial. It may not seem the most significant thing. Nevertheless, based on the observations, if nothing else, that I have made of the impact that the memorial had on my young boys, it is a special place in Australia. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the country, and for every Australian, when they come to Canberra, there should be no barriers to them visiting the War Memorial, because it is a special place and a place for reflection.


Getting back closer to home, no doubt it is true right around Australia, but, within my electorate of Lyons, which covers over 50 per cent of the south island—the island state of our great nation—there are many communities. There are literally hundreds of small communities. Without thinking too hard, I did start making a list last night of all the little towns around my electorate that I am aware of that have memorials to the Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War or the Vietnam War, as well as peacekeepers' memorials or memorials to Afghanistan or other conflicts. Truly, they have been focal points for those communities. I hesitated to complete the list because I was sure that I would miss some communities, but one town that springs to mind, a very, very small community, is Avoca in the Fingal Valley. I had the privilege of speaking at the 11 o'clock Anzac Day service at Avoca last year. Indeed, the work that they have done has been successful in attracting a little funding out of the Centenary of Anzac commemoration memorial fund. That has given them an opportunity to do some work that was overdue in upgrading their memorial.


Further south, in the beautiful Derwent Valley, up towards the Florentine and those iconic 'working forests', as they are—or were, at least—within my electorate, there is the town of Fentonbury. Those who take the road up the Derwent Valley through New Norfolk, past Bushy Park and Glenora, end up at Westerway. If you turn off there to go towards Ellendale, you pass the small town of Fentonbury. On the right-hand side as you head towards Ellendale, there is a memorial. It is in a privately owned paddock. This memorial somewhat resembles the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Every time I drive past it, I stop and I ponder. I have had conversations with the local mayor because I would love to see a way of working with the private landowner and, if it were deemed appropriate by the local community, perhaps consideration of moving that memorial to a place where it could once again be a focal point for that community—because we should always remember and reflect on and take the time at appropriate moments during the year to contemplate those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.


This debate gives me an opportunity also to reflect on the Centenary of Anzac program. It is a really valuable program right across the 150 electorates around the country. My observation might be that in an electorate such as Lyons, where every 10 kilometres down the road I have got another little town that has got another little memorial, the capacity to make $125,000 go further is probably more challenging than it may be in a smaller inner-city electorate. Nevertheless, it has been a really valuable process. I acknowledge the instigation of the same by the previous government and the work that Minister Ronaldson has done subsequently, adding $25,000 to those grants that were available to every electorate around the country.


The process that we went through was one of consultation. We had a committee and the committee was chaired by a former Professor of History at the University of Tasmania, retired, Michael Roe, and representatives from around the north and south of my electorate with people who have a connection either through the Returned Services League or their participation in the armed forces. It was a really constructive process on which they embarked. I have had a number of highlights. We are about halfway through the announcements that we are expecting. Understandably, they are being scrutinised properly by the department, as should be the case when public money is being used. So far we have had some announcements. For example, a little over $1,000 was approved for the very small community at Liffey that had small plaques disappear from trees that were planted in 1918. That money will go to re-establishing those plaques and in some cases replacing those trees. It is a small thing for a small community.


I had the privilege a couple of weekends ago of going to the small town of Woodsdale in the Southern Midlands in my electorate for the opening of another very small Centenary of Anzac program that they announced. It was $1,200 for a plaque to remember those people from that community who had gone away and served their country in the First World War. One of the things about my electorate is that the same names from different parts of the community keep coming up. No doubt previous members for this electorate—there have only been a few since the Second World War in this seat—when they heard the name 'Wilson' knew they were from somewhere between Parattah and Woodsdale and would start in the Southern Midlands. When you hear the name 'Dare', almost certainly they will be from Woodsdale in the Southern Midlands. It was a special occasion. I think there would have been close to 100 people who came to the opening of the park and the little memorial garden that has been established in that very, very small community there.


In the time I have left to speak, I would also comment on the wonderful work that has been done at Sheffield, 'the town of murals', which some would know. I would encourage anyone who is visiting my beautiful state to take the time to visit Sheffield. It truly is a wonderful thing. The RSL there have just completed a stunning memorial mural and garden. It is almost, if you like, designed to be a three-dimensional image. As you drive in from the eastern side of Sheffield into the town it is in a very prominent place and I think in time it will become in and of itself a reason for people to make the journey to Sheffield. It is a wonderful commemoration of not only people who served in the First World War in this instance but also the people who have served in many theatres of war since that time.


Whilst this is not the most auspicious piece of legislation, the War Memorial is nevertheless absolutely one of Australia's must-visit memorials. The Australian War Memorial in Canberra truly is a national treasure. It is a small measure that this bill enacts to make sure that those visiting are given as easy access as possible by making sure that there can never be parking or entry fees imposed on the War Memorial. It is also making sure that the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 continues to meet the current needs of the memorial and, most importantly, of the community that it is there to help reflect on those that have given their lives.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:15):  It gives me great pleasure to participate in the debate on the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014 and to use this opportunity to speak about the Australian War Memorial, which is arguably Australia's most important national cultural institution—although it is not just an institution; it is a monument and a memorial to Australians who have sacrificed their lives in war.


It is worthwhile, I think, to reflect for a moment at least on the origins of this great place. It arose, really, out of the work of Charles Bean. He, of course, was an official war correspondent for the First World War, and so he visited not only Gallipoli but also the Western Front. After he had been to Gallipoli and seen the horrors of Gallipoli, he witnessed Australia's first big battles on the Western Front, at Fromelles and Pozieres, in July 1916. Bean made some graphic observations about those events. It is worth reminding ourselves, I think, that on 19 July 1916, at the Battle of Fromelles, 5½ thousand Australians were either killed, captured or wounded. Around 1,800 were killed in that one period. It is Australia's highest loss in battle over a short time. In commenting on Pozieres, which followed Fromelles, Bean made these observations:


One knew that the Brigades which went in last night were there today in that insatiable factory of ghastly wounds. The men were simply turned in there as into some ghastly giant mincing machine. They have to stay there while shell after huge shell descends with a shriek close beside them—each one an acute mental torture—each shrieking tearing crash bringing a promise to each man—instantaneous—I will tear you into ghastly wounds—I will rend your flesh and pulp an arm or a leg –fling you half a gaping quivering man (like these that you see smashed around you one by one) to lie there rotting and blackening like all the things you saw by the awful roadside, or in that sickening dusty crater. Ten or twenty times a minute every man in the trench has that instant fear thrust tight upon his shoulders—I don't care how brave he is—with a crash that is a physical pain and a strain to withstand.


Then a month later, as the Bills Digest informs us, the idea of a memorial museum for Australia was born, as Bean's confidant AW Bazley later recalled. He said:


I remember in August 1916 when after his busy days tramping the Pozieres battlefield and visiting units in the line he would roll out his blankets on the chalk firestep of the old British front line … on the edge of Becourt Wood and Sausage Gully. We used to sleep feet to head—C.E.W.B., Padre Dexter, myself, and others—and although I cannot recall the actual conversations today I do remember that on a number of occasions he talked about what he had in his mind concerning some future Australian war memorial museum.


So the founding fathers of this museum, this great monument, became Charles Bean, our official First World War historian, and John Treloar, who became the director of the memorial between 1920 and 1952. But it was not until 1941 that we finally saw the opening of the basic buildings for this great place. In 1918, Bean conceived how the memorial would appear. He said:


… on some hill-top—still, beautiful, gleaming white and silent, a building of three parts, a centre and two wings. The centre will hold the great national relics of the A.I.F. one wing will be a gallery—holding the pictures that our artists painted and drew actually on the scene and amongst the events themselves. The other wing will be a library to contain the written official records of every unit.


Of course, subsequently, it became a memorial not only to the First World War but to subsequent conflicts—the Second World War, Korea and beyond. As a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel I have visited war museums across the world and I have to say that the Australian War Memorial is unique among them. I know the Australians who visit this wonderful place understand the gravitas that hits you once you are there. But it is really very important that we understand its significance both nationally and internationally.


At the beginning, Bean had hoped that the memorial would incorporate a roll of honour, which it does, listing the Australian dead of the war. Now that list is 102,000 men and women. As a result of changes which were made by the War Memorial Council last year, under the leadership of Ken Doolan as chair and as Dr Brendan Nelson as director, dead peacekeepers have been added to the Roll of Honour, which is as it should be. 


The really significant thing, in my view, in those periods post-1941 in terms of the development of the War Memorial is the Hall of Memory, which was completed in 1959. It is inspiring. We recall well Remembrance Day of 1993 when then Prime Minister Paul Keating spoke, as the remains of a soldier killed in the battlefields of the Western Front, name unknown, were placed in a marble covered tomb in the Hall of Memory. At that time, Paul Keating said: 


We do not know this Australian's name, we never will … He is one of them, and he is all of us. 


That says what it is. When you comprehend those 102,000 names and then all of those missing in action, names unknown, burial places unknown, it really is a really, really significant thing. That Hall of Memory and the Roll of Honour is a repository for our soul. We as a nation are all the better for it. 


There are some who would have argued in the past that somehow or other the War Memorial is a glorification of war, which of course it is not. It tells a story of war. It tells a story of our role in past conflicts. It reminds us, if anything, of the stupidity of war—of the need for us, every day, to strive to fight for peace. That, of course, is why we have such great confidence in the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, because that is their role. When we think about this War Memorial and see it as the monument that it is and recognise its role for us, for all Australians, in telling our national story, then we are all enhanced by that knowledge.


There have been significant developments at the War Memorial over the years. I mentioned some. But as the Centenary of Anzac comes upon us, a number of things have happened, one of which I was happily involved in as the former minister responsible for the War Memorial: the former Labor government made available $28.7 million to fund the redevelopment of the First World War galleries within the War Memorial, with $3.82 million from the War Memorial's own financial resources and $1 million from BHP Billiton. Last night members of this parliament had the opportunity to preview those galleries. I was fortunate enough to get a tour around those yet unfinished galleries, as they were last week, and I have to say they enhance the visit to the War Memorial greatly. I want to publicly thank and acknowledge the work of all those involved in these new galleries. I am sure most if not every member of parliament will have been there and will know the dioramas that exist there. Now there is a chronology so, when you walk into those First World War galleries, you start at the beginning of the war and work your way through. It is a fine monument and tells a really significant story, this story of Australians at war in the First World War on the Western Front and elsewhere. I say to those people who have not had the opportunity to visit: please do so. You will walk away with a great sense of pride in what has been achieved. 


It has not been achieved without leadership. That leadership has been provided by the War Memorial Council. The current members of that council are Rear Admiral Ken Doolan, who of course is the national president of the RSL; Air Chief Marshal Geoff Brown AO, who is the Chief of Air Force; the Hon. Graham Edwards AM, a former member of this fine parliament, a veteran himself and president of the Western Australian branch of the RSL; Mr Peter FitzSimons AM; Vice Admiral Tim Barrett AO CSC, the Chief of Navy; Dr Allan Hawke; Lieutenant-General David Morrison AO, the Chief of Army; Major General Paul Stevens AO (retired); Ms Gabrielle Trainor; Mr Les Carlyon; Ms Jillian Segal; and Mr Kerry Stokes.


Mr Stokes has been a wonderful contributor to Australia's war history. He has been a benefactor of the War Memorial and a benefactor of keeping these memories of Australians at war alive. His purchase of the pictures of Vignacourt, which record Australians away at the front during the First World War and are now on show at the gallery at the War Memorial, is a tribute to his philanthropy but also, most importantly, to his dedication to keeping these memories alive.


I want to also talk about Dr Brendan Nelson, who of course is the Director of the Australian War Memorial. I was in the fortunate position of being involved in his appointment, and I have to say what a wonderful appointment it has been. To his predecessor, Steve Gower, who spent many years as the director of the War Memorial, I want to say thank you for your contribution, Steve. I have not had the opportunity to publicly say this, but you made a wonderful contribution.


To Brendan and his staff, should they be listening, I say thank you for your leadership, Brendan, but, most importantly, I thank those people you have around you, who make the place work and who provide you with advice and insights: the historians, who do such wonderful work, the curators, the guides, the cleaners and the people who look after the landscape around the War Memorial—all of those involved. I say thank you on behalf of a grateful nation for keeping in a proper way this national icon, this national monument, this national museum.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (10:30):  I rise to speak to the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014, which will deliver our government's 2013 election commitment to amend the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 to prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the Australian War Memorial premises in Campbell in the Australian Capital Territory. At the 2013 election, the government committed to legislate to prohibit the levying of entry and parking fees at the Australian War Memorial. If we go back to 2010, it was revealed that the memorial's council was being forced to consider charging entry and parking fees, as well as to consider closing one day a week, under some pressure because of the previous government's failure to properly resource the Australian War Memorial. As a result, in February 2011 the coalition announced that, if elected, it would legislate to prevent the levying of parking and entry fees at the memorial. This is an incredibly important commitment—another important commitment that we are delivering on.


As we heard from the member for Lingiari in his contribution, the memorial must be a place for all Australians to visit free of charge, not only to pay their respects to the fallen but to learn the important story of Australia, and of Australians, at war. If we are to pass on to future generations the story of the Anzacs who served at Gallipoli and in other campaigns over a century of service, then we must ensure that these stories can be told and commemorated at no charge. This is particularly important for the hundreds and hundreds of schools which visit the memorial as part of school trips to Canberra each year. We must do all we can to ensure the Australian War Memorial's invaluable collection is not only protected for the future but able to be enjoyed by all visitors to the memorial at no cost.


As we heard in the fine contribution by the member for Lingiari, the Australian War Memorial is the nation's home of commemoration, reflection and remembrance. It is unique as both a memorial and a museum. Its cloisters contain the names of 102,000 Australians who have been killed in action as a result of service in war in the Australian Defence Force. The museum contains a world-class trove of memorabilia collected by soldiers, sailors and air men and women and left in perpetuity to the people of Australia as a reminder of the story of Australians at war. The galleries feature Australia's military engagements from Australia's colonial engagements in Africa in the 19th century through to recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and various peacekeeping operations. As we heard from the member for Lingiari, in February next year a $30 million redevelopment of the First World War galleries will open. This is the first major redevelopment of these galleries in 30 years. The much-loved dioramas depicting Australians at war at Gallipoli, on the Western Front and in Palestine have been upgraded, and this will be an even greater reason to visit the memorial from early next year.


Every year close to one million people visit the Australian War Memorial, including almost 200,000 school students. Of course, around the country Anzac Day services are becoming more and more popular. More and more people are attending Anzac Day services to reflect, to commemorate and to remember. This includes the national ceremony and the national remembrance day at the Australian War Memorial, which in 2014 had unprecedented numbers of people attending.


In fact, in June 2014 the Australian War Memorial was listed by TripAdvisor as the No. 1 tourist destination in Australia. It was also the only Australian institution listed in the world top 20, ranked 17. At this point I also want to concur with the recognition by the member for Lingiari of Kerry Stokes for his incredible contribution to the War Memorial and of the wonderful leadership of Dr Brendan Nelson, who is doing an absolutely outstanding job at this very important time in our nation's history. Of course the Centenary of Anzac next year will be the most significant period of commemoration, I think it is fair to say, in our nation's history. The date of 25 April 2015 will mark 100 years since that first fateful landing at Gallipoli. This will be a very important and special time for every Australian, young and old.


Some 15 years ago I visited Gallipoli—not for Anzac Day; at another time of the year—but even standing on those beaches and looking up in awe at the cliffs was incredible. I do not think there was a person who stood with us at that time who did not have tears in their eyes. It is a place so many Australians visit, and it is incredible to see that the story of the Anzacs continues to resonate so much as it does today.


Through my electorate of Corangamite winds the world's largest war memorial: the Great Ocean Road. As I said in my first speech, this is a journey made possible by the sweat and toil of returned soldiers of the Great War who built this iconic road between 1919 and 1932. But I think that at this time it is also very important not to forget that we must pay tribute over the next few years to the service of all men and women of the Australian Defence Forces who have served our country over the past hundred years. The date of 18 August 2016 marks another very significant day: the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, Vietnam Veterans Day. This will be a very important opportunity to pay tribute to the service of Vietnam vets, a contingent of men and women who were not properly recognised, many of whom were condemned and ostracised and who paid the price for many years. In fact, one of my staff members, Kerry Ridgeway, is a Vietnam vet. We went along to a Remembrance Day service just a few weeks ago, and he came along with me and wore his medals with pride. It was absolutely wonderful to see.


The government is rolling out a very important program commenced by the previous government. The Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program is all about recognising the incredible commitment the communities throughout my electorate and, of course, around the nation are making to commemorating the Centenary of Anzac, and $125,000 has been made available to each federal electorate to help fund various commemorative programs. I particularly want to commend and pay tribute to Senator Hon. Michael Ronaldson, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who increased the amount in each electorate by some $25,000. I must say he is doing an incredible job representing our government at this very important time.


I thought I would talk about a couple of the projects which have already been announced. Bannockburn Primary School has been awarded some $3,000, and that will help to enhance their remembrance garden. It is wonderful. I went along when we announced the grant with the children of Bannockburn Primary School. It is actually a school I am a great supporter of. It is wonderful to see that a new primary school is being delivered by the Victorian government. I am fighting very hard to make sure they get their secondary school too, but it is really fantastic to see that school's dedication to commemorating the Centenary of Anzac through a really wonderful project.


Another project we have announced is in Apollo Bay. Some $2,000 has gone to Apollo Bay Arts Incorporated for a literature reading event which has already been held, called Warm Winter Words. Again it commemorates 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War by exploring the Anzac Centenary and its connections with Indigenous Australians. At that event the guest speakers included Professor Mick Dodson, Bruce Elder and Bruce Pascoe. It was wonderful to be able to recognise and support that important event.


Just a couple of weeks ago I went along to Belmont Fire Brigade. Belmont Fire Brigade have received some $3,200 to support a project paying tribute to nine members of the brigade who fought in World War I. It was absolutely wonderful. There were, of course, both volunteers there and full-time firefighters. How much focus and how much pride they had in celebrating the achievements of previous members of the brigade who had so proudly represented them in the First World War. It was really a very special time for me, I have to say.


There are many other wonderful applications that have been made and they will be rolled out over the next few months. I thought I would just mention some of the great projects that are before us at the moment. The Ceres community organisation is looking to restore its First World War memorial gates. Belmont Primary School has applied for funding to build a special commemorative area and to install a new flagpole. The Colac RSL sub-branch is hoping to restore its war memorial site at Cressy Recreation Reserve, including a new flagpole. The money will greatly assist with upgrades to the site, including recording the details of soldiers from both world wars.


The Torquay RSL has been working incredibly hard—another great project—to construct a memorial garden at the Torquay Bowls Club. Recently that has been upgraded. It was a great job, I have to say, by the member for South Barwon in delivering a commitment to see a major upgrade of the Torquay Bowls Club, which is now home to the Torquay RSL. So that is a wonderful project.


In another fantastic project, the Military Historical Society of Geelong does incredible military re-enactments and they are looking to do a very large scale event next year. Christian College is also looking to invest in a remembrance garden. Then there is the Torquay and District Historical Society, and I want to say something about the Torquay Anzac Day service. It is an incredible service. Some 15,000 people gather at Point Danger on the cliffs at Torquay. The Torquay community and RSL do an incredible job holding a very moving service, as do so many of the other RSLs across Corangamite. They are looking to install a new plaque to commemorate local World War I diggers at Point Danger.


There are other projects by the Lorne RSL. Surf Coast Shire are looking to create a Winchelsea walk, and this particular walk is very significant. It will honour 64 Victoria Cross recipients from World War I. The first recipient was, of course, Albert Jacka, who was born in Winchelsea. That too is a wonderful project and there are some other fantastic projects from the Golden Plains Shire and the Burough of Queenscliffe. The light and sound production service there needs some assistance.


This is just an array of the projects that we are hoping to fund as part of our local commemorative grants program. In relation to Queenscliffe, I want to recognise a commitment from the Liberal candidate for Bellarine, Ron Nelson, who just yesterday announced a new visitors hub and cafe and other facilities at the Ocean View car park, where the Anzac Day service is held. That will provide power and really provide a lot more facilities for that very important service overlooking the back beach of Queenscliffe and overlooking the rip—a very important part of Queenscliffe's history. So that was a great commitment, part of a $3.6 million commitment for the Queenscliffe community made yesterday, as I say, by Ron Nelson.


At this time I want to take the opportunity to thank the members of the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program electorate committee for Corangamite: Graham Rawlins, Councillor Bob Merriman and Keith Hankin. The committee has worked with me to assess these applications. They have done a wonderful job. It is very much appreciated. They have applied great due diligence and I really do want to express my thanks for their work. And very briefly, I would like to congratulate Keith and his wife, Elaine, who have just celebrated 65 years of marriage.


The Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program recognises the importance of local commemorative events at this very special time in our nation's history. This is a very important bill as part of that. For these reasons I would like to commend the bill to the House.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (10:45):  I am very pleased to be speaking on this Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014 today. I note that previous speakers also acknowledge the remarkable role of the War Memorial, and also, quite rightly, the many commemorations around the country that have occurred and are occurring with the Centenary of Anzac. I too will be touching on many of those events in my electorate.


It is certainly the case that the War Memorial here in Canberra, in our nation's capital, commemorates the service and sacrifice of Australian service men and women who have died in the wars and conflicts in which Australia has participated. It is, indeed, a cultural institution of great international standing. It is of huge significance to Australians. The primary mission of the War Memorial is to assist Australians to remember, interpret and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact upon our society.


In reference to this bill specifically—as we have heard the previous speakers say—it amends the Australian War Memorial Act to prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the memorial premises in Campbell, where it is located. This is a very important initiative that I support.


The Australian War Memorial was officially opened on Remembrance Day, 11 November 1941, by the then Governor-General, Lord Gowrie, himself a former soldier whose honours included the Victoria Cross. As we know, the War Memorial is a magnificent institution. It has three very distinct sections. The shrine, which is a commemorative area, includes the Hall of Memory and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is an amazing premises. It is very moving when you are in there and see the whole shrine and the entire area.


It also has other galleries which consist of the museum and the research centre. We have heard some previous speakers talk about some of the wonderful upgrades to those particular areas. There is also an outdoor sculpture garden. These are very distinct areas that provide great information and wonderful areas of reflection for visitors. Indeed, this amazing military museum is widely regarded as one of the most significant memorials of its type in the world, which we should be all be very proud of. 


During times of reflection on war, the Australian War Memorial is quite rightly the nation's central focus. But it is only part of a much wider appreciation displayed right around the country for those brave men and women who served our nation. That appreciation can be seen in towns and other countries, particularly on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day. 


The Anzac Centenary is also very significant. It is a milestone of very special significance to all Australians and one that will be recognised and commemorated around the nation. It is the centenary of Australia's involvement in the First World War. The Anzac Centenary aims to encourage all Australians to reflect upon and learn more about Australia's military history and its impacts upon our nation and our communities and families. During the Anzac Centenary, we will remember not only the original Anzacs who served at Gallipoli; we will commemorate more than a century of service by Australian service men and women. The Anzac Centenary program encompasses all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australians have been involved. The program aims to give all Australians the opportunity to honour the service and sacrifice of those who served our country, including the more than 102,000 who have made the supreme sacrifice.


As we have heard previous speakers say today, it was the previous Labor government that established the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board in October 2011 to provide strategic advice and recommendations on the development of a program of commemorative activities for the Anzac Centenary.


An initiative from this was the undertaking to insist on and encourage communities right across the nation through the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program to carry out their own Anzac Centenary projects. These projects were to commemorate the service and sacrifice of Australian service men and women in the First World War. These particular grants are really a fantastic initiative. I note also from previous speakers today the very strong bipartisanship from the current government and all members in terms of this wonderful program in which we are seeing $125,000 being allocated per electorate for these very important commemorations—commemorations that will reflect each electorate's local communities and the different ways that they wish to commemorate this.


I would like to refer to some of the projects and the committee and the individuals involved in my electorate of Richmond. I had initially contacted the local RSLs asking their organisations to of course play a very vital role on the Richmond electorate committee for the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. The response was immediate and very enthusiastic. The committee, of course, once appointed, met straightaway to begin the consultation process with their communities and to develop an approach to commemorate the centenary which best represented their communities' views. 


The electorate committee of Richmond was chaired by Dr John Griffin, Secretary of the Tweed Heads and Coolangatta RSL Sub-Branch. I would like to particularly thank and acknowledge the wonderful work of Dr John not just in the Tweed Heads RSL but particularly on this committee. It was outstanding working with the RSLs and other community groups as well. Of course, many applications were received from a whole range of very diverse organisations—schools, RSL organisations, RSL care centres, theatre groups, local artists. It was fantastic to see the diversity.


The RSLs became the focal point to assist community groups with their applications and in the promotion of the program. This was also provided by local councils and schools through their newsletters and of course also by the local media. All these organisations and individuals called on to assist did so with great enthusiasm, which is a real testament to their support of what is a very worthy initiative.


I would like to mention some of the wonderful applications and projects the Richmond committee have put forward for consideration, some of which have been announced and some not announced yet. They are a great array and it really shows the diversity of projects and ideas that they have. First of all is the Byron Bay RSL Sub-Branch which, with the support of the local community, put forward their project to refurbish the existing First World War Memorial Gates and build a sheltered cenotaph for ex-service personnel, veterans and local communities to commemorate Anzac Day. There have been extremely generous offers of in-kind support and donations for the project. This demonstrates the high level of support for the project right throughout the local community.


A similar project is the upgrade of the war memorial at Cudgen Public School. Indeed, Cudgen school has a very long and proud association with the Anzac ceremonies and the local community. They have worked very closely with the Kingscliff RSL over the years with respect to this particular project. It has been wonderful to see attendance at this memorial service increase significantly over the years, so they now require a larger and, of course, more focused facility.


The Mullumbimby RSL has put together a proposal for a wonderful art exhibition which engages World War I descendants and local schoolchildren. A local ceramics artist will conduct the workshops and the artwork will be displayed locally for all of the community to enjoy. So it is a great project that will be really hands-on and involve a lot of locals.


Another wonderful initiative of the Mullumbimby community is the application made by the Drill Hall Theatre Company. The Drill Hall itself, it is interesting to note, may possibly be one of the only remaining buildings in the Richmond electorate to have been built for the training of soldiers for World War I. The Drill Hall Theatre Company is commissioning a play called The Signaller, which is about a young soldier who enlists in the Australian Light Horse just before meeting and falling in love with his young wife. The play will provide nine evening performances for the general public and four matinee performances for the elderly and also for schoolchildren. Again, it is another wonderful and very different initiative but it is great to see that happening.


The Murwillumbah RSL have undertaken to compile a Tweed roll of honour for World War I. The roll of honour will consist of those who originated from the Tweed and served with the AIF in World War I. This project will be displayed for the community to view at local service clubs, shopping malls and local shire offices. It is wonderful to have that roll of honour in such an array of different places.


I would also like to comment on the Tweed Heads and Coolangatta RSL and their proposal, which is a very worthy project of quite grand proportions. Their proposal is to re-enact the Gallipoli landing at Jack Evans boat harbour in Tweed Heads. I am very  enthusiastic about this project. It is very exciting and has a huge amount of local support. It is a very large undertaking. When we were first talking about this project and word spread about it, early predictions were that more than 10,000 people would be likely to attend. They already have huge numbers at the dawn services. Now some people are saying that perhaps up to 20,000 will be involved because of the size, scale and location, and the interest that people have in attending to commemorate and remember. 


The project was conceived to portray the Anzacs by re-enacting the Gallipoli landing, preceding the dawn service, using this wonderful boat harbour at Tweed Heads. It will be a significant event and it has support from a wide range of groups in the community—the local RSL, the surf clubs, all the local clubs, the council and local police from both sides of the border. New South Wales and Queensland police will assist with traffic management on the day. The project is also looking to have a live video feed of the event strategically placed so all those in attendance will be able to properly view the occasion. This reflects the fact that they are expecting such a large number of people and they do not want anyone to miss out on the great occasion. They want a live video feed on a number of screens around the boat harbour. 


Congratulations to them and to all the applications that were put together. I think it shows the great array of different and wonderful ideas they have to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac. They are all very significant events for the electorate, as I am sure they will be in all electorates throughout the country. Next year at a variety of times, communities will gather to remember the sacrifices of those who served and died in wars and conflicts. Indeed, there are lots of other wonderful events throughout my community as I am sure there will be in other electorates, with lots of RSLs and groups looking at organising events. All of these ceremonies with their symbols of commemoration will help us remember the sacrifices that have been made. 


These events reflect the permanent work that we see at the War Memorial, and the important role the War Memorial plays. It is often a highlight for schoolchildren from my electorate when they visit Canberra and the many other people from my electorate who visit here. It is absolutely one of their highlights. Quite rightly, the War Memorial is regarded as a special and unique place. The exhibitions in the memorial's galleries take advantage of the exceptional and diverse national collection to deliver some very interesting interactive visitor experiences that are engaging, informative and educational. What is also important is the commemorative focus. The memorial provides a very personal link and an emotive experience for those who served the nation in times of war. It is important for families and descendants to be able to find out information and to have the time for reflection.


I, like others, have been pleased to speak about the wonderful benefits the War Memorial brings to our nation. I support the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014. It amends the Australian War Memorial Act to prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the War Memorial premises. In conclusion, I commend this bill to the House, as we continue to recognise the role that the War Memorial plays within our community and congratulate them for the extensions and improvements to it. I particularly note around the country all those individuals and organisations involved with the ongoing services to commemorate all those who served in defence of our nation.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (10:58):  For both sides of this chamber to speak about our famous War Memorial is a great opportunity and one that is rarely afforded to us. TripAdvisor ranks the War Memorial as No. 17 in the top 20 tourist attractions in the world, narrowly edging out the Big Banana in Coffs Harbour and the wave pool in my colleague's electorate in Western Sydney! This is a magnificent place to visit. I have been visiting World War II and World War I battle scenes and cemeteries for a long time but had not actually gone to the War Memorial as a child. A million Australians and foreign tourists pass through the War Memorial every year, and 200,000 students—but that is not every Australian student. It should be the goal of this place to make sure that every young Australian gets to see the Australian War Memorial.


While this bill, the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014, is about ensuring that charges are never paid to walk through those hallowed doors or to park there, I do not for a moment think that, however bad we have thought the previous six years of Labor government were, they ever would have fallen to charging for the War Memorial. I acknowledge now that putting it in legislation is a smart move, but I do not for one moment doubt that both sides of this chamber respect the Australian War Memorial for the wonderful job it does, both in commemorating those 102,000 Australians who have given their lives for the democracy and freedoms that we enjoy, and in telling their stories. Many of us as Australian families—and I would count mine among them—do not actually have veterans who served overseas, so those stories were not passed through to me directly. So it is so vital. I was a 10-year-old in the 1970s, when turning up to Anzac Day parades was not only optional but probably undesirable. That turned around, and Australians realised what we were missing out on and what we potentially could lose as we saw our veterans becoming older each year. Australia seized that opportunity, and we have successfully grasped it. We have now continued that connection to those who served in the two great wars and before.


What many people do not realise is that the War Memorial covers all of Australia's engagements, right back to 19th century colonial engagements in Africa. It goes all the way through to, obviously, Iraq and Afghanistan and, most importantly, also where Australia's service is increasingly becoming world renowned, and that is in peacekeeping missions. Australia deployed in over a dozen locations around the world in the last 10 years. Peacekeeping missions are just as important. Peace building and peacekeeping with our United Nations partners is increasingly the new order. We can stabilise parts of the world that otherwise would descend into war by prompt responses from an alliance of nations, often those that are most closely bound to it. We need to find local and regional solutions to these challenges. It is not up to the great powers and the advanced economies to be stepping into every internecine disagreement that we find in the far corners of continents often far from our own.


So Australia does a great job, but I would like to take this opportunity that I have to mention one great omission, and that is that since the end of World War II we have not recognised, in the form of a simple medal, those people who gave their lives for our country. It was cancelled straight after World War II. It was known as the Mothers' and Widows' Badge, and I concede that it was not the best conceived plan at a time when Australia really had financial problems postwar. Sending out a mothers medal by sending a letter in the mail saying, 'Please pick it up at the post office,' was simply not good enough. We can do far better than that. The leading democratic nations whom we would call partners and allies have an arrangement where the next of kin are recognised. The people who, on service papers, are identified as next of kin deserve, I think, no less than a palpable physical token of our absolute appreciation for someone who makes the ultimate sacrifice serving overseas. We should be doing what Canada, the US in the form of their Purple Heart, the UK, many European countries and even New Zealand do. I believe that that is—and if it is not it should be—coalition policy. The cost would be infinitesimal. It does not add to the complexity of the military medal system, because it is a medal to the next of kin; it does not qualify as a military medal.


When we take this concept one step further—and I made my references to peacekeeping—perhaps someone in Australia who gives their life in the service of our nation in a peacekeeping role deserves not the same medal but a similar medal, because that sacrifice, for those parents, is no less. If you give your life serving an Australian NGO, for instance, in Africa, in a highly unstable location where there could be either terrorist activity or intertribal disputes where our aid workers are caught up and ultimately also pay with their lives, then I think that we should recognise that in a formal way. The first question that one would be asked is: who should be eligible? That is quite simple. There is the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal, the HOSM, which clearly identifies areas of service that are supported by the Australian government. That lists right back for many decades, clearly identifying the periods and the organisations that are eligible. If an Australian serves in a way that is eligible for the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal, I think they should, if they make the ultimate sacrifice, be formally recognised. It is a great omission in our awards, and I think it is one that the current government could examine.


In conclusion, we are fixing another problem today. I know that those visiting the War Memorial for years and decades to come will go back to Hansard and read the debate that we are having today about guaranteeing free entry, because there is no more important story—not only the commemoration of service but hearing the stories about people who were just like us. They came from families just like ours. As we travel around Australia, many of us who live in the cities often forget the extraordinary price in numbers that regional parts of Australia paid. You can visit a town like Scone or Orange or other smaller regional cities in Queensland and see enormous numbers of names—mostly of young men but also women who served overseas and gave their lives. To those country towns that staffed and filled the rank and file of our military in those two wars, I think we who live in the city and now enjoy the dividends of their service should be eternally grateful.

Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (11:05):  I rise today in support of the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014. It has long been recognised that the Australian War Memorial is the nation's home of commemoration, reflection and remembrance. Charles Bean wrote in his immortal words in 1948:


Here is their spirit, in the heart of the land they loved; and here we guard the record which they themselves made.


Charles Bean could not have said it any better. The War Memorial stands today as a tribute to those who served, their friends and the families of all the service men and women—those that fell and those that came home—but, most importantly as well, to all Australians for all time. It is right for us as a nation to recognise their loss and this enduring legacy. It is for this reason that the War Memorial must be a place that all Australians are able to access free of charge, to be able to pay their respects and to honour the fallen. But it is also important to remember the legacy and to teach the foundations of our country to our children and our children's children, and for all Australians to acknowledge the war commitments of our predecessors.


As we enter into a period of remembrance and reflection like never before—as we enter the year of the 100th anniversary of the Great War, the Centenary of Anzac and the 70th anniversary of World War II, taking place in 2015 and in 2018 and on significant dates in between—I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record my sincerest gratitude to all our Australian Defence Force personnel, men and women, both past and present, and those that are playing an important role in shaping our nation's rich history. 


In 1915, recruiting committees were formed in nearly every town throughout Australia. In the central west of New South Wales a movement began which became known as the Gilgandra snowball. Under the leadership of WT 'Captain Bill' Hitchen, 20 or so men marched off to Sydney. Gathering other recruits along the way, they numbered about 300 by the time they reached Sydney. This was known as the Coo-ee March. The Coo-ee March marched right through my electorate of Lindsay. Their example was soon followed by other marches from right around New South Wales and Queensland: the Waratahs, Kangaroos, Wallabies, Dungarees, Men from Snowy River, Kurrajongs, Kookaburras, Central West Boomerangs and North Coast Boomerangs. They all relied on the support of the communities they passed through, which was often very enthusiastic. The total number of men involved was only 1,500, but the marches attracted wide publicity and may have encouraged fundraising and enlistment more generally. One commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac is a re-enactment of the Coo-ee March and it is expected to arrive in the seat of Lindsay on or around 8 November 2015. These ex-servicemen will have spent 25 days walking from Gilgandra to Penrith and eventually on to Sydney in time for Remembrance Day. 


If we are to pass on to future generations the story of the Anzacs who served at Gallipoli and the campaigns over a century of service, we must ensure that these stories are available at no cost. This is particularly important for the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of school students that come to the memorial as part of their school trips to Canberra each and every year.


I have spoken to the two RSL clubs that are within the seat of Lindsay. They have both provided statements which I would like to read to the House. From the City of Penrith RSL Sub-Branch, the president, Mick McConnell, wrote:


The AWM—


the Australian War Memorial—


is to remind the community that it was built on the blood of our nation and you cannot put a price on that.


It is a monument to our Australian (military) history and it displays a myriad of records and all types of memorabilia for community members to view and reflect on our history from the beginning of our nation.


Australians who went to war helped to provide us with a free world.


The collection of records, mementos, collectables and relics that are placed on display is paramount to all members of the community so they can pass on—


their legacy—


to … other family members—


and—


the memories they gained from their experience.


People travelling from all regions of Australia who have already paid for travel and accommodation do not deserve to pay for parking or entry into the AWM, particularly those who wish to have access to the Research Centre where they can research their family's military history.


It is a place where it provides first hand education for Australian school students and a place—


to—


enhance the development of teachers.


The AWM holds an abundance of unreplaceable artefacts, which is unique to this country, and they belong to all Australians, the tax payers of this nation.


Every family has a history of some member of their family having served our country or have lost their lives defending it.


The AWM is … like a Mecca to our Australian people where it becomes a central location to pay homage to our fallen.


When commemoratives services and parades are conducted on the grounds, politicians and guests do not pay for parking, so why should members of the community, the tax payer, attending these events have to pay?


The new parking arrangements that were introduced on 1st July 2014 seem appropriate but 4 hours limit can be a restriction to those enthusiastic visitors.


The Government of the day has always provided funding, but maybe the Members of Council could look at—


other ways of funding the Australian War Memorial. His recommendations include:


… to encourage more organisations to become Friends of the Memorial,


… perhaps increase the membership fee to Friends of the Memorial,


… maybe enhance the content of the AWM shop,


… entice more organisations to place advertisements into the magazine (quarterly issues I think),


… actively seek more funds and regular donations by way of additional sponsorship from larger business corporations, mining corporations, RSL Clubs and the like …


Finally, he recommends:


… maybe have a government policy introduced that all clubs and registered organisations donate a small % of poker machine profits.


I would like to thank Mick McConnell from the Penrith RSL for his contributions.


I also had feedback from Tony Fryer, the honorary secretary of the St Marys RSL Sub-Branch. He says: 'I believe that the members of the St Marys ESOs, St Marys Outpost of the Vietnam Veterans Association and St Marys RSL Sub-Branch fully support the maintenance of free access to parking at the Australian War Memorial and free entry to the Australian War Memorial so that ESO members and the general public alike can continue to be exposed to the reality of Australia's past conflicts and Australia's rich military history and culture and to truly understand the price paid by our forebears in maintaining the freedoms that all Australians enjoy today.' I would like to thank Tony also for his contribution.


As you can see from the service men and women in the RSL clubs that I represent in Lindsay, it goes without saying: to keep the War Memorial free to all Australians is absolutely paramount. I would like to thank my RSL clubs for their support. I would like to also thank my RSL clubs for the work that they are doing to have a wonderful dawn service for Anzac Day. Both Penrith and St Marys do phenomenal jobs. In that vein, I would like to commend the bill to the House.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:14):  There are some things in our lives that should be sacrosanct. Unconditional love for your children and love for your country are two that spring to mind. The ability to pay your respects to those who so loved their country that they gave their lives in defence of it should be another. It is well known that the idea of the Australian War Memorial came from Australia's official war correspondent and official World War I historian the great Charles Bean one night while talking with others after days of inspecting the battlefields of Pozieres in August 1916. His confidant, AW Bazley, would later say:


I cannot recall the actual conversations today I do remember that on a number of occasions he talked about what he had in his mind concerning some future Australian war memorial museum.


Bean was among those who landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 and was well aware of the human sacrifice men were making for their country. To him it seemed fitting that such sacrifice was properly and respectfully memorialised.


Bean's vision for a memorial was given life by another who landed at Gallipoli that fateful and nation-defining day, Captain John Treloar. In 1917, Treloar was appointed head of the Australian War Records Section in London and it is the work of his team that provides the Australian War Memorial with so many of the relics from World War I that give life to the collection today. With the aid of his team and orders given to soldiers to do their own collecting for the envisaged war museum, 25,000 pieces were collected and formed the backbone of the first collection of the Australian War Memorial.


Like the design of Canberra itself, a competition was run for the design of the Australian War Memorial in 1927. However, no single entry was able to fulfil Bean's vision for the memorial, which he stated as:


… on some hill-top-still beautiful, gleaming white and silent, a building of three parts, a centre and two wings. The centre will hold the great national relics of the A.I.F. One wing will be a gallery—holding the pictures that our artists painted and drew actually on the scene and amongst the events themselves. The other wing will be a library to contain the written official records of every unit.


Two designers were asked to submit a joint entry and it is this design by Emil Sodersteen and Jon Crust that was constructed and opened in 1941. Prior to the opening of the memorial building, the collection was displayed first in Melbourne from 1923 to 1925 and then in Sydney until 1935. The memorial building was expanded with the addition of the wings in 1971 to house the growing collection. Prior to this, some of the memorial's collection had to be sold due to space constraints. The most recent update is a new World War I gallery, which was only opened last night, in time for the Centenary of ANZAC. Through all these many years, the Australian War Memorial has been open at no charge to all those who wish to come and pay their respects to our country's fallen. This bill, the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014, ensures entrance and access to the Australian War Memorial will always remain free.


Since 1860, from the Maori Wars in New Zealand through to current engagements, 102,787 Australian men and women have given their lives in defence of our country. Among them are members of my own family. There are 102,787 reasons the Australian War Memorial should be free forever for everyday Australians to go and pay their respects to the people whose blood gave us the country we have today. There are 102,787 reasons why this government believes it is important enough for parliament to legislate free access to the Australian War Memorial and not just leave it to fate. This is a matter close to my heart. My family has a long history of service to our nation through the ADF and its predecessors, and I understand their desire to serve.


I have heard people say that the Australian War Memorial glorifies war. I would respectfully say to those people that they have never visited the Australian War Memorial and sat by the Pool of Reflection on a sunny morning, or attended the extraordinarily moving Last Post service conducted each evening. The Australian War Memorial does not glorify war. It remembers and recognises the struggles we have faced as a nation and those brave men and women who gave their lives for our freedom. And I do not believe that a child visiting this hallowed place is any more likely to grow up to become a soldier than anyone else. A visit reminds them that the privileges they enjoy in their lives lie at the feet of those who have gone before them and those who had the courage to stand up for what is right.


A schoolchild visiting the Australian War Memorial as part of their year 7 Canberra trip should not have to pay to enter what is a special place. As well as the museum and war records wings, the Australian War Memorial contains the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The remains of this Australian soldier, killed on the Western Front, were interred in the Hall of Memory in 1933 to serve as a symbol of the sacrifice made by all who served and died—a man that Prime Minister Keating referred to in his 1993 eulogy as 'all of them' and 'one of us'.


I believe that visiting the Australian War Memorial gives children a greater sense of the world around them and emphasises just how fortunate we really are. Yes, 102,787 lives are a lot for such a small nation, but when compared to other countries we are fortunate. We are indeed fortunate that evil leaders like Pol Pot, Hitler, Stalin and Idi Amin have never held power in our country. We are fortunate that our allies share our beliefs and our ambitions not only for our countries but for the whole world. And we are fortunate that we have men and women who choose of their own free will to don the uniform of the Australian Defence Force. We should all be grateful to every man and woman who dons the uniform. I am grateful to their families who support them. And I am grateful that, because of this bill, honouring our fallen heroes will remain the right of every Australian until the end of time.


I finish with a further quote from Mr Keating about just what the unknown soldier and all those honoured by our War Memorial represent:


We have gained a legend: a story of bravery and sacrifice and, with it, a deeper faith in ourselves and our democracy, and a deeper understanding of what it means to be Australian.


It is not too much to hope, therefore, that this Unknown Australian Soldier might continue to serve his country—he might enshrine a nation's love of peace and remind us that in the sacrifice of the men and women whose names are recorded here there is faith enough for all of us.


I commend this bill to the House and trust there is not one person in this House or the Senate who will vote against it.

(
Mr Whiteley

The debate has been very interesting and respectful, and I am sad in one sense that I have not been able to contribute today because I have been sitting in the chair for the roster. I also take the opportunity to encourage everybody to visit the new World War I gallery. I note that the member for Wills is in the chamber; both he and I were there last night at the invitation of the War Memorial. It is absolutely fantastic and I encourage all members to visit. Given that the minister responsible for this bill is not in the chamber to sum up, I am going to move to suspend the Federation Chamber.

 (Casey) (11:28):  I join in speaking on the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014 and supporting the very important measures in it to ensure that there are no parking fees at the War Memorial. I want to very briefly associate myself with the remarks of members on this side who have spoken on this bill.


The War Memorial is one of Australia's foremost institutions. It has the names of 102,000 Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice. My friend and colleague the minister and I have spoken about this in the Centenary of Anzac. The memorial bears the names that are on all the cenotaphs in all the local towns in my electorate down in the Yarra Valley, and in the towns of the minister's electorate in Queensland. Over these four years it is going to be a focus like never before, with school groups going to the War Memorial and looking up the names that they have seen on their local honour boards. This bill is an important bill. It is one that was foreshadowed some years back by our Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, when he was the opposition spokesman—he carried it through in a clear policy prior to the last election. It has my strong support that we are dealing with that today.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (11:30):  Let me thank all members of the House that have made contributions here this morning. I thank the member for Ryan and the member for Casey especially for their contributions not just to the debate but also to our service men and women and our veterans throughout not just their electorates but the country. 


The Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill gives effect to the government's election commitment to prohibit the imposition of parking and entry fees at the Australian War Memorial. Every year, close on to a million Australians visit the memorial to pay their respects to the fallen and to visit the world-class museum. As I say to all guests that come here internationally, be they presidents, prime ministers, foreign dignitaries or diplomats, you will never understand Australia and its people unless you have been to the cauldron itself—the Australian War Memorial. At the memorial, visitors can see and experience the Roll of Honour, the Hall of Valour, the dioramas and the Hall of Memory containing the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier.


The bill amends the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 to ensure that entry to and parking at the memorial remain free so that everyone has access to a world-class shrine, a museum and an archive that commemorates and remembers the unique Australian military service that has so defined the nation.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (10:01):  It is a pleasure and an honour to be able to speak on the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014, which is probably not the most auspicious piece of legislation that I will have an opportunity to debate; nevertheless, remembering the sacrifice that so many over so many years have made for our country in the field of war, in the role of peacekeepers, in support roles and in active service is something that every Australian and future generations would do well to contemplate from time to time.


The Australian War Memorial is truly an icon in Australia. My family, my brother and his wife and daughters recently visited Canberra and as a family we went to see the War Memorial. Whilst it was a venue to enjoy a lunch, for me it was quite intriguing to watch the reaction of my young boys in particular to the amazing collection they have at the War Memorial. It was interesting to see the vividness of the display at the back of the War Memorial—the lights, the activity and the interactive display they have there—and observe the impact it has on young people. We are often critical of young people about living in a different world and about the way they engage with the community and with others. They move through life perhaps at a faster pace that you and I might have. For me it was truly eye-opening to see the way they were absolutely captivated by the images and the stories they were seeing.


Another recollection I have of that day was the absolutely broken wreck of an aircraft that forms part of a display in the War Memorial. Indeed, it compels you to contemplate the time and the place and how that came to be. It was special. I think it is something that every Australian should do. They should take the time. We did not give it enough time, but we will make sure that we have an opportunity at some point in the future to revisit that amazing memorial to people who served, many of whom gave their lives for the sake of this country.


The bill itself is about ensuring that there will never be the ability to charge parking fees at the War Memorial. It may not seem the most significant thing. Nevertheless, based on the observations, if nothing else, that I have made of the impact that the memorial had on my young boys, it is a special place in Australia. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the country, and for every Australian, when they come to Canberra, there should be no barriers to them visiting the War Memorial, because it is a special place and a place for reflection.


Getting back closer to home, no doubt it is true right around Australia, but, within my electorate of Lyons, which covers over 50 per cent of the south island—the island state of our great nation—there are many communities. There are literally hundreds of small communities. Without thinking too hard, I did start making a list last night of all the little towns around my electorate that I am aware of that have memorials to the Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War or the Vietnam War, as well as peacekeepers' memorials or memorials to Afghanistan or other conflicts. Truly, they have been focal points for those communities. I hesitated to complete the list because I was sure that I would miss some communities, but one town that springs to mind, a very, very small community, is Avoca in the Fingal Valley. I had the privilege of speaking at the 11 o'clock Anzac Day service at Avoca last year. Indeed, the work that they have done has been successful in attracting a little funding out of the Centenary of Anzac commemoration memorial fund. That has given them an opportunity to do some work that was overdue in upgrading their memorial.


Further south, in the beautiful Derwent Valley, up towards the Florentine and those iconic 'working forests', as they are—or were, at least—within my electorate, there is the town of Fentonbury. Those who take the road up the Derwent Valley through New Norfolk, past Bushy Park and Glenora, end up at Westerway. If you turn off there to go towards Ellendale, you pass the small town of Fentonbury. On the right-hand side as you head towards Ellendale, there is a memorial. It is in a privately owned paddock. This memorial somewhat resembles the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Every time I drive past it, I stop and I ponder. I have had conversations with the local mayor because I would love to see a way of working with the private landowner and, if it were deemed appropriate by the local community, perhaps consideration of moving that memorial to a place where it could once again be a focal point for that community—because we should always remember and reflect on and take the time at appropriate moments during the year to contemplate those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.


This debate gives me an opportunity also to reflect on the Centenary of Anzac program. It is a really valuable program right across the 150 electorates around the country. My observation might be that in an electorate such as Lyons, where every 10 kilometres down the road I have got another little town that has got another little memorial, the capacity to make $125,000 go further is probably more challenging than it may be in a smaller inner-city electorate. Nevertheless, it has been a really valuable process. I acknowledge the instigation of the same by the previous government and the work that Minister Ronaldson has done subsequently, adding $25,000 to those grants that were available to every electorate around the country.


The process that we went through was one of consultation. We had a committee and the committee was chaired by a former Professor of History at the University of Tasmania, retired, Michael Roe, and representatives from around the north and south of my electorate with people who have a connection either through the Returned Services League or their participation in the armed forces. It was a really constructive process on which they embarked. I have had a number of highlights. We are about halfway through the announcements that we are expecting. Understandably, they are being scrutinised properly by the department, as should be the case when public money is being used. So far we have had some announcements. For example, a little over $1,000 was approved for the very small community at Liffey that had small plaques disappear from trees that were planted in 1918. That money will go to re-establishing those plaques and in some cases replacing those trees. It is a small thing for a small community.


I had the privilege a couple of weekends ago of going to the small town of Woodsdale in the Southern Midlands in my electorate for the opening of another very small Centenary of Anzac program that they announced. It was $1,200 for a plaque to remember those people from that community who had gone away and served their country in the First World War. One of the things about my electorate is that the same names from different parts of the community keep coming up. No doubt previous members for this electorate—there have only been a few since the Second World War in this seat—when they heard the name 'Wilson' knew they were from somewhere between Parattah and Woodsdale and would start in the Southern Midlands. When you hear the name 'Dare', almost certainly they will be from Woodsdale in the Southern Midlands. It was a special occasion. I think there would have been close to 100 people who came to the opening of the park and the little memorial garden that has been established in that very, very small community there.


In the time I have left to speak, I would also comment on the wonderful work that has been done at Sheffield, 'the town of murals', which some would know. I would encourage anyone who is visiting my beautiful state to take the time to visit Sheffield. It truly is a wonderful thing. The RSL there have just completed a stunning memorial mural and garden. It is almost, if you like, designed to be a three-dimensional image. As you drive in from the eastern side of Sheffield into the town it is in a very prominent place and I think in time it will become in and of itself a reason for people to make the journey to Sheffield. It is a wonderful commemoration of not only people who served in the First World War in this instance but also the people who have served in many theatres of war since that time.


Whilst this is not the most auspicious piece of legislation, the War Memorial is nevertheless absolutely one of Australia's must-visit memorials. The Australian War Memorial in Canberra truly is a national treasure. It is a small measure that this bill enacts to make sure that those visiting are given as easy access as possible by making sure that there can never be parking or entry fees imposed on the War Memorial. It is also making sure that the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 continues to meet the current needs of the memorial and, most importantly, of the community that it is there to help reflect on those that have given their lives.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:15):  It gives me great pleasure to participate in the debate on the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014 and to use this opportunity to speak about the Australian War Memorial, which is arguably Australia's most important national cultural institution—although it is not just an institution; it is a monument and a memorial to Australians who have sacrificed their lives in war.


It is worthwhile, I think, to reflect for a moment at least on the origins of this great place. It arose, really, out of the work of Charles Bean. He, of course, was an official war correspondent for the First World War, and so he visited not only Gallipoli but also the Western Front. After he had been to Gallipoli and seen the horrors of Gallipoli, he witnessed Australia's first big battles on the Western Front, at Fromelles and Pozieres, in July 1916. Bean made some graphic observations about those events. It is worth reminding ourselves, I think, that on 19 July 1916, at the Battle of Fromelles, 5½ thousand Australians were either killed, captured or wounded. Around 1,800 were killed in that one period. It is Australia's highest loss in battle over a short time. In commenting on Pozieres, which followed Fromelles, Bean made these observations:


One knew that the Brigades which went in last night were there today in that insatiable factory of ghastly wounds. The men were simply turned in there as into some ghastly giant mincing machine. They have to stay there while shell after huge shell descends with a shriek close beside them—each one an acute mental torture—each shrieking tearing crash bringing a promise to each man—instantaneous—I will tear you into ghastly wounds—I will rend your flesh and pulp an arm or a leg –fling you half a gaping quivering man (like these that you see smashed around you one by one) to lie there rotting and blackening like all the things you saw by the awful roadside, or in that sickening dusty crater. Ten or twenty times a minute every man in the trench has that instant fear thrust tight upon his shoulders—I don't care how brave he is—with a crash that is a physical pain and a strain to withstand.


Then a month later, as the Bills Digest informs us, the idea of a memorial museum for Australia was born, as Bean's confidant AW Bazley later recalled. He said:


I remember in August 1916 when after his busy days tramping the Pozieres battlefield and visiting units in the line he would roll out his blankets on the chalk firestep of the old British front line … on the edge of Becourt Wood and Sausage Gully. We used to sleep feet to head—C.E.W.B., Padre Dexter, myself, and others—and although I cannot recall the actual conversations today I do remember that on a number of occasions he talked about what he had in his mind concerning some future Australian war memorial museum.


So the founding fathers of this museum, this great monument, became Charles Bean, our official First World War historian, and John Treloar, who became the director of the memorial between 1920 and 1952. But it was not until 1941 that we finally saw the opening of the basic buildings for this great place. In 1918, Bean conceived how the memorial would appear. He said:


… on some hill-top—still, beautiful, gleaming white and silent, a building of three parts, a centre and two wings. The centre will hold the great national relics of the A.I.F. one wing will be a gallery—holding the pictures that our artists painted and drew actually on the scene and amongst the events themselves. The other wing will be a library to contain the written official records of every unit.


Of course, subsequently, it became a memorial not only to the First World War but to subsequent conflicts—the Second World War, Korea and beyond. As a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel I have visited war museums across the world and I have to say that the Australian War Memorial is unique among them. I know the Australians who visit this wonderful place understand the gravitas that hits you once you are there. But it is really very important that we understand its significance both nationally and internationally.


At the beginning, Bean had hoped that the memorial would incorporate a roll of honour, which it does, listing the Australian dead of the war. Now that list is 102,000 men and women. As a result of changes which were made by the War Memorial Council last year, under the leadership of Ken Doolan as chair and as Dr Brendan Nelson as director, dead peacekeepers have been added to the Roll of Honour, which is as it should be. 


The really significant thing, in my view, in those periods post-1941 in terms of the development of the War Memorial is the Hall of Memory, which was completed in 1959. It is inspiring. We recall well Remembrance Day of 1993 when then Prime Minister Paul Keating spoke, as the remains of a soldier killed in the battlefields of the Western Front, name unknown, were placed in a marble covered tomb in the Hall of Memory. At that time, Paul Keating said: 


We do not know this Australian's name, we never will … He is one of them, and he is all of us. 


That says what it is. When you comprehend those 102,000 names and then all of those missing in action, names unknown, burial places unknown, it really is a really, really significant thing. That Hall of Memory and the Roll of Honour is a repository for our soul. We as a nation are all the better for it. 


There are some who would have argued in the past that somehow or other the War Memorial is a glorification of war, which of course it is not. It tells a story of war. It tells a story of our role in past conflicts. It reminds us, if anything, of the stupidity of war—of the need for us, every day, to strive to fight for peace. That, of course, is why we have such great confidence in the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, because that is their role. When we think about this War Memorial and see it as the monument that it is and recognise its role for us, for all Australians, in telling our national story, then we are all enhanced by that knowledge.


There have been significant developments at the War Memorial over the years. I mentioned some. But as the Centenary of Anzac comes upon us, a number of things have happened, one of which I was happily involved in as the former minister responsible for the War Memorial: the former Labor government made available $28.7 million to fund the redevelopment of the First World War galleries within the War Memorial, with $3.82 million from the War Memorial's own financial resources and $1 million from BHP Billiton. Last night members of this parliament had the opportunity to preview those galleries. I was fortunate enough to get a tour around those yet unfinished galleries, as they were last week, and I have to say they enhance the visit to the War Memorial greatly. I want to publicly thank and acknowledge the work of all those involved in these new galleries. I am sure most if not every member of parliament will have been there and will know the dioramas that exist there. Now there is a chronology so, when you walk into those First World War galleries, you start at the beginning of the war and work your way through. It is a fine monument and tells a really significant story, this story of Australians at war in the First World War on the Western Front and elsewhere. I say to those people who have not had the opportunity to visit: please do so. You will walk away with a great sense of pride in what has been achieved. 


It has not been achieved without leadership. That leadership has been provided by the War Memorial Council. The current members of that council are Rear Admiral Ken Doolan, who of course is the national president of the RSL; Air Chief Marshal Geoff Brown AO, who is the Chief of Air Force; the Hon. Graham Edwards AM, a former member of this fine parliament, a veteran himself and president of the Western Australian branch of the RSL; Mr Peter FitzSimons AM; Vice Admiral Tim Barrett AO CSC, the Chief of Navy; Dr Allan Hawke; Lieutenant-General David Morrison AO, the Chief of Army; Major General Paul Stevens AO (retired); Ms Gabrielle Trainor; Mr Les Carlyon; Ms Jillian Segal; and Mr Kerry Stokes.


Mr Stokes has been a wonderful contributor to Australia's war history. He has been a benefactor of the War Memorial and a benefactor of keeping these memories of Australians at war alive. His purchase of the pictures of Vignacourt, which record Australians away at the front during the First World War and are now on show at the gallery at the War Memorial, is a tribute to his philanthropy but also, most importantly, to his dedication to keeping these memories alive.


I want to also talk about Dr Brendan Nelson, who of course is the Director of the Australian War Memorial. I was in the fortunate position of being involved in his appointment, and I have to say what a wonderful appointment it has been. To his predecessor, Steve Gower, who spent many years as the director of the War Memorial, I want to say thank you for your contribution, Steve. I have not had the opportunity to publicly say this, but you made a wonderful contribution.


To Brendan and his staff, should they be listening, I say thank you for your leadership, Brendan, but, most importantly, I thank those people you have around you, who make the place work and who provide you with advice and insights: the historians, who do such wonderful work, the curators, the guides, the cleaners and the people who look after the landscape around the War Memorial—all of those involved. I say thank you on behalf of a grateful nation for keeping in a proper way this national icon, this national monument, this national museum.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (10:30):  I rise to speak to the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014, which will deliver our government's 2013 election commitment to amend the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 to prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the Australian War Memorial premises in Campbell in the Australian Capital Territory. At the 2013 election, the government committed to legislate to prohibit the levying of entry and parking fees at the Australian War Memorial. If we go back to 2010, it was revealed that the memorial's council was being forced to consider charging entry and parking fees, as well as to consider closing one day a week, under some pressure because of the previous government's failure to properly resource the Australian War Memorial. As a result, in February 2011 the coalition announced that, if elected, it would legislate to prevent the levying of parking and entry fees at the memorial. This is an incredibly important commitment—another important commitment that we are delivering on.


As we heard from the member for Lingiari in his contribution, the memorial must be a place for all Australians to visit free of charge, not only to pay their respects to the fallen but to learn the important story of Australia, and of Australians, at war. If we are to pass on to future generations the story of the Anzacs who served at Gallipoli and in other campaigns over a century of service, then we must ensure that these stories can be told and commemorated at no charge. This is particularly important for the hundreds and hundreds of schools which visit the memorial as part of school trips to Canberra each year. We must do all we can to ensure the Australian War Memorial's invaluable collection is not only protected for the future but able to be enjoyed by all visitors to the memorial at no cost.


As we heard in the fine contribution by the member for Lingiari, the Australian War Memorial is the nation's home of commemoration, reflection and remembrance. It is unique as both a memorial and a museum. Its cloisters contain the names of 102,000 Australians who have been killed in action as a result of service in war in the Australian Defence Force. The museum contains a world-class trove of memorabilia collected by soldiers, sailors and air men and women and left in perpetuity to the people of Australia as a reminder of the story of Australians at war. The galleries feature Australia's military engagements from Australia's colonial engagements in Africa in the 19th century through to recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and various peacekeeping operations. As we heard from the member for Lingiari, in February next year a $30 million redevelopment of the First World War galleries will open. This is the first major redevelopment of these galleries in 30 years. The much-loved dioramas depicting Australians at war at Gallipoli, on the Western Front and in Palestine have been upgraded, and this will be an even greater reason to visit the memorial from early next year.


Every year close to one million people visit the Australian War Memorial, including almost 200,000 school students. Of course, around the country Anzac Day services are becoming more and more popular. More and more people are attending Anzac Day services to reflect, to commemorate and to remember. This includes the national ceremony and the national remembrance day at the Australian War Memorial, which in 2014 had unprecedented numbers of people attending.


In fact, in June 2014 the Australian War Memorial was listed by TripAdvisor as the No. 1 tourist destination in Australia. It was also the only Australian institution listed in the world top 20, ranked 17. At this point I also want to concur with the recognition by the member for Lingiari of Kerry Stokes for his incredible contribution to the War Memorial and of the wonderful leadership of Dr Brendan Nelson, who is doing an absolutely outstanding job at this very important time in our nation's history. Of course the Centenary of Anzac next year will be the most significant period of commemoration, I think it is fair to say, in our nation's history. The date of 25 April 2015 will mark 100 years since that first fateful landing at Gallipoli. This will be a very important and special time for every Australian, young and old.


Some 15 years ago I visited Gallipoli—not for Anzac Day; at another time of the year—but even standing on those beaches and looking up in awe at the cliffs was incredible. I do not think there was a person who stood with us at that time who did not have tears in their eyes. It is a place so many Australians visit, and it is incredible to see that the story of the Anzacs continues to resonate so much as it does today.


Through my electorate of Corangamite winds the world's largest war memorial: the Great Ocean Road. As I said in my first speech, this is a journey made possible by the sweat and toil of returned soldiers of the Great War who built this iconic road between 1919 and 1932. But I think that at this time it is also very important not to forget that we must pay tribute over the next few years to the service of all men and women of the Australian Defence Forces who have served our country over the past hundred years. The date of 18 August 2016 marks another very significant day: the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, Vietnam Veterans Day. This will be a very important opportunity to pay tribute to the service of Vietnam vets, a contingent of men and women who were not properly recognised, many of whom were condemned and ostracised and who paid the price for many years. In fact, one of my staff members, Kerry Ridgeway, is a Vietnam vet. We went along to a Remembrance Day service just a few weeks ago, and he came along with me and wore his medals with pride. It was absolutely wonderful to see.


The government is rolling out a very important program commenced by the previous government. The Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program is all about recognising the incredible commitment the communities throughout my electorate and, of course, around the nation are making to commemorating the Centenary of Anzac, and $125,000 has been made available to each federal electorate to help fund various commemorative programs. I particularly want to commend and pay tribute to Senator Hon. Michael Ronaldson, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who increased the amount in each electorate by some $25,000. I must say he is doing an incredible job representing our government at this very important time.


I thought I would talk about a couple of the projects which have already been announced. Bannockburn Primary School has been awarded some $3,000, and that will help to enhance their remembrance garden. It is wonderful. I went along when we announced the grant with the children of Bannockburn Primary School. It is actually a school I am a great supporter of. It is wonderful to see that a new primary school is being delivered by the Victorian government. I am fighting very hard to make sure they get their secondary school too, but it is really fantastic to see that school's dedication to commemorating the Centenary of Anzac through a really wonderful project.


Another project we have announced is in Apollo Bay. Some $2,000 has gone to Apollo Bay Arts Incorporated for a literature reading event which has already been held, called Warm Winter Words. Again it commemorates 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War by exploring the Anzac Centenary and its connections with Indigenous Australians. At that event the guest speakers included Professor Mick Dodson, Bruce Elder and Bruce Pascoe. It was wonderful to be able to recognise and support that important event.


Just a couple of weeks ago I went along to Belmont Fire Brigade. Belmont Fire Brigade have received some $3,200 to support a project paying tribute to nine members of the brigade who fought in World War I. It was absolutely wonderful. There were, of course, both volunteers there and full-time firefighters. How much focus and how much pride they had in celebrating the achievements of previous members of the brigade who had so proudly represented them in the First World War. It was really a very special time for me, I have to say.


There are many other wonderful applications that have been made and they will be rolled out over the next few months. I thought I would just mention some of the great projects that are before us at the moment. The Ceres community organisation is looking to restore its First World War memorial gates. Belmont Primary School has applied for funding to build a special commemorative area and to install a new flagpole. The Colac RSL sub-branch is hoping to restore its war memorial site at Cressy Recreation Reserve, including a new flagpole. The money will greatly assist with upgrades to the site, including recording the details of soldiers from both world wars.


The Torquay RSL has been working incredibly hard—another great project—to construct a memorial garden at the Torquay Bowls Club. Recently that has been upgraded. It was a great job, I have to say, by the member for South Barwon in delivering a commitment to see a major upgrade of the Torquay Bowls Club, which is now home to the Torquay RSL. So that is a wonderful project.


In another fantastic project, the Military Historical Society of Geelong does incredible military re-enactments and they are looking to do a very large scale event next year. Christian College is also looking to invest in a remembrance garden. Then there is the Torquay and District Historical Society, and I want to say something about the Torquay Anzac Day service. It is an incredible service. Some 15,000 people gather at Point Danger on the cliffs at Torquay. The Torquay community and RSL do an incredible job holding a very moving service, as do so many of the other RSLs across Corangamite. They are looking to install a new plaque to commemorate local World War I diggers at Point Danger.


There are other projects by the Lorne RSL. Surf Coast Shire are looking to create a Winchelsea walk, and this particular walk is very significant. It will honour 64 Victoria Cross recipients from World War I. The first recipient was, of course, Albert Jacka, who was born in Winchelsea. That too is a wonderful project and there are some other fantastic projects from the Golden Plains Shire and the Burough of Queenscliffe. The light and sound production service there needs some assistance.


This is just an array of the projects that we are hoping to fund as part of our local commemorative grants program. In relation to Queenscliffe, I want to recognise a commitment from the Liberal candidate for Bellarine, Ron Nelson, who just yesterday announced a new visitors hub and cafe and other facilities at the Ocean View car park, where the Anzac Day service is held. That will provide power and really provide a lot more facilities for that very important service overlooking the back beach of Queenscliffe and overlooking the rip—a very important part of Queenscliffe's history. So that was a great commitment, part of a $3.6 million commitment for the Queenscliffe community made yesterday, as I say, by Ron Nelson.


At this time I want to take the opportunity to thank the members of the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program electorate committee for Corangamite: Graham Rawlins, Councillor Bob Merriman and Keith Hankin. The committee has worked with me to assess these applications. They have done a wonderful job. It is very much appreciated. They have applied great due diligence and I really do want to express my thanks for their work. And very briefly, I would like to congratulate Keith and his wife, Elaine, who have just celebrated 65 years of marriage.


The Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program recognises the importance of local commemorative events at this very special time in our nation's history. This is a very important bill as part of that. For these reasons I would like to commend the bill to the House.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (10:45):  I am very pleased to be speaking on this Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014 today. I note that previous speakers also acknowledge the remarkable role of the War Memorial, and also, quite rightly, the many commemorations around the country that have occurred and are occurring with the Centenary of Anzac. I too will be touching on many of those events in my electorate.


It is certainly the case that the War Memorial here in Canberra, in our nation's capital, commemorates the service and sacrifice of Australian service men and women who have died in the wars and conflicts in which Australia has participated. It is, indeed, a cultural institution of great international standing. It is of huge significance to Australians. The primary mission of the War Memorial is to assist Australians to remember, interpret and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact upon our society.


In reference to this bill specifically—as we have heard the previous speakers say—it amends the Australian War Memorial Act to prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the memorial premises in Campbell, where it is located. This is a very important initiative that I support.


The Australian War Memorial was officially opened on Remembrance Day, 11 November 1941, by the then Governor-General, Lord Gowrie, himself a former soldier whose honours included the Victoria Cross. As we know, the War Memorial is a magnificent institution. It has three very distinct sections. The shrine, which is a commemorative area, includes the Hall of Memory and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is an amazing premises. It is very moving when you are in there and see the whole shrine and the entire area.


It also has other galleries which consist of the museum and the research centre. We have heard some previous speakers talk about some of the wonderful upgrades to those particular areas. There is also an outdoor sculpture garden. These are very distinct areas that provide great information and wonderful areas of reflection for visitors. Indeed, this amazing military museum is widely regarded as one of the most significant memorials of its type in the world, which we should be all be very proud of. 


During times of reflection on war, the Australian War Memorial is quite rightly the nation's central focus. But it is only part of a much wider appreciation displayed right around the country for those brave men and women who served our nation. That appreciation can be seen in towns and other countries, particularly on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day. 


The Anzac Centenary is also very significant. It is a milestone of very special significance to all Australians and one that will be recognised and commemorated around the nation. It is the centenary of Australia's involvement in the First World War. The Anzac Centenary aims to encourage all Australians to reflect upon and learn more about Australia's military history and its impacts upon our nation and our communities and families. During the Anzac Centenary, we will remember not only the original Anzacs who served at Gallipoli; we will commemorate more than a century of service by Australian service men and women. The Anzac Centenary program encompasses all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australians have been involved. The program aims to give all Australians the opportunity to honour the service and sacrifice of those who served our country, including the more than 102,000 who have made the supreme sacrifice.


As we have heard previous speakers say today, it was the previous Labor government that established the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board in October 2011 to provide strategic advice and recommendations on the development of a program of commemorative activities for the Anzac Centenary.


An initiative from this was the undertaking to insist on and encourage communities right across the nation through the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program to carry out their own Anzac Centenary projects. These projects were to commemorate the service and sacrifice of Australian service men and women in the First World War. These particular grants are really a fantastic initiative. I note also from previous speakers today the very strong bipartisanship from the current government and all members in terms of this wonderful program in which we are seeing $125,000 being allocated per electorate for these very important commemorations—commemorations that will reflect each electorate's local communities and the different ways that they wish to commemorate this.


I would like to refer to some of the projects and the committee and the individuals involved in my electorate of Richmond. I had initially contacted the local RSLs asking their organisations to of course play a very vital role on the Richmond electorate committee for the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. The response was immediate and very enthusiastic. The committee, of course, once appointed, met straightaway to begin the consultation process with their communities and to develop an approach to commemorate the centenary which best represented their communities' views. 


The electorate committee of Richmond was chaired by Dr John Griffin, Secretary of the Tweed Heads and Coolangatta RSL Sub-Branch. I would like to particularly thank and acknowledge the wonderful work of Dr John not just in the Tweed Heads RSL but particularly on this committee. It was outstanding working with the RSLs and other community groups as well. Of course, many applications were received from a whole range of very diverse organisations—schools, RSL organisations, RSL care centres, theatre groups, local artists. It was fantastic to see the diversity.


The RSLs became the focal point to assist community groups with their applications and in the promotion of the program. This was also provided by local councils and schools through their newsletters and of course also by the local media. All these organisations and individuals called on to assist did so with great enthusiasm, which is a real testament to their support of what is a very worthy initiative.


I would like to mention some of the wonderful applications and projects the Richmond committee have put forward for consideration, some of which have been announced and some not announced yet. They are a great array and it really shows the diversity of projects and ideas that they have. First of all is the Byron Bay RSL Sub-Branch which, with the support of the local community, put forward their project to refurbish the existing First World War Memorial Gates and build a sheltered cenotaph for ex-service personnel, veterans and local communities to commemorate Anzac Day. There have been extremely generous offers of in-kind support and donations for the project. This demonstrates the high level of support for the project right throughout the local community.


A similar project is the upgrade of the war memorial at Cudgen Public School. Indeed, Cudgen school has a very long and proud association with the Anzac ceremonies and the local community. They have worked very closely with the Kingscliff RSL over the years with respect to this particular project. It has been wonderful to see attendance at this memorial service increase significantly over the years, so they now require a larger and, of course, more focused facility.


The Mullumbimby RSL has put together a proposal for a wonderful art exhibition which engages World War I descendants and local schoolchildren. A local ceramics artist will conduct the workshops and the artwork will be displayed locally for all of the community to enjoy. So it is a great project that will be really hands-on and involve a lot of locals.


Another wonderful initiative of the Mullumbimby community is the application made by the Drill Hall Theatre Company. The Drill Hall itself, it is interesting to note, may possibly be one of the only remaining buildings in the Richmond electorate to have been built for the training of soldiers for World War I. The Drill Hall Theatre Company is commissioning a play called The Signaller, which is about a young soldier who enlists in the Australian Light Horse just before meeting and falling in love with his young wife. The play will provide nine evening performances for the general public and four matinee performances for the elderly and also for schoolchildren. Again, it is another wonderful and very different initiative but it is great to see that happening.


The Murwillumbah RSL have undertaken to compile a Tweed roll of honour for World War I. The roll of honour will consist of those who originated from the Tweed and served with the AIF in World War I. This project will be displayed for the community to view at local service clubs, shopping malls and local shire offices. It is wonderful to have that roll of honour in such an array of different places.


I would also like to comment on the Tweed Heads and Coolangatta RSL and their proposal, which is a very worthy project of quite grand proportions. Their proposal is to re-enact the Gallipoli landing at Jack Evans boat harbour in Tweed Heads. I am very  enthusiastic about this project. It is very exciting and has a huge amount of local support. It is a very large undertaking. When we were first talking about this project and word spread about it, early predictions were that more than 10,000 people would be likely to attend. They already have huge numbers at the dawn services. Now some people are saying that perhaps up to 20,000 will be involved because of the size, scale and location, and the interest that people have in attending to commemorate and remember. 


The project was conceived to portray the Anzacs by re-enacting the Gallipoli landing, preceding the dawn service, using this wonderful boat harbour at Tweed Heads. It will be a significant event and it has support from a wide range of groups in the community—the local RSL, the surf clubs, all the local clubs, the council and local police from both sides of the border. New South Wales and Queensland police will assist with traffic management on the day. The project is also looking to have a live video feed of the event strategically placed so all those in attendance will be able to properly view the occasion. This reflects the fact that they are expecting such a large number of people and they do not want anyone to miss out on the great occasion. They want a live video feed on a number of screens around the boat harbour. 


Congratulations to them and to all the applications that were put together. I think it shows the great array of different and wonderful ideas they have to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac. They are all very significant events for the electorate, as I am sure they will be in all electorates throughout the country. Next year at a variety of times, communities will gather to remember the sacrifices of those who served and died in wars and conflicts. Indeed, there are lots of other wonderful events throughout my community as I am sure there will be in other electorates, with lots of RSLs and groups looking at organising events. All of these ceremonies with their symbols of commemoration will help us remember the sacrifices that have been made. 


These events reflect the permanent work that we see at the War Memorial, and the important role the War Memorial plays. It is often a highlight for schoolchildren from my electorate when they visit Canberra and the many other people from my electorate who visit here. It is absolutely one of their highlights. Quite rightly, the War Memorial is regarded as a special and unique place. The exhibitions in the memorial's galleries take advantage of the exceptional and diverse national collection to deliver some very interesting interactive visitor experiences that are engaging, informative and educational. What is also important is the commemorative focus. The memorial provides a very personal link and an emotive experience for those who served the nation in times of war. It is important for families and descendants to be able to find out information and to have the time for reflection.


I, like others, have been pleased to speak about the wonderful benefits the War Memorial brings to our nation. I support the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014. It amends the Australian War Memorial Act to prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the War Memorial premises. In conclusion, I commend this bill to the House, as we continue to recognise the role that the War Memorial plays within our community and congratulate them for the extensions and improvements to it. I particularly note around the country all those individuals and organisations involved with the ongoing services to commemorate all those who served in defence of our nation.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-27,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (10:58):  For both sides of this chamber to speak about our famous War Memorial is a great opportunity and one that is rarely afforded to us. TripAdvisor ranks the War Memorial as No. 17 in the top 20 tourist attractions in the world, narrowly edging out the Big Banana in Coffs Harbour and the wave pool in my colleague's electorate in Western Sydney! This is a magnificent place to visit. I have been visiting World War II and World War I battle scenes and cemeteries for a long time but had not actually gone to the War Memorial as a child. A million Australians and foreign tourists pass through the War Memorial every year, and 200,000 students—but that is not every Australian student. It should be the goal of this place to make sure that every young Australian gets to see the Australian War Memorial.


While this bill, the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014, is about ensuring that charges are never paid to walk through those hallowed doors or to park there, I do not for a moment think that, however bad we have thought the previous six years of Labor government were, they ever would have fallen to charging for the War Memorial. I acknowledge now that putting it in legislation is a smart move, but I do not for one moment doubt that both sides of this chamber respect the Australian War Memorial for the wonderful job it does, both in commemorating those 102,000 Australians who have given their lives for the democracy and freedoms that we enjoy, and in telling their stories. Many of us as Australian families—and I would count mine among them—do not actually have veterans who served overseas, so those stories were not passed through to me directly. So it is so vital. I was a 10-year-old in the 1970s, when turning up to Anzac Day parades was not only optional but probably undesirable. That turned around, and Australians realised what we were missing out on and what we potentially could lose as we saw our veterans becoming older each year. Australia seized that opportunity, and we have successfully grasped it. We have now continued that connection to those who served in the two great wars and before.


What many people do not realise is that the War Memorial covers all of Australia's engagements, right back to 19th century colonial engagements in Africa. It goes all the way through to, obviously, Iraq and Afghanistan and, most importantly, also where Australia's service is increasingly becoming world renowned, and that is in peacekeeping missions. Australia deployed in over a dozen locations around the world in the last 10 years. Peacekeeping missions are just as important. Peace building and peacekeeping with our United Nations partners is increasingly the new order. We can stabilise parts of the world that otherwise would descend into war by prompt responses from an alliance of nations, often those that are most closely bound to it. We need to find local and regional solutions to these challenges. It is not up to the great powers and the advanced economies to be stepping into every internecine disagreement that we find in the far corners of continents often far from our own.


So Australia does a great job, but I would like to take this opportunity that I have to mention one great omission, and that is that since the end of World War II we have not recognised, in the form of a simple medal, those people who gave their lives for our country. It was cancelled straight after World War II. It was known as the Mothers' and Widows' Badge, and I concede that it was not the best conceived plan at a time when Australia really had financial problems postwar. Sending out a mothers medal by sending a letter in the mail saying, 'Please pick it up at the post office,' was simply not good enough. We can do far better than that. The leading democratic nations whom we would call partners and allies have an arrangement where the next of kin are recognised. The people who, on service papers, are identified as next of kin deserve, I think, no less than a palpable physical token of our absolute appreciation for someone who makes the ultimate sacrifice serving overseas. We should be doing what Canada, the US in the form of their Purple Heart, the UK, many European countries and even New Zealand do. I believe that that is—and if it is not it should be—coalition policy. The cost would be infinitesimal. It does not add to the complexity of the military medal system, because it is a medal to the next of kin; it does not qualify as a military medal.


When we take this concept one step further—and I made my references to peacekeeping—perhaps someone in Australia who gives their life in the service of our nation in a peacekeeping role deserves not the same medal but a similar medal, because that sacrifice, for those parents, is no less. If you give your life serving an Australian NGO, for instance, in Africa, in a highly unstable location where there could be either terrorist activity or intertribal disputes where our aid workers are caught up and ultimately also pay with their lives, then I think that we should recognise that in a formal way. The first question that one would be asked is: who should be eligible? That is quite simple. There is the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal, the HOSM, which clearly identifies areas of service that are supported by the Australian government. That lists right back for many decades, clearly identifying the periods and the organisations that are eligible. If an Australian serves in a way that is eligible for the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal, I think they should, if they make the ultimate sacrifice, be formally recognised. It is a great omission in our awards, and I think it is one that the current government could examine.


In conclusion, we are fixing another problem today. I know that those visiting the War Memorial for years and decades to come will go back to Hansard and read the debate that we are having today about guaranteeing free entry, because there is no more important story—not only the commemoration of service but hearing the stories about people who were just like us. They came from families just like ours. As we travel around Australia, many of us who live in the cities often forget the extraordinary price in numbers that regional parts of Australia paid. You can visit a town like Scone or Orange or other smaller regional cities in Queensland and see enormous numbers of names—mostly of young men but also women who served overseas and gave their lives. To those country towns that staffed and filled the rank and file of our military in those two wars, I think we who live in the city and now enjoy the dividends of their service should be eternally grateful.

Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (11:05):  I rise today in support of the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014. It has long been recognised that the Australian War Memorial is the nation's home of commemoration, reflection and remembrance. Charles Bean wrote in his immortal words in 1948:


Here is their spirit, in the heart of the land they loved; and here we guard the record which they themselves made.


Charles Bean could not have said it any better. The War Memorial stands today as a tribute to those who served, their friends and the families of all the service men and women—those that fell and those that came home—but, most importantly as well, to all Australians for all time. It is right for us as a nation to recognise their loss and this enduring legacy. It is for this reason that the War Memorial must be a place that all Australians are able to access free of charge, to be able to pay their respects and to honour the fallen. But it is also important to remember the legacy and to teach the foundations of our country to our children and our children's children, and for all Australians to acknowledge the war commitments of our predecessors.


As we enter into a period of remembrance and reflection like never before—as we enter the year of the 100th anniversary of the Great War, the Centenary of Anzac and the 70th anniversary of World War II, taking place in 2015 and in 2018 and on significant dates in between—I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record my sincerest gratitude to all our Australian Defence Force personnel, men and women, both past and present, and those that are playing an important role in shaping our nation's rich history. 


In 1915, recruiting committees were formed in nearly every town throughout Australia. In the central west of New South Wales a movement began which became known as the Gilgandra snowball. Under the leadership of WT 'Captain Bill' Hitchen, 20 or so men marched off to Sydney. Gathering other recruits along the way, they numbered about 300 by the time they reached Sydney. This was known as the Coo-ee March. The Coo-ee March marched right through my electorate of Lindsay. Their example was soon followed by other marches from right around New South Wales and Queensland: the Waratahs, Kangaroos, Wallabies, Dungarees, Men from Snowy River, Kurrajongs, Kookaburras, Central West Boomerangs and North Coast Boomerangs. They all relied on the support of the communities they passed through, which was often very enthusiastic. The total number of men involved was only 1,500, but the marches attracted wide publicity and may have encouraged fundraising and enlistment more generally. One commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac is a re-enactment of the Coo-ee March and it is expected to arrive in the seat of Lindsay on or around 8 November 2015. These ex-servicemen will have spent 25 days walking from Gilgandra to Penrith and eventually on to Sydney in time for Remembrance Day. 


If we are to pass on to future generations the story of the Anzacs who served at Gallipoli and the campaigns over a century of service, we must ensure that these stories are available at no cost. This is particularly important for the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of school students that come to the memorial as part of their school trips to Canberra each and every year.


I have spoken to the two RSL clubs that are within the seat of Lindsay. They have both provided statements which I would like to read to the House. From the City of Penrith RSL Sub-Branch, the president, Mick McConnell, wrote:


The AWM—


the Australian War Memorial—


is to remind the community that it was built on the blood of our nation and you cannot put a price on that.


It is a monument to our Australian (military) history and it displays a myriad of records and all types of memorabilia for community members to view and reflect on our history from the beginning of our nation.


Australians who went to war helped to provide us with a free world.


The collection of records, mementos, collectables and relics that are placed on display is paramount to all members of the community so they can pass on—


their legacy—


to … other family members—


and—


the memories they gained from their experience.


People travelling from all regions of Australia who have already paid for travel and accommodation do not deserve to pay for parking or entry into the AWM, particularly those who wish to have access to the Research Centre where they can research their family's military history.


It is a place where it provides first hand education for Australian school students and a place—


to—


enhance the development of teachers.


The AWM holds an abundance of unreplaceable artefacts, which is unique to this country, and they belong to all Australians, the tax payers of this nation.


Every family has a history of some member of their family having served our country or have lost their lives defending it.


The AWM is … like a Mecca to our Australian people where it becomes a central location to pay homage to our fallen.


When commemoratives services and parades are conducted on the grounds, politicians and guests do not pay for parking, so why should members of the community, the tax payer, attending these events have to pay?


The new parking arrangements that were introduced on 1st July 2014 seem appropriate but 4 hours limit can be a restriction to those enthusiastic visitors.


The Government of the day has always provided funding, but maybe the Members of Council could look at—


other ways of funding the Australian War Memorial. His recommendations include:


… to encourage more organisations to become Friends of the Memorial,


… perhaps increase the membership fee to Friends of the Memorial,


… maybe enhance the content of the AWM shop,


… entice more organisations to place advertisements into the magazine (quarterly issues I think),


… actively seek more funds and regular donations by way of additional sponsorship from larger business corporations, mining corporations, RSL Clubs and the like …


Finally, he recommends:


… maybe have a government policy introduced that all clubs and registered organisations donate a small % of poker machine profits.


I would like to thank Mick McConnell from the Penrith RSL for his contributions.


I also had feedback from Tony Fryer, the honorary secretary of the St Marys RSL Sub-Branch. He says: 'I believe that the members of the St Marys ESOs, St Marys Outpost of the Vietnam Veterans Association and St Marys RSL Sub-Branch fully support the maintenance of free access to parking at the Australian War Memorial and free entry to the Australian War Memorial so that ESO members and the general public alike can continue to be exposed to the reality of Australia's past conflicts and Australia's rich military history and culture and to truly understand the price paid by our forebears in maintaining the freedoms that all Australians enjoy today.' I would like to thank Tony also for his contribution.


As you can see from the service men and women in the RSL clubs that I represent in Lindsay, it goes without saying: to keep the War Memorial free to all Australians is absolutely paramount. I would like to thank my RSL clubs for their support. I would like to also thank my RSL clubs for the work that they are doing to have a wonderful dawn service for Anzac Day. Both Penrith and St Marys do phenomenal jobs. In that vein, I would like to commend the bill to the House.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:14):  There are some things in our lives that should be sacrosanct. Unconditional love for your children and love for your country are two that spring to mind. The ability to pay your respects to those who so loved their country that they gave their lives in defence of it should be another. It is well known that the idea of the Australian War Memorial came from Australia's official war correspondent and official World War I historian the great Charles Bean one night while talking with others after days of inspecting the battlefields of Pozieres in August 1916. His confidant, AW Bazley, would later say:


I cannot recall the actual conversations today I do remember that on a number of occasions he talked about what he had in his mind concerning some future Australian war memorial museum.


Bean was among those who landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 and was well aware of the human sacrifice men were making for their country. To him it seemed fitting that such sacrifice was properly and respectfully memorialised.


Bean's vision for a memorial was given life by another who landed at Gallipoli that fateful and nation-defining day, Captain John Treloar. In 1917, Treloar was appointed head of the Australian War Records Section in London and it is the work of his team that provides the Australian War Memorial with so many of the relics from World War I that give life to the collection today. With the aid of his team and orders given to soldiers to do their own collecting for the envisaged war museum, 25,000 pieces were collected and formed the backbone of the first collection of the Australian War Memorial.


Like the design of Canberra itself, a competition was run for the design of the Australian War Memorial in 1927. However, no single entry was able to fulfil Bean's vision for the memorial, which he stated as:


… on some hill-top-still beautiful, gleaming white and silent, a building of three parts, a centre and two wings. The centre will hold the great national relics of the A.I.F. One wing will be a gallery—holding the pictures that our artists painted and drew actually on the scene and amongst the events themselves. The other wing will be a library to contain the written official records of every unit.


Two designers were asked to submit a joint entry and it is this design by Emil Sodersteen and Jon Crust that was constructed and opened in 1941. Prior to the opening of the memorial building, the collection was displayed first in Melbourne from 1923 to 1925 and then in Sydney until 1935. The memorial building was expanded with the addition of the wings in 1971 to house the growing collection. Prior to this, some of the memorial's collection had to be sold due to space constraints. The most recent update is a new World War I gallery, which was only opened last night, in time for the Centenary of ANZAC. Through all these many years, the Australian War Memorial has been open at no charge to all those who wish to come and pay their respects to our country's fallen. This bill, the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014, ensures entrance and access to the Australian War Memorial will always remain free.


Since 1860, from the Maori Wars in New Zealand through to current engagements, 102,787 Australian men and women have given their lives in defence of our country. Among them are members of my own family. There are 102,787 reasons the Australian War Memorial should be free forever for everyday Australians to go and pay their respects to the people whose blood gave us the country we have today. There are 102,787 reasons why this government believes it is important enough for parliament to legislate free access to the Australian War Memorial and not just leave it to fate. This is a matter close to my heart. My family has a long history of service to our nation through the ADF and its predecessors, and I understand their desire to serve.


I have heard people say that the Australian War Memorial glorifies war. I would respectfully say to those people that they have never visited the Australian War Memorial and sat by the Pool of Reflection on a sunny morning, or attended the extraordinarily moving Last Post service conducted each evening. The Australian War Memorial does not glorify war. It remembers and recognises the struggles we have faced as a nation and those brave men and women who gave their lives for our freedom. And I do not believe that a child visiting this hallowed place is any more likely to grow up to become a soldier than anyone else. A visit reminds them that the privileges they enjoy in their lives lie at the feet of those who have gone before them and those who had the courage to stand up for what is right.


A schoolchild visiting the Australian War Memorial as part of their year 7 Canberra trip should not have to pay to enter what is a special place. As well as the museum and war records wings, the Australian War Memorial contains the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The remains of this Australian soldier, killed on the Western Front, were interred in the Hall of Memory in 1933 to serve as a symbol of the sacrifice made by all who served and died—a man that Prime Minister Keating referred to in his 1993 eulogy as 'all of them' and 'one of us'.


I believe that visiting the Australian War Memorial gives children a greater sense of the world around them and emphasises just how fortunate we really are. Yes, 102,787 lives are a lot for such a small nation, but when compared to other countries we are fortunate. We are indeed fortunate that evil leaders like Pol Pot, Hitler, Stalin and Idi Amin have never held power in our country. We are fortunate that our allies share our beliefs and our ambitions not only for our countries but for the whole world. And we are fortunate that we have men and women who choose of their own free will to don the uniform of the Australian Defence Force. We should all be grateful to every man and woman who dons the uniform. I am grateful to their families who support them. And I am grateful that, because of this bill, honouring our fallen heroes will remain the right of every Australian until the end of time.


I finish with a further quote from Mr Keating about just what the unknown soldier and all those honoured by our War Memorial represent:


We have gained a legend: a story of bravery and sacrifice and, with it, a deeper faith in ourselves and our democracy, and a deeper understanding of what it means to be Australian.


It is not too much to hope, therefore, that this Unknown Australian Soldier might continue to serve his country—he might enshrine a nation's love of peace and remind us that in the sacrifice of the men and women whose names are recorded here there is faith enough for all of us.


I commend this bill to the House and trust there is not one person in this House or the Senate who will vote against it.

I note that the member for Wills is in the chamber; both he and I were there last night at the invitation of the War Memorial. It is absolutely fantastic and I encourage all members to visit.

 (Casey) (11:28):  I join in speaking on the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014 and supporting the very important measures in it to ensure that there are no parking fees at the War Memorial. I want to very briefly associate myself with the remarks of members on this side who have spoken on this bill.


The War Memorial is one of Australia's foremost institutions. It has the names of 102,000 Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice. My friend and colleague the minister and I have spoken about this in the Centenary of Anzac. The memorial bears the names that are on all the cenotaphs in all the local towns in my electorate down in the Yarra Valley, and in the towns of the minister's electorate in Queensland. Over these four years it is going to be a focus like never before, with school groups going to the War Memorial and looking up the names that they have seen on their local honour boards. This bill is an important bill. It is one that was foreshadowed some years back by our Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, when he was the opposition spokesman—he carried it through in a clear policy prior to the last election. It has my strong support that we are dealing with that today.

 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (11:30):  Let me thank all members of the House that have made contributions here this morning. I thank the member for Ryan and the member for Casey especially for their contributions not just to the debate but also to our service men and women and our veterans throughout not just their electorates but the country. 


The Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill gives effect to the government's election commitment to prohibit the imposition of parking and entry fees at the Australian War Memorial. Every year, close on to a million Australians visit the memorial to pay their respects to the fallen and to visit the world-class museum. As I say to all guests that come here internationally, be they presidents, prime ministers, foreign dignitaries or diplomats, you will never understand Australia and its people unless you have been to the cauldron itself—the Australian War Memorial. At the memorial, visitors can see and experience the Roll of Honour, the Hall of Valour, the dioramas and the Hall of Memory containing the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier.


The bill amends the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 to ensure that entry to and parking at the memorial remain free so that everyone has access to a world-class shrine, a museum and an archive that commemorates and remembers the unique Australian military service that has so defined the nation.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:32):  Condolence motions are times of sadness, but they also allow us to bring back, to the extent we can, positive memories about the person about whom we speak. So it is with Reg Withers, former minister and leader of the Senate. I did not know him well but, as a young staffer to Senator Sir John Carrick, I recall Reg Withers as one of the great characters of the Whitlam-Fraser years. To me he was larger than life. Indeed, for a newcomer to Old Parliament House, his presence was felt throughout the corridors of the Senate. Back then, in the much closer confines and limited space in which we operated, as Senate leader Senator Withers ruled with a strong hand. They were difficult days which saw the sacking of Gough Whitlam and the election of the Fraser government, and, while I am certain those opposite will disagree, his actions as leader of the Senate during those heady days were supported by the electorate a few short months later. 


His take-no-prisoners attitude during his time as Senate leader earned him the nickname 'the Toecutter'—which his son Simon tells us Reg always found a little bit odd, but I am sure he enjoyed the name. However, as tough as his reputation was, there was always a sense of humour. Reg Withers was one of a number of former servicemen from World War II who turned to politics and with that background brought a blunt realism to this parliament. Peter Shack's comments in The Australian a few days ago captured his essence. Just one piece of sage advice the elder statesman gave to the then new member for Tangney was: 'Don't trust anyone, not even me.' Another piece of wisdom, this time for ministers, was: 'Too many people believe that in every situation something must be done. Not true. A good nothing is better than a bad something. Save us please from the nonsense that ""we must appear to be doing something"".' His son Simon said Reg was just interested in getting the sensible thing done.


Reg cut his teeth in politics in local council with a stint on the Bunbury municipal council before being called to fill a Senate vacancy following the death of Senator Sir Shane Paltridge. He was the son of a trade unionist turned ALP MP but, like his siblings, became a staunch Liberal—we can only imagine those Christmas gatherings!


While he will be best remembered as the leader of the Senate during the final days of the Whitlam government, he would want us to recall the fact that he was, first and foremost, a family man who devoted himself to the service of his country because of his family. Service to Australia ran deep in him as a senator but also as a member of the Royal Australian Navy during World War II. I believe his desire to serve his country in the best way he saw fit was pivotal to his ability to hold a fractious Senate team together while it was under great duress in 1975.


Upon leaving the Senate, Reg Withers continued his service to his community with a successful and visionary tenure as the Lord Mayor of Perth. His foresight in building underground rail services and more apartments in Perth has been credited as the impetus for Perth becoming a revitalised city. He was a delegate for the monarchists at the 1998 Constitutional Convention, continuing his extraordinary history of service to his fellow Australians.


Reg and his wife, Shirley, were married for 61 years. By any measure, that is a magnificent achievement. They had three children and four grandchildren, who will obviously miss their father and grandfather very much. I wish to pass on to Reg's family my heartfelt condolences for their loss. While he lived to 90, the loss of a loved one is never easy to reconcile. Reg Withers leaves us with a record of service but, importantly, with a raft of memories of a time when politics thrived on the strength of character and good humour of a generation of great Australians who served their country in war and in this parliament. Senator Reg Withers was and remains a great Australian.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (11:37):  As the member for Perth I think it is most appropriate that I do recognise the passing of a former Lord Mayor of Perth—a lord mayor under whom I served when I was on the Perth City Council. I entered Perth City Council in 1988, and Reg was elected as lord mayor in 1991. I will be honest: I was part of a generation of people from Western Australia that very much saw Reg as something of an antichrist because of the role that he had played in bringing down the Whitlam government and, in our view, contravening the conventions of guaranteeing supply. Notwithstanding that, when Reg and I came to work together on the Perth City Council, we had a very cordial relationship. We were both able to put the party politics aside. I found Reg was always very straightforward to deal with and, as Peter Walsh has gone on the record as saying, whilst Reg might have been very cynical, he was never hypocritical. He was always someone I found to be very much a straight shooter.


I do note some of the commentary about Reg's vision for the city. I always remember Reg giving me a book he had just read, Edge City, about American cities, which seemed to have been written by someone who was saying that the future of the inner-city areas was over and that, in the future, there would be massive rejuvenation or expansion out on the edges of cities, with Walmarts moving out to the edge of cities—that was where people were moving; that was where jobs were moving—and that the inner city was dead. Whether Reg was fascinated by this book because he thought that was inevitable or because he thought that was a trend that we should resist was never entirely clear to me. Nevertheless, it was certainly an interesting period in the history of the city of Perth. In my second reincarnation as a local government person as mayor of Vincent, I worked very closely with his son, Simon, who was the mayor of the adjoining tiny town of Cambridge. We forged, I think, a very good working relationship on a number of issues, so it has been interesting to work closely with two generations of this family. I pass on my condolences to Shirley, whom I met many times during her time as the lady mayoress and who was always a very gracious person, and to Simon and all of the family.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (12:11):  I rise to speak today in support of the committee's report TAFE: an Australian asset. This report by the House of Representatives committee was convened to finish an inquiry that was started during the 43rd Parliament, referred by Labor minister at the time, Hon. Chris Bowen. The 44th Parliament committee was re-established in November last year, and in February this year Minister Ian Macfarlane referred the issue to the committee again with amended terms of reference.


There has been some comment about the decision of the Senate committee to take up the commenced inquiry of the previous House committee and to conduct their own inquiry, which tabled its report in May this year. It is my view, I have to say, that the critical point we have reached in many states regarding the need for support of TAFE into the future means that the dual inquiries should only be viewed as a positive, as they have allowed multiple opportunities for stakeholders to put forward their issues and their concerns. 


The 172 submissions and transcripts from the previous parliament were brought forward for the current inquiry, and the current committee held 11 hearings and inspections across capital cities and regional areas. I would like to thank the committee for taking up an idea I had to conduct an online survey. This ensured the maximised opportunity to hear directly from students—current and past students as well as those who may plan to study in the future. This was a significant task, and I would particularly like to thank the committee secretariat for their work in undertaking and assessing that survey.


The survey was launched in May and closed at the end of July. It received a total of 6,635 responses, which covered both quantitative and qualitative feedback.


The report title very appropriately identifies that TAFE has a broad social and economic task that is unique to a public provider and that this has made it an important national asset for decades. In the report's introduction it references the Kangan report. The Kangan report underscored the recurrent nature of the themes that recur with TAFE. In 1974, the Kangan report said:


The main purpose of education is the betterment and development of individual people and their contribution to the good of the community. Technical and further education should be planned accordingly. Emphasis on the needs of the individual should lead to easier access to learning, to better physical conditions of learning, to suitable student and teacher amenities, to welfare facilities, and to the highest standards of health and safety in workshops and laboratories.


It went on to say that the demand for education throughout life can be expected to grow, not simply because of changes in technologies and social organisation but also because people will become increasingly aware of the practical advantages that it gives an individual in respect of employment and livelihood. Forty years later, it would be hard to argue that those themes are not as important to communities now as they were in the seventies.


The committee took extensive evidence of the value and trust that many individual learners and employers place in TAFE and heard many examples of situations where TAFE was the critical provider in ensuring, in particular, that thin markets were covered and accessibility and affordability were ensured.


The first identified task in the committee's terms of reference was to consider 'the development of skills in the Australian economy'. The committee concluded:


While the COAG framework broadly recognises the important role of public VET providers, the crucial position and role of TAFE within VET is not explicitly recognised. For the Committee this is integral to the issues raised in the inquiry and is a deficiency that should be rectified. As stated above, it became evident to the Committee over the course of the inquiry that a foundational articulation of the role and function of TAFE is necessary.


The first task was obviously a particularly important one to the committee, and the evidence pointed quite clearly to the need for a nationally recognised agreement on the role of TAFE. This is encompassed, I would argue, very effectively in the first recommendation of the report, which says:


The Australian Government should, through the Council of Australian Governments, make a value statement comprehensively defining the role of TAFE within the VET sector together with its future direction in the competitive training market, from a national perspective.


This statement should recognise that the affordability and accessibility of the training market is underpinned by a strong public sector provider and acknowledges the following functions that TAFE, as a major and significant not-for-profit public provider, can uniquely bring to the VET sector …


It then goes on to outline nine specific, unique contributions that TAFE, as a public provider, makes and that need to be protected. The importance of this recommendation is that it identifies the unique role that TAFE, as the public provider, plays. It begins the task of identifying, from the evidence presented to the inquiry, the efforts that would be lost if TAFE were only required to operate simply as another competitor in a privatised market. I have said before—and I will put it on the record in this debate—that there would be nothing more tragic than for all of us, at all levels of government and across community and industry sectors, to only appreciate the true value of TAFE once it was lost.


The first recommendation calls on the federal government to take responsibility for coordinating an agreed national statement—between federal and state governments—that defines this role and outlines the future direction for TAFE in any competitive market with a view to protecting, if not enhancing, the capacity of TAFE to do the many public-good tasks that we ask of it. It is, therefore, critically important that the minister and the government accept all the recommendations of the committee and urgently seek to implement them.


The second and third terms of reference required an investigation of the pathways that TAFE provides for further education and employment. The survey of students, in particular, contained powerful evidence of the transformative role that TAFE had played in connecting vulnerable learners, or those who needed a second chance at education, with appropriate courses and significant support services. The report contains much evidence directly from students on this issue. This is, in itself, a good reason for many of those listening to take the opportunity to read the report of the committee.


It would be fair to acknowledge that, in many of these submissions, survey responses and direct evidence to the committee, the affordability of TAFE—and more recent changes to fee structures—was consistently raised as a barrier issue for students. This led to recommendation 3, which encourages governments to look at how these price structures might be acting as barriers.


The other persistent theme that came consistently through the evidence was the negative impact of aggressive behaviours by some private providers in the sector who are using unscrupulous marketing and recruitment practices and delivering poor-quality training and assessment. While the private sector was not a referred issue in the terms of reference, the committee did feel that the evidence directly impacted the fourth term relating to the role played by TAFE in 'the operation of a competitive training market'.


This led the committee to recommendation 2, providing options for tightening the content and assessment of national training packages; recommendation 4, supporting strengthening of the role of the regulators; and recommendation 5, where the intention is to be able to identify through an independent source, such as the NCVER, the funding efforts of all governments for the VET sector but TAFE in particular.


TAFE is a highly valued and trusted provider of education and training across all communities and states. Its importance can be seen in the significant place it fills in current debates in pending state elections—in particular, Victoria on Saturday. I am pleased that the Labor shadow minister in Victoria, Steve Herbert, has outlined a strong Labor policy for the election on TAFE, in particular the important task of rebuilding the TAFE system, which has been decimated under the Napthine government. On the weekend the Labor shadow minister in New South Wales, Ryan Park, also outlined a very strong TAFE policy to also take to the next election there. 


I would like to finish by thanking the committee chair, the member for Herbert, Ewen Jones; the deputy chair, the member for Perth, Alannah MacTiernan; and all my committee colleagues who worked in a very bipartisan way to produce what I think is an excellent report. I would also like to sincerely thank the committee secretariat—secretary Dr Glenn Worthington; inquiry secretary Mr Robert Little; research officer Ms Rebeka Mills; and administrative officers Ms Katrina Gillogly and Ms Jessica Ristevska—for their dedicated and professional work.

Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (12:19):  I rise today to speak on the Standing Committee on Education and Employment report, TAFE: an Australian asset, and acknowledge the comments by my committee colleague, the member for Cunningham. I appreciate her input into the inquiry as I do the many valuable contributions by other committee members to the inquiry this year. 


It is commonly recognised that TAFE is a great national asset. The message of the value of TAFE in the Australian community was very strong throughout our various discussions, and as such we believe that the Australian government should acknowledge this value with a statement through the Council of Australian Governments. TAFE has unique functions out there in the community as a major public provider that contributes to our society and economy. It has got an invaluable role in reskilling and providing, often mature-age workers, new opportunities. As our economy transitions, this becomes more prevalent. It is an important provider for second-chance education and is often a pathway to employment and university, avenues which are frequently supported through partnerships with industry and universities.


Skills development is a clear focus of TAFE and always has been. Can I just say on this issue that the skills and training that TAFE provides in Australia is internationally recognised. We heard from many industry associations and bodies about the high regard of TAFE in Australia from international experts and others. It was often compared to the tertiary system in Germany in terms of the quality of courses and outcomes. 


The significant role played by TAFE as a provider of opportunities for those in positions of disadvantage and vulnerability was also a clear message that we heard and acknowledge. In some cases we heard stories of students where TAFE had literally turned their lives around. These were inspiring stories of how they undertook a course in various TAFEs around Australia and the transformation of their lives was significant.


We also took evidence in relation to the unscrupulous marketing practices by private training providers and other practices of concern. This is something that needs addressing going forward for there to be a more level playing field in the tertiary education system. How to do this is the next question. We met with ASQA, the Australian Skills Quality Authority, a number of times. We support the continued work of the Australian government through ASQA and other parties involved in addressing loopholes that allow high-risk and unscrupulous practices to endanger the experience of students, and in particular the reputations of training providers and outcomes. Too many times we heard, for example, of those who work in the resources sector having to climb and jump on a huge grader yet there had been no testing in that area by the training provider. So their training was not aligned to the actual job. There were times when there were hairdressers who came through some short course offered by a private training provider and they also failed a basic test of skills. There were too many stories. It was too common to hear of such instances, and this needs to be addressed.


In terms of the way that TAFE works with industry I would like to raise a few points. It was widely acknowledged when we were in Adelaide that TAFE had close links with industry, with companies like Redarc. I acknowledge the member for Kingston, whose electorate covers where Redarc is based. I know Redarc has been a star in the South Australian economy. We need more stars like that. We need more Anthony Kiddles and more Redarcs around Australia and the same growth in small business.


Also, we had hospitality—Cordon Bleu and international hospitality schools that were based at Regency Park, linking well, using the facilities, training great chefs and those involved in hospitality management. There is potential growth in our economy coming from Asia, especially given the number of tourists, whether it be out of China, India or other areas of the world. They see Australia as a great tourist destination. There will be more jobs in hospitality and we will need more courses. We heard of examples where some courses for those involved in patisserie and other highly skilled areas in hospitality were not being adequately funded. This is a major deficiency. Some state governments, and I refer in particular to the South Australian state government in this respect, were not identifying and adequately funding the need.


I would like to say a few words about ASC, the Australian Submarine Corporation, because they were another industry participant that worked very closely with TAFE to get some great outcomes. I want to put on record my support for the workers at ASC, many of whom reside in my electorate. I know they do some good work there. They do have some challenging projects, such as the air warfare destroyers. We know there are some improvements being made and there is much work to still be undertaken. But I reiterate that I have been down to ASC and I respect the work they do.


Moving to the South Australian government and the way they have treated TAFE, I want to quote from a few recent articles in the media. In July, retired TAFE chief Jeff Gunningham commented that the South Australian government was ripping resources out of TAFE. He said they were being driven by Treasury in South Australia and were 'all about reducing costs. At the end of the day, quality costs money.' He said, 'TAFE lost 18 per cent of their revenue and 15 per cent of their staff over the first 18 months of the reform.' How can the South Australian Labor government be serious about resourcing the necessary courses at TAFE when they are ripping resources out of the system?


We see this translating into jobs. With the South Australian government and economy crying out for opportunities, TAFES are being devastated by job cuts. David Pisoni, the shadow minister for education, who holds the government to account extremely well, made the good point recently on morning radio when he said there were cuts of around 500 jobs by 2018, again, directed by the South Australian state Labor government and their Treasury. They have had six training ministers in six years. It resembles the previous Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government in respect of the turnover and lack of stability. Also, there is $90 million less in the training budget because the South Australian state government cannot manage money and cannot fund the necessary social infrastructure that is needed.


In closing, I want to pay tribute to the committee. The chair, Ewen Jones, did a great job. I also thank the secretariat, Robert, Rebeka and others, and, importantly, the TAFEs around Australia. Those service providers do such a great job. I have met many of the administrators of TAFE around Australia during this committee. I congratulate them on their efforts and their work; continue to keep up the good work. The Australian government recognises what you do and supports you all the way because of the vital role you play in the Australian economy.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (12:11):  I rise to speak today in support of the committee's report TAFE: an Australian asset. This report by the House of Representatives committee was convened to finish an inquiry that was started during the 43rd Parliament, referred by Labor minister at the time, Hon. Chris Bowen. The 44th Parliament committee was re-established in November last year, and in February this year Minister Ian Macfarlane referred the issue to the committee again with amended terms of reference.


There has been some comment about the decision of the Senate committee to take up the commenced inquiry of the previous House committee and to conduct their own inquiry, which tabled its report in May this year. It is my view, I have to say, that the critical point we have reached in many states regarding the need for support of TAFE into the future means that the dual inquiries should only be viewed as a positive, as they have allowed multiple opportunities for stakeholders to put forward their issues and their concerns. 


The 172 submissions and transcripts from the previous parliament were brought forward for the current inquiry, and the current committee held 11 hearings and inspections across capital cities and regional areas. I would like to thank the committee for taking up an idea I had to conduct an online survey. This ensured the maximised opportunity to hear directly from students—current and past students as well as those who may plan to study in the future. This was a significant task, and I would particularly like to thank the committee secretariat for their work in undertaking and assessing that survey.


The survey was launched in May and closed at the end of July. It received a total of 6,635 responses, which covered both quantitative and qualitative feedback.


The report title very appropriately identifies that TAFE has a broad social and economic task that is unique to a public provider and that this has made it an important national asset for decades. In the report's introduction it references the Kangan report. The Kangan report underscored the recurrent nature of the themes that recur with TAFE. In 1974, the Kangan report said:


The main purpose of education is the betterment and development of individual people and their contribution to the good of the community. Technical and further education should be planned accordingly. Emphasis on the needs of the individual should lead to easier access to learning, to better physical conditions of learning, to suitable student and teacher amenities, to welfare facilities, and to the highest standards of health and safety in workshops and laboratories.


It went on to say that the demand for education throughout life can be expected to grow, not simply because of changes in technologies and social organisation but also because people will become increasingly aware of the practical advantages that it gives an individual in respect of employment and livelihood. Forty years later, it would be hard to argue that those themes are not as important to communities now as they were in the seventies.


The committee took extensive evidence of the value and trust that many individual learners and employers place in TAFE and heard many examples of situations where TAFE was the critical provider in ensuring, in particular, that thin markets were covered and accessibility and affordability were ensured.


The first identified task in the committee's terms of reference was to consider 'the development of skills in the Australian economy'. The committee concluded:


While the COAG framework broadly recognises the important role of public VET providers, the crucial position and role of TAFE within VET is not explicitly recognised. For the Committee this is integral to the issues raised in the inquiry and is a deficiency that should be rectified. As stated above, it became evident to the Committee over the course of the inquiry that a foundational articulation of the role and function of TAFE is necessary.


The first task was obviously a particularly important one to the committee, and the evidence pointed quite clearly to the need for a nationally recognised agreement on the role of TAFE. This is encompassed, I would argue, very effectively in the first recommendation of the report, which says:


The Australian Government should, through the Council of Australian Governments, make a value statement comprehensively defining the role of TAFE within the VET sector together with its future direction in the competitive training market, from a national perspective.


This statement should recognise that the affordability and accessibility of the training market is underpinned by a strong public sector provider and acknowledges the following functions that TAFE, as a major and significant not-for-profit public provider, can uniquely bring to the VET sector …


It then goes on to outline nine specific, unique contributions that TAFE, as a public provider, makes and that need to be protected. The importance of this recommendation is that it identifies the unique role that TAFE, as the public provider, plays. It begins the task of identifying, from the evidence presented to the inquiry, the efforts that would be lost if TAFE were only required to operate simply as another competitor in a privatised market. I have said before—and I will put it on the record in this debate—that there would be nothing more tragic than for all of us, at all levels of government and across community and industry sectors, to only appreciate the true value of TAFE once it was lost.


The first recommendation calls on the federal government to take responsibility for coordinating an agreed national statement—between federal and state governments—that defines this role and outlines the future direction for TAFE in any competitive market with a view to protecting, if not enhancing, the capacity of TAFE to do the many public-good tasks that we ask of it. It is, therefore, critically important that the minister and the government accept all the recommendations of the committee and urgently seek to implement them.


The second and third terms of reference required an investigation of the pathways that TAFE provides for further education and employment. The survey of students, in particular, contained powerful evidence of the transformative role that TAFE had played in connecting vulnerable learners, or those who needed a second chance at education, with appropriate courses and significant support services. The report contains much evidence directly from students on this issue. This is, in itself, a good reason for many of those listening to take the opportunity to read the report of the committee.


It would be fair to acknowledge that, in many of these submissions, survey responses and direct evidence to the committee, the affordability of TAFE—and more recent changes to fee structures—was consistently raised as a barrier issue for students. This led to recommendation 3, which encourages governments to look at how these price structures might be acting as barriers.


The other persistent theme that came consistently through the evidence was the negative impact of aggressive behaviours by some private providers in the sector who are using unscrupulous marketing and recruitment practices and delivering poor-quality training and assessment. While the private sector was not a referred issue in the terms of reference, the committee did feel that the evidence directly impacted the fourth term relating to the role played by TAFE in 'the operation of a competitive training market'.


This led the committee to recommendation 2, providing options for tightening the content and assessment of national training packages; recommendation 4, supporting strengthening of the role of the regulators; and recommendation 5, where the intention is to be able to identify through an independent source, such as the NCVER, the funding efforts of all governments for the VET sector but TAFE in particular.


TAFE is a highly valued and trusted provider of education and training across all communities and states. Its importance can be seen in the significant place it fills in current debates in pending state elections—in particular, Victoria on Saturday. I am pleased that the Labor shadow minister in Victoria, Steve Herbert, has outlined a strong Labor policy for the election on TAFE, in particular the important task of rebuilding the TAFE system, which has been decimated under the Napthine government. On the weekend the Labor shadow minister in New South Wales, Ryan Park, also outlined a very strong TAFE policy to also take to the next election there.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hawke
):  Order! It being 12.30, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,17,2
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley) (12:30):  Australia has one of the most egalitarian and socially mobile societies in the world and we would not be where we are today, ranked second on the United Nations Human Development Index, if it were not for the hard work that has been put in over the years to build the institutions and the norms which allow the people of Australia to reach their full potential. This, of course, does include constructing a higher education system which allows all Australians, regardless of their background or wealth, the opportunity to attend university. We are now told by the government that we should junk our current model in favour of an American education model and also health model across the board. This government loves American models and they want one here which would replicate the sorts of outcomes we have seen in the United States—a society where over the past 30 years social mobility has gone backwards and where the middle class has been hollowed out because opportunities through higher education have been fewer and fewer for the millions of people in their system. 


I remember our higher education system when it was first introduced in 1974. I was at the University of Queensland and I remember how the feeling on campus changed. I remember how we opened up our higher education system and there was new life in our institutions, which had for too long been dominated by the wealthy elites of our society. I remember how, for the first time, a university education was no longer a dream for ordinary Australians—it would and did become a reality. The changes to higher education in 1974 and again in 1989 changed the cultural mindset of our society, and we reaped the benefits through higher university participation and through that higher economic growth as our society and education systems matured.


Now the Abbott government is attempting to tear down this higher education model and, as I said before, take us down the American road. The Abbott government is attempting to return Australia to the 1960s, when a university education was only there for those who were wealthy, particularly from the North Shore of Sydney. Before the election, Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne promised that there would be no changes to higher education. They said that there were no plans to increase fees and, of course, in the same interview where Mr Abbott promised no cuts to the ABC and SBS, he promised there would be no cuts to education. On Insiders one week before the election, he gave us an absolute assurance there would be no cuts to education. That is not what occurred. It was an absolute assurance and today we stand here with the higher education system $5.8 billion worse off.


The government has also announced plans to slash funding for student places by up to 37 per cent. This means that universities will be forced to increase their fees by as much as 60 per cent for some degrees just to cover the funding cut. They also plan to cut $1.1 billion of funding for Commonwealth supported places and to remove caps on undergraduate fees, thereby allowing universities to charge whatever they like. This will result in many vital degrees like nursing and teaching more than doubling in cost, saddling students with enormous debts that are disproportionate to what they would earn in the years ahead and making it almost impossible for them to pay back these debts and making those occupations very unattractive. 


This is a radical and regressive agenda. Essentially what it boils down to is $100,000 university degrees, which will make students think twice about pursuing a university education, and this will particularly be the case for those from lower-income backgrounds, those who may earn intermittent income—particularly women who might want to take time off to have a child—and so on. It is an incredibly regressive agenda, which will discourage participation, which, after all, lies at the very core of what we must do in our society if we wish to grow and prosper economically.


As Joe Stiglitz pointed out when he was in Australia recently, the United States' system is one in which student debt is now in excess of $1.2 trillion. It is a system which has failed that country and is producing regressive outcomes. So the fight is on. There are those who will stand for a fair Australia, where there is a high degree of social mobility which flows from universal access to quality health and education, and a decent industrial safety net. The battle is still ongoing and it is happening here on the floor of the parliament every day. The Labor Party are going to stand for fairness in our system and we are going to ensure that one more barnacle is scraped off that rotten hull of the Abbott government—that is, the Hockey barnacle—and these university charges with it.
