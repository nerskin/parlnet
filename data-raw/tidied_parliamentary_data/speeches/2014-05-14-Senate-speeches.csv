"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:31):  I continue my speech from yesterday, when I was quoting the coalition's dissenting report. That report reads as though there are many, many unions acting improperly with members' funds but not one employer group, and that members of employer groups have nothing to gain from this legislation. The final sentences highlight that this bill is solely about trashing unions and about seeking to destroy collective bargaining.


I turn to substantive parts of the references committee report—a report that was necessary because of the shortcomings of the recommendation from the legislation committee's report. Many submitters—both employer groups and trade unions—said that even if the recommendations were accepted by the government the legislation would still cause great disruption and harm to the operations and effectiveness of the administration of registered organisations in Australia. This is due to the significant unintended consequences of the bill, and the training and financial burdens imposed by the bill.


The references committee report went to great lengths to incorporate arguments both for and against the bill, and to include arguments from both employer groups and trade unions. It is a report that I believe clearly crushes the arguments for the bill. The report highlights how, in drafting and conceptualising the bill, the Liberal government has fundamentally missed the point about the nature of officials and officers of many registered organisations.


Far from being commercial, for-profit companies, these are membership organisations that survive on the work of volunteers. I highlight comments from the Australian Industry Group regarding the proposed material personal interest requirements of the bill. They said: 


The provisions of the Bill in this area will operate very unfairly on registered employer organisations and their officer, and it is essential that the Bill is amended. The Bill would impose a far more onerous regime for officers of registered organisations than what applies to directors of public companies. The regime, if enacted, would undoubtedly deter persons from standing for office in employer organisations. In practice the provisions of the Bill would seriously impede many organisations from carrying on their daily business operations.


The ACTU reiterated this concern, from the perspective of trade unions, in its submission. It said that the committee should be cognisant of the fact that the burden of this regulation falls not just on the full-time salaried leadership of unions but on many rank-and-file members who are elected as unpaid delegates to governing bodies, which may meet as infrequently as once a year or once every two years.


If registered organisations cannot get members to fill the various office and delegate roles required for their organisations to function appropriately, then what happens to these organisations? They will die a slow death, and the Australian community will be worse off.


The report also highlighted evidence from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation that the minute-keeping requirements of this bill were too onerous. The evidence was:


While organisations do keep extensive records of their meetings, it is often the case that they deal with sensitive and confidential issues and do so under an agreement that such matters remain “in house”. Examples of this are in dealing with an organisation’s employees, industrial strategy and commercial issues.


A blanket requirement to record minutes, and for such records to be made public, will only foster and encourage a lack of transparency as organisations respond to this requirement with more “off the record” discussions and more informality and consequently reduced accountability when dealing with issues that are considered sensitive or confidential.


I felt that the ANMF hit the nail on the head with this evidence.


The requirements in this bill around the management of registered organisations are too rigid and impractical. With regard to the training of officials, this bill would impose upon registered organisations a requirement to have their training recertified by the new commissioner, even if their training has been approved by the current Fair Work Commission. The Ai Group raised that they had already spent significant resources on developing a training program required under the 2012 changes. They submitted:


For example, there are four organisations—us, the ACTU, the AWU and one other organisation which I cannot recall—that put huge resources into having their officer training programs developed and approved. There is nothing in this legislation that grants automatic approval for those training courses. We have got to again run the gauntlet with the Registered Organisations Commission.


Talk about increasing red tape for business.


Of course, there are always loopholes available, and it was interesting that the ACTU said:


… that the passage of the bill could result in many employer organisations deregistering as registered organisations and instead, adopting corporate structures. By forming companies limited by guarantees, the organisations could then avoid the disclosure, training and oversight provisions of the bill.


So on one hand this bill will severely damage the effectiveness of trade unions but on the other hand provide an out for employer groups to actually become more secretive and more exclusive than they already are. Maybe that is the real reason for this bill.


The report also highlights that the penalties under the Registered Organisations Act were tripled in 2012, and that these penalties are sufficient to act as a disincentive. The report notes that the bill has been drafted in such a way that the new serious contravention category actually has a circular definition—that is, the definition of 'serious contravention' includes a contravention of the act that is 'serious'. Of course, no definition of 'serious' is provided, creating an ambiguous definition to allow the commissioner to apply a serious contravention whenever he or she chooses.


Further, given the different functions of corporations from registered organisations, the attempt to copy the serious contravention provision from the Corporations Act is totally flawed. As evidenced in recent months, criminal law is able to prosecute wrongdoing. The actions of the few should not be used as an excuse to enact draconian measures for registered organisations and their membership.


I repeat that I do not condone officers of registered organisations, or anyone in a position of trust, acting inappropriately, misusing trusted funds or taking benefits when they are not entitled to. The reforms by the previous government are sufficient to improve accountability of trade unions and employer groups, and this has been clearly demonstrated over recent times. I urge senators to vote against this bill.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:38):  In rising to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013 I would like to make one thing quite clear: this is a bill designed to silence unions. It is a bill designed to impose so many bureaucratic reporting requirements on unions that they have barely enough time to focus on their core business, and that is representing and defending the rights of workers.


When John Howard was Prime Minister, savage dogs and security people were on the docks. This government has decided to employ more subtle means of breaking the unions. But make no mistake about it: when the Liberal-National coalition is in government they will do all they can to attack the union movement. They will attack unions because the union movement is standing in the way of their ultimate ideological goal: stripping the rights and conditions of Australian workers.


This is a government led by an ideological Prime Minister with an historical grudge. He is continuing to fight a workplace relations battle that was comprehensively won in 2007, and this time he is fighting it by stealth and subterfuge. Instead of taking the union's head-on he is going to do it under the guise of tackling misconduct and corruption. And if you think Mr Abbott has abandoned WorkChoices, let us recall that in 2008 he said:


… it was good for wages, it was good for jobs and it was good for workers. And let’s never forget that.


That is his quote.


In 2009 he said:


… workplace reform was one of the greatest achievements of the Howard government.


That is what this bill is really all about. It is about crippling the union movement with burdensome regulation so they lack the ability to fight against the Abbott government's ideologically-driven workplace reform.


The bill that is now before the Senate is a broken promise. Once again, we see a coalition that says one thing in opposition and does another in government. The Abbott government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations, and now they have broken that promise. This bill places more onerous reporting requirements and higher penalties on officers of registered organisations than those imposed on company directors.


For example, corporations face a late fee from ASIC of $299 if their annual reports are lodged more than a month late. Yet this bill seeks to impose penalties of up to $85,000 if a registered organisation fails to lodge their annual report within the required time. The bill sets higher penalties for officers of registered organisations for a number of other breaches, such as noncriminal breach of good faith obligations, noncriminal misuse of position and noncriminal misuse of information.


For those who believed the Prime Minister when he said he would not touch workplace relations and when he said he would not reintroduce WorkChoices, just look at the trail of broken promises he has left behind so far. And just look at the ideological campaign that is being waged against unions right now, with this bill as a weapon, and you will see where the Abbott government stands on the interests of workers.


Those opposite like to pretend that this bill is about standing up for union members, but how can you stand up for union members if you mute the organisations that are supposed to represent them and fight for their rights? I want to make clear that this is not a debate about whether union corruption is acceptable. I and the rest of my colleagues in the Labor Party not only opposes corruption, we abhor it and have zero tolerance for it. Officers of registered organisations, just like directors of companies, are placed in a positions of trust and responsibility, to provide for the interests of their members—just as company directors are to act in the interests of their shareholders. Anyone who engages in corrupt behaviour, who is put in a position of responsibility and authority and abuses that authority for their own personal benefit, must be prosecuted with the full force of the law. I hope that the government is fervently opposed to all corruption, despite the fact that they seem to have an obsession with focussing on corruption in one particular sector—that is, the union movement.


But let us not pretend either, as those opposite would have us believe, that this is a debate about who is serious about tackling corruption. If the government cannot get this bill—this ideological instrument—through this place, then they will, at the very least, use it as some kind of political tool to claim that those of us on this side are not serious about tackling corruption in the union movement. We are serious about tackling corruption and misconduct, and we have demonstrated our seriousness through the legislation we passed in government in 2012.


In fact, Labor introduced stronger accountability measures and tougher penalties for misconduct in registered organisations than those introduced by the current Prime Minister when he was Minister for Workplace Relations in 2002. And do not forget, it was Labor in government that forced the Health Services Union into administration.


The conduct that those opposite claim they are targeting is already prohibited in the Registered Organisations Act. The act already prohibits members' money from being used to favour candidates in internal elections. It allows for criminal proceedings when funds are stolen or obtained by fraud, and ensures the Fair Work Commission can share information with police. There are statutory civil penalties in the act for parties who knowingly or recklessly contravene an order or direction made by the Fair Work Commission or Federal Court. Officers of registered organisations have fiduciary duties similar to those of company directors, and are required to disclose their personal interests. In trying to justify this bill, the government point to instances of alleged corruption that are being dealt with effectively by the current provisions.


If those opposite were really serious about tackling corruption and misconduct, then they would do so across the board. Despite the hundreds of prosecutions brought by ASIC each year against company directors, despite all the material that has been dealt with by ICAC in New South Wales, we do not hear a peep out of this government about corruption and misconduct in the corporate sector. Yet if you listened to the rhetoric of the coalition over the past several years, you would think that corruption and misconduct is entirely confined to unions.


The challenge for the government in prosecuting the case for the bill is this: explain to the Senate how and why the system that is in place already is not working; explain to the Senate how this bill will improve the system in any meaningful way; and explain to the Senate how you justify the enormous regulatory cost that you are seeking to impose on the very organisations whose members you claim to be protecting. They have failed to do this in the House, and I doubt they will succeed here. This is a poorly constructed piece of legislation. Not only is it poorly constructed, but its sole purpose is the pursuit of an ideological crusade—although I would consider it is more like the stuff of the sheriff of Nottingham than of Robin Hood.


As I said before, this bill imposes more onerous requirements on the officers of registered organisations than those which company directors are subject to. Why won't the government support the same onerous reporting requirements, the same steep penalties, for corporations and their directors as they do for registered organisations? If they are going to claim that by opposing this bill we are not serious about tackling union corruption then, surely, by their own standards they are not serious about tackling corruption in the corporate sector. 


Of course, this is the government that apparently is all about cutting red tape and letting businesses get on with business. But they are not interested in letting unions get on with their business. Instead, they want to drown them in regulatory requirements so they cannot get on with their core business—representing workers. That is what the coalition's mates in big business want them to do. If they cannot bring Work Choices back, then they will at least have a go at breaking the back of the union movement.


Business is often regarded by those opposite as their natural friends, but has the Abbott government considered how employer organisations feel about this regulatory approach? Employer organisations are, after all, registered organisations who would be subject to the same requirements as employee organisations under this bill. Perhaps the Abbott government is so hell-bent on this ideological crusade that they are happy to sacrifice employer organisations in the process. Perhaps they consider weighing down employer organisations with the same regulatory burden to be worth the collateral damage. Perhaps to them this is the cost of winning their ideological war against unions.


Well, these organisations obviously do not like it any more than employee organisations do. The Australian Industry Group made the point that directors of companies are typically small in number and well-remunerated for their role in returning a value on shareholders' investments, whereas registered organisations, being not-for-profit entities, typically have many elected officials and committee members who are unpaid. The Ai Group, for example, has 78 volunteer councillors deemed officers under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, who give up a great deal of their time working on the policy and financial management of the group while also trying to run their own companies. I know this is also the case for many other registered organisations including unions and yet the bill imposes excessive reporting requirements on these unpaid volunteers. 


One such requirement is the obligation to disclose their material personal interests, including those of relatives, to every member of the organisation and the penalty for breaching this requirement is over $1 million—I think that in fact it is $1,020,000. By contrast, under the Corporations Act, company directors only have to disclose their material interests to the other directors and only those interests that relate to the affairs of the company. Let me just reiterate that. One requirement is the obligation on one group to disclose material personal interests including those of relatives to every member of the organisation and the penalty for breaching that requirement is around $1 million. By contrast, under the Corporations Act, company directors only have to disclose their material interests to other directors and only those interests that relate to the affairs of the company. Here is what the Australian Industry Group said in their submission in relation to the disclosure of material personal interest:


The provisions of this Bill in this area will operate very unfairly on registered employer organisations and their officers, and it is essential that the Bill is amended. The Bill would impose a far more onerous regime for officers of registered organisations than what applies to directors of public companies. The regime, if enacted, would undoubtedly deter persons from standing for office in employer organisations. In practice the provisions of the Bill would seriously impede many organisations from carrying on their daily business operations.


That was from the Australian Industry Group in their submission to the Senate inquiry.


Will just drop this year and then I can work on I would like to compliment the Ai Group on what is a very comprehensive and well-thought-out submission, which points out the many flaws in this bill. Concerns about the regulatory burden this bill will place on registered organisations have been echoed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and several other employer organisations, including the Master Builders Australia and the Pharmacy Guild.


By introducing these onerous reporting requirements, the government is not just imposing costs on unions but is imposing costs on the whole workplace relations system. Of course, the government must have known that these concerns were going to be brought up. Maybe that is why they were in such a hurry to rush this bill through.


Many employer organisations, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have raised concerns about the lack of time they have had to review the legislation and lodge a considered submission. Surely it would send a clear message to this government, when both employer and employee organisations are united in their stance on this bill, that something is seriously wrong with it?


While looking through the second reading speeches to this bill in the other place, I think the member for Moreton made an interesting point—that the increased compliance costs resulting from this bill could be passed on to the members of registered organisations. In the case of unions these could include low-paid employees, such as retail workers, or cleaners, or childcare workers or aged care workers. Far be it from those opposite to care about low-paid workers, but many employer organisations that represent small businesses may also be forced to pass these costs onto their members, resulting in increased costs for small business. Of course, we know that if that happens that cost will be passed on to consumers.


I doubt the government, on the other side of this chamber, who trumpet their business credentials and their war on red tape, have considered the cost burden this legislation could potentially have on small businesses. You would think this is exactly the kind of legislation that the government would include in one of their 'red tape repeal days'. But then this government really only pays lip service to repealing red tape. Not only are they not serious about reducing red tape they are intent on using red tape as a weapon.


Labor will oppose this legislation, and we have many good reasons to do so. We already have a very good regime in place for ensuring the accountability of officers of registered organisations, including reasonable penalties for failing to meet their duties to their members As a number of submitters have pointed out, it is this rushed legislation that is causing problems. The government's royal commission into the trade union movement will be making recommendations about the regulation and governance of registered organisations, so why not wait for those findings? Is it because this bill is a stunt?


This is the same stunt the government pulled in opposition when Senator Abetz introduced a similar bill. I remember when I spoke on that bill: I described it as a 'solution looking for a problem'. The bill that is currently before the Senate is no different.


This is not just Labor's view, or the view of the union movement, and I point again to the Australian Industry Group's submission which said:


It is a transparently political Bill in an area where there is no extant public policy problem.


Unfortunately, what the government has demonstrated with their royal commission is that they are willing to spend millions of dollars in pursuit of their political witch hunt. They will spend millions of dollars in taxpayers funds while also imposing millions of dollars of costs on registered organisations, including employee and employer associations.


Why does this government insist on attacking unions? Because they want to silence the voices of those opposed to their real agenda, which is bringing back WorkChoices. If the government wants to introduce serious, adult, measures to combat misconduct and corruption, Labor will support them. However, Labor will not support childish stunts, we will not support a political witch-hunt and we will not support unnecessary regulation and red tape. And we will not support actions designed to cripple and silence the union movement.


For these reasons, Labor opposes this bill.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-05-14,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (09:54):  It is deja vu. It is Groundhog Day. Here we are again, and yet again we are pulling out our speeches—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Bilyk, I am glad you referred to an earlier speech you made on very similar legislation. Anyway, I rise to speak to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013, a bill for an act to amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 and for related purposes. This was the coalition election policy. We were very clear. Senator Bilyk, you made comments about rushed pieces of legislation. This piece of legislation was like a train coming across—through you, Chair—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator McKenzie, you cannot address senators directly—do so through the chair—and interjections are disorderly, Senator Bilyk.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Like a freight train across the Nullarbor, you could have seen this particular piece of legislation coming for miles—for days, for weeks, for months, for nigh on a year. This was part of our agenda to ensure accountability and transparency with registered organisations. It is not an ideological attack on the union movement, as those opposite would like us to believe. It is actually for all of us—for the community—to be assured that employer organisations, workers' organisations and indeed any registered organisations ensure that the dues paid by the members to those organisations are used in a responsible matter and that the governing arrangements for those organisations give confidence to those members that they are being taken care of in an appropriate manner.


Briefly, the policy applies the same rules to unions and officials as for companies and their directors. Given the amount of money that some of these organisations are in charge of, and given the importance of a lot of the advocacy work that they are involved in, that should be the least of the regulations that they should be subject to. It ensures penalties for breaking the rules are the same for everyone, as are disclosure requirements. In addition, the policy calls for a new body, the Registered Organisations Commission, to take on the enforcement and investigation roles currently held by the Fair Work Commission. The new commission would also provide information and advice to registered organisations about their rights and obligations under the law.


We have a clear mandate for this legislation. Specifically, the bill responds to a number of outstanding recommendations from the June 2012 review into the operation of the Fair Work Act by the Fair Work Review Panel. I speak on this bill as a member—and, at the time of the inquiry, acting chair—of the Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which inquired into the bill and reported to the Senate in 2013. In the legislation committee report, the committee supported the bill subject to four minor amendments. Firstly:


The Committee recommends that, consistent with the Corporations Act 2001, material personal interest disclosures should only be required to be made to those officers whose duties relate to the financial management of the organisation. Such disclosures should be recorded in the minutes of the meetings of those officers and should be made available to members on request.


I am surprised that the opposition is not supporting this amendment, given that it ensures that the shareholdings of husbands and wives of union representatives are not open for disclosure. It ensures that only those who are dealing directly with the financial management of the organisation are subject to the same disclosure rules as under the Corporations Act. Secondly:


The Committee recommends that a list of exclusions from the obligations to disclose material personal interests based on section 191(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 be inserted into the bill. This would narrow the obligation to disclose material personal interests …


Thirdly:


The Committee recommends that the obligation placed on officers to disclose every payment should be reduced with certain exclusions …


Fourthly and finally:


The Committee recommends the bill be amended to allow the Commissioner to grant exemptions from the training requirements if an individual can demonstrate significant knowledge of the financial obligations specified in the bill.


This is because, despite the policies of various Labor state governments and the TAFE regime, there is no point training people for the sake of training people. I know the training obligations and the money they can raise from training their members are a great money-spinner for many of the registered organisations, but if you already have the training there is no reason for you to undergo that again.


Predictably, for a bill which would make unions more accountable, Labor senators produced a dissenting report opposing the bill in its entirety. I think that was in December 2013. What was less predictable was Labor's decision to refer the bill to the Education and Employment References Committee, which of course they control.


Referring the bill for a second inquiry was a highly unusual tactic. In fact, it has not been used since August 1996 when, again, Labor referred another piece industrial relations legislation, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 to the Senate Economics Reference Committee. So much for the bleating about ideology. Politics is the battle of ideas; on this side, ideas centred around freedom, transparency and accountability. And on the other side, as Senator Cameron made reference to in his contribution on this piece of legislation yesterday: 'There is nothing wrong with it—leave it as it is. There is no problem.' Clearly, that is not what we found in our inquiry. That was not the evidence given to the committee and it was not the evidence given to the coalition during the construction of our policy around this matter. It just shows how desperate Labor is to appease its union mates and masters.


The reference committee essentially replicated the work of the legislative committee. The only difference is that this time it was a Labor majority report, with a dissenting report from coalition senators. Our dissenting report flatly rejected the need for a second inquiry. The new inquiry held just one hearing for which just three unions and one employer organisation turned up. What a waste of time, paper, energy, Senate resources and money! But how typical of Labor.


Senators on this side of the chamber firmly support the government taking strong action to ensure all registered organisations are accountable. Has Labor learnt nothing from the HSU scandal? The fact that it took Fair Work Australia four long years to complete its investigation into the HSU demonstrates the need for a separate Registered Organisations Commission, as set out in this bill.


It is now very clear that HSU was just the tip of the iceberg. The Fair Work Commission has recently launched proceedings against the Musicians Union of Australia, and currently has inquiries or investigations into the Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union, the Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation, the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia, the Flight Attendants' Association of Australia, the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, Australian Nursing Federation and the Australian Childcare Centres Association.


We have also just seen the start of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. I would encourage Labor Senators who think that all is well with the union movement and that this bit of legislation is not required to please log on to www.trade union royal commission.gov.au, and tor those Twitter aficionados amongst as it is #turc, if they want to follow what is actually going on at the royal commission into the trade union movement and governance. Find some evidence of why this bit of legislation is required now.


The bill before the Senate is not about union bashing. It is about protecting workers from union officials who do the wrong thing—and they do exist. Not all; not the majority. But they do exist. The majority of union officials are honest and dedicated to the welfare of their members, and thus have nothing to fear from this bill. In fact, by clearing up the governance issues in registered organisations unions should become stronger as they regain the lost trust of workers and, indeed, the wider Australian public about their important role in our civic life. It is hard to understand why any Labor senator would have a problem with tackling corruption.


While current Labor politicians are more than shy about criticising unions, Labor figures of the past have been much more forthcoming. Former Labor powerbroker, Graham Richardson, wrote a column in The Australian of 31 January 2014, titled, 'Labor needs to re-examine its ties with the unions'.


Labor must assert the primacy of its own position over the trade unions. If it is seen again to slavishly follow the union line, it will give an already well-endowed Prime Minister even more grist for his mill.


Unfortunately for Labor, for workers and for the union movement more generally, that message is not getting through to Labor in this building.


Labor Senators cited as their main reason to oppose the bill, disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations. Yet these issues arise courtesy of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012, introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten. When introducing the bill, Mr Shorten said:


Under the amendments proposed by the government—


the then government—


registered organisations will be required to amend their rules to provide for the disclosure of transactions between the organisation and related parties, which may include the family members of officials.


Labor was happy to support disclosure when it was in government, but now it is against it now it is in opposition. What hypocrisy. Labor senators should really be more supportive of their leader. Mr Shorten was very close to the top of the Gillard government. He not only helped install Ms Gillard, he was so close to her that he agreed with everything she said even when he had no idea what she had said. Mr Shorten had the Prime Minister's back—that is, until he stabbed her in the back.


Edmund Burke said:


Hypocrisy can afford to be magnificent in its promises, for never intending to go beyond promise, it costs nothing.


Labor's hypocrisy on this bill is similar to Labor now voting against budget saving measures that Labor brought to parliament and took to the last election. Last year Labor proposed $2.3 billion of savings. These came from an efficiency dividend on universities, a cut to scholarships and other higher education changes. In February last year the Gillard government announced savings of $1.1 billion as a result of research and development tax changes. But now Labor is blocking both of these pieces of legislation—both previous Labor plans. Labor sees no conflict in voting against its own policies, none at all. Indeed, it expects us to vote against our own policies, policies that we were very, very clear on prior to the election, that were part of the mandate that Australian people gave the Abbott government.


So why are Labor senators so reluctant to hold trade unions to account? I think that is a very, very good question. I have done a bit of homework; I have a few stats I would like to share with the chamber. Maybe one of the reasons could be that 19 out of the 31 ALP senators are former union officials or union bosses. Nine of them were union bosses, 10 of them were union officials. Senator Bilyk, who we just heard from before, the Australian Services Union; Senator Bishop, Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees union boss; Senator Cameron, passionate defence of the union movement yesterday, AMWU union boss; Senator Collins, SDA union official; Senator Conroy, Transport Workers Union official; Senator Dastyari, ALP boss right there; Senator Farrell, another shoppie union boss; Senator Furner, the National Union of Workers union boss; Senator Gallagher, Transport Workers Union boss; Senator Hogg, our President, a Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees union official; Senator Lines, United Voice, and what a voice it is, union boss; Senator Ludwig, Australian Workers Union union official; Senator Lundy, CFMEU union official; Senator Marshall, the ETU union official; Senator McEwen, the Australian Services Union boss; Senator Moore, CPSU union boss; Senator Singh, Australian Education Union official; Senator Sterle, Transport Workers Union official; Senator Urquhart, Australian Manufacturing Workers Union boss; Senator Wong, CFMEU union official. But wait, there is more! Come 1 July these senators will be joined by Senator Joe Bullock, SDA union boss, and Senator Chris Ketter, SDA union boss.


And what do they all have to hide? The community expectation is that these unions must operate to the highest of standards. These organisations are given special legislated rights, and with rights come responsibilities. The Craig Thomson affair showed that these responsibilities are not being met under the current arrangements. Mr Thomson was arrested in respect of more than 154 fraud related criminal charges and is facing allegations that his 2007 federal election campaign was partly funded by siphoning union money without authorisation. The union that Mr Thomson was ripping off represents some of the lowest paid workers in Australia, and it is outrageous that the union contributions of these low-paid workers were used to fund the seedy high life of a man who was supposed to be fighting on their behalf. It is outrageous that it took four years for justice to be done. It is outrageous that Labor senators think it is okay to maintain the status quo.


To improve oversight of registered organisations, the bill will establish a dedicated independent watchdog, the registered organisations commission, and provide it with enhanced investigation and information-gathering powers to monitor and regulate registered organisations. The new commission will have the necessary independence and the powers it needs to regulate registered organisations effectively, efficiently and transparently. The commission will have stronger investigation and information-gathering powers than those that currently apply. They will be modelled on those available to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The commission will also educate, assist and advise registered organisations and their members in relation to the new obligations, and ensure members are aware of their rights. The activities of the commission will also be subject to the same oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman as Commonwealth agencies. This will ensure the appropriate level of transparency and public accountability.


As well as establishing a strong, independent regulator, the bill introduces reporting and disclosure requirements, and enhanced penalties for wrongdoing. Many unions control assets worth millions of dollars. In financial terms they operate in a similar way to a large business, so it is appropriate for them to have similar reporting requirements. And I note that in his contribution yesterday, Senator Cameron was very keen to use the word 'volunteer', as if somehow we were talking kindergarten committees or football/netball clubs in the way that unions were being run. But I am very, very confident about this, having actually presided over a student association many years ago which had a turnover of $17 million. I know that many of the people involved in that organisation were not solely volunteers, and I know that throughout the unions there are some very significant salaries within the government structure of the union movement. They should be subject to more stringent accountability measures. Than the local kindergarten committee is.


The only people who have anything to fear are those who are doing the wrong thing. The overwhelming number of officers who are already doing the right thing should be comforted in knowing that unlawful behaviour will be dealt with, thus ensuring ongoing member confidence in registered organisations as a whole. There should be no difference between the penalties levied against a company director who misuses shareholders' funds and a union boss who misuses members' money. I do not know why that is a point of contention.


Any political party that refuses to support this greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations is voting to give the green light to more of the same behaviour that we have seen from some executives of the HSU. It is time for Labor senators to choose which side they are on. Are you on the side of Craig Thomson or are you on the side of the workers? I think the misuse of the committee process by Labor, particularly around this and the other amendment to the Fair Work Act is a disgrace, because all they are doing is using the very limited resources of the Senate basically to prosecute what is an ideological argument.


It will ever be thus, and when Senator Bilyk wants to talk about 'ideological crusades', the Labor Party and Greens, their partners in crime, have been on an ideological crusade for six years. And whenever you want to call them out on their ideological crusade; whenever you actually want to inject some accountability and transparency into workplace relations; and whenever you want to talk about the reality of operating a small business in regional areas and of penalty rates for young people, they pull out the Work Choices wildcard. It is the 'press button in case of emergency/smash glass'; it is as if this spectre of Work Choices will actually make up for the negligence that those opposite have wreaked upon the Australian economy and upon the potential job prospects of young Australians and the stability of our budgetary position over coming decades.


I am very proud of our government in that whilst it was not of our making, we have actually taken strong steps this week to address the inherent issues of the Labor malaise.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (10:14):  Senator McKenzie, I could not let you go without thinking to myself, quietly, 'I hear the social agrarian that you in fact are when you talk about trade unions with such distaste.' I find the juxtaposition of where you sit in the social agrarian National Party and where I sit in trade unions somewhat novel to look at. But, nonetheless, you are entitled to have your views.


I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. The Australian people were promised a mature, responsible government. We were promised a government that would be run by adults under the coalition. That promise has proved to be just one of the many broken promises that litter the corridors of the Ministerial Wing of this building today. The Abbott government's pre-election promises have all gone up in a puff of cigar smoke and the way this legislation has been handled, quite frankly, is no different. Just as Mr Tony Abbott's budget is a budget of broken promises, this legislation is completely full of hypocrisy. The legislation before the chamber can only be described as being politically motivated in the extreme. It is unnecessary, and I will not be supporting it or the way government has managed this bill in this place. It is in fact a piece of scrambled legislation that they have cobbled together as, you could only say, an extreme attack on trade unions per se. The legislation is a thinly-veiled attack on trade unions and, by extension, their members. Unions work incredibly hard to represent the best interests of their members. They have a role to play in the modern Australian economy and workforce, and I think that in itself is what the Liberal Party and the Liberals on the other side find almost impossible to accept. 


The government has not properly explained the case for change for this legislation. They have failed to make the case that the existing legislation should be changed in this extreme way. Registered organisations should be responsibly regulated, and I do not think that anyone would cavil at that statement. Labor supports the act in its current state. Why? Because it gets the balance right. It strikes the right balance between good legislation, how you properly regulate registered organisations and how you should ensure that you do not take it to the extreme to punish registered organisations. 


The law at present already does the following: registered organisations already prohibit members' money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns; the Registered Organisations Act already allows for criminal proceedings being initiated where funds are stolen or are obtained by fraud; the Registered Organisations Act already ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police, as is appropriate; and the Registered Organisations Act already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the Federal Court or the Fair Work Commission under the Registered Organisations Act or the Fair Work Act. The current legislation is pretty tough, can I say, in the way that it currently works.


Under the Fair Work Act officers of registered organisations already have a fiduciary duty akin to that for directors under the Corporations Law. The Registered Organisations Act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests. The Registered Organisations Act already requires officers to disclose when payments are made to related parties. And it does not stop there. The Registered Organisations Act already requires officers to exercise care and diligence and act with good faith. All of these put an incredible onus and responsibility on trade unions to act appropriately and conduct their affairs in an open and transparent way on behalf of their members.


As the dissenting report of the committee's inquiry into the bill noted, the current Registered Organisations Act already addresses the proposals of the bill to the appropriate extent. It prohibits money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections and gives priority to the determination of criminal proceedings, for example, where it is alleged that funds have been stolen or obtained by fraud, and ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police, as appropriate.


As has already been noted by the speakers on this side on this bill, these changes are aimed solely at hindering the efforts of trade unions to effectively represent their members in the workplace. When you look at the present legislation and at where these changes want to go, you can be left in no doubt that it is all about simply making it almost impossible for unions to operate effectively in the workplace and an unveiled attack on trade unions by this government. Why? Those on the other side have a long hatred of unions, and it manifests itself whenever they get their head. When they had the ability to pass legislation in this place from 2004 onwards, what did they do? They attacked unions and their members through Work Choices. Unfettered, they then went to the extreme, as is always the case. In this instance, they took a piece of legislation that was suitable and matched to fit registered organisations, and they have taken it to the extreme again. Why? As I said, the only reason left is their unbridled hatred of trade unions.


When you look at one particular aspect of the bill that represents significant overreach by a government full of twisted priorities and full of surprises, you can see it come through. The expansion of coercive investigatory powers is hidden within this bill. The legislation as it stands provides coercive powers in relation to current and former officers, employees or auditors of an organisation. The amendment legislation extends the powers in such a way as to reach any person the commission identifies as potentially holding information or evidence of relation. This will give the commissioner significant new powers to compel evidence, execute warrants and seize documents from any person. This can only be described as a significant overreach.


It was not something the coalition canvassed with the public before the last election. What they want to be able to do is give powers to the commissioners which are unprecedented in a broad sense—more than what you would expect for a body that is there to ensure registered organisations act within the law. Why? They want to have unfettered access to be able to attack trade unions using this piece of legislation shamelessly. Of course, the overreach is not hidden in that sense. They do put it in their legislation and they do encourage the commission to use all of the powers that are available to it to attack trade unions—and I suspect it would.


One of the novelties, if there is a novelty within this piece of legislation, is the extraordinary hypocrisy about red tape. We all know that this government is about removing red tape. They have set up—I do not know what they call it—a red tape task force to go around in departments, find red tape and destroy it where they can. This is one of the hypocritical issues that have come forward, which can also be described as a broken promise.


Mr Daniel Mammone, the workplace policy and legal affairs director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, gave this evidence in the Senate inquiry in response to a searching question from Senator Tillem:



Senator TILLEM: Would you agree with the statement that, further, the requirements of this bill add another layer of red tape for those organisations that you deal with and got feedback from? Is that a fair statement?



Mr Mammone: There are elements that compound the existing problems, yes.


This is clear evidence that the government's only plans are for twisted priorities and broken promises, because in this instance they want to add red tape and ensure that they surround trade unions with a substantial amount of red tape. Why? Because of their unbridled hatred of the operation of trade unions, the way they look after their members and the way they operate within the industrial sphere. The government are willing, in this instance, to breach and break one of their promises of removing red tape for what can only be described as a political end. It is simply a twisted priority when you juxtapose it. As Senator Bilyk noted, they would happily sacrifice a business to put impediments on the operation of trade unions. They are even willing to go that little extra step and say: 'We won't worry too much about business in this instance. Businesses are in the way of our target. They might be called collateral damage—too bad, so sad. We are willing to sacrifice those principles and sacrifice small business to achieve our aim of attacking trade unions.'


The Liberals have proved themselves to be the poorest managers of this chamber since I have been here. I cannot speak for before then, but when you look at the way this bill has been dealt with, the incompetence has not been limited to the operation of government business and the programs of this place. It really has extended across the entirety of this government when you look at how they are managing this legislative program. 


The budget is a betrayal of working people and it truly is a slap in the face to the people who voted for this government, because what are we dealing with today? We are dealing with one of their twisted priorities. We are dealing with registered industrial organisations. It is not about the budget, it is not about issues that go to the budget; what they really want to talk about are their twisted priorities around how to attack trade unions. The budget process to date has been farcical, and the extraordinary damage they are now inflicting on families is quite unbelievable. We witnessed the most chaotically mishandled and sieve-like budget since John Howard's 1980 budget, which was leaked in full to Laurie Oakes.


I suspect we have already got a government in revolt, with a backbench treated like mushrooms and a Prime Minister and Treasurer breaking election promise after election promise. Above all, I think this budget has been—as Dr Chalmers from the other place called it—an ambush on the Australian people, particularly on working people, and this piece of legislation is just another attack on working people. It attacks industrial organisations which represent their members—Australian working people—in the workplace. It highlights their priorities around who they have in their target: working people and trade unions who represent working people.


This is a budget written by the cigar chompers and borne by hardworking Australians. While lower- and middle-income earners are being sent to the wall, the big end of town are getting off scot-free. Their attack on working people contained in this bill is replicated in their attacks in the budget, and you do not have to go far into it to hear it. A GP tax, increasing the petrol tax, cuts to the pension, education, students with disabilities and young apprentice support—all broken promises, all attacks on hardworking Australians, and it is reflected here. 


I would go so far as to say that this registered industrial organisation bill today has at its heart the way the Liberal Party addresses working people. They do not like trade unions, they do not like working people and they do not like those who need support in the electorate. Labor does not support a tax on working people or their representatives. Unions work hard for their members' interests in the workplace, and you do not have to go far to find how bad this piece of legislation is. 


The Australian Council of Trade Unions, in its submission to the Senate committee inquiry, expressed the view that this bill is 'poorly conceived, badly motivated, entirely unnecessary and transparently political in an area where there is no extant public policy problem.' I think they have said it all in one sentence, quite frankly. The ACTU's analysis and conclusions about many of the requirements and penalties in this bill are similar to the AIG's. 


In the workplace we have a confluence of interests—industrial organisations, trade unions and employer organisations—who all think this legislation is bad. It is atrocious in the extreme. It even goes to areas which I think make you wonder about their priorities. If you look at the coercive powers in the investigatory area, they have given greater powers and taken away use and derivative use immunity. You could juxtapose that with what a former senator of this place, Senator Cooney, said. I hope I have got this right; I am happy to correct it. He once said that what you are doing is giving more power to people to look into, in this instance, trade unions or registered industrial organisations, than you give to the police to look at people who have been murderers, people who have done some heinous deeds in the criminal sphere. Why is that? To be able to justify it you do need to put down quite clearly what those justifications are and why we should accept them. I do not think, in this instance, the case has been made for this extreme use of powers plus the removal of the privilege against self-incrimination for use and derivative use immunities. In fact, derivative use immunity is, as I understand it, gone. 


Turning to other provisions in this legislation, of course they will have to fund it. I think it highlights their twisted priorities where they are going to fund an attack on registered industrial organisations whilst at the same time, for companies, it is quite interesting. The argument goes something like this: registered industrial organisations should be treated like companies. I think that is a poor argument and does not reflect the truth of how industrial organisations work and how they are comprised. But whilst you are strengthening these powers to attack trade unions, today we find out from the budget that you are removing approximately $120 million from ASIC so that they will not be able to perform their tasks in pursuing companies and the like for the work that they do—which has been and always is good work. But that is where you find their priorities. 'We'll ensure that ASIC cannot do its job. We'll take $120 million out of them over four years to make sure they cannot do their proper functions of keeping big corporations in check, making sure that companies do have a good investigative arm on their case. In this instance, though, we're going to support a tough piece of legislation to attack trade unions but ultimately we are going to say that companies and trade unions from your perspective should be treated the same.' How hypocritical. You are entirely hypocritical in that argument. It falls flat when you look at how you are going to pull the rug out from under ASIC and bolster your attack on trade unions. I commend the submission to the Senate. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (10:34):  I too rise to make my contribution to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. I think it is amazing to sit here when we go on a union-bashing exercise. It is absolutely gobsmacking to hear some of the contributions from those opposite. I did not hear it but I am told that, to use up some of the Senate's valuable time, Senator McKenzie went on a tirade about those of us on this side of the chamber—our backgrounds or what union affiliation we have. As I said, I did not hear it; I was sorting out my sock drawer when she was making her contribution. 


I just want to clarify a few things. Do I have a conflict of interest with this ridiculous amendment that is before the chamber? If I can be accused of being a lifelong member of the Transport Workers Union and having been awarded life membership of the Transport Workers Union, yes, I have a conflict of interest. If I am accused of being a truck driver, not a university-graduated person who just wanted to get into politics and went to work for a member of parliament or a Liberal law firm—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Apparatchik.




Senator STERLE:
  I am not one of those, I can tell you. I can be accused of a lot of things but that is not one of them. I have actually been a blue-collar worker. I joined the Transport Workers Union in 1980 when I was 20 years of age because I wanted to join the Transport Workers Union. Do I have a lot of friends in the union movement? Yes, I do. There are a lot of good people in the union movement, both office holders and rank and file members—my oath. But when I am told that an opposition senator thinks it is clever to wrap us all up as—my words, not hers—'operatives for unions', they really need to do their homework. I am proud to say that my wife and I were self-employed. We had our own small family business; so, gosh, forgive me. I actually worked for myself. 




Senator Edwards:
  You'd be the only ones!



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  Order! We'll have a little bit of order, please.




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do appreciate that coverage. I shake in my boots when Senator Edwards from South Australia attacks me! But you see, I know the value of dirt under the fingernails. I know the value of leaving school and thinking, 'What am I doing to do with myself, because I do not want to go to university?'


I also understand the value of putting up your life savings. I think I had about $1,200 in the bank when my dad said to me, 'If you want to buy a truck, mate, you're using your own money.' I understand signing up to a loan and thinking, 'Now I've got pay it off.' I also understand the value of putting in a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. I also understand feeling that if I did not have—like hundreds of thousands of other Australian workers have—the safety net of union membership behind me should I need it, what the heck would I do? How would I service my loans if I were, one day, unfairly treated, if the company I worked for decided that they did not need me, through no fault of my own? I worked for one of the largest transport companies in Australia, TNT. At the time, we were the Ansett division, Ansett Transport Industries, so I came through the Ansett sector. They were a very good company until things started going bad. My union membership came in very, very handy, and I am proud to have had that. I am also proud—and I will get to the bill but I just want to let some of those boofheads over there understand that they are not the gatekeepers to all intelligence, let alone good business practice—




Senator Edwards:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.




Senator STERLE:
  I withdraw the 'boofheads'. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator STERLE:
  Only because Senator Edwards just reminded me, as soon as he stood up, that I might have used the wrong word there.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sterle, you might address the question before the chair.




Senator STERLE:
  Yes. I have withdrawn. Through the chair, I withdraw.


I go back to this ridiculous position we have in front of us, where those on that side think that they are so clever because they go and bash a few unions because it suits the top end of town. I came off the road when I had two young children. It was time to come home and try to be more than a part-time father. It was time to stop running between Perth and Darwin and try to be home every night. I was employed as an organiser with the Transport Workers Union. I was employed as an organiser with the Transport Workers Union not because I was an apparatchik and not because they wanted to put me in parliament—nothing could be further from the truth. It was because I was a truck driver. It was because I valued a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Fourteen years later, I left and entered the Senate. But it really irks me when smartypants on that side make ridiculous statements and they have got no idea of our backgrounds. I dismiss the ridiculous contribution from Senator McKenzie. I do not think she would be the only one.


This bill is a nonsense. I could waffle on about what it is all supposed to do. This is ideology as its craziest. This is the Liberal Party, with the help of the Nats, paying back the top end of town. But they are also throwing out a blanket, because they want to talk about some unfortunate misdemeanours we have seen from a couple of people who were employed in union leadership roles. Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, I know your background too. Apart from being a father of two and a hardworking senator for 18 years, you have been a very successful union secretary. You served a massive membership. The majority of your membership respected not only your intelligence but your thoughts and your wisdom. You represented mainly women, a lot of people who had English as a second language and those working in stores and shops.


This bill is the government delivering to the top end of town. Employers who do the right thing have absolutely nothing to fear in dealing with unions. Employers who are doing the right thing—and there are many, many employers out there that do the right thing; unfortunately it is a few ratbags that bring the rest of them down—have nothing to fear with collective bargaining. But what they have got to fear is when the opposition come out to deliver their thankyous to the top end of town.


If we are talking about the corrupt few, I say: throw the buggers in jail and throw the key away. I am not just making that up. I would have full support from the union movement. They are not the sort of people that we want in the movement. But they are not the only ones, unfortunately, who may be corrupt or who are doing the wrong thing. I have got some statistics I wish to share with you, Mr Acting Deputy President. They are about ASIC. For a bit of background, for those who may not know: ASIC is Australia's corporate market and financial services regulator. ASIC is an independent Commonwealth government body. ASIC is set up under and administered under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act and carries out most of its work under the Corporations Act. ASIC currently comes under the portfolio responsibilities of the Assistant Treasurer. Who does ASIC regulate? It regulates Australian companies, financial markets, financial services, organisations and professions who deal and advise in investments, superannuation, insurance, deposit taking and credit. Why am I telling you that? Because I want to tell you of some of the fine work that ASIC has done. In the last three financial years, there have been 79 criminal proceedings completed, 74 people convicted and 45 people jailed—not union secretaries but businesspeople. There have been 30 non-custodial sentences or fines, 73 civil proceedings completed and 70 illegal schemes shut down or other action taken—and I have not even started on that scenario in Western Australia with the Vietnamese market gardeners. There have been 228 people disqualified or removed from directing companies. ASIC also publish enforcement reports. The most recent one is for July to December 2013, for which the media statement says:


ASIC achieved 340 enforcement outcomes. This included criminal as well as civil and administrative (e.g. a banning or disqualification) actions, and negotiated outcomes, including enforceable undertakings (EU).


What I am saying is, if you want to look where all the crooks are, it is not how to work out where most of them are. They are in the boardrooms. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, it is absolutely ridiculous, the contribution from the other side. 


I want to allude to Senator Back's contribution. I have the greatest respect for Senator Back. We do a lot of work together in our RRAT committee. RRAT—for those who are listening—is not what you might think it is; it is rural and regional affairs and transport. Senator Back is very well regarded in agricultural industry, but he is way off track in this debate. I will tell you why he is way off track. In the closing couple of minutes that were available to him yesterday, Senator Back wanted to attack the Maritime Union of Australia. Before that mob over there get all excited and get their undies in a twist, I am just going to make it very clear that I am a personal friend of Christy Cain, the state secretary of the MUA in Perth, and I know you are too, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop. Christy is a fantastic representative of maritime workers and waterside workers on the waterfronts throughout Western Australia.


But Senator Back had a whack at 50 employees—I think there are about 50, but I will stand corrected—offshore in Port Hedland. I believe they work in the port for Teekay Shipping. Some background: I would hope that every Western Australian would know this, but in Port Hedland every day there are about 30 or 40 ships waiting offshore to get in and load predominantly iron ore out of Port Hedland and get it to the Asian Markets, the Chinese markets, the Indian markets or wherever it needs to go. We have about 50 of these guys, who followed John Howard's dream of actually having to have secret ballots for whether they wanted to take industrial action. They followed John Howard's dream, they had the vote for the Fair Work Commission and they voted to take industrial action on a secret ballot basis. But it does not suit those on that side that there was a secret ballot and workers actually made up their minds that they wanted to take industrial action.


What do they want to take industrial action about? With Senator Back and the Libs it is all about going out there—in my words, not theirs—to try to destroy the iron ore industry or however they put it. They put their case forward: how dare these maritime workers or seamen go out there and want to take action because of safety issues that may cost—and I am using Senator Back's figures here, but I think I did read them in one of the journals to The Australian, which is not to say I like reading The Australian, but obviously I had nothing better to do for that three minutes—the industry about $100 million a day, and the action that was supported could last for seven days. So we have an industry that could lose $100 million a day. You think to yourself: 'A hundred million dollars a day? Crikey, that's a lot of money.' But then you think to yourself, 'Why the hell do these workers want to take industrial action?'


I will tell you what I did. I rang Christy Cain and spoke to Christy. What it is is that, in the trucking industry, aviation, the mines and everywhere, we have fatigue management policies. It is enshrined in legislation, and workers are protected through occupational health and safety laws to be able to have certain hours of rest and certain hours of work. It is done for a very good reason: to protect not only workers on the site but other workers, particularly in the transport industry—which this mob want to steal from us too in terms of getting remunerated for it. We want our drivers safe. The miners want their miners safe. We want other workers safe. And the seamen, waterside workers and maritime workers want to be safe too.


Christy told me about the BHP shipping operations out of Port Hedland. I was told very clearly—and I know this for a fact anyway—that BHP has fatigue management systems. They have safety procedures everywhere you go. Any of us who have visited a BHP site knows the rules and knows that occupational health and safety is foremost in their mind, and so it should be. And the mining industry does too. It is great, because it is a dangerous industry. But these rules that govern miners and truck drivers are not enforced for the maritime operation. Through Teekay Shipping, who contract to BHP in Port Hedland, whose maritime workers' job every day is to get these ships in nice and quick, get them loaded and push them out, I am told very clearly that these guys are working 12- to 14-hour shifts per day. You think that is a long stretch, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. These guys and girls are actually working these 12- to 14-hour days 28 days in a row. With the greatest of respect, it is all very well for BHP—and if I am off the Christmas list for BHP, stiff—to have rules that govern workers on mines. It is all right for BHP to have rules that govern truck drivers' hours when they are on their sites or come into their sites, which we support. But it does not have to affect workers or cover workers on the ocean. I say to the MUA and their 50 members: good on you, boys. Stick it up them. You want to get home safely.


I do not want to sound alarmist, but what would happen if one of those ships ended up on the beach or, worse still, some other terrible accident happened in the port of Port Hedland because these guys are fatigued? I am backing them. Good on you, fellas. These ships can weigh up to 250,000 tonnes. It alarms me that senators from that side—and I am talking about the Libs and the Nats—cannot get their thoughts past the poor company that may have some financial penalties imposed upon them because workers want to be safe. You guys have got to get real, seriously. You have to save your whips and your ministers. I am too embarrassed to make stupid contributions like that; but, unfortunately, some of them have.


While I am on that, there is another fear there too. Trust me, there is always another angle. Not only did the MUA have to be condemned by Liberals—particularly Liberals from WA, which makes it worse—because how dare they want to be safe; there is another game being played. As Christy Cain informed me earlier, there is a mob—you would be aware of this, Bob—called Saipan. I believe they are an Italian company. I remember Saipan because, when I was out there trucking through the eighties and early nineties in the Pilbara, they were the mob that built the gas pipeline from Karratha to Bunbury. They are working for Inpex, who are building the underwater pipeline through the Ichthys field to Darwin. Saipan are now saying that they have 33 barge loads. I cannot tell you the tonnage—I wish I could—but it is significant. That is 33 trips from Kupang, where these pipes are being made, to come down to be laid as part of their project out there on the ocean to take the pipeline to Darwin. That in itself is good, no worries; it is tremendous and good for Australia. But I will tell you want is not good for Australia: that work has always been performed by Australian workers.


I come from WA, and some on that side may attack me and say I have this thing against foreign workers, but I do not. We welcome foreign workers. This country was built on foreign workers. I am first-generation Australian. But I really have a problem when foreign workers are used when Australian workers are sitting around with their hands in their pockets. They are used because—and I will take my 32 steps and say it outside publicly—they will be paid a heck of a lot less than Australian workers.




Senator Edwards:
  Why have they got their hands in their pockets?




Senator STERLE:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Edwards from South Australia really has no idea what is going on with working people. Their work has been taken because they are losing their work to foreign workers. In WA a classic example this week was the disgraceful uncovering of the Vietnamese market-gardening operation. I think we are up to about 120-odd. I know that Senator Abetz as the Minister for Employment might be able to tell me how many foreign workers are treated like absolute animals, caged in rooms of 30 people with, I believe, one toilet. They are being absolutely exploited. I do not support this bill; I reckon it is a load of bull. But I do support the maritime union's members—I support Christy Cain—and I wish them all the very best in their pursuit of safe working practices.


BHP are welcome to ring me and tell me that this is not the case. How can you have safety procedures, how can you espouse to be the king of all safety in looking after your workers if they are on a mine or in a trucking operation coming to your mine, and how can you absolutely keep a straight face and say that that does not affect you with the maritime workers and with the shipping because they are employed by a contractor? Do not be fooled by the crocodile tears coming from BHP. Christy, all the best brother, and to your members, the brothers and sisters out there on the Port Hedland port, I wish you well in your procedures for a safe working environment.


Mr Acting Deputy President, I will not be supporting the bill.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-05-14,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (10:53):  I thank those senators that have partaken in this debate for their contribution. Let us remember what this bill is about. It is, in fact, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill. It is seeking to implement the policy that we as a coalition announced well in advance of the last election; in fact, 12 months in advance. It was out there for all to see. I thought we had won the election but, no, the Labor Party and the Greens are going to keep using and abusing their majority in this place to frustrate the will of the Australian people. If I recall Senator Wong correctly, this morning in the media, she said that she and the Labor Party were elected to oppose. They were elected to oppose the government. I think that says it all. It indicates the mindset; it is their negativity; it is their resentment of the Australian people voting for a change of management on 7 September last year.


What is this registered organisations commission bill all about? It is very simply this: under corporate law, if a company director rips off his or her shareholders, they potentially face a period of imprisonment of five years, or a fine of, I think, $320,000. Now, if you go to a union official or, indeed, an employer organisation official that rips off his or her members, do you know what the penalty is? It is $10,000. Those opposite in all their ranting and raving and contributions in this debate were not able to indicate in any way, shape or form what the material or moral difference is between a company director ripping off shareholders or a union official ripping off members. What is the difference, morally or materially? Absolutely nothing.


What we are seeking to do in this legislation is to make the penalty regime for ripping off shareholders the same as for ripping off members. Why did we think that that was necessary? Because of the former Labor member for Dobell, Craig Thomson, because of the former National President of the Australian Labor Party, Michael Williamson, because of Mr Blewitt and Mr Bruce Wilson of the Australian Workers Union scandal of some 20 years ago, we believe there was the need for a regime that put in place penalties that would ensure, or hope to ensure, that if you do the crime you would actually do the time and pay a penalty.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  My goodness, we have the former union official from the other side. They are all the same from over there. They are here courtesy of the unions, by the unions and, regrettably, for the unions. Keep in mind that the Australian workforce has determined for themselves, now that the coalition has given workers the opportunity to decide whether or not to join a union, and 83 per cent have decided not to belong to trade unions. I just ask the simple question: I wonder why? Indeed, there have been some decent trade union officials who have come to me and said, 'Whatever you do, don't quote my name or where I'm from but, Eric, you are doing a great thing for the trade union movement in this country with this legislation. Because you know what, all I want to be is a shop steward. I want to be a person that looks after the interests of the workers. I have no desire to become a Labor senator, therefore I don't need slush funds, therefore I don't need to have slush funds to boost membership.'




Senator Bilyk:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Abetz is alluding to the fact that he believes all Labor union officials who become senators have been involved in slush funds, and I find that completely and utterly offensive.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  There is no point of order.




Senator ABETZ:
  Well, the former Labor leader that Senator Bilyk helped knife, Ms Gillard, in her exit interview with Slater and Gordon admitted that every union has a slush fund. So, Senator Bilyk, I either take your word or Ms Gillard's, your former celebrated Prime Minister. One or the other must be right or wrong. I will let the public of Australia determine as to whether Senator Bilyk or Ms Gillard was correct, but I am not going to get involved in that debate.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Collins, another former union official. They come into this place thick and fast. The simple fact is this: Ms Gillard said it in her exit interview with Slater and Gordon, 'Every union has a slush fund.' She is either right or wrong. We believe that there should not be this sort of mechanism that is now being shown with the Australian Workers Union and its Victorian 2020 fund that collected $250,000. A union official, using the union's name, collected hundreds of thousands of dollars but never put it through the union books—exactly the trick of Ralph Blewett and Bruce Wilson 20 years earlier. The CFMEU started off a drug and alcohol fund—a very worthy cause. There was $1 million allegedly raised for it from employers and elsewhere. The sad fact is it appears that not one cent has actually been spent on that. But it will be revealed in the royal commission in due course whether or not that has occurred. We then hear about the Electrical Trades Union waterfront mansion for one of their officials and so the list goes on. It seems to us as a government, having taken these issues to the Australian people, that this is the sort of legislation that nearly every union member actually wants because it protects their money.


I have got news for those sitting opposite. As I go around factory floors and other workplaces in Australia, the vast majority of the workers that are actually union members—so it is a majority of a very clear minority—say that they are members of a union not because they want to hold hands and sing Solidarity Forever but because they see their membership as an insurance policy for their own protection. So the relationship is a bit like house insurance: it is a payment they make in the hope they will never have to use it. But you know what? Union members want a proper guarantee that their money will be used for the purposes for which they give it. And that is why insurance companies have robust reporting mechanisms required of them as should registered organisations.


It is passing strange that having announced this legislation as we did before the election, which Labor says is completely unnecessary, Mr Shorten, in one of the most clumsy, flat-footed approaches and indeed panicked by our policy, raced into this place with some legislation which Labor and the Greens rammed through this place without proper consideration, which has now left the reporting requirements in an absolute shambles. Indeed, the trade union movement has been to me requesting that we amend Mr Shorten's legislation because it was so hopeless. The Senate committee looking into our bill suggested we make amendment to the existing legislation to undo the mess Mr Shorten created with the help of those Labor and Green senators sitting opposite. Yet again, it is another example where Labor, in its dying days and in cahoots with the Greens in this place, forced through legislation that was not thought out, that tied people up in red tape serving no useful purpose and then tried to window-dress to overcome the need for what everybody understands is necessary—that is, a more robust supporting system and stronger penalties.


Now we have before this place, as part of this legislation, some amendment to fix up Mr Shorten's mess. Labor and the Greens, I suspect, will be voting down this legislation, which will mean we do not even get the opportunity to clean up Mr Shorten's mess, which, the trade union movement in agreement with the employer organisations believe should be cleaned up. They are on a unity ticket on this but Labor senators opposite, so absolutely committed to ensuring that no robust reporting conditions be applied to unions, will say, 'Bad luck brother and sister'—to use Senator Sterle's language in the union movement. You will have to cop these reporting conditions that will regrettably see shop stewards having to report what their spouse might be earning or what assets they have.


We as a coalition did not ventilate the activities of the Craig Thomsons of this world and the Michael Williamsons of this world or the other activities that are slowly being ventilated but—I have said this before and I will repeat it—the Fairfax Media and the ABC, surprisingly, exposed some of the scams that were operating. They simply asked the question: why shouldn't the honest trade union members, the honest trade union men and women of Australia be protected from all these scams that have now been uncovered and disclosed? Why should they not be protected?


It is interesting that, in all this, we do in fact have the support of such people as Paul Howes of the Australian Workers Union and of Chris Brown. Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson, who are both former presidents of the ACTU, who are both former ministers in a Labor government and who both have had a lifetime of commitment to their service to the trade union movement, see the need for the act of the trade union movement to be cleaned up. If they can see it, why cannot those that are currently holding office, courtesy of the trade union movement in this place, see it as well? If ever there was a conflict of interest writ large it is in relation to those Labor senators in this place, who are, I understand, going to vote down this legislation.


It will be a matter of great regret if this legislation does not get carried. It is legislation that we put out there in lights before the election. We said it was important legislation. We therefore said it would be introduced within the first week of the parliament sitting because it was so important. Can I thank the departmental officials and the parliamentary draftspeople that worked so hard to make sure it was ready for the first week. And here we are in the Senate with Labor and Green senators denying the will of the Australian people, still in full resentment mode of what the Australian people decided on 7 September and in denial of that which their own party elders like Martin Ferguson and Simon Crean have said to them: 'This is basically good legislation. Let it go through and clean up the trade union movement.' Then in relation to the amendments that we are moving to the existing legislation, you do know, those sitting opposite, that those amendments are fundamentally required for the benefit of the trade union movement itself and employer organisations and you are wilfully blocking that and as a result making life exceptionally difficult for the administration of the trade union movement.


We can hear about the terrible things that occurred in a market garden in Western Australia. I simply say to Senator Sterle that the workplace relations legislation and framework in Australia has not changed over the past seven years. These things have happened under Labor's Fair Work regime. You cannot blame the coalition for the atrocities. If what Senator Sterle says is right, and I am willing to accept that, I just remind those opposite that it has all occurred under their watch, under their legislation, under their regime. Bad as it is, condemned as it should be, I ask: how does that relate to getting rid of corruption out of the trade union movement? It is completely and utterly unrelated but a desire to use up the time, because there is no argument against that fundamental proposition, which is, what is the moral difference, what is the material difference, between a company director ripping off shareholders and a union official ripping off members? Why shouldn't the penalty be the same? None of the Labor senators in their contributions have dealt with that issue in any way, shape or form.


We know we have got argument on our side, we know we have got right on our side, we know we have got the people of Australia on our side. The regrettable fact is, and we recognise this, that the Labor Party and the Greens are not on the side of the people of Australia, on the moral side of this debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:31):  I continue my speech from yesterday, when I was quoting the coalition's dissenting report. That report reads as though there are many, many unions acting improperly with members' funds but not one employer group, and that members of employer groups have nothing to gain from this legislation. The final sentences highlight that this bill is solely about trashing unions and about seeking to destroy collective bargaining.


I turn to substantive parts of the references committee report—a report that was necessary because of the shortcomings of the recommendation from the legislation committee's report. Many submitters—both employer groups and trade unions—said that even if the recommendations were accepted by the government the legislation would still cause great disruption and harm to the operations and effectiveness of the administration of registered organisations in Australia. This is due to the significant unintended consequences of the bill, and the training and financial burdens imposed by the bill.


The references committee report went to great lengths to incorporate arguments both for and against the bill, and to include arguments from both employer groups and trade unions. It is a report that I believe clearly crushes the arguments for the bill. The report highlights how, in drafting and conceptualising the bill, the Liberal government has fundamentally missed the point about the nature of officials and officers of many registered organisations.


Far from being commercial, for-profit companies, these are membership organisations that survive on the work of volunteers. I highlight comments from the Australian Industry Group regarding the proposed material personal interest requirements of the bill. They said: 


The provisions of the Bill in this area will operate very unfairly on registered employer organisations and their officer, and it is essential that the Bill is amended. The Bill would impose a far more onerous regime for officers of registered organisations than what applies to directors of public companies. The regime, if enacted, would undoubtedly deter persons from standing for office in employer organisations. In practice the provisions of the Bill would seriously impede many organisations from carrying on their daily business operations.


The ACTU reiterated this concern, from the perspective of trade unions, in its submission. It said that the committee should be cognisant of the fact that the burden of this regulation falls not just on the full-time salaried leadership of unions but on many rank-and-file members who are elected as unpaid delegates to governing bodies, which may meet as infrequently as once a year or once every two years.


If registered organisations cannot get members to fill the various office and delegate roles required for their organisations to function appropriately, then what happens to these organisations? They will die a slow death, and the Australian community will be worse off.


The report also highlighted evidence from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation that the minute-keeping requirements of this bill were too onerous. The evidence was:


While organisations do keep extensive records of their meetings, it is often the case that they deal with sensitive and confidential issues and do so under an agreement that such matters remain “in house”. Examples of this are in dealing with an organisation’s employees, industrial strategy and commercial issues.


A blanket requirement to record minutes, and for such records to be made public, will only foster and encourage a lack of transparency as organisations respond to this requirement with more “off the record” discussions and more informality and consequently reduced accountability when dealing with issues that are considered sensitive or confidential.


I felt that the ANMF hit the nail on the head with this evidence.


The requirements in this bill around the management of registered organisations are too rigid and impractical. With regard to the training of officials, this bill would impose upon registered organisations a requirement to have their training recertified by the new commissioner, even if their training has been approved by the current Fair Work Commission. The Ai Group raised that they had already spent significant resources on developing a training program required under the 2012 changes. They submitted:


For example, there are four organisations—us, the ACTU, the AWU and one other organisation which I cannot recall—that put huge resources into having their officer training programs developed and approved. There is nothing in this legislation that grants automatic approval for those training courses. We have got to again run the gauntlet with the Registered Organisations Commission.


Talk about increasing red tape for business.


Of course, there are always loopholes available, and it was interesting that the ACTU said:


… that the passage of the bill could result in many employer organisations deregistering as registered organisations and instead, adopting corporate structures. By forming companies limited by guarantees, the organisations could then avoid the disclosure, training and oversight provisions of the bill.


So on one hand this bill will severely damage the effectiveness of trade unions but on the other hand provide an out for employer groups to actually become more secretive and more exclusive than they already are. Maybe that is the real reason for this bill.


The report also highlights that the penalties under the Registered Organisations Act were tripled in 2012, and that these penalties are sufficient to act as a disincentive. The report notes that the bill has been drafted in such a way that the new serious contravention category actually has a circular definition—that is, the definition of 'serious contravention' includes a contravention of the act that is 'serious'. Of course, no definition of 'serious' is provided, creating an ambiguous definition to allow the commissioner to apply a serious contravention whenever he or she chooses.


Further, given the different functions of corporations from registered organisations, the attempt to copy the serious contravention provision from the Corporations Act is totally flawed. As evidenced in recent months, criminal law is able to prosecute wrongdoing. The actions of the few should not be used as an excuse to enact draconian measures for registered organisations and their membership.


I repeat that I do not condone officers of registered organisations, or anyone in a position of trust, acting inappropriately, misusing trusted funds or taking benefits when they are not entitled to. The reforms by the previous government are sufficient to improve accountability of trade unions and employer groups, and this has been clearly demonstrated over recent times. I urge senators to vote against this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:38):  In rising to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013 I would like to make one thing quite clear: this is a bill designed to silence unions. It is a bill designed to impose so many bureaucratic reporting requirements on unions that they have barely enough time to focus on their core business, and that is representing and defending the rights of workers.


When John Howard was Prime Minister, savage dogs and security people were on the docks. This government has decided to employ more subtle means of breaking the unions. But make no mistake about it: when the Liberal-National coalition is in government they will do all they can to attack the union movement. They will attack unions because the union movement is standing in the way of their ultimate ideological goal: stripping the rights and conditions of Australian workers.


This is a government led by an ideological Prime Minister with an historical grudge. He is continuing to fight a workplace relations battle that was comprehensively won in 2007, and this time he is fighting it by stealth and subterfuge. Instead of taking the union's head-on he is going to do it under the guise of tackling misconduct and corruption. And if you think Mr Abbott has abandoned WorkChoices, let us recall that in 2008 he said:


… it was good for wages, it was good for jobs and it was good for workers. And let’s never forget that.


That is his quote.


In 2009 he said:


… workplace reform was one of the greatest achievements of the Howard government.


That is what this bill is really all about. It is about crippling the union movement with burdensome regulation so they lack the ability to fight against the Abbott government's ideologically-driven workplace reform.


The bill that is now before the Senate is a broken promise. Once again, we see a coalition that says one thing in opposition and does another in government. The Abbott government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations, and now they have broken that promise. This bill places more onerous reporting requirements and higher penalties on officers of registered organisations than those imposed on company directors.


For example, corporations face a late fee from ASIC of $299 if their annual reports are lodged more than a month late. Yet this bill seeks to impose penalties of up to $85,000 if a registered organisation fails to lodge their annual report within the required time. The bill sets higher penalties for officers of registered organisations for a number of other breaches, such as noncriminal breach of good faith obligations, noncriminal misuse of position and noncriminal misuse of information.


For those who believed the Prime Minister when he said he would not touch workplace relations and when he said he would not reintroduce WorkChoices, just look at the trail of broken promises he has left behind so far. And just look at the ideological campaign that is being waged against unions right now, with this bill as a weapon, and you will see where the Abbott government stands on the interests of workers.


Those opposite like to pretend that this bill is about standing up for union members, but how can you stand up for union members if you mute the organisations that are supposed to represent them and fight for their rights? I want to make clear that this is not a debate about whether union corruption is acceptable. I and the rest of my colleagues in the Labor Party not only opposes corruption, we abhor it and have zero tolerance for it. Officers of registered organisations, just like directors of companies, are placed in a positions of trust and responsibility, to provide for the interests of their members—just as company directors are to act in the interests of their shareholders. Anyone who engages in corrupt behaviour, who is put in a position of responsibility and authority and abuses that authority for their own personal benefit, must be prosecuted with the full force of the law. I hope that the government is fervently opposed to all corruption, despite the fact that they seem to have an obsession with focussing on corruption in one particular sector—that is, the union movement.


But let us not pretend either, as those opposite would have us believe, that this is a debate about who is serious about tackling corruption. If the government cannot get this bill—this ideological instrument—through this place, then they will, at the very least, use it as some kind of political tool to claim that those of us on this side are not serious about tackling corruption in the union movement. We are serious about tackling corruption and misconduct, and we have demonstrated our seriousness through the legislation we passed in government in 2012.


In fact, Labor introduced stronger accountability measures and tougher penalties for misconduct in registered organisations than those introduced by the current Prime Minister when he was Minister for Workplace Relations in 2002. And do not forget, it was Labor in government that forced the Health Services Union into administration.


The conduct that those opposite claim they are targeting is already prohibited in the Registered Organisations Act. The act already prohibits members' money from being used to favour candidates in internal elections. It allows for criminal proceedings when funds are stolen or obtained by fraud, and ensures the Fair Work Commission can share information with police. There are statutory civil penalties in the act for parties who knowingly or recklessly contravene an order or direction made by the Fair Work Commission or Federal Court. Officers of registered organisations have fiduciary duties similar to those of company directors, and are required to disclose their personal interests. In trying to justify this bill, the government point to instances of alleged corruption that are being dealt with effectively by the current provisions.


If those opposite were really serious about tackling corruption and misconduct, then they would do so across the board. Despite the hundreds of prosecutions brought by ASIC each year against company directors, despite all the material that has been dealt with by ICAC in New South Wales, we do not hear a peep out of this government about corruption and misconduct in the corporate sector. Yet if you listened to the rhetoric of the coalition over the past several years, you would think that corruption and misconduct is entirely confined to unions.


The challenge for the government in prosecuting the case for the bill is this: explain to the Senate how and why the system that is in place already is not working; explain to the Senate how this bill will improve the system in any meaningful way; and explain to the Senate how you justify the enormous regulatory cost that you are seeking to impose on the very organisations whose members you claim to be protecting. They have failed to do this in the House, and I doubt they will succeed here. This is a poorly constructed piece of legislation. Not only is it poorly constructed, but its sole purpose is the pursuit of an ideological crusade—although I would consider it is more like the stuff of the sheriff of Nottingham than of Robin Hood.


As I said before, this bill imposes more onerous requirements on the officers of registered organisations than those which company directors are subject to. Why won't the government support the same onerous reporting requirements, the same steep penalties, for corporations and their directors as they do for registered organisations? If they are going to claim that by opposing this bill we are not serious about tackling union corruption then, surely, by their own standards they are not serious about tackling corruption in the corporate sector. 


Of course, this is the government that apparently is all about cutting red tape and letting businesses get on with business. But they are not interested in letting unions get on with their business. Instead, they want to drown them in regulatory requirements so they cannot get on with their core business—representing workers. That is what the coalition's mates in big business want them to do. If they cannot bring Work Choices back, then they will at least have a go at breaking the back of the union movement.


Business is often regarded by those opposite as their natural friends, but has the Abbott government considered how employer organisations feel about this regulatory approach? Employer organisations are, after all, registered organisations who would be subject to the same requirements as employee organisations under this bill. Perhaps the Abbott government is so hell-bent on this ideological crusade that they are happy to sacrifice employer organisations in the process. Perhaps they consider weighing down employer organisations with the same regulatory burden to be worth the collateral damage. Perhaps to them this is the cost of winning their ideological war against unions.


Well, these organisations obviously do not like it any more than employee organisations do. The Australian Industry Group made the point that directors of companies are typically small in number and well-remunerated for their role in returning a value on shareholders' investments, whereas registered organisations, being not-for-profit entities, typically have many elected officials and committee members who are unpaid. The Ai Group, for example, has 78 volunteer councillors deemed officers under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, who give up a great deal of their time working on the policy and financial management of the group while also trying to run their own companies. I know this is also the case for many other registered organisations including unions and yet the bill imposes excessive reporting requirements on these unpaid volunteers. 


One such requirement is the obligation to disclose their material personal interests, including those of relatives, to every member of the organisation and the penalty for breaching this requirement is over $1 million—I think that in fact it is $1,020,000. By contrast, under the Corporations Act, company directors only have to disclose their material interests to the other directors and only those interests that relate to the affairs of the company. Let me just reiterate that. One requirement is the obligation on one group to disclose material personal interests including those of relatives to every member of the organisation and the penalty for breaching that requirement is around $1 million. By contrast, under the Corporations Act, company directors only have to disclose their material interests to other directors and only those interests that relate to the affairs of the company. Here is what the Australian Industry Group said in their submission in relation to the disclosure of material personal interest:


The provisions of this Bill in this area will operate very unfairly on registered employer organisations and their officers, and it is essential that the Bill is amended. The Bill would impose a far more onerous regime for officers of registered organisations than what applies to directors of public companies. The regime, if enacted, would undoubtedly deter persons from standing for office in employer organisations. In practice the provisions of the Bill would seriously impede many organisations from carrying on their daily business operations.


That was from the Australian Industry Group in their submission to the Senate inquiry.


Will just drop this year and then I can work on I would like to compliment the Ai Group on what is a very comprehensive and well-thought-out submission, which points out the many flaws in this bill. Concerns about the regulatory burden this bill will place on registered organisations have been echoed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and several other employer organisations, including the Master Builders Australia and the Pharmacy Guild.


By introducing these onerous reporting requirements, the government is not just imposing costs on unions but is imposing costs on the whole workplace relations system. Of course, the government must have known that these concerns were going to be brought up. Maybe that is why they were in such a hurry to rush this bill through.


Many employer organisations, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have raised concerns about the lack of time they have had to review the legislation and lodge a considered submission. Surely it would send a clear message to this government, when both employer and employee organisations are united in their stance on this bill, that something is seriously wrong with it?


While looking through the second reading speeches to this bill in the other place, I think the member for Moreton made an interesting point—that the increased compliance costs resulting from this bill could be passed on to the members of registered organisations. In the case of unions these could include low-paid employees, such as retail workers, or cleaners, or childcare workers or aged care workers. Far be it from those opposite to care about low-paid workers, but many employer organisations that represent small businesses may also be forced to pass these costs onto their members, resulting in increased costs for small business. Of course, we know that if that happens that cost will be passed on to consumers.


I doubt the government, on the other side of this chamber, who trumpet their business credentials and their war on red tape, have considered the cost burden this legislation could potentially have on small businesses. You would think this is exactly the kind of legislation that the government would include in one of their 'red tape repeal days'. But then this government really only pays lip service to repealing red tape. Not only are they not serious about reducing red tape they are intent on using red tape as a weapon.


Labor will oppose this legislation, and we have many good reasons to do so. We already have a very good regime in place for ensuring the accountability of officers of registered organisations, including reasonable penalties for failing to meet their duties to their members As a number of submitters have pointed out, it is this rushed legislation that is causing problems. The government's royal commission into the trade union movement will be making recommendations about the regulation and governance of registered organisations, so why not wait for those findings? Is it because this bill is a stunt?


This is the same stunt the government pulled in opposition when Senator Abetz introduced a similar bill. I remember when I spoke on that bill: I described it as a 'solution looking for a problem'. The bill that is currently before the Senate is no different.


This is not just Labor's view, or the view of the union movement, and I point again to the Australian Industry Group's submission which said:


It is a transparently political Bill in an area where there is no extant public policy problem.


Unfortunately, what the government has demonstrated with their royal commission is that they are willing to spend millions of dollars in pursuit of their political witch hunt. They will spend millions of dollars in taxpayers funds while also imposing millions of dollars of costs on registered organisations, including employee and employer associations.


Why does this government insist on attacking unions? Because they want to silence the voices of those opposed to their real agenda, which is bringing back WorkChoices. If the government wants to introduce serious, adult, measures to combat misconduct and corruption, Labor will support them. However, Labor will not support childish stunts, we will not support a political witch-hunt and we will not support unnecessary regulation and red tape. And we will not support actions designed to cripple and silence the union movement.


For these reasons, Labor opposes this bill.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-05-14,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (09:54):  It is deja vu. It is Groundhog Day. Here we are again, and yet again we are pulling out our speeches—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Bilyk, I am glad you referred to an earlier speech you made on very similar legislation. Anyway, I rise to speak to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013, a bill for an act to amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 and for related purposes. This was the coalition election policy. We were very clear. Senator Bilyk, you made comments about rushed pieces of legislation. This piece of legislation was like a train coming across—through you, Chair—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator McKenzie, you cannot address senators directly—do so through the chair—and interjections are disorderly, Senator Bilyk.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Like a freight train across the Nullarbor, you could have seen this particular piece of legislation coming for miles—for days, for weeks, for months, for nigh on a year. This was part of our agenda to ensure accountability and transparency with registered organisations. It is not an ideological attack on the union movement, as those opposite would like us to believe. It is actually for all of us—for the community—to be assured that employer organisations, workers' organisations and indeed any registered organisations ensure that the dues paid by the members to those organisations are used in a responsible matter and that the governing arrangements for those organisations give confidence to those members that they are being taken care of in an appropriate manner.


Briefly, the policy applies the same rules to unions and officials as for companies and their directors. Given the amount of money that some of these organisations are in charge of, and given the importance of a lot of the advocacy work that they are involved in, that should be the least of the regulations that they should be subject to. It ensures penalties for breaking the rules are the same for everyone, as are disclosure requirements. In addition, the policy calls for a new body, the Registered Organisations Commission, to take on the enforcement and investigation roles currently held by the Fair Work Commission. The new commission would also provide information and advice to registered organisations about their rights and obligations under the law.


We have a clear mandate for this legislation. Specifically, the bill responds to a number of outstanding recommendations from the June 2012 review into the operation of the Fair Work Act by the Fair Work Review Panel. I speak on this bill as a member—and, at the time of the inquiry, acting chair—of the Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which inquired into the bill and reported to the Senate in 2013. In the legislation committee report, the committee supported the bill subject to four minor amendments. Firstly:


The Committee recommends that, consistent with the Corporations Act 2001, material personal interest disclosures should only be required to be made to those officers whose duties relate to the financial management of the organisation. Such disclosures should be recorded in the minutes of the meetings of those officers and should be made available to members on request.


I am surprised that the opposition is not supporting this amendment, given that it ensures that the shareholdings of husbands and wives of union representatives are not open for disclosure. It ensures that only those who are dealing directly with the financial management of the organisation are subject to the same disclosure rules as under the Corporations Act. Secondly:


The Committee recommends that a list of exclusions from the obligations to disclose material personal interests based on section 191(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 be inserted into the bill. This would narrow the obligation to disclose material personal interests …


Thirdly:


The Committee recommends that the obligation placed on officers to disclose every payment should be reduced with certain exclusions …


Fourthly and finally:


The Committee recommends the bill be amended to allow the Commissioner to grant exemptions from the training requirements if an individual can demonstrate significant knowledge of the financial obligations specified in the bill.


This is because, despite the policies of various Labor state governments and the TAFE regime, there is no point training people for the sake of training people. I know the training obligations and the money they can raise from training their members are a great money-spinner for many of the registered organisations, but if you already have the training there is no reason for you to undergo that again.


Predictably, for a bill which would make unions more accountable, Labor senators produced a dissenting report opposing the bill in its entirety. I think that was in December 2013. What was less predictable was Labor's decision to refer the bill to the Education and Employment References Committee, which of course they control.


Referring the bill for a second inquiry was a highly unusual tactic. In fact, it has not been used since August 1996 when, again, Labor referred another piece industrial relations legislation, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 to the Senate Economics Reference Committee. So much for the bleating about ideology. Politics is the battle of ideas; on this side, ideas centred around freedom, transparency and accountability. And on the other side, as Senator Cameron made reference to in his contribution on this piece of legislation yesterday: 'There is nothing wrong with it—leave it as it is. There is no problem.' Clearly, that is not what we found in our inquiry. That was not the evidence given to the committee and it was not the evidence given to the coalition during the construction of our policy around this matter. It just shows how desperate Labor is to appease its union mates and masters.


The reference committee essentially replicated the work of the legislative committee. The only difference is that this time it was a Labor majority report, with a dissenting report from coalition senators. Our dissenting report flatly rejected the need for a second inquiry. The new inquiry held just one hearing for which just three unions and one employer organisation turned up. What a waste of time, paper, energy, Senate resources and money! But how typical of Labor.


Senators on this side of the chamber firmly support the government taking strong action to ensure all registered organisations are accountable. Has Labor learnt nothing from the HSU scandal? The fact that it took Fair Work Australia four long years to complete its investigation into the HSU demonstrates the need for a separate Registered Organisations Commission, as set out in this bill.


It is now very clear that HSU was just the tip of the iceberg. The Fair Work Commission has recently launched proceedings against the Musicians Union of Australia, and currently has inquiries or investigations into the Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union, the Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation, the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia, the Flight Attendants' Association of Australia, the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, Australian Nursing Federation and the Australian Childcare Centres Association.


We have also just seen the start of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. I would encourage Labor Senators who think that all is well with the union movement and that this bit of legislation is not required to please log on to www.trade union royal commission.gov.au, and tor those Twitter aficionados amongst as it is #turc, if they want to follow what is actually going on at the royal commission into the trade union movement and governance. Find some evidence of why this bit of legislation is required now.


The bill before the Senate is not about union bashing. It is about protecting workers from union officials who do the wrong thing—and they do exist. Not all; not the majority. But they do exist. The majority of union officials are honest and dedicated to the welfare of their members, and thus have nothing to fear from this bill. In fact, by clearing up the governance issues in registered organisations unions should become stronger as they regain the lost trust of workers and, indeed, the wider Australian public about their important role in our civic life. It is hard to understand why any Labor senator would have a problem with tackling corruption.


While current Labor politicians are more than shy about criticising unions, Labor figures of the past have been much more forthcoming. Former Labor powerbroker, Graham Richardson, wrote a column in The Australian of 31 January 2014, titled, 'Labor needs to re-examine its ties with the unions'.


Labor must assert the primacy of its own position over the trade unions. If it is seen again to slavishly follow the union line, it will give an already well-endowed Prime Minister even more grist for his mill.


Unfortunately for Labor, for workers and for the union movement more generally, that message is not getting through to Labor in this building.


Labor Senators cited as their main reason to oppose the bill, disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations. Yet these issues arise courtesy of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012, introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten. When introducing the bill, Mr Shorten said:


Under the amendments proposed by the government—


the then government—


registered organisations will be required to amend their rules to provide for the disclosure of transactions between the organisation and related parties, which may include the family members of officials.


Labor was happy to support disclosure when it was in government, but now it is against it now it is in opposition. What hypocrisy. Labor senators should really be more supportive of their leader. Mr Shorten was very close to the top of the Gillard government. He not only helped install Ms Gillard, he was so close to her that he agreed with everything she said even when he had no idea what she had said. Mr Shorten had the Prime Minister's back—that is, until he stabbed her in the back.


Edmund Burke said:


Hypocrisy can afford to be magnificent in its promises, for never intending to go beyond promise, it costs nothing.


Labor's hypocrisy on this bill is similar to Labor now voting against budget saving measures that Labor brought to parliament and took to the last election. Last year Labor proposed $2.3 billion of savings. These came from an efficiency dividend on universities, a cut to scholarships and other higher education changes. In February last year the Gillard government announced savings of $1.1 billion as a result of research and development tax changes. But now Labor is blocking both of these pieces of legislation—both previous Labor plans. Labor sees no conflict in voting against its own policies, none at all. Indeed, it expects us to vote against our own policies, policies that we were very, very clear on prior to the election, that were part of the mandate that Australian people gave the Abbott government.


So why are Labor senators so reluctant to hold trade unions to account? I think that is a very, very good question. I have done a bit of homework; I have a few stats I would like to share with the chamber. Maybe one of the reasons could be that 19 out of the 31 ALP senators are former union officials or union bosses. Nine of them were union bosses, 10 of them were union officials. Senator Bilyk, who we just heard from before, the Australian Services Union; Senator Bishop, Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees union boss; Senator Cameron, passionate defence of the union movement yesterday, AMWU union boss; Senator Collins, SDA union official; Senator Conroy, Transport Workers Union official; Senator Dastyari, ALP boss right there; Senator Farrell, another shoppie union boss; Senator Furner, the National Union of Workers union boss; Senator Gallagher, Transport Workers Union boss; Senator Hogg, our President, a Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees union official; Senator Lines, United Voice, and what a voice it is, union boss; Senator Ludwig, Australian Workers Union union official; Senator Lundy, CFMEU union official; Senator Marshall, the ETU union official; Senator McEwen, the Australian Services Union boss; Senator Moore, CPSU union boss; Senator Singh, Australian Education Union official; Senator Sterle, Transport Workers Union official; Senator Urquhart, Australian Manufacturing Workers Union boss; Senator Wong, CFMEU union official. But wait, there is more! Come 1 July these senators will be joined by Senator Joe Bullock, SDA union boss, and Senator Chris Ketter, SDA union boss.


And what do they all have to hide? The community expectation is that these unions must operate to the highest of standards. These organisations are given special legislated rights, and with rights come responsibilities. The Craig Thomson affair showed that these responsibilities are not being met under the current arrangements. Mr Thomson was arrested in respect of more than 154 fraud related criminal charges and is facing allegations that his 2007 federal election campaign was partly funded by siphoning union money without authorisation. The union that Mr Thomson was ripping off represents some of the lowest paid workers in Australia, and it is outrageous that the union contributions of these low-paid workers were used to fund the seedy high life of a man who was supposed to be fighting on their behalf. It is outrageous that it took four years for justice to be done. It is outrageous that Labor senators think it is okay to maintain the status quo.


To improve oversight of registered organisations, the bill will establish a dedicated independent watchdog, the registered organisations commission, and provide it with enhanced investigation and information-gathering powers to monitor and regulate registered organisations. The new commission will have the necessary independence and the powers it needs to regulate registered organisations effectively, efficiently and transparently. The commission will have stronger investigation and information-gathering powers than those that currently apply. They will be modelled on those available to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The commission will also educate, assist and advise registered organisations and their members in relation to the new obligations, and ensure members are aware of their rights. The activities of the commission will also be subject to the same oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman as Commonwealth agencies. This will ensure the appropriate level of transparency and public accountability.


As well as establishing a strong, independent regulator, the bill introduces reporting and disclosure requirements, and enhanced penalties for wrongdoing. Many unions control assets worth millions of dollars. In financial terms they operate in a similar way to a large business, so it is appropriate for them to have similar reporting requirements. And I note that in his contribution yesterday, Senator Cameron was very keen to use the word 'volunteer', as if somehow we were talking kindergarten committees or football/netball clubs in the way that unions were being run. But I am very, very confident about this, having actually presided over a student association many years ago which had a turnover of $17 million. I know that many of the people involved in that organisation were not solely volunteers, and I know that throughout the unions there are some very significant salaries within the government structure of the union movement. They should be subject to more stringent accountability measures. Than the local kindergarten committee is.


The only people who have anything to fear are those who are doing the wrong thing. The overwhelming number of officers who are already doing the right thing should be comforted in knowing that unlawful behaviour will be dealt with, thus ensuring ongoing member confidence in registered organisations as a whole. There should be no difference between the penalties levied against a company director who misuses shareholders' funds and a union boss who misuses members' money. I do not know why that is a point of contention.


Any political party that refuses to support this greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations is voting to give the green light to more of the same behaviour that we have seen from some executives of the HSU. It is time for Labor senators to choose which side they are on. Are you on the side of Craig Thomson or are you on the side of the workers? I think the misuse of the committee process by Labor, particularly around this and the other amendment to the Fair Work Act is a disgrace, because all they are doing is using the very limited resources of the Senate basically to prosecute what is an ideological argument.


It will ever be thus, and when Senator Bilyk wants to talk about 'ideological crusades', the Labor Party and Greens, their partners in crime, have been on an ideological crusade for six years. And whenever you want to call them out on their ideological crusade; whenever you actually want to inject some accountability and transparency into workplace relations; and whenever you want to talk about the reality of operating a small business in regional areas and of penalty rates for young people, they pull out the Work Choices wildcard. It is the 'press button in case of emergency/smash glass'; it is as if this spectre of Work Choices will actually make up for the negligence that those opposite have wreaked upon the Australian economy and upon the potential job prospects of young Australians and the stability of our budgetary position over coming decades.


I am very proud of our government in that whilst it was not of our making, we have actually taken strong steps this week to address the inherent issues of the Labor malaise.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (10:14):  Senator McKenzie, I could not let you go without thinking to myself, quietly, 'I hear the social agrarian that you in fact are when you talk about trade unions with such distaste.' I find the juxtaposition of where you sit in the social agrarian National Party and where I sit in trade unions somewhat novel to look at. But, nonetheless, you are entitled to have your views.


I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. The Australian people were promised a mature, responsible government. We were promised a government that would be run by adults under the coalition. That promise has proved to be just one of the many broken promises that litter the corridors of the Ministerial Wing of this building today. The Abbott government's pre-election promises have all gone up in a puff of cigar smoke and the way this legislation has been handled, quite frankly, is no different. Just as Mr Tony Abbott's budget is a budget of broken promises, this legislation is completely full of hypocrisy. The legislation before the chamber can only be described as being politically motivated in the extreme. It is unnecessary, and I will not be supporting it or the way government has managed this bill in this place. It is in fact a piece of scrambled legislation that they have cobbled together as, you could only say, an extreme attack on trade unions per se. The legislation is a thinly-veiled attack on trade unions and, by extension, their members. Unions work incredibly hard to represent the best interests of their members. They have a role to play in the modern Australian economy and workforce, and I think that in itself is what the Liberal Party and the Liberals on the other side find almost impossible to accept. 


The government has not properly explained the case for change for this legislation. They have failed to make the case that the existing legislation should be changed in this extreme way. Registered organisations should be responsibly regulated, and I do not think that anyone would cavil at that statement. Labor supports the act in its current state. Why? Because it gets the balance right. It strikes the right balance between good legislation, how you properly regulate registered organisations and how you should ensure that you do not take it to the extreme to punish registered organisations. 


The law at present already does the following: registered organisations already prohibit members' money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns; the Registered Organisations Act already allows for criminal proceedings being initiated where funds are stolen or are obtained by fraud; the Registered Organisations Act already ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police, as is appropriate; and the Registered Organisations Act already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the Federal Court or the Fair Work Commission under the Registered Organisations Act or the Fair Work Act. The current legislation is pretty tough, can I say, in the way that it currently works.


Under the Fair Work Act officers of registered organisations already have a fiduciary duty akin to that for directors under the Corporations Law. The Registered Organisations Act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests. The Registered Organisations Act already requires officers to disclose when payments are made to related parties. And it does not stop there. The Registered Organisations Act already requires officers to exercise care and diligence and act with good faith. All of these put an incredible onus and responsibility on trade unions to act appropriately and conduct their affairs in an open and transparent way on behalf of their members.


As the dissenting report of the committee's inquiry into the bill noted, the current Registered Organisations Act already addresses the proposals of the bill to the appropriate extent. It prohibits money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections and gives priority to the determination of criminal proceedings, for example, where it is alleged that funds have been stolen or obtained by fraud, and ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police, as appropriate.


As has already been noted by the speakers on this side on this bill, these changes are aimed solely at hindering the efforts of trade unions to effectively represent their members in the workplace. When you look at the present legislation and at where these changes want to go, you can be left in no doubt that it is all about simply making it almost impossible for unions to operate effectively in the workplace and an unveiled attack on trade unions by this government. Why? Those on the other side have a long hatred of unions, and it manifests itself whenever they get their head. When they had the ability to pass legislation in this place from 2004 onwards, what did they do? They attacked unions and their members through Work Choices. Unfettered, they then went to the extreme, as is always the case. In this instance, they took a piece of legislation that was suitable and matched to fit registered organisations, and they have taken it to the extreme again. Why? As I said, the only reason left is their unbridled hatred of trade unions.


When you look at one particular aspect of the bill that represents significant overreach by a government full of twisted priorities and full of surprises, you can see it come through. The expansion of coercive investigatory powers is hidden within this bill. The legislation as it stands provides coercive powers in relation to current and former officers, employees or auditors of an organisation. The amendment legislation extends the powers in such a way as to reach any person the commission identifies as potentially holding information or evidence of relation. This will give the commissioner significant new powers to compel evidence, execute warrants and seize documents from any person. This can only be described as a significant overreach.


It was not something the coalition canvassed with the public before the last election. What they want to be able to do is give powers to the commissioners which are unprecedented in a broad sense—more than what you would expect for a body that is there to ensure registered organisations act within the law. Why? They want to have unfettered access to be able to attack trade unions using this piece of legislation shamelessly. Of course, the overreach is not hidden in that sense. They do put it in their legislation and they do encourage the commission to use all of the powers that are available to it to attack trade unions—and I suspect it would.


One of the novelties, if there is a novelty within this piece of legislation, is the extraordinary hypocrisy about red tape. We all know that this government is about removing red tape. They have set up—I do not know what they call it—a red tape task force to go around in departments, find red tape and destroy it where they can. This is one of the hypocritical issues that have come forward, which can also be described as a broken promise.


Mr Daniel Mammone, the workplace policy and legal affairs director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, gave this evidence in the Senate inquiry in response to a searching question from Senator Tillem:



Senator TILLEM: Would you agree with the statement that, further, the requirements of this bill add another layer of red tape for those organisations that you deal with and got feedback from? Is that a fair statement?



Mr Mammone: There are elements that compound the existing problems, yes.


This is clear evidence that the government's only plans are for twisted priorities and broken promises, because in this instance they want to add red tape and ensure that they surround trade unions with a substantial amount of red tape. Why? Because of their unbridled hatred of the operation of trade unions, the way they look after their members and the way they operate within the industrial sphere. The government are willing, in this instance, to breach and break one of their promises of removing red tape for what can only be described as a political end. It is simply a twisted priority when you juxtapose it. As Senator Bilyk noted, they would happily sacrifice a business to put impediments on the operation of trade unions. They are even willing to go that little extra step and say: 'We won't worry too much about business in this instance. Businesses are in the way of our target. They might be called collateral damage—too bad, so sad. We are willing to sacrifice those principles and sacrifice small business to achieve our aim of attacking trade unions.'


The Liberals have proved themselves to be the poorest managers of this chamber since I have been here. I cannot speak for before then, but when you look at the way this bill has been dealt with, the incompetence has not been limited to the operation of government business and the programs of this place. It really has extended across the entirety of this government when you look at how they are managing this legislative program. 


The budget is a betrayal of working people and it truly is a slap in the face to the people who voted for this government, because what are we dealing with today? We are dealing with one of their twisted priorities. We are dealing with registered industrial organisations. It is not about the budget, it is not about issues that go to the budget; what they really want to talk about are their twisted priorities around how to attack trade unions. The budget process to date has been farcical, and the extraordinary damage they are now inflicting on families is quite unbelievable. We witnessed the most chaotically mishandled and sieve-like budget since John Howard's 1980 budget, which was leaked in full to Laurie Oakes.


I suspect we have already got a government in revolt, with a backbench treated like mushrooms and a Prime Minister and Treasurer breaking election promise after election promise. Above all, I think this budget has been—as Dr Chalmers from the other place called it—an ambush on the Australian people, particularly on working people, and this piece of legislation is just another attack on working people. It attacks industrial organisations which represent their members—Australian working people—in the workplace. It highlights their priorities around who they have in their target: working people and trade unions who represent working people.


This is a budget written by the cigar chompers and borne by hardworking Australians. While lower- and middle-income earners are being sent to the wall, the big end of town are getting off scot-free. Their attack on working people contained in this bill is replicated in their attacks in the budget, and you do not have to go far into it to hear it. A GP tax, increasing the petrol tax, cuts to the pension, education, students with disabilities and young apprentice support—all broken promises, all attacks on hardworking Australians, and it is reflected here. 


I would go so far as to say that this registered industrial organisation bill today has at its heart the way the Liberal Party addresses working people. They do not like trade unions, they do not like working people and they do not like those who need support in the electorate. Labor does not support a tax on working people or their representatives. Unions work hard for their members' interests in the workplace, and you do not have to go far to find how bad this piece of legislation is. 


The Australian Council of Trade Unions, in its submission to the Senate committee inquiry, expressed the view that this bill is 'poorly conceived, badly motivated, entirely unnecessary and transparently political in an area where there is no extant public policy problem.' I think they have said it all in one sentence, quite frankly. The ACTU's analysis and conclusions about many of the requirements and penalties in this bill are similar to the AIG's. 


In the workplace we have a confluence of interests—industrial organisations, trade unions and employer organisations—who all think this legislation is bad. It is atrocious in the extreme. It even goes to areas which I think make you wonder about their priorities. If you look at the coercive powers in the investigatory area, they have given greater powers and taken away use and derivative use immunity. You could juxtapose that with what a former senator of this place, Senator Cooney, said. I hope I have got this right; I am happy to correct it. He once said that what you are doing is giving more power to people to look into, in this instance, trade unions or registered industrial organisations, than you give to the police to look at people who have been murderers, people who have done some heinous deeds in the criminal sphere. Why is that? To be able to justify it you do need to put down quite clearly what those justifications are and why we should accept them. I do not think, in this instance, the case has been made for this extreme use of powers plus the removal of the privilege against self-incrimination for use and derivative use immunities. In fact, derivative use immunity is, as I understand it, gone. 


Turning to other provisions in this legislation, of course they will have to fund it. I think it highlights their twisted priorities where they are going to fund an attack on registered industrial organisations whilst at the same time, for companies, it is quite interesting. The argument goes something like this: registered industrial organisations should be treated like companies. I think that is a poor argument and does not reflect the truth of how industrial organisations work and how they are comprised. But whilst you are strengthening these powers to attack trade unions, today we find out from the budget that you are removing approximately $120 million from ASIC so that they will not be able to perform their tasks in pursuing companies and the like for the work that they do—which has been and always is good work. But that is where you find their priorities. 'We'll ensure that ASIC cannot do its job. We'll take $120 million out of them over four years to make sure they cannot do their proper functions of keeping big corporations in check, making sure that companies do have a good investigative arm on their case. In this instance, though, we're going to support a tough piece of legislation to attack trade unions but ultimately we are going to say that companies and trade unions from your perspective should be treated the same.' How hypocritical. You are entirely hypocritical in that argument. It falls flat when you look at how you are going to pull the rug out from under ASIC and bolster your attack on trade unions. I commend the submission to the Senate. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (10:34):  I too rise to make my contribution to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. I think it is amazing to sit here when we go on a union-bashing exercise. It is absolutely gobsmacking to hear some of the contributions from those opposite. I did not hear it but I am told that, to use up some of the Senate's valuable time, Senator McKenzie went on a tirade about those of us on this side of the chamber—our backgrounds or what union affiliation we have. As I said, I did not hear it; I was sorting out my sock drawer when she was making her contribution. 


I just want to clarify a few things. Do I have a conflict of interest with this ridiculous amendment that is before the chamber? If I can be accused of being a lifelong member of the Transport Workers Union and having been awarded life membership of the Transport Workers Union, yes, I have a conflict of interest. If I am accused of being a truck driver, not a university-graduated person who just wanted to get into politics and went to work for a member of parliament or a Liberal law firm—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Apparatchik.




Senator STERLE:
  I am not one of those, I can tell you. I can be accused of a lot of things but that is not one of them. I have actually been a blue-collar worker. I joined the Transport Workers Union in 1980 when I was 20 years of age because I wanted to join the Transport Workers Union. Do I have a lot of friends in the union movement? Yes, I do. There are a lot of good people in the union movement, both office holders and rank and file members—my oath. But when I am told that an opposition senator thinks it is clever to wrap us all up as—my words, not hers—'operatives for unions', they really need to do their homework. I am proud to say that my wife and I were self-employed. We had our own small family business; so, gosh, forgive me. I actually worked for myself. 




Senator Edwards:
  You'd be the only ones!



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  Order! We'll have a little bit of order, please.




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do appreciate that coverage. I shake in my boots when Senator Edwards from South Australia attacks me! But you see, I know the value of dirt under the fingernails. I know the value of leaving school and thinking, 'What am I doing to do with myself, because I do not want to go to university?'


I also understand the value of putting up your life savings. I think I had about $1,200 in the bank when my dad said to me, 'If you want to buy a truck, mate, you're using your own money.' I understand signing up to a loan and thinking, 'Now I've got pay it off.' I also understand the value of putting in a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. I also understand feeling that if I did not have—like hundreds of thousands of other Australian workers have—the safety net of union membership behind me should I need it, what the heck would I do? How would I service my loans if I were, one day, unfairly treated, if the company I worked for decided that they did not need me, through no fault of my own? I worked for one of the largest transport companies in Australia, TNT. At the time, we were the Ansett division, Ansett Transport Industries, so I came through the Ansett sector. They were a very good company until things started going bad. My union membership came in very, very handy, and I am proud to have had that. I am also proud—and I will get to the bill but I just want to let some of those boofheads over there understand that they are not the gatekeepers to all intelligence, let alone good business practice—




Senator Edwards:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.




Senator STERLE:
  I withdraw the 'boofheads'. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator STERLE:
  Only because Senator Edwards just reminded me, as soon as he stood up, that I might have used the wrong word there.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sterle, you might address the question before the chair.




Senator STERLE:
  Yes. I have withdrawn. Through the chair, I withdraw.


I go back to this ridiculous position we have in front of us, where those on that side think that they are so clever because they go and bash a few unions because it suits the top end of town. I came off the road when I had two young children. It was time to come home and try to be more than a part-time father. It was time to stop running between Perth and Darwin and try to be home every night. I was employed as an organiser with the Transport Workers Union. I was employed as an organiser with the Transport Workers Union not because I was an apparatchik and not because they wanted to put me in parliament—nothing could be further from the truth. It was because I was a truck driver. It was because I valued a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Fourteen years later, I left and entered the Senate. But it really irks me when smartypants on that side make ridiculous statements and they have got no idea of our backgrounds. I dismiss the ridiculous contribution from Senator McKenzie. I do not think she would be the only one.


This bill is a nonsense. I could waffle on about what it is all supposed to do. This is ideology as its craziest. This is the Liberal Party, with the help of the Nats, paying back the top end of town. But they are also throwing out a blanket, because they want to talk about some unfortunate misdemeanours we have seen from a couple of people who were employed in union leadership roles. Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, I know your background too. Apart from being a father of two and a hardworking senator for 18 years, you have been a very successful union secretary. You served a massive membership. The majority of your membership respected not only your intelligence but your thoughts and your wisdom. You represented mainly women, a lot of people who had English as a second language and those working in stores and shops.


This bill is the government delivering to the top end of town. Employers who do the right thing have absolutely nothing to fear in dealing with unions. Employers who are doing the right thing—and there are many, many employers out there that do the right thing; unfortunately it is a few ratbags that bring the rest of them down—have nothing to fear with collective bargaining. But what they have got to fear is when the opposition come out to deliver their thankyous to the top end of town.


If we are talking about the corrupt few, I say: throw the buggers in jail and throw the key away. I am not just making that up. I would have full support from the union movement. They are not the sort of people that we want in the movement. But they are not the only ones, unfortunately, who may be corrupt or who are doing the wrong thing. I have got some statistics I wish to share with you, Mr Acting Deputy President. They are about ASIC. For a bit of background, for those who may not know: ASIC is Australia's corporate market and financial services regulator. ASIC is an independent Commonwealth government body. ASIC is set up under and administered under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act and carries out most of its work under the Corporations Act. ASIC currently comes under the portfolio responsibilities of the Assistant Treasurer. Who does ASIC regulate? It regulates Australian companies, financial markets, financial services, organisations and professions who deal and advise in investments, superannuation, insurance, deposit taking and credit. Why am I telling you that? Because I want to tell you of some of the fine work that ASIC has done. In the last three financial years, there have been 79 criminal proceedings completed, 74 people convicted and 45 people jailed—not union secretaries but businesspeople. There have been 30 non-custodial sentences or fines, 73 civil proceedings completed and 70 illegal schemes shut down or other action taken—and I have not even started on that scenario in Western Australia with the Vietnamese market gardeners. There have been 228 people disqualified or removed from directing companies. ASIC also publish enforcement reports. The most recent one is for July to December 2013, for which the media statement says:


ASIC achieved 340 enforcement outcomes. This included criminal as well as civil and administrative (e.g. a banning or disqualification) actions, and negotiated outcomes, including enforceable undertakings (EU).


What I am saying is, if you want to look where all the crooks are, it is not how to work out where most of them are. They are in the boardrooms. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, it is absolutely ridiculous, the contribution from the other side. 


I want to allude to Senator Back's contribution. I have the greatest respect for Senator Back. We do a lot of work together in our RRAT committee. RRAT—for those who are listening—is not what you might think it is; it is rural and regional affairs and transport. Senator Back is very well regarded in agricultural industry, but he is way off track in this debate. I will tell you why he is way off track. In the closing couple of minutes that were available to him yesterday, Senator Back wanted to attack the Maritime Union of Australia. Before that mob over there get all excited and get their undies in a twist, I am just going to make it very clear that I am a personal friend of Christy Cain, the state secretary of the MUA in Perth, and I know you are too, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop. Christy is a fantastic representative of maritime workers and waterside workers on the waterfronts throughout Western Australia.


But Senator Back had a whack at 50 employees—I think there are about 50, but I will stand corrected—offshore in Port Hedland. I believe they work in the port for Teekay Shipping. Some background: I would hope that every Western Australian would know this, but in Port Hedland every day there are about 30 or 40 ships waiting offshore to get in and load predominantly iron ore out of Port Hedland and get it to the Asian Markets, the Chinese markets, the Indian markets or wherever it needs to go. We have about 50 of these guys, who followed John Howard's dream of actually having to have secret ballots for whether they wanted to take industrial action. They followed John Howard's dream, they had the vote for the Fair Work Commission and they voted to take industrial action on a secret ballot basis. But it does not suit those on that side that there was a secret ballot and workers actually made up their minds that they wanted to take industrial action.


What do they want to take industrial action about? With Senator Back and the Libs it is all about going out there—in my words, not theirs—to try to destroy the iron ore industry or however they put it. They put their case forward: how dare these maritime workers or seamen go out there and want to take action because of safety issues that may cost—and I am using Senator Back's figures here, but I think I did read them in one of the journals to The Australian, which is not to say I like reading The Australian, but obviously I had nothing better to do for that three minutes—the industry about $100 million a day, and the action that was supported could last for seven days. So we have an industry that could lose $100 million a day. You think to yourself: 'A hundred million dollars a day? Crikey, that's a lot of money.' But then you think to yourself, 'Why the hell do these workers want to take industrial action?'


I will tell you what I did. I rang Christy Cain and spoke to Christy. What it is is that, in the trucking industry, aviation, the mines and everywhere, we have fatigue management policies. It is enshrined in legislation, and workers are protected through occupational health and safety laws to be able to have certain hours of rest and certain hours of work. It is done for a very good reason: to protect not only workers on the site but other workers, particularly in the transport industry—which this mob want to steal from us too in terms of getting remunerated for it. We want our drivers safe. The miners want their miners safe. We want other workers safe. And the seamen, waterside workers and maritime workers want to be safe too.


Christy told me about the BHP shipping operations out of Port Hedland. I was told very clearly—and I know this for a fact anyway—that BHP has fatigue management systems. They have safety procedures everywhere you go. Any of us who have visited a BHP site knows the rules and knows that occupational health and safety is foremost in their mind, and so it should be. And the mining industry does too. It is great, because it is a dangerous industry. But these rules that govern miners and truck drivers are not enforced for the maritime operation. Through Teekay Shipping, who contract to BHP in Port Hedland, whose maritime workers' job every day is to get these ships in nice and quick, get them loaded and push them out, I am told very clearly that these guys are working 12- to 14-hour shifts per day. You think that is a long stretch, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. These guys and girls are actually working these 12- to 14-hour days 28 days in a row. With the greatest of respect, it is all very well for BHP—and if I am off the Christmas list for BHP, stiff—to have rules that govern workers on mines. It is all right for BHP to have rules that govern truck drivers' hours when they are on their sites or come into their sites, which we support. But it does not have to affect workers or cover workers on the ocean. I say to the MUA and their 50 members: good on you, boys. Stick it up them. You want to get home safely.


I do not want to sound alarmist, but what would happen if one of those ships ended up on the beach or, worse still, some other terrible accident happened in the port of Port Hedland because these guys are fatigued? I am backing them. Good on you, fellas. These ships can weigh up to 250,000 tonnes. It alarms me that senators from that side—and I am talking about the Libs and the Nats—cannot get their thoughts past the poor company that may have some financial penalties imposed upon them because workers want to be safe. You guys have got to get real, seriously. You have to save your whips and your ministers. I am too embarrassed to make stupid contributions like that; but, unfortunately, some of them have.


While I am on that, there is another fear there too. Trust me, there is always another angle. Not only did the MUA have to be condemned by Liberals—particularly Liberals from WA, which makes it worse—because how dare they want to be safe; there is another game being played. As Christy Cain informed me earlier, there is a mob—you would be aware of this, Bob—called Saipan. I believe they are an Italian company. I remember Saipan because, when I was out there trucking through the eighties and early nineties in the Pilbara, they were the mob that built the gas pipeline from Karratha to Bunbury. They are working for Inpex, who are building the underwater pipeline through the Ichthys field to Darwin. Saipan are now saying that they have 33 barge loads. I cannot tell you the tonnage—I wish I could—but it is significant. That is 33 trips from Kupang, where these pipes are being made, to come down to be laid as part of their project out there on the ocean to take the pipeline to Darwin. That in itself is good, no worries; it is tremendous and good for Australia. But I will tell you want is not good for Australia: that work has always been performed by Australian workers.


I come from WA, and some on that side may attack me and say I have this thing against foreign workers, but I do not. We welcome foreign workers. This country was built on foreign workers. I am first-generation Australian. But I really have a problem when foreign workers are used when Australian workers are sitting around with their hands in their pockets. They are used because—and I will take my 32 steps and say it outside publicly—they will be paid a heck of a lot less than Australian workers.




Senator Edwards:
  Why have they got their hands in their pockets?




Senator STERLE:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Edwards from South Australia really has no idea what is going on with working people. Their work has been taken because they are losing their work to foreign workers. In WA a classic example this week was the disgraceful uncovering of the Vietnamese market-gardening operation. I think we are up to about 120-odd. I know that Senator Abetz as the Minister for Employment might be able to tell me how many foreign workers are treated like absolute animals, caged in rooms of 30 people with, I believe, one toilet. They are being absolutely exploited. I do not support this bill; I reckon it is a load of bull. But I do support the maritime union's members—I support Christy Cain—and I wish them all the very best in their pursuit of safe working practices.


BHP are welcome to ring me and tell me that this is not the case. How can you have safety procedures, how can you espouse to be the king of all safety in looking after your workers if they are on a mine or in a trucking operation coming to your mine, and how can you absolutely keep a straight face and say that that does not affect you with the maritime workers and with the shipping because they are employed by a contractor? Do not be fooled by the crocodile tears coming from BHP. Christy, all the best brother, and to your members, the brothers and sisters out there on the Port Hedland port, I wish you well in your procedures for a safe working environment.


Mr Acting Deputy President, I will not be supporting the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-05-14,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (10:53):  I thank those senators that have partaken in this debate for their contribution. Let us remember what this bill is about. It is, in fact, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill. It is seeking to implement the policy that we as a coalition announced well in advance of the last election; in fact, 12 months in advance. It was out there for all to see. I thought we had won the election but, no, the Labor Party and the Greens are going to keep using and abusing their majority in this place to frustrate the will of the Australian people. If I recall Senator Wong correctly, this morning in the media, she said that she and the Labor Party were elected to oppose. They were elected to oppose the government. I think that says it all. It indicates the mindset; it is their negativity; it is their resentment of the Australian people voting for a change of management on 7 September last year.


What is this registered organisations commission bill all about? It is very simply this: under corporate law, if a company director rips off his or her shareholders, they potentially face a period of imprisonment of five years, or a fine of, I think, $320,000. Now, if you go to a union official or, indeed, an employer organisation official that rips off his or her members, do you know what the penalty is? It is $10,000. Those opposite in all their ranting and raving and contributions in this debate were not able to indicate in any way, shape or form what the material or moral difference is between a company director ripping off shareholders or a union official ripping off members. What is the difference, morally or materially? Absolutely nothing.


What we are seeking to do in this legislation is to make the penalty regime for ripping off shareholders the same as for ripping off members. Why did we think that that was necessary? Because of the former Labor member for Dobell, Craig Thomson, because of the former National President of the Australian Labor Party, Michael Williamson, because of Mr Blewitt and Mr Bruce Wilson of the Australian Workers Union scandal of some 20 years ago, we believe there was the need for a regime that put in place penalties that would ensure, or hope to ensure, that if you do the crime you would actually do the time and pay a penalty.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  My goodness, we have the former union official from the other side. They are all the same from over there. They are here courtesy of the unions, by the unions and, regrettably, for the unions. Keep in mind that the Australian workforce has determined for themselves, now that the coalition has given workers the opportunity to decide whether or not to join a union, and 83 per cent have decided not to belong to trade unions. I just ask the simple question: I wonder why? Indeed, there have been some decent trade union officials who have come to me and said, 'Whatever you do, don't quote my name or where I'm from but, Eric, you are doing a great thing for the trade union movement in this country with this legislation. Because you know what, all I want to be is a shop steward. I want to be a person that looks after the interests of the workers. I have no desire to become a Labor senator, therefore I don't need slush funds, therefore I don't need to have slush funds to boost membership.'




Senator Bilyk:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Abetz is alluding to the fact that he believes all Labor union officials who become senators have been involved in slush funds, and I find that completely and utterly offensive.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  There is no point of order.




Senator ABETZ:
  Well, the former Labor leader that Senator Bilyk helped knife, Ms Gillard, in her exit interview with Slater and Gordon admitted that every union has a slush fund. So, Senator Bilyk, I either take your word or Ms Gillard's, your former celebrated Prime Minister. One or the other must be right or wrong. I will let the public of Australia determine as to whether Senator Bilyk or Ms Gillard was correct, but I am not going to get involved in that debate.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Collins, another former union official. They come into this place thick and fast. The simple fact is this: Ms Gillard said it in her exit interview with Slater and Gordon, 'Every union has a slush fund.' She is either right or wrong. We believe that there should not be this sort of mechanism that is now being shown with the Australian Workers Union and its Victorian 2020 fund that collected $250,000. A union official, using the union's name, collected hundreds of thousands of dollars but never put it through the union books—exactly the trick of Ralph Blewett and Bruce Wilson 20 years earlier. The CFMEU started off a drug and alcohol fund—a very worthy cause. There was $1 million allegedly raised for it from employers and elsewhere. The sad fact is it appears that not one cent has actually been spent on that. But it will be revealed in the royal commission in due course whether or not that has occurred. We then hear about the Electrical Trades Union waterfront mansion for one of their officials and so the list goes on. It seems to us as a government, having taken these issues to the Australian people, that this is the sort of legislation that nearly every union member actually wants because it protects their money.


I have got news for those sitting opposite. As I go around factory floors and other workplaces in Australia, the vast majority of the workers that are actually union members—so it is a majority of a very clear minority—say that they are members of a union not because they want to hold hands and sing Solidarity Forever but because they see their membership as an insurance policy for their own protection. So the relationship is a bit like house insurance: it is a payment they make in the hope they will never have to use it. But you know what? Union members want a proper guarantee that their money will be used for the purposes for which they give it. And that is why insurance companies have robust reporting mechanisms required of them as should registered organisations.


It is passing strange that having announced this legislation as we did before the election, which Labor says is completely unnecessary, Mr Shorten, in one of the most clumsy, flat-footed approaches and indeed panicked by our policy, raced into this place with some legislation which Labor and the Greens rammed through this place without proper consideration, which has now left the reporting requirements in an absolute shambles. Indeed, the trade union movement has been to me requesting that we amend Mr Shorten's legislation because it was so hopeless. The Senate committee looking into our bill suggested we make amendment to the existing legislation to undo the mess Mr Shorten created with the help of those Labor and Green senators sitting opposite. Yet again, it is another example where Labor, in its dying days and in cahoots with the Greens in this place, forced through legislation that was not thought out, that tied people up in red tape serving no useful purpose and then tried to window-dress to overcome the need for what everybody understands is necessary—that is, a more robust supporting system and stronger penalties.


Now we have before this place, as part of this legislation, some amendment to fix up Mr Shorten's mess. Labor and the Greens, I suspect, will be voting down this legislation, which will mean we do not even get the opportunity to clean up Mr Shorten's mess, which, the trade union movement in agreement with the employer organisations believe should be cleaned up. They are on a unity ticket on this but Labor senators opposite, so absolutely committed to ensuring that no robust reporting conditions be applied to unions, will say, 'Bad luck brother and sister'—to use Senator Sterle's language in the union movement. You will have to cop these reporting conditions that will regrettably see shop stewards having to report what their spouse might be earning or what assets they have.


We as a coalition did not ventilate the activities of the Craig Thomsons of this world and the Michael Williamsons of this world or the other activities that are slowly being ventilated but—I have said this before and I will repeat it—the Fairfax Media and the ABC, surprisingly, exposed some of the scams that were operating. They simply asked the question: why shouldn't the honest trade union members, the honest trade union men and women of Australia be protected from all these scams that have now been uncovered and disclosed? Why should they not be protected?


It is interesting that, in all this, we do in fact have the support of such people as Paul Howes of the Australian Workers Union and of Chris Brown. Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson, who are both former presidents of the ACTU, who are both former ministers in a Labor government and who both have had a lifetime of commitment to their service to the trade union movement, see the need for the act of the trade union movement to be cleaned up. If they can see it, why cannot those that are currently holding office, courtesy of the trade union movement in this place, see it as well? If ever there was a conflict of interest writ large it is in relation to those Labor senators in this place, who are, I understand, going to vote down this legislation.


It will be a matter of great regret if this legislation does not get carried. It is legislation that we put out there in lights before the election. We said it was important legislation. We therefore said it would be introduced within the first week of the parliament sitting because it was so important. Can I thank the departmental officials and the parliamentary draftspeople that worked so hard to make sure it was ready for the first week. And here we are in the Senate with Labor and Green senators denying the will of the Australian people, still in full resentment mode of what the Australian people decided on 7 September and in denial of that which their own party elders like Martin Ferguson and Simon Crean have said to them: 'This is basically good legislation. Let it go through and clean up the trade union movement.' Then in relation to the amendments that we are moving to the existing legislation, you do know, those sitting opposite, that those amendments are fundamentally required for the benefit of the trade union movement itself and employer organisations and you are wilfully blocking that and as a result making life exceptionally difficult for the administration of the trade union movement.


We can hear about the terrible things that occurred in a market garden in Western Australia. I simply say to Senator Sterle that the workplace relations legislation and framework in Australia has not changed over the past seven years. These things have happened under Labor's Fair Work regime. You cannot blame the coalition for the atrocities. If what Senator Sterle says is right, and I am willing to accept that, I just remind those opposite that it has all occurred under their watch, under their legislation, under their regime. Bad as it is, condemned as it should be, I ask: how does that relate to getting rid of corruption out of the trade union movement? It is completely and utterly unrelated but a desire to use up the time, because there is no argument against that fundamental proposition, which is, what is the moral difference, what is the material difference, between a company director ripping off shareholders and a union official ripping off members? Why shouldn't the penalty be the same? None of the Labor senators in their contributions have dealt with that issue in any way, shape or form.


We know we have got argument on our side, we know we have got right on our side, we know we have got the people of Australia on our side. The regrettable fact is, and we recognise this, that the Labor Party and the Greens are not on the side of the people of Australia, on the moral side of this debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-05-14,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I want to use the 15 minutes allowed to me in this matter of public interest debate today to talk about the future. Having just heard the previous speaker, can I start by saying that the future will look bright for our country if we can get our finances and our budgets in order. Thanks to the government supported by the previous speaker, Australia was left in a position where we were approaching three quarters of a trillion dollars in debt. It was debt that did not help our productivity. It was debt that very often supported wasteful and ill thought through projects—and we are hearing all about those in the royal commission on the pink batts scheme at the present time.


The difficulties and the stringent measures in last night's budget are there thanks to the Labor Party, who took office just six short years ago with no net debt at all and $20 billion in the bank and who, in a six-year spending spree, managed not only to get rid of the $20 billion in credit but also to run up a debt that is heading towards three quarters of a trillion dollars. Whilst I do not want to dwell on the budget, I do want to talk about the future—and certainly the budget settings displayed and announced last night will help that future.


You may say I am a little parochial in my views on this as it refers to the area where I live, work and play, but I am one of those who sees the future of Australia in the north of our country. That view is there for many reasons. As I say, I live and work in that part of the world. It is a great part of the world, and it is a part of the world that shows promise for the future. It is a part of the world which can take Australia further forward to the heights that I know that Australia can achieve.


We have practically limitless supplies of water in the north of Australia. With the climate changing as it is and as it has done for literally millions of years, we are being told that the north of Australia may well become wetter as the south of Australia becomes drier. I note in passing one of the reasons suggested for the dryness in the south of our continent is the increasing ice cap in Antarctica. That always makes me smile when people talk about global warming—but that is an aside. There are real opportunities for industry and productivity that depend on water and there are a number of very exciting prospects for the better use of water in the north of Australia—and the productivity, wealth and the increase in the standard of living for Australians that that will provide.


Currently the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia is looking very closely at the development of northern Australia and how that could be achieved and what should be done. I am a participating member of that committee. I do not want to in any way pre-empt anything the committee will resolve in its report later this year, but can I say that, having travelled around many parts of the north with the committee, it is heart-lifting to see the enthusiasm, the vision and the energy of people who have appeared before that parliamentary committee with their well thought through, well determined and well investigated ideas and enthusiasm for development of the north. As one who has spent most of my parliamentary career promoting the north, I find that even I—who have been doing this for many years—learned a lot from the submissions that were brought forward, and I see a very good recommendation from that committee coming forward to the government.


Senators will recall that, at the last election, the coalition made a commitment to the preparation of a white paper within 12 months of the election. The joint committee which I have spoken of is feeding into that white paper process, and I am pleased to see that, as promised, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is actually working on a white paper that will set out the way forward for the development of the north. It is not of course going to be a paper that says that within 12 months we are going to build all these roads, build all these dams, open up this new land for productive use, open up new trade routes and open up new universities. Clearly, it is not going to say that, but, hopefully, it will set out a 30- to 40-year program of how we can use Australia's assets and the enthusiasm of our people to build a stronger country by developing northern Australia.


We have had evidence from the sugar industry, for example. Senators will know that the Australian sugar industry generates something like $2 billion in revenue annually. It is a low-cost producer, and it is a major raw sugar exporter, with some $1.7 billion in annual export revenue. Some 80 per cent of the country's sugar is exported, and Australia is the third-largest raw sugar exporter after Brazil and Thailand.


The future for the sugar industry can be bright, with government encouragement. One of the issues confronting the sugar industry now is that there has been a lot of investment made in co-generation plants at various sugar mills, which puts energy into the electricity grid. That is why we have to be very careful in any alteration to the renewable energy targets in the months and years ahead. Certainly, a lot of these sugar mill companies have invested heavily on the basis of what the rules were.


At the present time, the Senate is also conducting an inquiry into the beef industry through a beef levies inquiry, and that is bringing up some very interesting facts and figures about that very significant industry in northern Australia. It is an industry that was almost brought to its knees by the Labor government's insensitive and frankly quite stupid decision to ban live cattle exports for a couple of years, but it does have a great future and work has to be done to give that industry every encouragement.


Tourism, obviously, is an industry that figures very prominently in the economies of northern Australia. We have great assets in the Kakadu park, the desert outback, the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropics—all of those natural assets do bring tourists to our country, and we continue to look after them very well and I congratulate all those agencies who play their part in the protection of those wonderful natural assets. At the same time, we are able—because we are clever enough to do it, these days—to make sure we can have sustainable and sensible development, like the Abbot Point coal refinery, in waters close to the Barrier Reef; we can do that because we know how to do it, and we can do it carefully and in a way that enhances Australia's overall economy.


I want to mention briefly James Cook University and Charles Darwin University, two northern based universities that are doing a wonderful job in educating not only Australians but also people from nearby countries. They are concentrating on areas which are relevant to northern Australia and therefore relevant to the tropic zone around the world, which contains some 60 per cent of the world's population. JCU is doing a great deal of work in looking at that tropic zone and exporting that knowledge and science to other parts of the world.


We are looking at a defence white paper in the not too distant future, and I certainly hope that the defence white paper being brought down by this government will seriously look at the absolute necessity of having our defence bases, our defence facilities, up in the area where they are more likely to be used. That is why I have been a long-term advocate for getting rid of some of the capital ships out of Garden Island in Sydney Harbour and moving them up to the north, where they will be there for border protection, there to defend Australia, and there to use when natural calamities require Australia to send in the troops, so to speak. With the 3rd Brigade at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, Australia's largest Army barracks and the area that will contain the maritime force which will be using the new LHDs, I think that there is a real argument for additional capital ships to be based in Gladstone, Townsville, Mackay, Cairns—where Australia's second-largest east coast naval base currently is—or Darwin, or even Broome over in the west. So I hope that is being carefully thought about in the defence white paper.


As well, it is important that our Air Force is prominent in the north. For years, the Caribou squadrons were based at Garbutt Air Force Base in Townsville. As to the replacement, the C-27J Spartan, planning for its career started off in, I think, Richmond near Newcastle. Some think it should go into Amberley, but I cannot see why it should not be based where the Caribous were. The Spartans are replacing the Caribou, and therefore should be based in the north—again, closer to where they are ever likely to be used.


On another occasion when I have the opportunity I will expand upon a push for a sensible zone tax rearrangement and review in northern Australia. Back in the dying days of the Second World War, the then Labor government introduced a zone tax rebate to help develop the remoter parts of Australia, and at the time much of the north fitted the category. It was introduced by the Labor government, recognising the additional costs of living in those areas that are remote from the capital cities of the states and of our nation. That requirement is still there—the cost of living is greater. I have to say, in passing, that I do not know that the reintroduction of the fuel excise is going to help in this regard, but that fuel price increase, which will impact most heavily on people remote from the capital cities, is something that needs to be factored in to the need for a review of the zone tax rebate system and to make it more relevant now and to bring it back to the sort of policy front that it had at the time it was introduced back in the late 1940s.


So, with last night's budget setting the scene and the parameters for a prosperous Australia into the future, I certainly look to northern Australia being a part of that and doing its part in building a bigger and better society for all Australians.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:03):  My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to Prime Minister Abbott's pre-election promise:


We are about getting rid of taxes, not imposing new taxes.


Can the minister confirm that the new $7 GP tax and $5 prescription fee that families will pay are broken promises? Why is this Prime Minister forcing families to pay for his broken promise by making it harder to take children to the doctor and buy the medicine they need?

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:06):  Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise to the Australian people: no cuts to health. Can the minister confirm that ripping tens of billions of dollars from our public hospitals over the next decade, including $3 billion in the next four years, is a broken promise? Why is this Prime Minister making Australians pay for his broken promise with longer waiting times, fewer beds, fewer doctors and fewer nurses?

I refer the minister again to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise of no cuts to health. Can the minister explain: was that a solemn promise or not a solemn promise? Can the minister confirm that the Prime Minister is in fact breaking that promise by dismantling Medicare and the support it provides to millions of Australians?

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2014-05-14,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (14:03):  The purpose of this budget is to build a strong, prosperous Australia and a safe, secure future. MBS expenditure has been growing at an unsustainable rate. Ten years ago it was $10 billion. Today it is $19 billion. It is projected, over the next decade, to reach $38 billion. Any sensible and responsible government knows that we have to place that expenditure on a sustainable footing, that we have to ensure that Australia can afford a strong Medicare into the future. We are asking patients to make a small contribution to the cost of their care to their GP while still protecting those that are most vulnerable. We are keeping faith with our commitment to the Australian people. The fundamental action is being able to get the economy back on track. We made a promise to the Australian people that we would fix the economy, that we would ensure we had a safe and secure future for this nation, and that is what we will be doing.




Senator Cameron:
  Why did you lie?



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Cameron:
  She is lying to the Australian people.

 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (14:06):  Unlike the previous government, this government is going to deliver a responsible budget. Indeed, in relation to the previous question, I note that the Shadow Assistant Treasurer has supported the co-payment.


In relation to hospitals, the Commonwealth funding for hospitals will still grow significantly—from $14 billion in 2013-14 to $18.9 billion in 2017-18 under the coalition government.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, my point of order is about relevance. Again, the specific question is about the broken promise and cuts to health. The minister has not referred to that question in her answer. I would ask you to draw that to the minister's attention.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (14:09):  At the last election the Australian people elected the coalition government to fix the budget—to fix the economic mess that the previous Labor government had left. Unlike the previous Labor government, this government realises that the Australian people expect us to deliver them a future that is sustainable.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, again my point of order is on relevance. The minister has gone nowhere close to the direct question and I would ask you to draw her  attention to what the question was.



The PRESIDENT:  I do draw the minister's attention to the question. The minister has 33 seconds remaining.




Senator NASH:
  The greatest question facing the Australian people at the moment is the fact that this government is the answer when it comes to delivering a sustainable health system.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, my point of order is again on relevance. The greatest question before the minister is the one we have asked. If we could draw the attention of the minister to that question.



The PRESIDENT:  At the 33-second mark I did draw the minister's attention to the question. The minister still has 21 seconds. The minister needs to address the question.




Senator NASH:
  When it comes to the health system in this nation it is the coalition government that is going to deliver a sustainable health system into the future. The Australian people elected us at the last election to do that, knowing that it was only this government that was going to do that. (Time expired)

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Human Services) (14:49):  I thank Senator McKenzie for her continued interest in the important area of education. What I am able to tell the Senate about this historical higher education reform is that it will ensure that more Australians are able to receive a world-class higher education as well as wider opportunities through diploma and other pathway courses, and it will ensure that Australia's higher education is not left behind in what is an increasingly competitive international environment.


For the first time ever, the Australian government will provide direct financial support to all students studying at any registered Australian higher education provider such as a public university, a private university, a TAFE or a college for any accredited under graduate course including higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas, associate degrees and degrees. For the first time ever, there will be direct financial support to all students in those categories. What those changes provide is an historic pathway into higher education for Australians. And a lot of those Australians will come from lower socioeconomic areas and regional areas. What that means by 2018 is world-changing for this country.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Resume your seat, Senator Payne. You are entitled to be heard in silence. When silence resumes, you will be called upon to continue the answer.





Senator PAYNE:
  What that means by 2018 is that the reforms will see the Australian government supporting over 80,000 more students as they pursue the best course for them. The government will also offer HECS style trade support loans for apprentices from 1 July 2014 that will encourage more people to take up a trade and complete their qualification. Like HELP loans for university students, they will only be repayable once apprentices are earning a decent income. We are going to introduce a massive new Commonwealth scholarship scheme which will boost equity of access for disadvantaged university students from low socioeconomic backgrounds— (Time expired)

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Human Services) (14:52):  I thank Senator McKenzie for the supplementary. Most importantly, from 1 January 2016 there will be no restriction on the number of subsidised places available to students who are enrolling in these higher education courses. This reform responds to the recommendation in the 2008 Bradley review of higher education. That was for a demand-driven funding system to be implemented for all undergraduate courses. What the more recent Norton report has also recommended is that sub-bachelor higher education courses should also be included in the demand-driven system. So we will see options dramatically expanded for Australians, pathways for students who are less prepared for university while funding an enormous range of qualifications that then lead straight to jobs. Students who really need the support can prepare better for university rather than necessarily going into degree courses before they are ready. The UWS College is a great example of this particular aspect of the policy. We are going to support students into pathway courses. (Time expired)

 (New South Wales—Minister for Human Services) (14:53):  Thank you, Senator McKenzie. This is a fantastic piece of news in the higher education space because it means that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are going to have access to a new Commonwealth scholarship system which will help them meet the costs associated with higher education, particularly students, as Senator McKenzie would especially identify with, from regional Australia.

The PRESIDENT:  Senator Payne is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator PAYNE:
  Those regional students often face additional challenges. They are going to be offered by higher education institutions with 500 or more Commonwealth subsidised students who increase their revenue as a result of the deregulation of student contributions. We are going to require universities and other higher ed providers to spend a dollar in every five dollars of additional revenue raised to the new Commonwealth scholarships. Universities and other providers will provide tailored individualised support to students which includes need based scholarships which will meet the cost of living, fee exemptions, mentoring, tutorial support and assistance and other critical points in their study.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (15:09):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the 2014-15 Budget.


Budgets are about choices. They are about priorities. A government's budget is a window on the priorities of that government, and this budget fails the fairness test and it fails the truth test.


Mr Abbott said in the election campaign last year that there would be no new taxes. Last night's budget saw the beginning of the dismantling of Medicare, where we are taxing people now to pay for the promises of this government. Last night saw the introduction of a $7 co-payment just to visit the GP. It saw the introduction of $5 for every prescription that that GP may prescribe. It provided for another co-payment of $7 for any X-ray, for any pathology, for any other ancillary services that that doctor may wish the patient to have. And we have heard from the other side that $7 is 'just a cup of coffee'. Well, that is not the case for people who are on a pension. It is not the case for people who are on low incomes, and it is not the case for families who may have many children who are unwell. But let me refer to Kasy Chambers, the Executive Director of Anglicare, who puts that in some context. She says:


… $7 is very different to different groups in the community. Seven dollars to someone on Newstart is the equivalent of $43.17 for those on the average male wage, or $63.26 for those on a salary of $120,000.


She says it is:


Certainly enough to make people think more than twice about that visit.


What will be the result of the imposition of these taxes on our health system—this dismantling of our Medicare? The result will be that people will visit the doctor less. They will be less compliant with their medication. That will lead to worse health outcomes in the future.


And who are the people who will reduce their access to health services? The research is clear: it is the poor, including our pensioners; it is the chronically ill; it is people with disability; it is people who are living with mental illness; it is people in remote areas and it is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The health of all Australians will suffer, but it will affect the poor and the sick more than everyone else in our society. It is hard to get people to attend the doctor for an annual check-up, but a GP tax will mean that fewer people will attend the doctor for those annual check-ups that are so beneficial to their health in the long run—check-ups that will identify diabetes early or identify cancers that can be cured. Those check-ups save the health budget in the long term and they save the health of people in our society and our community.


Preventive health measures save lives and they save money in future budgets. That is why it is, frankly, plain crazy to cut programs that will increase physical activity, particularly in our young children, that will tackle the obesity problem that is looming large. It is crazy to remove programs that will improve healthy eating, as we have already seen from this minister. We need to ensure that we do all we can to ensure that the health of our community is given the best advice, and that is why the Australian National Preventive Health Agency was so beneficial; it was doing such good work to ensure that the health of our society would continue to improve.


But the big killer in this budget, and the big killer in society, as we all know, is tobacco smoking. This budget reduces the programs to reduce smoking in our community. This is not the time to remove effort to stop people smoking. I commend ministers Roxon and Plibersek for the work that they did in government to ensure that the numbers of Australians smoking cigarettes were reduced. But now there is a reduction in the program to ensure that people know that they should not smoke, and I am afraid it will lead to poorer health outcomes.


This is a bad budget. It hits the sick and the poor the hardest. It will result in higher costs in the long term. It will result in worse health outcomes for all Australians. It has broken a solemn promise, of no new cuts and no cuts to health. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2014-05-14,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (15:14):  Mr Deputy President, you and I are both students of history. In just six short years, Labor conjured up a projected debt of two-thirds of $1 trillion and just 6½ years ago the coalition had about $40 billion in the bank. If anyone had said 6½ years ago that even the Labor Party could conjure nearly $700,000 million in projected debt, no-one in this country would have believed that.


Yet that is what they have done. They have created the problem and, when we try to solve it and come up with some solutions, they complain. No-one believes this budget is comfortable. I accept that there is pain in the community. There are no easy choices in this budget. It is difficult. We are not doing this because we enjoy it, we are not doing it because it is easy; we are doing it because we have to do it.


Let us face it: this budget is electorally hazardous. Every political instinct, every political impulse, every opinion poll would tell you: don't do it. Every opinion poll would say: 'Take the easy option and do what the Labor Party and the Greens always do; just chuck it on the credit card, because the voters of today won't feel the pain, neither will the politicians.' That is the easy way out. It is typical of the Left here in Australia and throughout the developed world to throw the debt and the responsibility to the next generation, who cannot yet vote.


That is the easy way out, the cowardly way out. While of course we know and understand that the Labor Party and the Greens know nothing about economics, we always thought they had a social conscience—that they may have no idea about economics, but they have some sort of social conscience. Now we know this: that they are quite happy to throw the debt on to our children and grandchildren and those yet unborn for the sake of their own electoral hides. It is absolutely disgraceful. If the history of the Western world has said anything in the last 30 years it is that governments must say no, enough is enough and that generations must live within their means.


The history of Western Europe is littered with this lot, every single interest group—all the rent seekers, all the cronies—seeking money from the government. And they always give in. Do you know why? Because it is the easy thing to do: 'Put it on the credit card, we will get re-elected. Forget about tomorrow, forget about our children and our grandchildren.' That makes me sick. 


I get this hypocrisy every day and I bet you I will get it for the next several months: 'You're cutting this, you're cutting that.' We are doing it for one very simple reason: so that our children and our grandchildren and those yet to be born will not have to face a mountain of debt. If you want proof of this, you have only to look across at Western Europe. Quite frankly, if I were a Greek teenager I would want to shoot every politician and half the electorate because the government have spent their inheritance.


You owe me an apology, Mr Deputy President. I look forward to the budget in reply on Thursday. Can you imagine Mr Shorten delivering a credible return to surplus? When they were in government Labor kept talking about a return to surplus. It was just a chimera, it was a fraud and it was a joke, just like all their Social Democratic partners in Western Europe. The problem with Social Democrats is that they have no credibility on this issue. Labor have always left Australia further in debt for the last 113 years and they have still not come up with a way to pay off debt. They sit here and whinge and carp about what we are doing. We are doing it for one simple reason: to ensure that our kids and grandchildren have a future.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:19):  How could I possibly disagree with that sort of proposition? What we were being told was that, suddenly, there was a budget emergency. Remember that line? There was going to be a budget emergency that had to be fixed. Where is the evidence? On the question of debt, look at what we have got in this country: a AAA rating. And what is our international performance on the question of debt and deficits? Australia has a remarkably good economic record. We are amongst the world's leaders when it comes to economic management and that is what governments around the world have looked to. But not this government. 


What they needed was an alibi, an alibi for what was their pre-election mantra that there would be no cuts. Remember that? No cuts to education, no cuts to health and no cuts to the ABC. What do we see after the election? Of course, we see a return to the famous old coalition fantasy of core and non-core promises. That is what we heard today: a return to the John Howard schema of core and non-core promises. 


We have a position whereby the government are adopting the ruthless Thatcherite policies. They are seeking to pursue an ideological agenda of hatred against people they believe to be their political opponents. They have measures particularly aimed at the most vulnerable in our community, people who are the poorest, less powerful and not able to defend themselves.


This is a government that always seeks to advance the interests of the wealthy and the powerful. Now we have the ultimate hypocrisy: this Faustian pact that we are presented with, the suggestion that this Senate should embrace the prospect of actually gutting Medicare, one of the great achievements of this nation, in return for a medical research fund.


As the German legend of Faust is maintained, the scholar who was unhappy with the world sought to make a pact with the devil to secure great knowledge, we see that that is exactly what we have here: a Faustian pact being presented by this government to try to blackmail the Senate into accepting the gutting of Medicare, a proposition that I contend this Senate will not accept. We have a fraud being presented to medical researchers across this country—a fraud because the government knows that this parliament will not accept the gutting of Medicare because of the importance of Medicare to the Australian people and the welfare of this nation.


When it comes to education more generally, we have a series of measures. Once again, the government said before the election, 'There will be no cuts.' After the election, we have over $5 billion worth of cuts to higher education. There is even their mention of privatising the provision of education. The additional 80,000 places that they spoke of today come at a price. There is $1.1 billion in savings to underwrite that measure. We see a government that are cutting back the CSIRO, cutting back maritime research, cutting back our nuclear agency and cutting back Geoscience Australia. The government are making it much more difficult to advance research in this country, they are undermining science and at the same time they are suggesting that they are doing something else. There is a perfidy about the way in which this government seek to present their case—a perfidy that the Australian people will see through. My colleague Senator Mason pointed out that the political damage that they are doing to themselves as a consequence of their lies, deceit and treacherous behaviour during the election will be exposed to all those with eyes to see.


In terms of Indigenous affairs—and my colleague will talk more on this issue in a moment—the lies that were told about the attitude towards Indigenous affairs are plain for all to see now as a consequence of what the government actually have done as distinct from what they said they would do prior to the election. The real question is: what is the trust deficit? The trust deficit as a result of the budget last night has grown dramatically. We all understand the consequences for political parties that embark upon that sort of deceit, that sort of dishonesty, that sort of lie. That is exactly what this government has brought upon itself.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:24):  There certainly has been a very large level of hypocrisy, deceit, perfidy and fraud perpetrated in this chamber and elsewhere about the budget in the last 24 hours, but it has all come from the opposition benches, not from the government. As Senator Cormann pointed out, this budget is tough and fair and it is designed to make us more prosperous and more resilient. It is designed to get the economy back on track. Yet from the opposition all we get is half-truths and outright deceit in terms of what the measures in this budget actually achieve.


I was bemused, I suppose, this morning listening to poor old Mr Bill Shorten trying to develop a mythical family on $100,000 a year, with two children aged 12 and five. He tried to say that this family would be worse off. My first reaction was: why did they wait seven years for the second kid? Nevertheless, Mr Shorten no doubt will have manufactured this family. He does not mention that, if the opposition were to support our carbon tax legislation, this family would be $550 a year better off than they currently are. No, the opposition does not want to let a fact get in the way of their discussion. We had Senator McLucas making the outrageous claim that we have cut $377 million out of preventative health. We have not cut $377 million out of preventative health. We have moved one of the useless bureaucratic agencies that the previous government established back to where it belongs: the Department of Health, which had previously done excellent work in the area of preventative health and will continue to do so.


In the area of Indigenous affairs, as Senator Scullion has pointed out, there has been a 4½ per cent cut across the board, but if anyone here wants to suggest that there was no waste within the way the Labor government went about attempting to deliver services to the Indigenous community in Australia, that is a complete joke. As Senator Scullion pointed out, they built the childcare centres but did not worry about where the childcare workers were going to come from. It is completely typical of the way this government carried on.


I looked at some of the comments in today's papers. One of the key focuses was how to address the huge explosion of spending that was due to hit the budget in 2017. As Senator Mason pointed out, who could have imagined what a Labor government could do to a surplus of $40 million in the bank, but, goodness, we sure know now what a Labor government can do. It seems to be in their DNA to overspend and have no idea about how to implement. We are even getting evidence of that from various court cases going on at the moment, some with tragic results.


Why was there going to be a huge explosion in 2017? It was former Treasurer Swan's pathetic attempt, time after time, to argue that one day he would produce a budget surplus. In his last budget, when it appeared that the Labor government knew the writing was on the wall—that they were going to lose government—they came up with apparently wonderful policy after apparently wonderful policy which they did not fund past the forward estimates. They were unfunded promises. Now they want to carry on about cuts to things that never existed as well as cuts that we have been forced to make due to their attitudes, their spending, their waste, their inability to implement and their inability to evaluate what they do and how they do it.


The Canberra Times today says:


… the measures are well crafted, the numbers internally consistent and coherent. This budget invests in future sustainability …


But it mentions that there will be short-term pain. We do not apologise for that. It is not our fault that there is short-term pain. It is the opposition— (Time expired)

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (15:29):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Scullion to questions on Indigenous Affairs relating to the budget asked in question time today. I am sure we all remember the media coverage our Prime Minister received when he proclaimed that he aspired to be 'the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Australians'. This budget confirms that what this government says and what they do are two different things. Some of our most vulnerable people in this country will be hurt the hardest. This is a budget that well and truly widens the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. My electorate of the Northern Territory has the highest proportion of Aboriginal people in Australia and, make no mistake, they will be hurt more than people anywhere else by these savage cuts. Tony Abbott promised to be the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Well, it is now clear that he was not telling us the truth. Indigenous Australians put their trust in Tony Abbott, and they are being repaid by having half a billion dollars slashed from Indigenous Affairs. 


Senator Scullion stood in the Senate today and said there will not be any impact on front-line services. That shows just how delusion this government is, especially on the matter of Indigenous Australians. Essential front-line services will be critically affected, including in the areas of education, health, legal services, art programs, Indigenous radio stations, employment programs and more. This has been done under the sneaky cover of `streamlining' and leaves service providers out in the cold. Across this country, 38 child and family services for Indigenous families will be cut.


This budget also confirms cuts of $15million to the National Congress, which has over 7,500 individual and organisational members. Thanks to the efforts of the previous federal Labor government and the Northern Territory governments, the Northern Territory is the only jurisdiction currently meeting the Closing the Gap targets. This budget puts that achievement at serious risk.


Indigenous Australians make up 85 per cent of the prison population in the Northern Territory. This is a shocking statistic, yet this budget will only result in that percentage increasing. Providing legal service for Indigenous Australians is paramount. Access to legal aid is something most Australians rightly take for granted. It would appear that this government considers Indigenous Australians to be 'out of sight, out of mind'. So far, the self-professed Prime Minister for Indigenous Australians has given the green light to racism while slamming the brakes on Indigenous programs and, worse, takings us backwards. There are also cuts to local governments, which will mean more pain for those in the bush, where the regional councils already struggle to raise their own revenue in the face of so much need.


The year 2013 was the most violent in the history of the Northern Territory, with the majority of victims being women. Domestic violence in the Northern Territory increased by 22 per cent last year. An Aboriginal woman is 80 times more likely than other Territorians to be admitted to hospital as a result of assault. I have said it before and I will say it over and over and over again: this is a statistic that every Australian should be made aware of, and be embarrassed by. But it seems to fall on deaf ears on the other side of the House. Given that statistic, it is a national disgrace that this government has seen fit to cut family violence prevention programs. Ultimately, the government is tolerating the unacceptable violence that women in the Territory suffer. This is a message Senator Scullion will need to communicate to his constituents. This was his chance to influence a budget to help Indigenous Australians. No matter the spin coming from the other side, this promise has been broken—like so many other promises that this budget has broken.


But it doesn't stop there. The cuts to tertiary education will also impact on widening a gap that we are meant to be actively taking part in bipartisan efforts to close. One of the best achievements of the previous Labor government was the establishment of the Northern Territory Medical School at Charles Darwin University. We face a doctor shortage in the Northern Territory, and developing our own home-grown doctors is the best way to address it. This program encouraged local doctors and nurses to provide their much needed skills in the remote bush regions of the Territory. This facility should be expanded, not cut, but instead this government has announced a cut of $400,000 over four years.


The Prime Minister has broken the fundamental commitment he made to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples before the election. He said: 'Should the coalition win the election, Aboriginal people will be at the heart of a new government in word and in deed.' Closing the Gap requires more than words. Whether we succeed or fail will depend on a relationship of trust and support between the Commonwealth government and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:01):  Last night the Abbott government launched a vicious attack on low- and middle-income earners in Australia. The Abbott government's first budget attacks Australians who work hard. It attacks families struggling with the cost of living. It attacks parents who want a better future for their children. It attacks young people studying to improve their skills and to strengthen the nation's future. It attacks the elderly, age pensioners and self-funded retirees. It attacks Indigenous Australians by widening, not closing the gap, and it attacks the weak and the vulnerable: people who are sick, people with disabilities and their carers.


Budgets are a demonstration of a government's values and its priorities. The decisions governments make in budgets reveal what sort of country they want—what sort of economy and what sort of society. The decisions made in budgets also reveal the character of those who lead governments. Revealed in last night's budget is a government with the wrong values and the wrong priorities. Revealed in last night's budget is a government which has only been in office for eight months but which is light-years out of touch with low- and middle-income Australia, a government which denies the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families, a government which is hitting middle Australia hard yet is giving $50,000 to millionaires for having a baby.


And also revealed in last night's budget is a government which has collectively failed the test of character: a Prime Minister exposed as telling serial lies to the public, a Prime Minister breaking not just one promise but virtually every promise he made, a Prime Minister who sat behind his Treasurer last night, smirking and gloating as every cut and every tax hike was announced. Mr Abbott promised no cuts to health and education, and now he is cutting $80 billion from schools and hospitals. Mr Abbott promised no new taxes; now he is hiking petrol tax, imposing new GP and medicine taxes and increasing the top marginal rate of income tax. Mr Abbott promised no change to pensions; now he is cutting pensions. Mr Abbott promised no increase to university fees; now he is increasing university fees for students and their families. And Mr Abbott promised no cuts to the ABC or SBS, and now this budget will cut funding to the public broadcasters by $240 million, and regional services will be the first to go.


Mr Abbott said his government would not slash foreign aid, but this budget slashes foreign aid by $16 billion—a move which will hurt the world's poorest people. As the head of World Vision, Mr Tim Costello has said:


This is devastating because there is a disproportionate impact on those who are most vulnerable.


There has been virtually no promise unbroken and no stone unturned in the Prime Minister's search for ways of hurting people. You have to search far and wide to find a promise that this Prime Minister has not broken.


And it is not just the Prime Minister who has failed the character test. We have a Treasurer who does not understand or care about people who live far from the leafy environs of Sydney's North Shore. We have a finance minister who promised less tax and now he has circulated budget papers showing the government will lift its tax take by $96 billion over the next four years. This Treasurer and this finance minister were caught out puffing on celebratory cigars after putting together a budget that hikes taxes, cuts pensions and cuts family payments. This Treasurer was caught out dancing in his office to the song Best day of my life after putting together a budget that slashes funding from schools and hospitals and paves the way for an increase in the GST.


In question time today the Minister for Finance claimed this was an 'honest budget.' On the contrary; this is a dishonest and deceitful budget. If Joe Hockey had stood up last night and given an honest budget speech, this is what he would have said. This is the speech Mr Hockey, if he had given an honest speech, would have given:


Tonight the Abbott government is showing its true colours. We went to the election last year promising no new taxes, no cuts to schools, no cuts to hospitals, no cuts to pensions and no cuts to family payments.


Well, those were lies.


We inherited a budget with one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios amongst all advanced economies and with a AAA credit rating from all three international ratings agencies.


Then we spent months fabricating a fictional budget emergency to justify breaking every promise we made.


So, in tonight's budget we unveil a comprehensive plan to hit low- and middle-income earners at every stage of their lives.


No matter how hard you work, or how much effort you put in to better yourself and your children, or how much you deserve a helping hand, this government will attack you with higher costs and by ripping away support.


The Abbott government's cuts will hit child care, they will hit school children, they will hit university students, they will hit people in the workforce, and they will hit working families.


The government's tax hikes will hit people when they go to the doctor, when they go to the chemist, and when they go to the hospital.


We will hit people when they go to the petrol pump and we will hit them when they go to the supermarket.


For those struck down by illness or disability and for those who lose their jobs, this government will cut social security, replacing the helping hand with a slap in the face.


For those who have retired after paying taxes all their life, this government will cut the age pension and make people work until they are 70.


For self-funded retirees, this government will give out more Commonwealth seniors health cards with one hand, but with the other hand we will slash the concessions and benefits the card entitles you to.


And when advancing years and declining health see you move into a nursing home, this government will not forget you either. It will honour your great age and your contribution to society by cutting aged-care funding by more than half a billion dollars.


And when we are finished with you, we will light up our Cubans and we will dance in our offices.


Because, with this first budget, this Abbott government is looking after the well-off, but for everyone else it is delivering broken promises, increased costs, higher taxes and no hope for the future.


With this first budget the Abbott government is implementing the coalition's real agenda, that is, the one we hid from you at the last election.


It is an agenda for making this nation more unfair, less equal and less caring.


If the Treasurer was, indeed, giving an honest speech last night that is what he would have said, because this budget is a cruel assault on middle Australia. It will cost Australians and it will hit Australians every time they need to see a doctor and every time they fill up their car with petrol. It will cost Australians when they send their children to school or university. It will cost Australians who rely on family payments and pensions to make ends meet.


We are being lectured by this government about how important this budget is for children, how important this budget is for the next generation. So important are the children of this nation to this government that they will ensure that you have to pay more to take your sick child to a doctor, you will have to pay more to get your sick child a prescription, and your child will have less money at their local public school and less money invested in their local public hospital. This government is saying, 'We care about children, but only some children.' If you are a child of a middle-income family or a poorer family, well, guess what? you are on your own.


This budget fatally undermines fairness and decency in our society, and it is a budget that will damage the strength of our nation and the future of our economy. That is why those on this side of the chamber will fight every step of the way against the unfairness that is at the heart of this budget.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:11):  The age of hypocrisy is with us, and it will be here whilst this opposition is on the other side. The question of the age of entitlement has been raised by Treasurer Hockey, and it caused me to reflect on when the age of entitlement began. For those young enough and, perhaps, for those whose memories go back, the age of entitlement in this country commenced with then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. It was during the Whitlam years, and from the Whitlam years, that in this country we saw the creation of, and then the maintenance of, the age of entitlement. We saw a Whitlam government that said to everybody—whether it was with money that they had, or with money that they borrowed, or, indeed, with money that they were to illegally borrow offshore from one Khemlani and his scaly mates—that the age of entitlement in this country started. I think it is absolutely amazing. It is good fortune, indeed, that Mr Whitlam lived long enough to see a government worse than his own. That government has been the last six years of the Rudd, followed by the Gillard, followed by the Rudd governments in this country.


When I speak of the age of hypocrisy, I find it absolutely amazing that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, in fact, the then finance minister of this country during a Labor government, could come in here and lead the speeches on behalf of the opposition about apparent vicious attacks on low- and middle-income Australians. The age of entitlement is over. It started with the Whitlam era and it is over with the Abbott and Hockey terms.


I can explain to you, for those who are not knowledgeable in this area, that in 2007 this Labor Party inherited no net debt in this country. We were probably the only developed country in the world that had no net debt. It had $20 billion to $30 billion on account of taxpayers' money. Mr Costello, after having paid back the $96 billion of Mr Keating's debt, then had some $6 billion of saved interest which he could spread into the Australian economy at the time. Where are we now in contrast to that no deficit, no debt and no interest being paid? Indeed, there was about $1 billion a year interest coming in. Isn't that amazing that an Australian government could ever have $1 billion of interest coming in?


Let us contrast that with what Labor left us in September last year. There was $190-plus billion of accumulated deficits and there was a debt rushing to $667 billion. But the figure that I want people to focus on is that we are currently paying interest alone of nearly $1 billion a month.


Let me put that into perspective for people: that is $30 million a day, every day of the year. What does it equate to? It costs $15 million to build the new primary school that is close to my office. A new primary school in Australia every 12 hours is what we are foregoing as a result of paying the debt. The new Fiona Stanley Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Perth, cost two months worth of interest on the debt—not repayment of the debt but interest on the debt. Imagine that, a new teaching hospital in every major city in this country every two months. But no, that money has been foregone as a result of the haphazardness, the hypocrisy and the poor management by the then Labor government. But worse than all that is the fact that what they squandered was borrowed money, money from lower-income families, money from middle-income families, money from high-income families and money from business. They borrowed against the future grandchildren of this country. And Senator Wong has the audacity to come in here this afternoon and talk about a vicious attack on low- and middle-income Australians when what the Labor government left us with was debt into the future and interest payments well and truly taking away from the very needs of all Australians, but particularly low- and middle-income Australians.


The opposition, together with the Greens, have in this place twice now refused to allow this government to do what it said it would do in a mandate to the Australian people and that was to get rid of the carbon tax. Which families are those most affected? The lower- and middle-income families, who would immediately have a $550 per year burden lifted from their shoulders in direct costs apart from all of the other indirect costs that we see coming through.


If you wish me to be specific about what this government did provide in the budget last night, Mr Kevin Andrews, the finest minister that this country has probably had—certainly in recent times in the social services area—delivered $19.3 billion to support families with the cost of living through family tax benefits. So we apparently have, from Senator Wong, a vicious attack on low incomes. There will be $19 billion for families through the family tax benefit—targeted, however, to those who actually need it. There will be $28.6 billion to maintain current childcare rebates and childcare benefits. The paid parental leave scheme paid for by business, not paid for by the tax payer, will help women have their children and spend that necessary time with them before they go back into the workforce. There will be a new $750 annual supplement for single parents for each child aged six to 12 years. Single parent families will receive $750. That will benefit some 86,000 families—through you, Mr Deputy President, to Senator Siewert, who has an interest in this.


The family tax benefit part B for children under six years of age will phase out but it will have a grandfathering clause. From 1 July 2015, we will see the primary earner threshold for families to be eligible for family tax benefit part B reduced from $150,000 to $100,000. It is a large family supplement that recognises those families with four or more children. Child care, as I mentioned, will receive $28.6 billion.


Recognising the importance of volunteerism in civil society in this country, the government has announced that we will abolish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, a body that simply put red tape around the very necessary and voluntary work of so many people in our communities. The government is investing $6 million over four years to re-establish the community business partnership to promote the culture of giving and volunteering, which we know is so often directed at low- and middle-income earners. For the aged, there will be strategies to keep people in their homes. Ninety-two per cent of aged people do not go in to aged care. Opportunities and funding will keep people in their homes where they want to be.


In the education space, there will be $20,000 loans for young people to do apprenticeships. We will increase the opportunities for young people to get access to universities through Commonwealth scholarships and the like. We see right through this budget the excellence of the Abbott government and we also see the fact that the age of entitlement is indeed complete— (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-05-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:20):  Well, there is probably one thing that I agree with the government about—that is, that this budget has changed and will change society. But it will be for the worst, by far for the worst. I think Senator Back must have been reading different documents to the ones we have been reading. Oh yeah, single parents are going to get $750 extra—when you have taken $3,000 off them, when you have taken the indexation off them and when you have taken the education supplement, which, by the way, they just got back in March, off them. No, single parents will not be better off. I can tell you that, for sure.


This is after you dumped single parents onto Newstart. You have not fixed Newstart or raised it so that people can stop living in poverty. What this budget will do is drive young Australians, older Australians, single parents and the most vulnerable even deeper into poverty. Some of them are already struggling and living in poverty. This will drive far more people into poverty and drive those that are already in poverty into deep and persistent disadvantage, which has intergenerational impacts that will take a long time for these families to recover from.


These cuts take out over $12 billion from low-income earners—from families, pensioners, single parents and young people—and overshadow the other aspects of this budget. This is a fundamental change in our community to make it a much tougher community, to make these people suffer, because that is what this government is trying to do. It is almost as if they deliberately sat down and thought about how to make it the toughest for the most vulnerable members of our community. Let me tell you, you succeeded. How could you conscionably think that it is acceptable to take young people off Newstart for six months and give them no means of support? That will change our community. Those young people will have nothing. They will not be able to pay for any medicines, for going to the doctor, for any absolutely necessary things. What are they supposed to do? Just under 30, go back and live with mum and dad, come and go from mum and dad when they get back onto Work for the Dole? It is on top of your normal six-week waiting period, then you get six months waiting period with no payment, then you get Work for the Dole for up to 25 hours and then you are back off again, living on nothing. How do you pay for food? How do you pay your rent? How do you pay for the absolute necessities of life? You can't. That is a mean, cruel and harsh society. Is that your vision? That is what you are going to achieve. It is not a vision, by the way, that we, the Greens, share and we never, ever will. 


How does this government think it is going to be building a better society? Who is doing the heavy lifting? It is the most vulnerable: older Australians, younger Australians, single parents and the vulnerable—that is who is doing the heavy lifting. As I said, single parents are copping cuts all over the place. Younger people will be far worse off. They will have the compulsory job readiness activities for those who can find work. It is almost as if the government is sitting there thinking, 'All these young people are just sitting there on the couch collecting their easy welfare.' Have they never seen how hard it is for young people to find work? They are not out of work because they want to be, they are out of work because there are no jobs. So just making them poorer and dropping them literally into poverty, because they will have no means of support, how do you think that is going to make it easy to find work? How do you think they are going to find clothes to even turn up for an interview? How do you think they are going to be employed if they have no proper attire to even go for an interview? I asked the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Senator Fifield, yesterday what evidence he had that living in poverty provides an extra incentive for people to find work. He could not provide one because there is none. The evidence shows that in fact dropping people into poverty provides yet another barrier to employment. These are demeaning policies. They are designed to have the deserving and the undeserving, and if you are unfortunate in this country, from now on you are the undeserving. 


The government had made their promise to pensioners and now they think that Australians will be fooled to think that they have kept it. They have raised the retirement age by 2035. They will be changing indexation of the pension and it will make up to $100 difference a fortnight, but it will be after 2017. In the meantime there are lots of other little cuts that are already going to impact on older Australians. 


This is cruel and it is mean—and I have not even started touching yet on the impacts on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. First off, the government have taken $534 million out of the budget because they are supposed to be getting the administration better. The problem here is that the budget conveniently does not say which programs are surviving and which programs are not. Aboriginal organisations have got a letter that says, 'Well, we have made these cuts and we are making a decision about which programs and contracts will continue for, say, six months or 12 months. Hang by the phone, folks, and we will tell you whether in less than two months time your organisation's work will continue, your contract will continue, or whether it will finish.' They have also cut funds completely into national congress, showing what complete disregard the self-professed Prime Minister for Aboriginal affairs has for self-determination and for elected Aboriginal people representing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I say this to the government: if you have in fact genuinely found $534 million worth of savings, why aren't you putting that back into Aboriginal programs? We are nowhere near closing the gap and a lot of indicators are not being met. So we will not under this budget be meeting our close the gap commitments to close the gap within a generation. Again, this is mean, cruel and tricky to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. What I should also mention is that the cuts to Newstart, the changes to Newstart, the changes to Youth Allowance and the increased health care costs are going to disproportionately impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—on top of the cuts, a double whammy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


Senator Di Natale has already outlined today some of the impacts of the cuts to health care. The cost of basic medical care will throw up a huge challenge to the most vulnerable and those on income support and low incomes. For those living on $255 a week a hit of $7 for visiting a doctor is huge to your budget. I will stop here again and just say that when you are living on Newstart you are already living in poverty. Every single dollar counts. When you are living below the poverty line you think about every dollar you spend because you have an extremely low and fixed income.


Increasing the co-payments for prescription medicines for those on low incomes will also be a burden. We already know that many people on low incomes are not filling their prescriptions. In fact, when we had an inquiry into section 100 of the PBS process, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs found that Aboriginal people would share prescriptions because they could make them stretch longer. Of course, that is completely unacceptable.


This is the sort of thing that we are going to see under this government. This is going to fundamentally change our community—and not for the better. It will be a darker, meaner, crueller future that the coalition and the Abbott government foresees for the most vulnerable members of our community. We the Greens will not be a part of it. We will not help this government do in the most vulnerable members of our community.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:30):  I rise on this matter of public importance debate that the Abbott government's budget is a vicious attack on low- and middle-income Australians. Across the nation this morning, low- and middle-income Australians woke up to the news that life was going to get a whole lot tougher for them. For some, life will be just a little bit tougher; for many, the savage cuts in this government's budget will make it near impossible to make ends meet. For these and others, the changes slated as 'tough measures' will drive them into poverty, drive them into homelessness, drive them into poor health and drive them out of engagement with their community.


This is a government that is happy to cast people aside in its pursuit of a society comprised of the haves and have-nots. The pain in this budget falls almost solely on low- and middle-income Australians, while not only sparing company owners but also giving them three tax cuts. While low- and middle-income Australians do the heavy lifting, Prime Minister Abbott is cutting the company tax rate, cutting the carbon tax paid by fewer than 500 of our biggest polluters and cutting the mining tax paid by a very small number of mining companies who make super profits.


For me, the simple question that we have to pose to ourselves is: what kind of a country do we want to live in? I believe our country is wealthy enough to ensure there is a quality set of public services to care for Australians at times of need and to give all Australians an opportunity to release their potential. By 'all' that means all of us. For this government, 'all of us' really only means low- and middle-income Australians. Those opposite obviously believe that low- and middle-income Australians have it far too easy—those on a pension, those on a minimum wage, those with a full-time job with two kids. This government obviously believes that these people have it easy relative to those 'battlers' with wealth in the millions. 'Battlers' whose tax concessions in areas like superannuation, property and fuel were left completely untouched.


What if young Australians who are battling the fiercest job market in memory cannot get a job? They will no longer get any unemployment benefits for six months, but they now have to pay at least $7 extra to go to a doctor, at least an extra $5 for medicine and a few extra dollars to put petrol in a car if they are lucky enough to have one. If they cannot find a job in their hometown, this government believes that they should just up and move to remote parts of the country—away from family, away from friends—to get a job. So they have to beg, borrow or steal to raise the funds to move and then, when they get there, if times get tough and their business puts them off, what happens? What happens to them?


If they are under 30 this Abbott government will wipe their hands. 'Go and find another job,' they will say. 'You're lazy; go and do some more study,' they will say. And if no-one actually says it to these kids, it will be what is floating around in their minds. It will be what is eating away at them—'I owe mum 500 bucks; I owe nan two tanks of petrol; I owe my housemate two months rent.' They will think that as they try to get some sleep at night. For this government that is part of life. If your family cannot look after you—tough! If luck does not fall your way at every step—tough!


What does this budget mean for those in our community with a disability? Thank goodness, the government did not touch the National Disability Insurance Scheme fund—well, not yet. Mind you, there are no great plans for how the next stage of the rollout will progress. But, at the very minimum, the NDIS fund is intact. There has been no news on the plans to extend the Tasmanian trial to children aged zero to 14, but we waited with bated breath.


For those trying to survive on a disability support pension, there was plenty of news last night. The big news flash was that this Abbott government thinks most of these Australians are faking it. The government thinks that they can work in any job and they are just being lazy. Thousands of Australians with a disability are going to have the tortuous wait while they are reassessed for the disability support pension. Many of these young Australians will also be forced to complete compulsory work activities, compulsory activities that may be totally unrelated to the hopes and aspirations of the person—penalising someone based on their circumstances; penalising someone based on luck.


The Liberal government has also totally cut all specialised support for young Australians with a disability who are at school. Despite promising to deliver extra funding for students with disability, the Abbott government has, true to form, cut all dedicated support. On Monday I attended a briefing from the Australian Education Union and the organisation Children With Disability Australia, who were concerned that these promised programs would be cut in the budget. On Monday the CEO of Children With Disability Australia, Stephanie Gotlib, said to that forum:


A typical school experience for students with disability involves limited choice of school, discrimination, bullying, limited or no funding for support and resources, inadequately trained staff and having to contend with a culture of low expectations.


There was a bipartisan commitment to these programs. Both sides of politics have made commitments to young people with a disability, their families and their school communities. But this cruel budget shows that only one side of this place is prepared to do the heavy lifting to give an opportunity to all. Those opposite are prepared to cut these young people adrift, deprive them of the specialist support they need to fulfil their potential and condemn them to a life on the disability support pension and a life of compulsory work activities instead of achieving their dreams.


And what of compulsory work activities? Well, this of course is code for an expanded work-for-the-dole scheme. My home region is north-west Tasmania, and the electorate of Braddon. From his first budget as the new minister, what was the headline measure that Mr Brett Whitely spruiked in today's local daily, TheAdvocate? Work for the dole! It is in their DNA. They do not want people to find meaningful work; they are happy for Australians who find themselves unemployed to waste away in a work-for-the-dole scheme. And I say 'waste away' because, time and time again, studies are released showing that work for the dole does not lead to long-term employment.


North-west Tasmania is one of the most disadvantaged regions in our country: high unemployment, low levels of education, high rates of chronic disease and high levels of dependency on Commonwealth payments. It is also home to some world-leading advanced manufacturers, and the most fertile soils and plentiful ocean in the country. The budget still lists the $100 million Tasmanian Jobs and Growth Plan announced by Labor last year as on track to be spent. The funds were allocated by the previous government to partner with businesses in the agricultural and manufacturing industries, and to create jobs in our region. But this government is drip-feeding the announcements, leaving many businesses uncertain of their status and leaving job seekers to see news of only work-for-the-dole schemes.


The region is also the gateway to and from Tasmania, with two of Tasmania's major ports located at Burnie and Devonport. Under Labor, expenditure on freight and passenger subsidies from Bass Strait was indexed and increased every year we were in government. The Abbott government has actually cut the funding for next financial year then frozen the pool over the forward estimates, despite Tasmania being an island state totally dependent on those subsidies.


This Liberal government, whose new member for Braddon promised to have a huge 'open for business' sign in the middle of Bass Strait, has actually cut around $30 million of Bass Strait subsidies over the next three years. Meanwhile, their increase to the petrol excise is not slated to fund a single kilometre of road in north-west Tasmania. No, the petrol excise increases paid by the people of Braddon will be used to fund some of the incentive payment to the state of Victoria to sell the Port of Melbourne. This cut to Bass Strait subsidies and the sale of the Port of Melbourne will be a double whammy on low- and middle-income families in north-west Tasmania. It is a simple fact that over 98 per cent of goods freighted in and out of Tasmania must go through the Port of Melbourne. Privatisation is likely to see an increase in fees as the new owner seeks to maximise profit. Those increased fees will flow through to Tasmanian consumers and businesses who, along with their increased petrol prices, will be paying more for almost everything they buy. The impact on Tasmania has been totally ignored in this ill-thought-out, privatisation-at-all-costs policy decision. In the lead-up to the federal election, the new member for Braddon said, time and time again, 'We are open for business.' Has he deceived those who voted for him? (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-05-14,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:40):  I rise today to speak in the debate on the motion before the Senate on:


The Abbott Government's vicious attack on low and middle income Australians.


I think this debate is actually a debate between reality and fallacy. That is what the difference is between the coalition government and those opposite—the reality of the coalition fixing Labor's mess versus the fallacy of Labor believing there is nothing to fix; the reality of the coalition budget ensuring the fixing of the economic mess left by Labor versus the fallacy of Labor pretending that we are sticking it to low-income earners.


Labor claims to be the champion of low-income earners, but it appears to be unrequited love. None of the seven federal electorates with the lowest median weekly incomes elected a Labor MP at the last election. If the ALP's economic game plan was what low-income earners wanted in this country, then someone forgot to tell the low-income earners of Australia! If the false hopes and pipe dreams peddled by the previous government were what low-income earners wanted, then why did they reject the ALP and the Greens? That is because low-income earners in this country tend to be tough—they are tough people, and they knew that tough measures were required, and they understood how much $1 billion in interest payments could actually deliver for their communities. If I go through the ranks in the 2012 electoral divisions, No. 1 was Hinkler with a median income of $940; then there was Cowper with $970, Lyne with $978, the electorate of Page in New South Wales with $999, Wide Bay in Queensland with $1,008, Lyons in Tasmania with $1,029, and Mallee in Victoria with $1,069. They are the seven lowest median income level communities in our nation, and all of them have elected coalition members as their local representatives.


The MPI not only claims that there is a government attack on low-income earners; it claims that it is 'vicious', which means that it is with malicious intent, and that is the fallacy. The reality is that our only intent is for a stronger future, a sustainable future, a self-reliant future, for our nation.


Labor has some nerve, coming in here accusing us of attacking low-income earners! Let us have a look at the reality of how the last Labor government treated low-income earners. It was the last Labor government that put an extra 200,000 Australians on the dole. It was Labor that ripped off regional students with drastic cuts to youth allowance. It was Labor that sabotaged our border protection policies, resulting in more than 1,000 asylum seekers drowning at sea. It was Labor that slashed $700 million from payments to single parents, and it was a Labor MP who spent the union dues of the country's lowest-paid workers on champagne and prostitutes. That is the reality. It is easy to expose the fallacy of Labor's claim that the budget is characterised by malice against low-income earners. There is no tax increase on low-income earners, but a temporary debt levy—




Senator Singh:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator McKenzie is besmirching the name of Labor through the remarks she just made in her speech, and I ask her to withdraw them.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  There is no point of order. You are debating the issue.




Senator McKENZIE:
  There is no tax increase for low-income earners but a temporary debt levy on high-income workers, those who earn more than $180,000 a year, and it is a levy I am more than happy to pay. I also support the pay freeze for federal parliamentarians and Public Service department heads.


These are hardly vicious attacks on low- and middle-income Australia. This is an honest federal budget, something Australians have not been used to for awhile. We did not fiddle the figures and we did not put all the spending beyond the forward estimates. It is an authentic, realistic budget, compared to the fallacious surplus of the previous Labor government, promised 500 times but never delivered. 


It is a tough budget; it had to be. Labor inherited a string of budget surpluses and no debt. In fact, $60 billion was in the bank and, in just six years of Labor government, that money was wasted. We ended up owing $667 billion. That is the reality. That is half the Defence budget. It is about what we spend on aged care and it is more than we spend on universities.



Senator Singh interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  You do not like to hear it, but these are the facts. The coalition did not create this Labor mess, but we have a duty to fix it. The Australian people elected us to fix it. We are the firefighters and Labor are the arsonists. The Abbott-Truss government's Economic Action Strategy will reduce the Labor deficits by $44 billion over the forward estimates. If we do nothing to the budget, as Labor planned, then we will not be able to afford the welfare and the education, health and defence systems that we currently enjoy.


There is good news in the coalition budget for low- and middle-income Australians. The budget has plenty of good news, including infrastructure. Infrastructure benefits all Australians but particularly job seekers, as better infrastructure means more employment. We will invest $50 billion in infrastructure by 2019-20, strategically to grow our economic potential, to grow jobs. 


The budget includes major reforms to education, particularly in higher education. The deregulation of the university system has allowed Labor to screen $200,000 arts degrees, but the fact is—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  and you do not want to hear it—that the cost of some degrees will go up and the cost of some degrees will come down, depending on demand. Deregulation will allow our universities to compete with the best on the planet, by giving them the freedom to innovate. It has been welcomed by the vice-chancellors of the very universities that service the lowest income earners in the nation. The Regional Universities Network has come out in support of the education initiatives that this government handed down last night.


When we talk about health, how will the $7 co-payment for GPs visits affect low-income earners? We are actually making sure that there are safeguards within the budget to protect the most vulnerable. The Medicare safety net threshold will be adjusted to ensure that those most vulnerable in our society will still be able to access excellence in health care.


The fact is that the Medicare surcharge and the Medicare levy only funds 20 per cent of our Commonwealth healthcare spend. It is unsustainable. If we want to enjoy state-of-the-art X-rays, state-of-the-art diagnostic tests and world-class health delivery from our GP right throughout the hospital system, 20 per cent of our federal Commonwealth government collection is not going to cut it. 


Older Australians will also be able to make a modest contribution. The pension age will rise to 70 but not for two decades. So that is time to prepare all you 35-year-olds to put some money away. That is the reality and it is a fallacy to believe that the working population in the future will be able to support a huge number of Australians living upwards of age 100.


To conclude, the reality is that it is a tough but fair budget. However, Labor's claims that it unfairly targets low- and middle-income Australia is demonstrably false. Just get real! (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (16:49):  I do not know what is in the water today. You had better check, because it would seem that the briefing notes that the government senators have been provided with for today's debate were written last night over a few glasses of red!



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator STEPHENS:
  And a cigar or two! Let me just say one thing: Senator Back is here in the chamber, so this is a good place to start. The way that the budget affects people on high incomes of $200,000 or more—people like you and me—is that we are going to pay $400 a year extra tax. That is $7.60 a week. It would not even buy you a cheap bottle of red.


Consider the single parents who are out there, with two children, whose parenting payment has just been cut to the tune of $65 a week. Their weekly income is about $600 a week all up. What does that $65 a week get them? Guess what? It does not get them a doctor's appointment, it does not get them a visit to a GP, which in my home town currently costs $76, and it does not even get the kids their antibiotics prescription, because that will now cost $47 under the announcement made yesterday. So we have a family—a mum with kids, trying to decide what on earth to do. Will she consult Dr Google, and even that will not get her a prescription? She actually has to get to the doctor to get a prescription for her sick child. What will she do? Sixty-five dollars is more than some people pay for food for their whole family for a week. These are the kinds of decisions that last night's budget is actually going to force people to make. It is a disgrace. This is a budget that hurts so many people and helps so few.


Andrew Leigh, member for Fraser, wrote an article yesterday and it was very thought provoking: 


In an environment when the three richest people in Australia have more wealth than the bottom one million, the government is cutting foreign aid and student support to make room for tax breaks to multi-millionaire superannuants and multinational firms.


That is the truth of it: this budget is a clear victory for Australia's one per cent.


If you think that people are not gutted by what they heard last night—and I have to say it was a gut-wrenching read, and I join with Senator Siewert in the rage that I felt—people know that single parents and parents with disabled children will be the hardest hit under the changes announced last night. One woman rang my office this morning in tears. This is what she said:


I have four kids and they all have disabilities. This budget, in every way, kills my children's future—their ability to get an education, their ability to be part of society, their ability to earn a living. They are penalised because they are disabled and because they are young.


As Senator Urquhart said, the whole commitment to supporting kids with disabilities and mainstreaming kids with disabilities in schools, worth $100 million a year, has gone.


If that were all that is gone, people could maybe manage. It is such a stress. On one hand we are trying to force people into work and on the other hand we are taking away every mechanism there is to help them get work. Outside school hours care and child care are critical issues in this whole debate, and there was a $450 million cut last night. For Indigenous children and family centres, $78 million a year is gone. And $500 million a year has been taken out of the universal access to preschool program. The thresholds are frozen for the childcare benefit and for the childcare rebate the cap is frozen. That is fundamentally going to change the lives of Australian families.

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2014-05-14,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Government Whip) (16:54):  I would like to preface my remarks with a compliment, and that is that there are some on the other side of the chamber whom I respect highly. Senator Stephens is one of those, but I have to say that in this instance I could not disagree more fully with what she has said if I tried. One fundamental difference between the discussion and debate about the budget that was brought down last night is the very fact that the moral obligation for any government is to govern in the interests of all Australians, and you cannot do that by continuing to spend money that you do not have and ratcheting up the deficit for our future generations to pay. They will be the ones who will have to support the dreadful and appalling legacy unless it is dealt with. So, as I said, whilst I do respect—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator KROGER:
  I sat here quietly. I may not have agreed with what was said, but I did respect the rights of those on the other side of the chamber to be able to speak without being interrupted so that they could be heard. I am sure that they will afford me the same respect and opportunity.


It is a moral obligation for any government to provide an economic, fiscal and social structure that is sustainable—and 'sustainable' is the operative word here—and responsible, not only for today but, most importantly, for future generations. A responsible government should adjust its spending priorities by taking into account changing global circumstances, along with local influences that impinge on the national income. Sadly, I have to say, those changing circumstances that Australia has experienced were not accounted for or factored in in any considerations by the previous Rudd and Gillard governments. Not only were they not factored in with appropriate spending adjustments but, rather, they responded with a continued chequebook approach to every challenge that emerged. It was this irresponsibility of writing a cheque to deal with whatever circumstances arose that has dramatically accelerated the situation that every Australian is now faced with. To put it simply, Australia is living beyond its means—there is no other way to put it—and it is a situation that will significantly impede our national potential unless it is addressed. Opportunities and economic prosperity for decades are at stake.


I stand here today and commend the Abbott government and the Herculean efforts of the Treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey, and the finance minister, Senator Mathias Cormann, in not shirking the enormous responsibility but, rather, confronting it head-on so that future generations have an opportunity to thrive. The motion of the opposition, suggesting the government is attacking low- and middle-income earners, typically and predictably misses the point. Sending $900 cheques to 21,000 dead people, overseeing a disgraceful installation scheme that cost more to fix than the cost to implement it, not to mention the cost of dismantling effective—and I have to stress 'effective'—border protection measures, are sadly just small examples of the fiscally reckless behaviour of the former governments that we are now responsibly seeking to fix. No government takes this on lightly and it is certainly no fun to be left with the legacy that the coalition has been left with. But I have to say that nations that are blessed with the resources that Australia enjoys should not find themselves in the situation where the projected national debt in a decade will rise to $667 billion if the previous government's spending patterns continue. As we have heard, that amounts to a staggering $12 billion, or $1 billion every month, to service that debt. To put it into context, that is the same amount we spend on aged care and it is the same amount that we use to fund our universities. And this is what we would have been looking at if we had continued on the trajectory that was set by the former governments.


As a mother, but also as someone who is very, very responsive to those who walk in the door of my electorate office, I do not believe that we should be burdening our children and our future generations with a noose of debt that will strangle them for their lifetimes. And we are beholden to do something about it now. Whatever happened to the Australian ethos? Aussies were known for their fierce independence, their self-reliance, the drive to do one's best and achieve one's own potential while working hard to ensure that family and friends were looked after. What has happened to that ethos? What has it been replaced with in the last few years? Instead we seem to have developed—and we have heard it today—a patronising culture where individuals are being told the government knows best and is best placed to make decisions for them—whether it is about their health, their education or even telling them how to run a business.


The budgetary decisions have not been made lightly and they have not been easy. But what is missing here—and we have not heard it from the other side—is that it was the right thing to do. We all know we have to increase workforce participation to build a more prosperous economy while living within our means. We all know that we have an ageing demographic. We all know—certainly on this side—that the status quo cannot continue. I urge those on the opposite side—

The speeches read as follows—



MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS (INDICIA AND IMAGES) PROTECTION BILL 2014


The purpose of the Bill is to protect major sporting event sponsorship and licensing revenue from being undermined by unauthorised commercial use of event indicia and images for the following events:


Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup 2015;


International Cricket Council (ICC) Cricket World Cup 2015; and


Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games.


This Bill is consistent with the approach the Australian Government took when it legislated to protect the indicia and images for the Sydney Olympics and Melbourne Commonwealth Games through the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 (Sydney Games Act) and the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2005 (Melbourne 2006 Act) respectively.


Australia has a reputation for, and track record in, hosting highly successful major sporting events, with the Australian Government playing a critical role in facilitating the appropriate environment that makes such success possible. 


The three events that are the focus of this Bill will, between them, see over 60 countries participating on Australian shores with a much broader global reach due to their profile and nature. They represent the pinnacle of competition and include some of the world's best football players, cricketers and athletes. 


For Australia, the profiles of these events present a great opportunity to showcase our country from a tourism, trade and event delivery perspective. For event owners and organisers this profile provides the opportunity to showcase their sports, build a legacy and attract commercial partners that will invest in the event and their sport into the future. 


This latter point is particularly important as event owners and organisers rely heavily on revenue gleaned from television rights, ticket sales, sponsorship and licensing to ensure their event can be delivered and continues to be an attractive and viable financial proposition to future host countries.  


It is this profile and these commercial realities that necessitate the sorts of protections that are proposed in this Bill. Major events have long been targets of those that would seek to create an impression of association with, or sponsorship of, the event in order to achieve commercial gain without having purchased the rights to claim that association. This act, known as ""ambush marketing by association"", has the capacity to diminish the value of sponsorship, reduce the incentive for organisations to enter into commercial arrangements with events, and reduce overall event revenue.


The Bill will protect the use of a range of words and expressions associated with each major sporting event such as ""Asian Cup 2015"", ""Cricket World Cup 2015"" and ""Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games"", from ambush marketing and unlicensed commercial use in the lead-up to and during the each major sporting event.  Variants of the event names and known abbreviations will also be protected such as, ""Asian Cup"", ""CWC 2015"", ""GC2018"".  


While it is important to protect sponsors from ambush marketing, the rights of the community to freedom of expression must also be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage.  A pragmatic approach has been taken with generic words and references such as ""cricket"", ""football"" and ""Commonwealth"" excluded from any list.


In addition to protecting particular words, numbers and expressions, the Bill also provides protection to certain images that suggest, or are likely to suggest, a connection with these events.  The manner in which these indicia and images will be defined and protected by the Bill is consistent with the approach used under the Sydney Games Act and Melbourne 2006 Act.


An important feature of this Bill is a 'commercial benefit' test that applies to the use of material. Restrictions will apply only to unlicensed commercial use of the protected indicia and images.  The aim is to prevent an unauthorised user from applying the protected indicia and images to suggest a formal association with the events. 


The Australian Government supports state, territory and local governments engaging their local communities, including the local business community, in the festival and city dressing that will surround these events which may involve the use of indicia and images.


The Bill also recognises arrangements that may already be in place between host jurisdictions and the respective organising committees in relation to the use of indicia and images. The intention is for such arrangements to continue and not be affected by the proposed legislation. Further, it is intended to be complementary to existing or proposed legislation in states and territories that may be put in place in relation to these events. 


The Bill also contains a number of exceptions allowing:


for the continued operation of rights and liabilities under the Trade Marks Act 1995, Design Act 2003 and Copyright Act 1968; 


the provision of information, criticism and review of the events, such as in newspapers, magazines and broadcasts; and


use for the reasonable needs of sporting bodies in relation to fundraising and promotion.


In line with the Australian Government's deregulation agenda, it is made clear in the Bill that the legislation is not intended to increase the burden on business or affect their everyday operations.  It is recognised that some individuals and corporations, such as the event owners and sponsors already use the indicia prescribed in the legislation in conjunction with their goods and services.  The Bill fully protects the rights of the existing holders to use indicia to carry out their business functions.


Just as the Melbourne 2006 Act permitted the use of Melbourne 2006 indicia or images solely for the purposes of providing information, or for the purposes of criticism or review, so too does this Bill.  The Bill therefore permits the provision of information for the purposes of reporting news and presentation of current affairs, the factual description of goods or services provided by a business (such as stating that accommodation is available at a hotel that is located near an event venue), or factual statements by an athlete to promote their own achievements.


The Government also recognises that the reasonable needs of sporting bodies in relation to fundraising for and promotion of their preparation of athletes and teams for these events should be allowed to continue.  Those reasonable needs could involve use of the indicia or images for the purposes of providing factual information.  The Bill is not intended to affect this type of use.


Another feature of the Bill establishes a Register to outline the authorised users of each event's indicia and images.  These Registers will be published and provides consumers with confidence that goods and services purchased are official.  Authorising bodies, the owners of the intellectual property are responsible for keeping account of authorised persons and entering and updating relevant details into the Register.  A person whose name appears on the Register constitutes an authorised person of indicia and images for the event specified.  


Similar to provisions contained in the Melbourne 2006 Act, this Bill also provides various remedies to the authorising bodies and authorised persons to enforce their rights in relation to the protected indicia and images.  It will be the authorising body or an authorised person who may bring an action against an unauthorised user, this will not be the responsibility of the Government.  The remedies available under the Bill include injunctions, damages and corrective advertising.  The courts also have the discretion to provide remedies under any law (either State, Territory or Commonwealth) and most notably, Trade Marks Act 1995, Copyright Act 1968 and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 in relation to engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive.


The Bill also includes appropriate measures to limit the possibility of the importation of goods which seek to ambush each event's marketing.  The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs) will be able to carry out the measures of this legislation relating to the monitoring of imported goods at Australia's borders. This Bill allows Customs to perform functions similar to those it undertook at the time of the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games by seizing goods marked with unauthorised indicia and images at Australia's borders.  The border protection component of this bill is consistent with the Trade Marks Act 1995 and the Copyright Act 1968 as amended by the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Raising the Bar) Act 2012 to ensure powers for Customs officers are aligned in relation to the seizure of unauthorised goods at the border, thus avoiding confusion for business, consumers and those administering the measures.


Each schedule of the Bill will cease to have effect within one year after the completion of each major sporting event as prescribed in the Bill.


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2014 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2014


This Bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia’s tax laws.


Schedule 1 will improve the Farm Management Deposit scheme by amending the Banking Act 1959 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. 


Farm Management Deposits allow farmers to save some of their income in good years without it being taxed, and then withdraw it in leaner years and pay tax on it when their marginal tax rate is lower.  They are a financial risk management tool to help farmers protect themselves against the large income fluctuations that are often typical of primary production.  


This legislation will make several improvements to the scheme to make it easier for farmers to use Farm Management Deposits.  


First, farmers will be able to earn more income from non primary production sources before they are prevented from creating new Farm Management Deposits.  The non primary production income ceiling will be raised from $65,000 to $100,000.  


Second, individuals will be able to consolidate Farm Management Deposits across financial institutions without adverse tax consequences.  If a farmer chooses to combine multiple Farm Management Deposits that they have held for at least 12 months into a single account, the amounts will not be included in their assessable income for that year, nor affect their entitlement to make new Farm Management Deposits in that year.


Finally, Farm Management Deposits will be excluded from the unclaimed money provisions in the Banking Act 1959, to ensure that these accounts, which are intended to facilitate long term savings, are not inadvertently paid to the Commonwealth as a result of a period of inactivity.  


Schedule 2 to this Bill amends the GST law to allow taxpayers to determine whether they are entitled to a refund by reference to objective conditions, rather than having to rely on the Commissioner to exercise the discretion to refund an excess amount of GST.


The measure provides additional clarity for entities which may have overpaid GST and are seeking to claim refunds.  The measure also aims to prevent taxpayers from receiving a windfall gain of overpaid GST and encourages suppliers to refund their customers any overpaid GST.


Schedule 2 also addresses a gap in the existing law relating to refunds associated with miscalculations of GST payable on a supply.  Recently the Federal Court found that the restriction on paying a refund does not apply where GST is overpaid because of a miscalculation.  The amendments provide that the refund provisions apply to overpayments of GST, irrespective of whether the overpayment arises as a result of a mischaracterisation or miscalculation of the GST payable.


The amendments apply only on a prospective basis from the date of commencement in order to minimise the uncertainty and compliance costs involved in the application of the amendments on a retrospective basis.


Schedule 2 also amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to give taxpayers review rights, both in relation to the Commissioner’s discretion to refund in exceptional circumstances, as well as to restore these rights under the existing refund provisions as a consequence of a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.


Full details of these measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:42):  As the deputy chair of the committee. I wish to advise the chamber that the coalition senators have dissented from elements of the TAFE funding inquiry and express my appreciation to all those who were involved, including the secretariat and my colleague Senator McKenzie who so ably worked with us on this.


There is no doubt at all that there needs to be an improvement in the overall recognition of standards in the technical and further education of vocational education sector across Australia. I think there would be general acceptance of a move towards standards that are accepted and equivalent across state and territory boundaries. They would be beneficial to employers, employees and, of course, the students, because we have such a freedom of movement now and we are going to see that far more into the future as we try to bring this economy back to a level of acceptability to the Australian and wider community.


That will definitely require a circumstance in the vocational education and training area where we are going to ensure that standards remain high, from a student's point of view, including—but not exclusively—international students, who increasingly see value in coming to our country. 


Where the coalition senators dissent from the majority report is in a number of sectors, and I wish to highlight them. The first is that whilst the Commonwealth government does provide and has a great interest in the vocational education sector, it is a fact and will remain the fact that the actual delivery of VET-type training is and should remain the province of the states and the territories. 


We actually saw evidence of that in our hearings in the different areas of Australia. In Victoria we saw a heavy emphasis in the manufacturing sector because it is heavily a manufacturing state. In Western Australia we saw emphasis reflecting the industries which are active in that state. In Wollongong we saw a slight change of emphasis to students with disabilities. How interesting that particular hearing was to all of us.


The coalition senators, in presenting our dissenting report, wish to make very clear the fact that TAFE delivery, vocational education and training, is a state and territory responsibility. There should not be a role for the federal government to want to take control over that. Those states who wish to participate more fully should be encouraged to do so. But at the same time we do believe there needs to be a consistency of standards and transferability of qualifications across state and territory boundaries.


Vocational education is education with the purpose of equipping a person with the necessary skills to do a job. Coalition senators—and I have said this in the report—support a strong, vibrant, dynamic, financially sustainable vocational education system. Again, this is where the coalition senators dissent from the majority report. The majority report tends to emphasise that those most capable and most competent to deliver vocational education and training are exclusively in the TAFE sector, the government controlled sector. It is the case that it was the decision of the states to move well beyond the TAFE system of delivery towards a competitive system involving the private sector. That has achieved enormous gains for students, particularly, and into the future it will for employers. So that is an area of difference between the majority report and the dissenting report as delivered by Senator McKenzie and me.


We were disappointed the majority report did not give adequate air time or space to the essential role of industry. It is industry, in the main, that will provide the career opportunities for VET students on completion of their training. I believe Senator McKenzie will want to expand further on that involvement by industry in the provision of services. If industry, having the role that it does, wants that choice of a private sector service provider as well as a TAFE based service provider, all to the good. We heard some very interesting evidence around Australia on the need for liaison with industry in that context.


The issue of who drives skills development is crucial to the future role of TAFE, and we recognise it as the pre-eminent provider of vocational education and training in this country. Employers have told us that, as we all know, they rely on TAFE to provide consistent high-quality training and to ensure that trainees enter the workplace—particularly importantly—work ready. There are three areas that we identified in this report for this to happen, the first being skills development driven by employers and industries that will employee the graduates at the end of their training. The second is that TAFEs must respond to and liaise with employers and industry to ensure that the training provided is of the type and standard required by employers. Third, and most importantly, TAFEs have to be financially viable and sustainable in that competitive environment. We must never lose sight of the fact that each of those three criteria are driving towards one objective: the competence and capacity of students to come into the workplace work ready, safety ready, and willing and competent to go to the next stage of their careers.


The majority report concentrated on funding being reduced to TAFEs or making public funding for the VET sector contestable. The coalition senators are of the view that the system needs to involve a mix of contributors, including government, industry and students. That was certainly highlighted by the Victorian government's Vocational education and training market 2013 highlights report. To quote:


Over the past year, we’ve seen 10,000 more enrolments in construction, nearly 10,000 more people training in healthcare and 8,000 more in transport—all critical areas to the Victorian economy.


I wish to emphasise that point again. In the few moments left to me I make reference to the recommendation by the coalition senators that the states and territories take steps to each ensure their TAFEs are given the capacity to negotiate industrial agreements, to ensure that TAFEs operate on an equal footing with other vocational education providers. They must not be left behind. They must not be shackled in this new world of vocational education and training.


We amend a recommendation from the majority report that the Commonwealth work through its COAG partners on the National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform to ensure that all states and territories do provide clear statements of policy direction on the role of TAFE in their jurisdiction, in consultation with effective industries to ensure a quality education for students—coming back to that point of emphasis. Again, we recommend the amendment of a majority report recommendation that the committee recommends that COAG work collaboratively to develop a national workforce strategy for TAFE that addresses the level and quality of the teaching qualifications, an area that certainly was the subject of abundant discussion. We reject the recommendations that point to TAFE, pretty well exclusively, returning to being the only provider, and we certainly recommend that for quality vocational education outcomes a mix of contributors is required, that being government, industry and students.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-05-14,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:52):  This was a most important inquiry with significant findings. I would like to thank the chair of the Education and Employment References Committee, all the senators who worked on this inquiry and certainly all the staff that did such outstanding work in organising our many visits across the country and assisting with the report in all its detail. I also want to thank all colleagues in the Senate, because there was unanimous agreement when I put this up last November that this inquiry should go ahead. 


I remember at the time, because we were coming into the end of the year, meeting and talking with a number of young people who are thinking about their future and their plans for 2014. Many of them were looking towards courses at TAFE. But equally they spoke of their concerns and their uncertainty because of what they could see was happening to TAFE in many jurisdictions. It certainly underlined again the need for this inquiry.


It is clear from the evidence presented to the committee that the TAFE sector has been under enormous pressure following decisions to open up government funding to competition from private providers. This was certainly a theme that came through in so many of the hearings. These themes of concern were around continuing cuts in government funding to the TAFE sector, and that has occurred both under successive Labor and coalition governments. Unfortunately, the contestability model that Labor pushed through in those COAG reforms has really allowed so many of the destructive developments that we are seeing play out at a state level.


Other concerns were to do with the diversion of substantial public funding from TAFE to private for-profit RTOs under the contestability model. This has resulted in underfunding TAFE institute in many states, with major losses of staff, resources and infrastructure. The issue of casualisation was something that I found very disturbing in terms of the impact it has on the individuals, because of their uncertainty in terms of their future employment and their workplace conditions but also the quality of the education. I am in no way reflecting on the teachers there, but when you have a highly casualised workforce the quality of the work that comes through is certainly under a cloud.


But what we saw in so much of the evidence with the funding cuts was the enormous impact it is having on the lives of individuals, whether they be staff or students or people who really hope that they could go to TAFE but now often find that that is not possible. The funding cuts are also affecting, as I mentioned, the education standards and also the very fabric of our society. I do not say that lightly. I really learned so much of this inquiry in terms of the huge contribution that TAFE makes to our society in helping bring people back into having confidence to be part of society, gaining training and in many cases then going on to employment. I did find it a great irony, because we are hearing so much from the coalition government about people getting back into the workforce and at the same time they are undermining to such a huge degree an organisation—our TAFE system—which has this myriad of pathways bringing people literally back into society. We heard examples, met and heard evidence from people who were feeling so insecure that in some cases had not left their homes for years and years because of disabilities suffered at work and because of various circumstances that had arisen with their own wellbeing. But through either being introduced to TAFE or meeting TAFE teachers accidentally they were brought back. In one case a man met a TAFE staff person through his disabled child and that person recognised that this man could benefit enormously from TAFE. He went on to not only gain an education but to become a TAFE teacher in graphic design. The stories were just so impressive. That is what I mean when I talk about the damage that is being done to the very fabric of our society.


We heard a great deal of evidence that the affordable, quality vocational training and further education to individuals, communities and industries across Australia is being compromised or even, in many cases, made not possible. Serious concerns were raised about these accessible pathways. Again I really want to emphasise how impressive the evidence was on this issue from both staff and students. This came from so many of the sites that we visited—from Perth to Wollongong. It was very comprehensive inquiry and the evidence from so many people was so beneficial to our considerations.


Other issues that came up strongly were the increase in student fees and the imposition of limited once-only publicly funded training entitlements for each student and how that has put qualifications out of the reach of many students. Then, as I said, there was the evidence about people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, people with disabilities and how they had benefited so much. So many of the staff who teach these people with disabilities, teach these people with special needs, set out the difficulties under the changes that are coming through at a state level—again, allowed because of the contestability model and the weakness of the regime that we have federally. 


I take the example of my home state, New South Wales, the so-called 'smart and skilled' approach to vocational education and training—certainly those words are far from an accurate representation. But what a number of staff explained was that under 'smart and skilled' the money allocated for the assistance many people need will not cover the notetakers, will not cover the translators for people who need an Auslan interpreter if they are deaf. While that does sound costly—it often runs to about $80,000 over four years—when you consider that out of the training so many of those people go on to full employment, paying their taxes, not being on benefits for the rest of their lives, that $80,000 is in fact a most important and worthwhile contribution. That will not be available under the new way that vocational education and training is being rolled out by conservative governments. It was quite moving to hear the stories of some of the deaf students and people with disabilities. The current conditions made a difference to their lives but, they said, if they had enrolled next year it would not have been able to happen. 


This was an incredibly worthwhile inquiry. The Greens were pleased to support the report; however, we were disappointed that some important recommendations that came through from a lot of the evidence were not adopted. I would like to thank the many teachers, the staff, the Australian Education Union and many other organisations that gave evidence.


Some of the recommendations that the Greens put forward which we think should have been included in the report are: an end to the current model of competitive tendering of government vocational education and training and a comprehensive public examination and review of the consequences of full competition on TAFE, including the impact on the quality of vocational education, levels of student support and teaching infrastructure, and a reassessment of the case and justification for a competitive training market.


We also put forward a further recommendation for a complete and rigorous examination of the real costs of the provision of high quality vocational and further education, including technical skills for work, adult literacy and numeracy and a number of other key factors. A third recommendation that we included in our part of the report was for guaranteed funding for the public TAFE system based on the actual costs of providing education and on a funding model that supports a strong and increased base for capital works, maintenance, infrastructure and equipment, and which properly recognises the important role of TAFE in providing vocational and technical education in areas of high and low demand, in rural and remote areas and improved access and participation for disadvantaged learners. 


We cannot afford to lose TAFE. TAFE is an integral part of how our society works—not just in terms of education but in bringing dignity and respect for people across the board who have had varying opportunities. (Time expired)

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:02):  I want to rise very briefly; I will not be using all the time available to me today. Senator Back, the magnificent deputy chair of this committee, has fully traversed all the issues that I was hoping to raise today, except for one.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Magnificent!




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Cameron, I am glad you are in the chamber! Page 1 of our dissenting report goes to the fact that vocational training is incredibly important, and we all know that in this place. It is incredibly important that it meets the needs of students and of industry so that our young people are appropriately trained, with important skills that our nation and our industries need, to go on to full careers within their chosen industry. 


What was so disappointing and so typical is that this inquiry is about an issue that concerns state government jurisdiction. It is epidemic within the Greens political party that we are continually conducting inquiries into issues that quite properly belong within area of control of the state governments simply so that Senator Rhiannon or Senator Di Natale can get their press releases out into the media—even though they are issues that, as a federal parliamentary body, we cannot do anything about. At the moment we have got several inquiries going on, and the first page of our dissenting report goes to the fact that the integrity of the Senate committee process is fabulous. We are very lucky in this nation to have a committee system that is the envy of other chambers throughout the world. I want the reports that we produce in this place, from both references and legislation committees, to be well-researched reports that can be cited by other bodies that contribute to the public debate—rather than just a replication of evidence provided because the staff within the Senate are overworked, as are the senators. Our committee report says it beautifully:


Senate committees are not political footballs. They have scarce resources that should be employed to produce substantial, high quality reports based on extensive and comprehensive evidence gathering. Senate reports should be reputable, with high quality reference material that everyone in the policy arena can access with confidence.


Unfortunately, this particular inquiry was conducted in such a way that we were running around the country, hearing similar evidence time and time again. I think those of us on the committee can agree that we got a certain amount of evidence quite quickly and then it was simply repetitive so that certain media opportunities could be obtained by certain senators. I think that is a great disappointment, because the education and employment references and legislation committees have an important role to play in policy discussion and debate within the wider population.


One of the recommendations of the majority report goes to the quality of teaching and support for teachers within the TAFE system to participate in the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group and perhaps make a submission around that. I particularly enjoyed some of Senator Rhiannon's commentary around increasing support for pathways into higher education, and I look forward to her support for some of our budget measures in that light.


A lot of the critique of the majority report goes to issues concerning state governments—particularly coalition governments but not all; South Australia followed Victoria's lead in terms of restructuring and refocusing their vocational education sector so that TAFE remains a very key part of the mix but not the only part in delivering vocational education in this country. I commend the report and the dissenting report to the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have been reminded to make sure that senators know that the time for the debate on this particular item finishes at 6.13 and, on the whole segment, at 6.43.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (18:07):  I rise to make a few short statements given the time constraints of the report. Unfortunately, I did not hear all of Senator McKenzie's speech so I cannot really make any comment about what was said. 


It is true to say that across the country we heard from a range of witnesses—teachers, academics, TAFE directors, parents, students, the Australian Education Union, the Australian Human Rights Commission and business groups. So it is fair to say that TAFE is an important provider of vocational education and training. Indeed, it is the most significant provider of vocational education and training in the country. Its role is critical.


But what was very clear to us was that, right across the country, the role of TAFE is under threat. It is being undermined. All the people who gave evidence—they were experts in their fields, whether they were teachers, people in the business community who rely on TAFE, students, academics or TAFE directors—put significant expert evidence before us. 


The contestability market is clearly not working for TAFE. Certainly a number of independent witnesses suggested that there be more of a controlled market, and that there are some areas that TAFE should not be competing in. One of the areas of excellence that TAFE provides is in the absolutely solid support for students with disability. We heard from an amazing young man in Sydney, who was representing the Deaf Society. He was incredibly articulate. Help with the cost of Auslan interpreters and note-takers and all the other services and supporters that, in particular, deaf students need is under threat. In Wollongong a young man gave us evidence. He had completed a whole range of diplomas but he physically needed quite a lot of support. That is at threat, too.


Clearly, TAFE is a provider of excellence in terms of supporting students with disability. It is clearly a leader in second-chance education. It is a leader in terms of providing younger students who have dropped out of school with the opportunity to come back. We heard evidence from a young woman in Perth who told us that TAFE was the difference between life and death for her. It was that serious. Her life was so far off the rail but through doing a youth diploma in TAFE she is now working in that field and her whole life has changed.


I am sure that those opposite—in particular, Senator McKenzie—would appreciate that education can turn people's lives around. Clearly TAFE is expert in that.


TAFE sits within a political space. There were very disappointing issues that arose in Perth and Wollongong. In Perth particularly, the state government threatened the employment of witnesses who were giving evidence. The committee had to send a very strong letter to the WA government outlining the fact that parliamentary privilege extended to witnesses. There was a similar issue in Wollongong. So this is obviously getting to be political.


I hope that COAG takes our recommendations seriously. We need to ensure that TAFE survives. It is not just another registered training organisation. It is clearly much, much more than that. At risk right now is the further education of students with disability and second-chance education, of which TAFE is such a strong providers, particularly in relation to mature-age people who have become redundant and need to change their skills.


We heard a lot of evidence like that and it was rather surprising that only two state governments have a clear definition of the sorts of roles that TAFEs play. We heard evidence of where TAFE was expanding. There were partnerships with universities. One TAFE in particular is looking at working with a big private health provider to look at how they can do courses of mutual benefit. Those are all positive outcomes, but clearly both the federal and state governments, through the COAG process, need to be very clear about TAFE. It does need to remain a provider of excellence and a benchmark against which we hold all others accountable.


This competitive market it sits in now needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency, because TAFE is a great provider of vocational education and training in our country. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

The issue of casualisation was something that I found very disturbing in terms of the impact it has on the individuals, because of their uncertainty in terms of their future employment and their workplace conditions but also the quality of the education. I am in no way reflecting on the teachers there, but when you have a highly casualised workforce the quality of the work that comes through is certainly under a cloud.


But what we saw in so much of the evidence with the funding cuts was the enormous impact it is having on the lives of individuals, whether they be staff or students or people who really hope that they could go to TAFE but now often find that that is not possible. The funding cuts are also affecting, as I mentioned, the education standards and also the very fabric of our society. I do not say that lightly. I really learned so much of this inquiry in terms of the huge contribution that TAFE makes to our society in helping bring people back into having confidence to be part of society, gaining training and in many cases then going on to employment. I did find it a great irony, because we are hearing so much from the coalition government about people getting back into the workforce and at the same time they are undermining to such a huge degree an organisation—our TAFE system—which has this myriad of pathways bringing people literally back into society. We heard examples, met and heard evidence from people who were feeling so insecure that in some cases had not left their homes for years and years because of disabilities suffered at work and because of various circumstances that had arisen with their own wellbeing. But through either being introduced to TAFE or meeting TAFE teachers accidentally they were brought back. In one case a man met a TAFE staff person through his disabled child and that person recognised that this man could benefit enormously from TAFE. He went on to not only gain an education but to become a TAFE teacher in graphic design. The stories were just so impressive. That is what I mean when I talk about the damage that is being done to the very fabric of our society.


We heard a great deal of evidence that the affordable, quality vocational training and further education to individuals, communities and industries across Australia is being compromised or even, in many cases, made not possible. Serious concerns were raised about these accessible pathways. Again I really want to emphasise how impressive the evidence was on this issue from both staff and students. This came from so many of the sites that we visited—from Perth to Wollongong. It was very comprehensive inquiry and the evidence from so many people was so beneficial to our considerations.


Other issues that came up strongly were the increase in student fees and the imposition of limited once-only publicly funded training entitlements for each student and how that has put qualifications out of the reach of many students. Then, as I said, there was the evidence about people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, people with disabilities and how they had benefited so much. So many of the staff who teach these people with disabilities, teach these people with special needs, set out the difficulties under the changes that are coming through at a state level—again, allowed because of the contestability model and the weakness of the regime that we have federally. 


I take the example of my home state, New South Wales, the so-called 'smart and skilled' approach to vocational education and training—certainly those words are far from an accurate representation. But what a number of staff explained was that under 'smart and skilled' the money allocated for the assistance many people need will not cover the notetakers, will not cover the translators for people who need an Auslan interpreter if they are deaf. While that does sound costly—it often runs to about $80,000 over four years—when you consider that out of the training so many of those people go on to full employment, paying their taxes, not being on benefits for the rest of their lives, that $80,000 is in fact a most important and worthwhile contribution. That will not be available under the new way that vocational education and training is being rolled out by conservative governments. It was quite moving to hear the stories of some of the deaf students and people with disabilities. The current conditions made a difference to their lives but, they said, if they had enrolled next year it would not have been able to happen. 


This was an incredibly worthwhile inquiry. The Greens were pleased to support the report; however, we were disappointed that some important recommendations that came through from a lot of the evidence were not adopted. I would like to thank the many teachers, the staff, the Australian Education Union and many other organisations that gave evidence.


Some of the recommendations that the Greens put forward which we think should have been included in the report are: an end to the current model of competitive tendering of government vocational education and training and a comprehensive public examination and review of the consequences of full competition on TAFE, including the impact on the quality of vocational education, levels of student support and teaching infrastructure, and a reassessment of the case and justification for a competitive training market.


We also put forward a further recommendation for a complete and rigorous examination of the real costs of the provision of high quality vocational and further education, including technical skills for work, adult literacy and numeracy and a number of other key factors. A third recommendation that we included in our part of the report was for guaranteed funding for the public TAFE system based on the actual costs of providing education and on a funding model that supports a strong and increased base for capital works, maintenance, infrastructure and equipment, and which properly recognises the important role of TAFE in providing vocational and technical education in areas of high and low demand, in rural and remote areas and improved access and participation for disadvantaged learners. 


We cannot afford to lose TAFE. TAFE is an integral part of how our society works—not just in terms of education but in bringing dignity and respect for people across the board who have had varying opportunities. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-05-14,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:02):  I want to rise very briefly; I will not be using all the time available to me today. Senator Back, the magnificent deputy chair of this committee, has fully traversed all the issues that I was hoping to raise today, except for one.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Magnificent!




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Cameron, I am glad you are in the chamber! Page 1 of our dissenting report goes to the fact that vocational training is incredibly important, and we all know that in this place. It is incredibly important that it meets the needs of students and of industry so that our young people are appropriately trained, with important skills that our nation and our industries need, to go on to full careers within their chosen industry. 


What was so disappointing and so typical is that this inquiry is about an issue that concerns state government jurisdiction. It is epidemic within the Greens political party that we are continually conducting inquiries into issues that quite properly belong within area of control of the state governments simply so that Senator Rhiannon or Senator Di Natale can get their press releases out into the media—even though they are issues that, as a federal parliamentary body, we cannot do anything about. At the moment we have got several inquiries going on, and the first page of our dissenting report goes to the fact that the integrity of the Senate committee process is fabulous. We are very lucky in this nation to have a committee system that is the envy of other chambers throughout the world. I want the reports that we produce in this place, from both references and legislation committees, to be well-researched reports that can be cited by other bodies that contribute to the public debate—rather than just a replication of evidence provided because the staff within the Senate are overworked, as are the senators. Our committee report says it beautifully:


Senate committees are not political footballs. They have scarce resources that should be employed to produce substantial, high quality reports based on extensive and comprehensive evidence gathering. Senate reports should be reputable, with high quality reference material that everyone in the policy arena can access with confidence.


Unfortunately, this particular inquiry was conducted in such a way that we were running around the country, hearing similar evidence time and time again. I think those of us on the committee can agree that we got a certain amount of evidence quite quickly and then it was simply repetitive so that certain media opportunities could be obtained by certain senators. I think that is a great disappointment, because the education and employment references and legislation committees have an important role to play in policy discussion and debate within the wider population.


One of the recommendations of the majority report goes to the quality of teaching and support for teachers within the TAFE system to participate in the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group and perhaps make a submission around that. I particularly enjoyed some of Senator Rhiannon's commentary around increasing support for pathways into higher education, and I look forward to her support for some of our budget measures in that light.


A lot of the critique of the majority report goes to issues concerning state governments—particularly coalition governments but not all; South Australia followed Victoria's lead in terms of restructuring and refocusing their vocational education sector so that TAFE remains a very key part of the mix but not the only part in delivering vocational education in this country. I commend the report and the dissenting report to the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have been reminded to make sure that senators know that the time for the debate on this particular item finishes at 6.13 and, on the whole segment, at 6.43.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (18:07):  I rise to make a few short statements given the time constraints of the report. Unfortunately, I did not hear all of Senator McKenzie's speech so I cannot really make any comment about what was said. 


It is true to say that across the country we heard from a range of witnesses—teachers, academics, TAFE directors, parents, students, the Australian Education Union, the Australian Human Rights Commission and business groups. So it is fair to say that TAFE is an important provider of vocational education and training. Indeed, it is the most significant provider of vocational education and training in the country. Its role is critical.


But what was very clear to us was that, right across the country, the role of TAFE is under threat. It is being undermined. All the people who gave evidence—they were experts in their fields, whether they were teachers, people in the business community who rely on TAFE, students, academics or TAFE directors—put significant expert evidence before us. 


The contestability market is clearly not working for TAFE. Certainly a number of independent witnesses suggested that there be more of a controlled market, and that there are some areas that TAFE should not be competing in. One of the areas of excellence that TAFE provides is in the absolutely solid support for students with disability. We heard from an amazing young man in Sydney, who was representing the Deaf Society. He was incredibly articulate. Help with the cost of Auslan interpreters and note-takers and all the other services and supporters that, in particular, deaf students need is under threat. In Wollongong a young man gave us evidence. He had completed a whole range of diplomas but he physically needed quite a lot of support. That is at threat, too.


Clearly, TAFE is a provider of excellence in terms of supporting students with disability. It is clearly a leader in second-chance education. It is a leader in terms of providing younger students who have dropped out of school with the opportunity to come back. We heard evidence from a young woman in Perth who told us that TAFE was the difference between life and death for her. It was that serious. Her life was so far off the rail but through doing a youth diploma in TAFE she is now working in that field and her whole life has changed.


I am sure that those opposite—in particular, Senator McKenzie—would appreciate that education can turn people's lives around. Clearly TAFE is expert in that.


TAFE sits within a political space. There were very disappointing issues that arose in Perth and Wollongong. In Perth particularly, the state government threatened the employment of witnesses who were giving evidence. The committee had to send a very strong letter to the WA government outlining the fact that parliamentary privilege extended to witnesses. There was a similar issue in Wollongong. So this is obviously getting to be political.


I hope that COAG takes our recommendations seriously. We need to ensure that TAFE survives. It is not just another registered training organisation. It is clearly much, much more than that. At risk right now is the further education of students with disability and second-chance education, of which TAFE is such a strong providers, particularly in relation to mature-age people who have become redundant and need to change their skills.


We heard a lot of evidence like that and it was rather surprising that only two state governments have a clear definition of the sorts of roles that TAFEs play. We heard evidence of where TAFE was expanding. There were partnerships with universities. One TAFE in particular is looking at working with a big private health provider to look at how they can do courses of mutual benefit. Those are all positive outcomes, but clearly both the federal and state governments, through the COAG process, need to be very clear about TAFE. It does need to remain a provider of excellence and a benchmark against which we hold all others accountable.


This competitive market it sits in now needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency, because TAFE is a great provider of vocational education and training in our country. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:22):  Youth unemployment is a very big issue for Australia and for young Australians. I regret to say this is particularly the case for my home state of Tasmania. According to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics our unemployment rate for 15- to 24-year-olds is 17.4 per cent compared with a national average of 12.2 per cent. The situation is even worse when you get into the north-west of Tasmania where in some areas the unemployment rate is as high as 21 per cent. That is one young person out of a job for every five seeking to participate in the workforce. This is a serious challenge for government as we need to ensure that our young people have a stable future and that the next generation is job ready.


The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Increased Employment Participation) Bill is the government's attempt to put in place incentives to assist young job seekers. The bill establishes the Job Commitment Bonus. Young Australians aged from 18 to 30 who have been receiving Newstart Allowance or Youth Allowance, other than as an apprentice or a full-time student, for a period of at least 12 months will be eligible to receive a tax-free payment of $2,500 if they remain in gainful work and off income support for a continuous period of at least 12 months. Recipients will also qualify for a further tax-free bonus payment of $4,000 if they remain in continuous gainful work for an additional 12 months. That is a continuous period of 24 months in total.


The bill also establishes the Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job program. This program provides financial assistance to long-term unemployed job seekers with participation requirements who have been receiving Newstart Allowance, or Youth Allowance, other than as apprentices of full-time students, or parenting payment for at least the preceding 12 months to relocate for the purposes of commencing ongoing employment. The program is demand driven and will provide up to $6,000 to support eligible job seekers who relocate to a regional area, either from a metropolitan or another regional area, or up to $3,000 to support eligible job seekers who relocate to a metropolitan area, either from a regional area, or, in certain circumstances, another metropolitan area. Families with dependent children will be provided with up to an extra $3,000. The non-payment periods for participants who leave their employment without good reason within six months after receiving a relocation payment will be 26 weeks under this bill rather than the 12 weeks which currently applies to relocation payments made under Labor's Move 2 Work program.


I question the government's financial impact statement accompanying this bill. The government's figures assume that the relocation program will operate as a savings measure due to job seekers remaining in employment rather than receiving unemployment benefits. There are a couple of reasons why I believe this assumption is questionable. Firstly, relocating for work does not mean that long-term unemployed job seekers are more likely to remain in employment. Secondly, Labor's Move 2 Work program, while not as generous as the government's relocation program, was similarly intended to increase workforce participation but had a very low take-up rate. While Labor will not be opposing the bill, we do have a serious concern about one of the provisions. The non-payment period for participants who leave their employment without good reason is extended to 26 weeks, up from the 12 weeks which currently applies under Labor's Move 2 Work program. We believe that 26 weeks is unduly harsh. I understand that my colleague Senator Cameron has already tabled amendments to deal with this provision which will be considered in committee. I understand that the hardship provisions, which waive the non-payment period, continue to apply. But the hardship provisions are about access to the essentials of life such as health care, housing or sanitation. What we need to consider carefully is the impact of extending a non-payment period on a job seeker's ability to find work and to maintain a reasonable lifestyle. Labor would like to see the government commit to reviewing the impact of this measure on job seekers because we do not accept that a person can be job ready while receiving no income for six months.


Perhaps we should be thankful that this is not the worst to come considering the announcement in the budget last night that people under the age of 30 applying for Newstart Allowance will have to wait six months before receiving a payment. The changes to Newstart announced in the budget seem to be at odds with the Treasurer's statement in his budget speech which said, 'As Australians, we must not leave our children worse off,'—but I digress.


As I said earlier, Labor will not be opposing this bill. After all, it has some provisions which have the potential to be useful. The measures in the bill are about providing young people with incentives to look for work and to remain in work. Incentives are important, but they will not work unless there are jobs to go to and job seekers have the right skills for those jobs. The fact is that the overwhelming majority of young people are willing to work but face a number of barriers that are beyond their control. The government needs to realise that a lot more is needed to tackle the pervasive problem of youth unemployment. There needs to be a job creation agenda.


The Prime Minister promised before the election that he would create one million jobs within five years and two million over the next decade. That is an average of 200,000 jobs a year so, by now, the government should have created more than 100,000 jobs. However, the pace of jobs growth has been well short of this target. In catching up to their aspiration, the government also need to make up for the announced 60,000-odd job losses in Holden, Toyota, car parts manufacturers, Qantas, Rio Tinto and Alcoa, not to mention the job losses in the public sector resulting from last night's budget and all the flow-on effects of those losses.


Labor in government created 950,000 jobs, while 28 million jobs were lost around the world during the same period. In addition to this we saved another 200,000 jobs through our decisive action during the global financial crisis. We also put in place a $1 billion plan to support exports, grow small business and help local manufacturers win local contracts, and we investigated future export opportunities through the Asian Century white paper. By contrast, we have yet to see a plan from this government for job creation. Australians who are currently out there looking for work are rightly asking where the government's plan is.


Another element that is needed to get young people into work is education and training so that they have the skills to match the jobs available. In government, Labor focused on supporting young people to finish school and to get the training and higher education they need for well-paying jobs. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, Labor invested over $19 billion in skills funding—a 77 per cent increase on the previous government's investment. Since 2009, the federal Labor government provided funding of $6 billion to support state and territory skills and workforce development under the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development. We also announced that all Australians would have access of up to $90,000 assistance though VET FEE-HELP and access to courses up to certificate Ill level though the National Training Entitlement. So, Labor has a proud record of investing in skills and training.


Getting young people into jobs also requires comprehensive support services, and this is an area where Labor also has a proud track record. We introduced a system which matched services to individual job seekers and prioritised resources to go to the job seekers with the greatest need. This resulted in outcomes for job seekers improving by 90 per cent. Labor initiated a further review of employment services in 2012. There was strong interest in the review with over 180 written submissions received, and 440 people from 300 organisations attended face-to-face consultations.


We announced, prior to the last election, that Labor would establish a new system, Jobs and Training Australia, which would integrate employment services and training systems for the first time and place job seekers, workers and employers at the heart of the system. The system was to be founded on seven key principles: (1) training and employment services will be integrated through a place based and demand-led model; (2) Jobs and training boards 


will be established in around 42 regions across Australia to formally link employers, employment and training services, and health and community services. The boards will also ensure that services meet local needs and replace the artificial boundaries of the current employment service areas. (3) The up-front assessment of job seeker needs and employment barriers will be improved; (4) the jobs, training and apprenticeship guarantee will ensure that every job seeker gets the help they need to get back to work and that no one slips through the cracks regardless of whether they have low or high needs, or how long they have been unemployed; (5) there will be an increased focus on addressing long-term unemployment and youth unemployment, and on closing the gap in Indigenous employment; (6) incentive structures for providers will be changed to encourage sustained employment outcomes and reward investment in improving the capacity of job seekers to secure work; (7) an independent employment services regulator will manage job seeker complaints and service quality, oversee provider compliance and be responsible for reducing red tape. We are yet to see what the new government's plan is for Job Services Australia. If they are serious about tackling youth unemployment, I would strongly encourage them to take up the principles enshrined in Labor's pre-election policy.


Labor also wanted to provide a jobs, training and apprenticeship guarantee, which would ensure access to telephone and online career advice, skills appraisals, assistance with resume writing. It would be engaged with an employment service provider and start work on a return-to-work plan within two days.


So, to sum up, we are satisfied with the incentives provided in this bill, but we believe there needs to be a more comprehensive approach to tackling youth unemployment. This approach needs job creation, investment in skills and training, and investment in employment services which meet the needs of job seekers.


On that note, I commend the bill to the Senate, while highlighting the opposition's concerns about the doubling of the non-payment period.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-05-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:33):  As my mother used to say, this bill is a bit like Curate's egg—in other words, there are bits that are good and bits that are bad. There are elements of this bill we support and agree with because we do think it is important to provide incentives, in particular for young job seekers. I was in here not long ago talking about how some of the budget measures the government is intending to bring in will significantly impact on young job seekers and young unemployed people. I am glad the government is recognising that we do need to be providing support to young job seekers and this is a much better way of doing it.


This bill seeks to amend two parts of social security legislation. First, it provides that job seekers aged from 18 to 30 years who have been receiving Newstart or youth allowance for at least 12 months will be eligible to receive a tax-free payment of $2,500. If they remain in employment and off income support for a continuous period of 12 months, they will receive an additional payment. That is really good and we can support that part of the legislation. Second, it provides relocation assistance for people to take up a job.


But what we have concerns about is this bill changes the non-payment period or, in effect, the punishment period if you leave employment without a reasonable excuse. In fact, there will now be a 26-week non-payment period before a person can become eligible to receive unemployment benefits. This is the same issue I was talking about in the chamber earlier today. Young job seekers who are unemployed will have to wait six months—well, six months and six weeks so, in fact, seven months and two weeks—before they are given an initial payment. They then have to work for the dole and after six months they will then receive no payments for six months. It is the same argument: how do you expect people to live for that period of time? It also depends very much on what your definition of a reasonable excuse is, and I have had several run-ins with the department in the past about what are reasonable excuses.


When young people move and take up relocation assistance, they quite often move to an area where they do not have family support or the usual supports. They can be quite disconnected from the community and that plays out quite significantly on how they adapt to their work environment. The concerns here are that on one hand we have a positive measure, on the other hand we have one that we think is over the top. ACOSS has raised concerns about the changes of definition around some of the requirements in the bill and we share their concerns. So while the ALP has moved to amend, as I understand it, the exclusion from payments provision which would then revert back to the normal 12 weeks, we would like to knock out the whole of schedule 2 because the whole of the schedule deals with both the exclusion from eligibility for unemployment benefits and extending that to the 26-week period and also some of the definitional aspects of the legislation and we have some concerns about that. It changes the emphasis around how you get penalised and we believe that is a retrograde step in this legislation. We would prefer to see those not changed. 


We have circulated in the last sitting amendments to the legislation which would in fact exclude or oppose schedule 2 while supporting schedule 1, which has the sorts of supports we need for young people. We need a much more supportive approach rather than a punitive approach. A punitive approach demonises people and assumes people do not want to work. As I said earlier, classing most of them as sitting around on the couch getting easy welfare is not the way you want to encourage people into work. The way to encourage them is, firstly, to have an incentive approach. The big stick does not work when people are living in poverty; poverty becomes yet another barrier to work. There is evidence to show that but there is not evidence to show that dropping people into poverty provides an extra incentive to work. It does not; it in fact becomes another barrier. So instead of penalising people we need to take a more positive approach, which this one does. It will be interesting to see how this now lines up with some of the other mechanisms that the government is bringing in and the impact the other approach the government is bringing through the budget will have on young people and how it encourages people into work versus a much more supportive approach which helps incentivise people and does not penalise people. It is an approach that works with young people to address their training needs and addresses any other barriers they have to employment. We know that that more individualised approach does help people into employment whereas a much more draconian penalising approach does not. 


But the government could not help themselves with this. They brought in a positive but the sting in the tail was schedule 2, where people are penalised for such a long period of time. We believe it is much better to leave it at the current rate. If you are living on nothing, it really is a punishment for 12 weeks rather than 26 weeks; it really is. It is extremely hard for people to manage. I know that because I have had feedback from people who have already experienced, for example, the eight-week non-eligibility period when people were penalised for no-show, for example, through the current process. Eight weeks is a long time not to get any payment, so is 12 weeks, and 26 weeks is just too much. It is six months, half a year, which in fact is what the government is doing with its new approach announced last night in the budget.


So the Greens support the first part of this bill but we do not support the second part, schedule 2. Given that the ALP is, as I understand, still moving amendments, we support their amendments but they are not as extensive as ours, so I indicate our support for the ALP half-step that we have taken but we would prefer that we strike out the whole of schedule 2 because we believe that the amendments that this schedule seeks to make are not positive amendments but take us a step backwards in terms of the definitional aspects of the bill. However, we support schedule 1.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-05-14,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:42):  The coalition is proud to support policies that encourage job seekers into jobs and encourage job seekers to stay in those jobs. This bill enables two such policies: the Job Commitment Bonus and the relocation assistance to take up a job program. These policies are major initiatives of the government's broader policy commitment to encourage an increased workforce participation. We took these policies to the election and this bill will deliver on these election commitments.


I will briefly outline the Job Commitment Bonus. It is a new incentive specifically targeted to young Australians. The coalition understands the importance of getting young people into work. Getting young people into work and keeping them in work is crucial to avoiding the damage long-term unemployment can do. All the evidence shows that having a job improves not only your financial health but your emotional, physical and mental health. The Job Commitment Bonus is an incentive that encourages young people to stay in a job and keeps them away from the tragic cycle of long-term unemployment. 


The Job Commitment Bonus is a new payment. There was no equivalent payment under the former Labor government. This is an innovative policy to address a very serious problem of youth unemployment. I know that in the regional electorate of Indi youth unemployment at the moment is at 17.5 per cent, so it is indeed a concern for all of us, regional and urban Australians like. This bonus rewards young Australians aged from 18 to 30 who get and keep a job and remain off welfare. Eligible young job seekers will receive $2,500 after 12 months in continuous employment and off welfare and a further $4,000 if they remain in continuous employment and off welfare for another 12 months. That is 24 months in total with a total bonus of $6,500. This is a significant investment by government to help young long-term unemployed Australians to make a positive change in their life, specifically moving away from welfare dependency to finding and keeping a job. To qualify for the bonus payment job seekers will have to meet the following criteria. Firstly, they will have to be aged 18 to 30 and have been on income support, Newstart allowance or Youth Allowance for at least the preceding 12 months. Secondly, they need to get a job and remain continuously employed for 12 months and off welfare to attract the first bonus payment of $2½ thousand and then remain continuously employed for a further 12 months whilst remaining off welfare to attract the second bonus payment of $4,000. This will be a significant incentive for young people to get off welfare and keep a job.


The relocation assistance to take up a job program is a targeted measure designed to promote workforce participation by encouraging jobseekers to move to areas where jobs are available. Many jobseekers find themselves living in areas with high levels of unemployment and far away from job opportunities. This, combined with high moving costs, causes many jobseekers to give up on taking up a job that they could ordinarily take because they are simply too far away. This program will help long-term unemployed people and assist with the costs of relocation, so that they can actually move to where the jobs are. The program will provide significant financial assistance of up to $3,000 for jobseekers to move to a metropolitan area, up to $6,000 to move to a regional area and up to an additional $3,000 for jobseekers with dependent children. It is important to note that this program will reimburse actual moving costs up to the applicable maximum amount, including some rent in advance if necessary.


Both measures contained in this bill will address long-term unemployment and demonstrate the coalition's broader agenda of increasing employment participation across the economy. The coalition firmly believes that all Australians capable of work should be working. The Job Commitment Bonus and the relocation assistance program will both encourage and reward long-term unemployed to find and keep a job. These measures form part of the coalition's plan to create a stronger economy and create two million jobs over the next decade and will particularly help young Australians and the long-term unemployed move from welfare to work.


Why are we choosing to introduce these measures? The Job Commitment Bonus addresses the problem of youth unemployment. We understand, as I said earlier, the importance of getting young people into work. It is a targeted measure designed to promote workforce participation. As we have seen in the economy in recent years, particularly when we look at regional areas, there have been significant job opportunities created, particularly in Western Australia and areas of western New South Wales and Queensland, particularly in the mining industry. Many young people have taken advantage of those opportunities and have taken the skills that they have learnt at TAFE or, indeed, on the farm—particularly around mechanical skills—to these regional areas and participated in very lucrative job opportunities in working within the mining and construction industry. So it is possible to move from family and friends. Whilst it is heart wrenching and hard to move away from your community, to ensure your own financial stability and future and the economic sustainability of family if you have dependants these are the decisions that you may have to make.


When we look at high-income earners, we see that they tend to be a lot more mobile as a workforce and are quite willing, able and ready to move to where the next best job opportunity is for them in their particular career area. This is not the case for those who have been on welfare or are from low-income families. This type of targeted measure is one way the coalition government is seeking to provide additional assistance to those most vulnerable in our communities to ensure that they can have additional assistance to make those difficult decisions to move from friends and family and from their communities to where potential job opportunities may be available elsewhere in our national economy and, by doing so, provide financial stability for themselves going forward. I know that those opposite may struggle to accept that it is an acceptable measure for young people to actually incentivise them moving away from home.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-05-14,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:22):  Youth unemployment is a very big issue for Australia and for young Australians. I regret to say this is particularly the case for my home state of Tasmania. According to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics our unemployment rate for 15- to 24-year-olds is 17.4 per cent compared with a national average of 12.2 per cent. The situation is even worse when you get into the north-west of Tasmania where in some areas the unemployment rate is as high as 21 per cent. That is one young person out of a job for every five seeking to participate in the workforce. This is a serious challenge for government as we need to ensure that our young people have a stable future and that the next generation is job ready.


The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Increased Employment Participation) Bill is the government's attempt to put in place incentives to assist young job seekers. The bill establishes the Job Commitment Bonus. Young Australians aged from 18 to 30 who have been receiving Newstart Allowance or Youth Allowance, other than as an apprentice or a full-time student, for a period of at least 12 months will be eligible to receive a tax-free payment of $2,500 if they remain in gainful work and off income support for a continuous period of at least 12 months. Recipients will also qualify for a further tax-free bonus payment of $4,000 if they remain in continuous gainful work for an additional 12 months. That is a continuous period of 24 months in total.


The bill also establishes the Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job program. This program provides financial assistance to long-term unemployed job seekers with participation requirements who have been receiving Newstart Allowance, or Youth Allowance, other than as apprentices of full-time students, or parenting payment for at least the preceding 12 months to relocate for the purposes of commencing ongoing employment. The program is demand driven and will provide up to $6,000 to support eligible job seekers who relocate to a regional area, either from a metropolitan or another regional area, or up to $3,000 to support eligible job seekers who relocate to a metropolitan area, either from a regional area, or, in certain circumstances, another metropolitan area. Families with dependent children will be provided with up to an extra $3,000. The non-payment periods for participants who leave their employment without good reason within six months after receiving a relocation payment will be 26 weeks under this bill rather than the 12 weeks which currently applies to relocation payments made under Labor's Move 2 Work program.


I question the government's financial impact statement accompanying this bill. The government's figures assume that the relocation program will operate as a savings measure due to job seekers remaining in employment rather than receiving unemployment benefits. There are a couple of reasons why I believe this assumption is questionable. Firstly, relocating for work does not mean that long-term unemployed job seekers are more likely to remain in employment. Secondly, Labor's Move 2 Work program, while not as generous as the government's relocation program, was similarly intended to increase workforce participation but had a very low take-up rate. While Labor will not be opposing the bill, we do have a serious concern about one of the provisions. The non-payment period for participants who leave their employment without good reason is extended to 26 weeks, up from the 12 weeks which currently applies under Labor's Move 2 Work program. We believe that 26 weeks is unduly harsh. I understand that my colleague Senator Cameron has already tabled amendments to deal with this provision which will be considered in committee. I understand that the hardship provisions, which waive the non-payment period, continue to apply. But the hardship provisions are about access to the essentials of life such as health care, housing or sanitation. What we need to consider carefully is the impact of extending a non-payment period on a job seeker's ability to find work and to maintain a reasonable lifestyle. Labor would like to see the government commit to reviewing the impact of this measure on job seekers because we do not accept that a person can be job ready while receiving no income for six months.


Perhaps we should be thankful that this is not the worst to come considering the announcement in the budget last night that people under the age of 30 applying for Newstart Allowance will have to wait six months before receiving a payment. The changes to Newstart announced in the budget seem to be at odds with the Treasurer's statement in his budget speech which said, 'As Australians, we must not leave our children worse off,'—but I digress.


As I said earlier, Labor will not be opposing this bill. After all, it has some provisions which have the potential to be useful. The measures in the bill are about providing young people with incentives to look for work and to remain in work. Incentives are important, but they will not work unless there are jobs to go to and job seekers have the right skills for those jobs. The fact is that the overwhelming majority of young people are willing to work but face a number of barriers that are beyond their control. The government needs to realise that a lot more is needed to tackle the pervasive problem of youth unemployment. There needs to be a job creation agenda.


The Prime Minister promised before the election that he would create one million jobs within five years and two million over the next decade. That is an average of 200,000 jobs a year so, by now, the government should have created more than 100,000 jobs. However, the pace of jobs growth has been well short of this target. In catching up to their aspiration, the government also need to make up for the announced 60,000-odd job losses in Holden, Toyota, car parts manufacturers, Qantas, Rio Tinto and Alcoa, not to mention the job losses in the public sector resulting from last night's budget and all the flow-on effects of those losses.


Labor in government created 950,000 jobs, while 28 million jobs were lost around the world during the same period. In addition to this we saved another 200,000 jobs through our decisive action during the global financial crisis. We also put in place a $1 billion plan to support exports, grow small business and help local manufacturers win local contracts, and we investigated future export opportunities through the Asian Century white paper. By contrast, we have yet to see a plan from this government for job creation. Australians who are currently out there looking for work are rightly asking where the government's plan is.


Another element that is needed to get young people into work is education and training so that they have the skills to match the jobs available. In government, Labor focused on supporting young people to finish school and to get the training and higher education they need for well-paying jobs. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, Labor invested over $19 billion in skills funding—a 77 per cent increase on the previous government's investment. Since 2009, the federal Labor government provided funding of $6 billion to support state and territory skills and workforce development under the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development. We also announced that all Australians would have access of up to $90,000 assistance though VET FEE-HELP and access to courses up to certificate Ill level though the National Training Entitlement. So, Labor has a proud record of investing in skills and training.


Getting young people into jobs also requires comprehensive support services, and this is an area where Labor also has a proud track record. We introduced a system which matched services to individual job seekers and prioritised resources to go to the job seekers with the greatest need. This resulted in outcomes for job seekers improving by 90 per cent. Labor initiated a further review of employment services in 2012. There was strong interest in the review with over 180 written submissions received, and 440 people from 300 organisations attended face-to-face consultations.


We announced, prior to the last election, that Labor would establish a new system, Jobs and Training Australia, which would integrate employment services and training systems for the first time and place job seekers, workers and employers at the heart of the system. The system was to be founded on seven key principles: (1) training and employment services will be integrated through a place based and demand-led model; (2) Jobs and training boards 


will be established in around 42 regions across Australia to formally link employers, employment and training services, and health and community services. The boards will also ensure that services meet local needs and replace the artificial boundaries of the current employment service areas. (3) The up-front assessment of job seeker needs and employment barriers will be improved; (4) the jobs, training and apprenticeship guarantee will ensure that every job seeker gets the help they need to get back to work and that no one slips through the cracks regardless of whether they have low or high needs, or how long they have been unemployed; (5) there will be an increased focus on addressing long-term unemployment and youth unemployment, and on closing the gap in Indigenous employment; (6) incentive structures for providers will be changed to encourage sustained employment outcomes and reward investment in improving the capacity of job seekers to secure work; (7) an independent employment services regulator will manage job seeker complaints and service quality, oversee provider compliance and be responsible for reducing red tape. We are yet to see what the new government's plan is for Job Services Australia. If they are serious about tackling youth unemployment, I would strongly encourage them to take up the principles enshrined in Labor's pre-election policy.


Labor also wanted to provide a jobs, training and apprenticeship guarantee, which would ensure access to telephone and online career advice, skills appraisals, assistance with resume writing. It would be engaged with an employment service provider and start work on a return-to-work plan within two days.


So, to sum up, we are satisfied with the incentives provided in this bill, but we believe there needs to be a more comprehensive approach to tackling youth unemployment. This approach needs job creation, investment in skills and training, and investment in employment services which meet the needs of job seekers.


On that note, I commend the bill to the Senate, while highlighting the opposition's concerns about the doubling of the non-payment period.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,27,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-05-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:33):  As my mother used to say, this bill is a bit like Curate's egg—in other words, there are bits that are good and bits that are bad. There are elements of this bill we support and agree with because we do think it is important to provide incentives, in particular for young job seekers. I was in here not long ago talking about how some of the budget measures the government is intending to bring in will significantly impact on young job seekers and young unemployed people. I am glad the government is recognising that we do need to be providing support to young job seekers and this is a much better way of doing it.


This bill seeks to amend two parts of social security legislation. First, it provides that job seekers aged from 18 to 30 years who have been receiving Newstart or youth allowance for at least 12 months will be eligible to receive a tax-free payment of $2,500. If they remain in employment and off income support for a continuous period of 12 months, they will receive an additional payment. That is really good and we can support that part of the legislation. Second, it provides relocation assistance for people to take up a job.


But what we have concerns about is this bill changes the non-payment period or, in effect, the punishment period if you leave employment without a reasonable excuse. In fact, there will now be a 26-week non-payment period before a person can become eligible to receive unemployment benefits. This is the same issue I was talking about in the chamber earlier today. Young job seekers who are unemployed will have to wait six months—well, six months and six weeks so, in fact, seven months and two weeks—before they are given an initial payment. They then have to work for the dole and after six months they will then receive no payments for six months. It is the same argument: how do you expect people to live for that period of time? It also depends very much on what your definition of a reasonable excuse is, and I have had several run-ins with the department in the past about what are reasonable excuses.


When young people move and take up relocation assistance, they quite often move to an area where they do not have family support or the usual supports. They can be quite disconnected from the community and that plays out quite significantly on how they adapt to their work environment. The concerns here are that on one hand we have a positive measure, on the other hand we have one that we think is over the top. ACOSS has raised concerns about the changes of definition around some of the requirements in the bill and we share their concerns. So while the ALP has moved to amend, as I understand it, the exclusion from payments provision which would then revert back to the normal 12 weeks, we would like to knock out the whole of schedule 2 because the whole of the schedule deals with both the exclusion from eligibility for unemployment benefits and extending that to the 26-week period and also some of the definitional aspects of the legislation and we have some concerns about that. It changes the emphasis around how you get penalised and we believe that is a retrograde step in this legislation. We would prefer to see those not changed. 


We have circulated in the last sitting amendments to the legislation which would in fact exclude or oppose schedule 2 while supporting schedule 1, which has the sorts of supports we need for young people. We need a much more supportive approach rather than a punitive approach. A punitive approach demonises people and assumes people do not want to work. As I said earlier, classing most of them as sitting around on the couch getting easy welfare is not the way you want to encourage people into work. The way to encourage them is, firstly, to have an incentive approach. The big stick does not work when people are living in poverty; poverty becomes yet another barrier to work. There is evidence to show that but there is not evidence to show that dropping people into poverty provides an extra incentive to work. It does not; it in fact becomes another barrier. So instead of penalising people we need to take a more positive approach, which this one does. It will be interesting to see how this now lines up with some of the other mechanisms that the government is bringing in and the impact the other approach the government is bringing through the budget will have on young people and how it encourages people into work versus a much more supportive approach which helps incentivise people and does not penalise people. It is an approach that works with young people to address their training needs and addresses any other barriers they have to employment. We know that that more individualised approach does help people into employment whereas a much more draconian penalising approach does not. 


But the government could not help themselves with this. They brought in a positive but the sting in the tail was schedule 2, where people are penalised for such a long period of time. We believe it is much better to leave it at the current rate. If you are living on nothing, it really is a punishment for 12 weeks rather than 26 weeks; it really is. It is extremely hard for people to manage. I know that because I have had feedback from people who have already experienced, for example, the eight-week non-eligibility period when people were penalised for no-show, for example, through the current process. Eight weeks is a long time not to get any payment, so is 12 weeks, and 26 weeks is just too much. It is six months, half a year, which in fact is what the government is doing with its new approach announced last night in the budget.


So the Greens support the first part of this bill but we do not support the second part, schedule 2. Given that the ALP is, as I understand, still moving amendments, we support their amendments but they are not as extensive as ours, so I indicate our support for the ALP half-step that we have taken but we would prefer that we strike out the whole of schedule 2 because we believe that the amendments that this schedule seeks to make are not positive amendments but take us a step backwards in terms of the definitional aspects of the bill. However, we support schedule 1.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-05-14,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:42):  The coalition is proud to support policies that encourage job seekers into jobs and encourage job seekers to stay in those jobs. This bill enables two such policies: the Job Commitment Bonus and the relocation assistance to take up a job program. These policies are major initiatives of the government's broader policy commitment to encourage an increased workforce participation. We took these policies to the election and this bill will deliver on these election commitments.


I will briefly outline the Job Commitment Bonus. It is a new incentive specifically targeted to young Australians. The coalition understands the importance of getting young people into work. Getting young people into work and keeping them in work is crucial to avoiding the damage long-term unemployment can do. All the evidence shows that having a job improves not only your financial health but your emotional, physical and mental health. The Job Commitment Bonus is an incentive that encourages young people to stay in a job and keeps them away from the tragic cycle of long-term unemployment. 


The Job Commitment Bonus is a new payment. There was no equivalent payment under the former Labor government. This is an innovative policy to address a very serious problem of youth unemployment. I know that in the regional electorate of Indi youth unemployment at the moment is at 17.5 per cent, so it is indeed a concern for all of us, regional and urban Australians like. This bonus rewards young Australians aged from 18 to 30 who get and keep a job and remain off welfare. Eligible young job seekers will receive $2,500 after 12 months in continuous employment and off welfare and a further $4,000 if they remain in continuous employment and off welfare for another 12 months. That is 24 months in total with a total bonus of $6,500. This is a significant investment by government to help young long-term unemployed Australians to make a positive change in their life, specifically moving away from welfare dependency to finding and keeping a job. To qualify for the bonus payment job seekers will have to meet the following criteria. Firstly, they will have to be aged 18 to 30 and have been on income support, Newstart allowance or Youth Allowance for at least the preceding 12 months. Secondly, they need to get a job and remain continuously employed for 12 months and off welfare to attract the first bonus payment of $2½ thousand and then remain continuously employed for a further 12 months whilst remaining off welfare to attract the second bonus payment of $4,000. This will be a significant incentive for young people to get off welfare and keep a job.


The relocation assistance to take up a job program is a targeted measure designed to promote workforce participation by encouraging jobseekers to move to areas where jobs are available. Many jobseekers find themselves living in areas with high levels of unemployment and far away from job opportunities. This, combined with high moving costs, causes many jobseekers to give up on taking up a job that they could ordinarily take because they are simply too far away. This program will help long-term unemployed people and assist with the costs of relocation, so that they can actually move to where the jobs are. The program will provide significant financial assistance of up to $3,000 for jobseekers to move to a metropolitan area, up to $6,000 to move to a regional area and up to an additional $3,000 for jobseekers with dependent children. It is important to note that this program will reimburse actual moving costs up to the applicable maximum amount, including some rent in advance if necessary.


Both measures contained in this bill will address long-term unemployment and demonstrate the coalition's broader agenda of increasing employment participation across the economy. The coalition firmly believes that all Australians capable of work should be working. The Job Commitment Bonus and the relocation assistance program will both encourage and reward long-term unemployed to find and keep a job. These measures form part of the coalition's plan to create a stronger economy and create two million jobs over the next decade and will particularly help young Australians and the long-term unemployed move from welfare to work.


Why are we choosing to introduce these measures? The Job Commitment Bonus addresses the problem of youth unemployment.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-05-14,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (18:51):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I wanted to draw the Senate's attention to the Torres Strait Regional Authority Report and the corrigendum, as a way of drawing attention to the Torres Strait itself. I was lucky enough to be a member of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia that visited the Torres Strait in April. Amongst the others who were there were the chair, of course, Mr Warren Entsch, and Queensland senators Ian Macdonald and Joe Ludwig, as well as other members of the joint committee from other states.


I was very honoured during my visit there to receive a gift from the Torres Strait Regional Authority. I have tried very hard during my time as a senator to draw the Senate's attention, both as a Queensland senator and as an Australian senator, to the existence of the Torres Strait. I have been trying to make the point for many years that Australia does not stop at Cape York; although that is the end of the mainland, Australia continues for another 140 kilometres, with our most northerly island, Boigu, being only six kilometres from the Papua New Guinean coast and within easy sight and boat reach of the Papuan coast.


During our committee's inquiry the Torres Strait Regional Authority made some very strong points about the unique position that they inhabit within Australia as our most northern frontier. It is certainly a frontier that has, in certain ways, as Minister Scott Morrison in a subsequent visit pointed out, some porosity for Australia and for our border. But in the Torres Strait they face many problems, not the least of which is being our most northerly and most open border—with the issues relating to health, to biosecurity and to crime—as a way, perhaps, to enter Australia, and the Torres Strait Islanders I believe have done an extraordinarily good job of occupying that position. The other point that they make is that they occupy a part of Australia that is very expensive to live in, very expensive to visit and very expensive to get around. During evidence we heard that it can cost over $300 for a flight from one of the islands to the main island of Thursday Island, for medical treatment, for example. So it can be over $600 simply to visit the doctor—which is not something, of course, that very many of us, even in rural and remote Australia, experience. Also, the cost of fuel there is at least twice what it is in other parts of Australia.


I also want to add that this was my last visit as a senator to the Torres Strait, but will by no means be my last visit to the Torres Strait. I will continue to support the area.


In my time as a senator I have established three scholarships for Queensland women for educational purposes, and one of those is the Morey Scholarship, named after my great-grandfather who had pearling luggers in the Torres Strait before World War II. According to family history, he was quite pleased when these were commandeered during World War II because the pearling industry was in decline! But the most recent winner of the Morey Scholarship is a young woman who was born on Horn Island and is now undertaking a Batchelor of Education with JCU in Cairns. Her name is Katijah Keenan, and she is intending to return to the Torres Strait after she has finished her degree. Quite coincidentally, we have discovered, since speaking to her, that Katijah's grandfather, a Mr TJ Farquhar, was a pearler in the Torres Strait at the same time as my great-grandfather, Frederick Morey. So I hope that this will provoke both of us to put some more time into looking at our history in a very worthwhile part of Australia.


Question agreed to.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2014-05-14,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (18:58):  It will come as no news to other senators in this place that I have a longstanding commitment to our federation. The Australian Constitution was founded on a very sound principle of clearly delineating responsibilities for the Commonwealth, with matters not specifically mentioned in section 51 of our Constitution held to remain the responsibility of state governments. This was not an accident of design. It was a clearly thought-through element of systemic protection, which drew heavily on the American experience.


I have spoken previously in this chamber of the powerful influence that James Bryce's book The American Commonwealth exerted on many of the delegates who attended the constitutional conventions of the 1890s, which created the document that continues to underpin our system of government today.


Bryce's work comprehensively catalogues the numerous benefits that flow from a system of government that clearly divides power between a central national government and state jurisdictions, which, by definition, are closer to the people and, accordingly, have a better capacity to appreciate and respond to the more immediate day-to Australia.


As a Western Australian I can say—and I am sure that other Western Australian residents would also say—that this is more than a constitutional theory; it accords with our own lived experience. There is a reason why Western Australians were initially reluctant to join the Federation in the lead-up to 1 January 1901.


Likewise, it is not an accident that at each attempt a federal government has made to alter the Constitution in a fashion designed to grant increased powers to Canberra, the yes vote in Western Australia tends to be noticeably lower than in other jurisdictions. 


I realise it is something of a cliche, but the fact remains that Western Australia is a very different place from Australia's eastern states. Our geography orients us toward the Indian Ocean, rather than the Pacific. It is cheaper and faster for Western Australians to travel to Bali, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur than to some of our key eastern-state centres.


Western Australia exports 46 per cent—almost half—of Australia's total exports. Some estimates indicate that by the end of this decade that figure will be closer to 60 per cent. Seventy-three per cent of all Australia's exports to China come from Western Australia.


As I have said on previous occasions, Western Australians understand that we are part of a nation, a Federation. However, I believe that that Federation is big enough and mature enough to account for the fact that there are distinct cultural and economic elements in each of its constituent parts. There is no doubt that there are changes and challenges within our Federation. It has its problems. However, my view is that these problems have not emerged because of the design of our federalist system, as some would suggest. Rather, these problems have arisen because of political imperatives—a desire by federal governments of both political persuasions to overreach, to gather more power into their own hands, at the expense of the states.


I think that what had sometimes been forgotten in this centralist zeal is that, when you take powers from the states though the power games that have been fashionable over recent decades, it is actually the citizen you disempower, not the state government.


After all, state parliaments still exist, state parliamentarians continue to draw salaries and state public servants still have jobs. In practical terms, they have lost very little. The big losers have been the residents in our states, most particularly in my home state of Western Australia, who have had to deal with services increasingly being run from a distant national capital that does not understand the day-to-day needs of our communities.


Accordingly, the question those of us in this place need to deal with is the manner in which we address this challenge. As I see it, there are really two pathways to reform. One way—and I know it has had a number of fans on the other side of the chamber—is to abolish state governments altogether.


Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, along with other senior Labor figures, is on the public record as favouring this radical course of action. During its time in government, under former Prime Minster Kevin Rudd, Labor promised to end the blame game. In the lead-up the 2007 election, when Mr Rudd was in his 'economic conservative' phase and those opposite were keeping their real views about their leader under wraps, this was portrayed as an honest desire by the Labor Party to work with the states.


Yet, once safely in The Lodge, it quickly transpired that what Mr Rudd had in mind was a series of federal takeovers, taking over hospitals and schools. Mr Rudd, with hands on levers, was going to cure all our ills by taking personal charge of them. And what did he create? An almighty mess, one that was so bad that his colleagues were forced to end his political career. 


Time and time again, Australian history has demonstrated that there is simply no evidence that the Commonwealth government is any better at service delivery than the state governments it seeks to usurp. Indeed, our experience in Australia has repeatedly demonstrated that the Commonwealth is actually very bad at service delivery.


That is the reason we saw former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in the witness box today, delivering evidence at a royal commission into the role his bungled home insulation scheme played in the deaths of several young Australian workers. That is what happens when the federal government starts trying to micromanage.


So why on earth anyone capable of learning the lessons of the past would view the abolition of the states and handing greater power to the Commonwealth as a solution is beyond me. As I said earlier, it is my strongly held view that the way forward for Australian federalism is to adhere more closely to the intention of its original design.


As a member of the Senate Select Committee into the Abbott Government's Commission of Audit, which has been conducting an inquiry into the National Commission of Audit, I have taken a keen interest in the commission's report. Understandably, given this is budget week, much of the public attention on the report has been on the budgetary recommendations contained within it. However, I think an equally important part of the commission's lasting legacy will be the series of recommendations that it has made in regard to our particular brand of federalism in Australia.


 In the lead-up to last September's federal election, the Abbott government gave a commitment to produce in its first term a white paper, looking at the future of Australian federalism in modern Australia. As the government has indicated, the recommendations contained in the report from the National Commission of Audit will feed into the preparation of that white paper.


The commission's final report contains a number of very worthy recommendations that, in my view, have enormous capacity to strengthen our Federation and start to reverse what had, over recent decades, seemed to be an inexorable and unwelcome drift towards centralism.


 As the commissioners noted in the statement issued at the time of the release of their report:


The Commission was asked to examine Commonwealth/State relations. It has made recommendations to reform the Federation and to devolve as much as possible to the States which is the level of government closest to the people.


It has also recommended the elimination of costly and ineffective duplication and a reduction in the significant administrative burden the Commonwealth imposes on the States through hundreds of COAG agreements. The States should be sovereign in their own right if Australia is to return to the Federation and Constitution which have served the country so well.


As a proud supporter of our Constitution, I was very pleased to read those last few words.


 I am very pleased that the budget that the Treasurer handed down last begins this important task of reforming the Federation. I look forward to the white paper on federalism, which I think will represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to actually put federalism to work for us in building a stronger economy and in delivering better-targeted and better-resourced services for communities. 


Yes, the Commonwealth does and will continue to play a role in funding those services but, as a Western Australian, I was especially pleased that the National Commission of Audit highlighted opportunities to do this in a more effective way.


The commission has recommended that the states have direct access to a portion of income tax generated in their economy and that this be offset by a reduction in tied grants. That will be subject to further examination by the government in its taxation and federalism review process. Also recommended was pro rata distribution of the GST, with top-ups to the states that require some extra assistance. As a Western Australian, this is an issue close to my heart. In my first speech to the Senate two years ago next month, I urged my party to rise to the challenge of dealing with this prickly political issue. I renew that urge this evening. Yes, I am mindful of the statements the coalition took to the last election—that no changes would be made before the next election—but I am also conscious of the sensitivities of other states on this issue. It is complex and arriving at a satisfactory outcome will take time, but that time must begin now.


People will be alarmed to hear that Western Australia is on a trajectory towards receiving just 11 per cent return on its population share. On current trends, by 2017-18— (Time expired)
