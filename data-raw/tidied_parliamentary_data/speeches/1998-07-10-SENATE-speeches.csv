"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-07-10,"—The Democrats oppose the preamble as follows:
(1)	 Preamble, page 1 (line 12) to page 3 (line 10).
I will explain this briefly. As we stand now at the beginning of the committee stage, I will also say that I will pursue, as briefly as possible, all the amendments that we have listed. Regardless of what some might say is the likelihood of any of them getting through, I want to make sure that I place on the record for the future my opposition, section by section, to what we are doing here tonight. I think that when we look back in five to 10 years time it will be one of the greatest acts of economic vandalism this country would have seen.
To begin with, I do not believe that the preamble can be supported because it simply is not true. Let us begin by taking the second paragraph and the allegation that government ownership inhibits flexibility. Nonsense. There has been a series of extensive studies by the World Bank, by the OECD, by Monash University and so forth, and the key message from all of them is: it makes little difference who owns the company; the key is the quality of the management, competition and, of course, regulation. I do not believe that we should put patent untruths into a preamble. Indeed, why let the totally unproven assertion that public ownership is somehow 
 second best actually be incorporated into law? It is simply a lie and should not be there.
The next paragraph is just as fallacious. Plenty of countries around the world have publicly owned telecommunications companies. In fact, one of the most efficient in the world, one of the best telcos, is publicly owned—and that is the Swiss telco. Again, this paragraph is a nonsense.
The fourth paragraph is the biggest lie of all. It says that Australia will receive a social bonus to the budget bottom line from the Telstra sale. This is absolutely and patently untrue. Within seven years the sale of the rest of Telstra will leave the budget a full $4 billion worse off than it would have been, even after taking into account the interest savings. That is certainly no social bonus in any terms that I would agree with.
Let us remember that the sale of the first third of Telstra resulted in windfall gains of $11 billion to the wealthiest 10 per cent of Australians at the expense of the other 90 per cent. The sale of the rest of it will again deliver a windfall gain for the wealthy few. I do not believe that the rest of us should be facing increased taxes to make up that $4 billion black hole.
The next paragraph reminds us that the legislation only takes effect after the next election. Why are we even considering the bill now? I think that point was made last night. Why is it only the cabinet of the day that decides what the people's mandate was? That is something that we will develop later as we come to other amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—We rise to support the Democrat amendment. I agree fully with the remarks of Senator Lees.
—Really?
—Of course we agree. To put the preamble into law—for economic assertions, and that is all they are, from some ideological bent out of a Liberal Party policy document to become the law of the land—is really absurd. Of course, if you asked any court to try to interpret those three or four clauses, if it got any challenge, any judge worth their salt would say that this has noth 
 ing to do with the actual working clauses of the bill. It is just rhetoric that a parliamentary majority carried. It is put there as a political explanation. This Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can wander around the country at any time saying, `It is in the law, it is in the bill, that all these wonderful advantages will come from the full privatisation of Telstra.'
Senator Lees correctly pointed out that the preamble mentions that they will deliver a `social bonus' of an undeclared size, but there is no mention anywhere else in the bill of the detail of that social bonus. By asserting that government ownership is in no way appropriate in the `highly competitive, global communications environment', the minister, as usual, confuses competition issues with ownership. They are separate issues.
The Labor Party has always separated those issues. That is why we supported the introduction of competition into the Australian telecommunications market in 1991-92. We believed that that would get a better outcome for Australian consumers. At the same time, we also recognised that then and for the foreseeable future Telstra would provide over 85 to 90 per cent and, in many areas of Australia, 100 per cent of the telecommunications services to ordinary Australians.
At some time or other, most of those competitive companies that may come in—other carriers, other service providers—will have to use the Telstra network to make the connection between their customers. We have always recognised that, and that will be the case for the foreseeable future.
The minister forgot to mention in his ludicrous wind-up speech, or second reading closure speech, that the evidence that was given to the Senate legislation committee of inquiry into this bill from even the great devotees of competition—those fully privatised companies like AAPT and many others—all said, `The worst thing you can do is privatise Telstra and let it loose against us. With its market dominance, it will wipe us out.' In this case, the representative of AAPT, who made it clear that his position was that 
 he generally supports privatisation, said, `Even if you fully privatise Telstra, for goodness sake, leave the power of the minister to direct in the act. We know that, with the dominance of, as the minister once described it, ""the 600 pound gorilla"", only as a last resort will we get some protection by knowing that we can go to a minister, to the parliament, and raise political and broader social and economic issues.' It is a joke to put in this preamble. I had a look at the preamble earlier on and thought, `Should we move an amendment to delete the first three pages?'
This leads me to the point of this whole committee stage. The Labor Party will be supporting many amendments—our own and other amendments of the Democrats and the Greens. The government will move some amendments on competition issues that at the moment we are agnostic about. We think they would be better dealt with as a separate bill, not tied into a privatisation bill. We take the view that, in the committee stage, our principal position is to oppose the privatisation of Telstra—full stop.
It is true, as people say—Senator Harradine said it and Senator Alston has repeated it ad nauseam—that the Labor Party privatised a number of other instrumentalities. The difference with Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank was that they did not have 90 per cent of the Australian telecommunications market. The Commonwealth Bank had, at best, 20 per cent of the market. In the case of Qantas, less than 10 per cent of Australians fly regularly and half the airline market was provided by another carrier. No-one can remember the last time Qantas paid a dividend. It was always calling for more government guarantees to buy more equipment, et cetera. The Commonwealth Bank did pay a regular dividend, although it was not a brilliant dividend compared to what Telstra has been paying. There is a world of difference, and that is the distinction the Labor Party made when it made the decision. Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were not near all-encompassing monopolies, even with competition. That is the difference.
I know others in the political debate will keep throwing it up at us and saying, `In the 
 end, you'll do the same to Telstra.' The Labor Party has never equivocated in its national platform. In our policy statements for each election we have always said: `We'll keep Telstra in full public ownership, and we'll keep Australia Post in full public ownership.' There is an important message that we want to give the people of Australia at the beginning of the committee stage, now that the second reading has been carried. After talking with our parliamentary leader, Kim Beazley, we give a commitment that if we win the next election—and I am sure the government's privatisation proposal will help us win the next election—one of the first pieces of legislation presented to the parliament in the first week of sitting of the new Beazley Labor government will be legislation to repeal this bill.
The Labor Party will make a commitment in its election campaign that, on election, in the first week of the first sitting of the first Beazley Labor government, we will repeal this legislation if it has passed through its final stages in this place. That is a statement we will not walk away from. We will go around Australia making that very clear. We look forward to putting this proposition clearly and in stark terms all over Australia—not only in the cities, of course, but in the country areas, the regional areas.
We look forward to seeing the National Party squirming, given what they outlined to us today. I have to say that I have, on many occasions, admired Senator Boswell because of the courageous speeches he has made in this place opposing mad right-wing lunatics, including infiltrators of One Nation. He has stood up in his own party against competition policy. He has stood up in his own party against a whole range of what he would call `economic rationalist statements'. But today's performance was the most pathetic performance that Senator Boswell has put in as he tried to explain how he sold out the bush for not billions of dollars, not even hundreds of millions of dollars and not even approaching $1 billion, but at best a couple of hundred dollars.
I want to go to the issue of what has so far been announced and how already it is being 
 exposed. If the National Party have bought this as a package, they have already been sold short. I will give an example. The minister yesterday announced that the new CDMA network would involve expenditure of some $400 million plus—$450 is, I think, the round figure. He said there would be $176 million for the spectrum and a further $200 million for the provision of the capital equipment to make it work. As was pointed out by Telstra today, the $176 million has already been spent. The National Party have bought a promise that they will get $176 million as part of the social bonus, but that was spent by Telstra several months ago when they bid for the spectrum. Finally, we find that Telstra has spent the grand sum of $6 million to $7 million to buy the spectrum that will be used to provide this system in rural areas. The minister said there would be $176 million to spend on the spectrum to get this network running, but it will be $6 million to $7 million. The National Party should scratch $170 million off their expected pot. They have been dudded $170 million already.
The next thing that happened is that Telstra said this is a commercial decision of theirs; they were going to do it anyway. If they were going to do it anyway, why did the National Party claim it as a victory, as part of their pressure? Senator Boswell said today he and his members rolled into parliament, met with John Howard two or three times and that one of their great victories was the new mobile phone network when Telstra put out a statement saying: `This is a commercial decision.' Apparently, they were going to do it anyway. This Liberal-National Party government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say, `This is a special deal we got for the bush with $420 million,' when Telstra is saying, `It's a commercial decision we were going to make.'
If it is not a commercial decision and it was part of the deal, it means that Telstra was lent on and, after discussions with the minister, had to make this decision. Why? Because the minister represented the two-thirds public ownership. The good old Country Party with `Black Jack' McEwen would not have fallen for this. He would have rattled the coalition 
 to the very end. Did the minister either lean on or direct Telstra or is it a totally commercial decision to establish the CDMA? It cannot be both. Either he lent on them to get this deal for the National Party or it is a straight commercial decision. I think it shows the hypocrisy of this arrangement. 
There is a first series of questions we would like to get answers to about this CDMA proposal. I think Senator Boswell said that it was one of three prongs. He mentioned this one and he mentioned the new call charges for remote areas. He said that he is not at liberty to describe the third prong at the moment because it is a secret deal with the minister after his meeting with John Howard. I notice that Senator Harradine, in response to an interjection, said he is not at liberty to divulge the full deal.
This is showing this place in contempt. A deal is being done to provide money for regional and rural telecommunications, yet this government and the National Party are not even willing to tell their own supporters what the deal is. Senator Harradine says, `There is a deal, but I cannot tell you either.' I am surprised that Senator Harradine takes that attitude, because he has always been such a stickler for Senate arrangements.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. We are dealing with an amendment moved by Senator Lees to delete the preamble. I am just wondering how Senator Schacht's remarks apply to that. I indicate to the chamber that my current view is to support the amendment.
—Senator Schacht, I am sure that you will tie your discussion and arguments into the amendment before the committee.
—I am pleased to hear that Senator Harradine is thinking of supporting the amendment. He knows that it does not mean anything either way. It does not change the thrust of the bill, which still gives the government the guts of what it wants.
As the issues raised in the preamble seem to cover everything under the sun about telecommunications, I do not think there is any problem in my speaking on some of the 
 issues that have come up. Until we get more detail of the deal, what justifies this bill being carried by this parliament, for the rest of the committee stage I am going to keep asking a whole range of questions for the sake of the people of Australia. I want to find out exactly what the government has given them and what has persuaded Senator Harradine to vote for the government's basic proposition. If we cannot get that in the parliament, what is the use of having a parliamentary debate or a committee stage? They are some of the questions I raise about the CDMA proposal. There are many more to come. During the rest of this committee stage debate, I will raise them and others. I hope the minister can provide some information.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-10,"—I rise to indicate that the Greens (WA) will be supporting the Australian Democrats' amendment No. 1 on sheet 1124 to oppose the preamble. We had a debate just a couple of days ago about truth in advertising. This is probably a really good example of legislation staying on the table for as long as it is going to last and which basically says what it purports to do, yet in reality deals with ideological claptrap.
During the second reading debate, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) said that a minister who comes into this chamber and says things that are untrue will be—I cannot remember the exact term; this is basically what he said—a goner. It seems to me that you might be able to put ideological claptrap in a bill and get away with it. However, the Senate is saying, `No. You can't and you shouldn't.' This isn't what should be happening in legislation. Quite a lot of the elements within the preamble can be proven to be patently untrue. Therefore, they ought not be in the legislation.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-07-10,"—At the outset, in commenting on this amendment and the matter before the Senate regarding the preamble, I want to go back to some of the closing remarks of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) in the second reading debate. During his speech the 
 minister accused the opposition of being engaged in some extensive delaying tactic. The supposed evidence for this was all the members of the opposition, with the exception of one, having spoken in the debate in an attempt to drag it out.
Firstly, in order to correct that, let me say that I was one who did not speak, even though I was on the list. I and a number of other opposition senators took ourselves off the list of speakers today in order to allow the process to at least be kept on track, as it were. I would dearly love to have had my 20 minutes worth in the second reading debate and been able to spend as much time as I could in the committee proceedings putting my points of view. But, in the interests of getting that second reading debate out of the way and getting into the committee stage, a number of opposition senators took themselves off the list. If I had had that opportunity, I would have said a lot of things. I want to make a couple of points, and they relate to the preamble. Firstly, I note that Senator Harradine has indicated that he is of a mind to support the preamble.
—No.
—Sorry, to support the amendment to delete the preamble. I appreciate that, but it is well known as a matter of statutory interpretation that a preamble to any law or act of parliament is really only ever an aid in the most extreme and very rare situations where some ambiguity arises within the main body of the legislation and the court has to turn to the preamble or the second reading speeches to ascertain what may have been parliament's real intention. Whether the preamble remains in or is taken out—and we clearly support it being taken out because it is largely a statement of ideological claptrap, adopting Senator Margetts's words—it clearly does not matter at the end of the day because a future conservative government, and I am confident there will not be one, could take steps to amend other important sections of the legislation as well as the preamble. If anybody thinks anything here is set in stone or is cast iron, as the minister is wont to say all the time, then they should have another think.
Let me make a couple of other points, and I want to address this comment to Senator Harradine. I know Senator Harradine has been the target, if you like, of a lot of the speeches made today. He is a well-intended target, because what the opposition is clearly putting before the chamber and endeavouring to remind Senator Harradine of—as he is in this unique position of having almost the casting vote on this matter—is those commitments he has given in the past. It appears that there is no point reminding the government of the commitments they gave in the past because they long ago gave up any semblance of wanting to adhere to any of their commitments. This was a government which promised to make all Australians relaxed and comfortable, and then scared the living daylights out of the aged community with their attempts to force people to sell their homes to get decent aged accommodation. This is the government that told workers of this country that they would be no worse off, and then brought in draconian workplace relations legislation. Even in its watered-down form as a result of the agreement with the Democrats, they still nevertheless endeavoured to use that to beat-up on the maritime workers union.
I remind Senator Harradine—although I am sure he does not need any reminding—that he supported the Labor opposition in opposing the workplace relations legislation. Senator Harradine's support for the opposition on that occasion did not help us because the Democrats had reached an agreement with the government. I remind the chamber and Senator Harradine that the government claimed a mandate for their workplace relations legislation and, on at least one theory—having won the election and achieved a majority in the House of Representatives—it could be argued that they had a mandate to bring in their workplace relations reforms. We do not believe they had the mandate to bring in the reforms they did; nevertheless, it is arguable that they had a mandate to bring them in. Notwithstanding what could clearly be said at least on that occasion was a government mandate for workplace relations reform, Senator Harradine did not vote to let the government govern on that issue. He voted with us.
However, when it came to Telstra, there was a slight change, I would suggest, in the logic to the argument. After negotiating agreements with the government—which in his view were to be to the betterment of the state of Tasmania but which in our view have not been proven and have not been carried out—Senator Harradine voted with the government to support the sale of one-third of Telstra. Again, Senator Harradine and the government argued that they had a mandate to sell one-third of Telstra because they had gone to the people before the election indicating that they supported the sale of one-third of Telstra.
I have produced some figures in this chamber before—although I do not have them with me tonight—that interestingly enough show that, in the last federal election when the issue of the sale was clearly on the table and the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats had all made it clear that they were opposed to it, those parties in the Senate actually received a majority of votes in the election. My argument is this, and I would ask Senator Harradine to consider it: this debate has already been had in this parliament.
—Let's go home.
—Yes, let's go home. Move the adjournment and let's go home, Senator Heffernan. This debate has been had because, when we debated the government's proposition to sell only one-third of Telstra and the Prime Minister gave his solemn promise that he would not seek to sell any more of Telstra, implicit in the decision of this parliament and this chamber to allow that bill to go through was the rejection of the sale of the other two-thirds of  Telstra. It is not just an argument in terms of logic or semantics even; it is quite clearly the case that the reason Senator Harradine and indeed Senator Colston supported the sale of one-third of Telstra on that occasion was that guarantee and that commitment that no more was going to be sold, certainly within the life of this parliament, and that there would be no attempt by the government to introduce any further legislation to sell off the remaining two-thirds. 
So the debate has been had. The Senate has made the decision, in giving its approval to the sale of the first one-third of Telstra. Clearly, implicit in that decision was its rejection of the further sale of any more of Telstra. I make this final point, as has been argued and put by my colleagues throughout this debate: why the sudden urgency for this legislation? Why didn't the minister and the Prime Minister announce after the float of the first one-third of Telstra, which they said was so successful when all the mums and dads in Australia went out and bought Telstra shares, `We think this has been such a tremendous success. We're going to sell the rest of the two-thirds'? Why didn't they say it then?
What has happened is they have got down to the 11th hour, they know they are in trouble electorally and they are trying to push this bill through this parliament now because they know that, whether they win or lose the next election—and it is becoming increasingly obvious that they will not win it—the composition of this Senate will change in June next year and there will be more senators in this chamber who are opposed to the sale of Telstra than there appear to be now.
The government knows that, if it can get the vote of Senator Colston, the vote that rightly belongs to the Labor Party and rightly should be a vote against the sale of Telstra, and if it can get Senator Harradine's support, it can get this bill through now. But, if it were to leave this legislation, if it were to allow the people to have their say at the next election, it knows that the composition of this chamber will change and it will not get that legislation through the new Senate because a number of government senators who currently sit in this chamber will not be back here. There will be more of us, and I am sure we will be sitting over there.
That is the reason for this haste. The government is, firstly, relying upon the vote that rightly belongs to the Labor Party and, secondly, relying upon the vote of Senator Harradine. I would just ask Senator Harradine to think of that. Whilst this parliament has dealt with the issue of the sale of the first one-third of Telstra—and there is certainly, as I said, an argument that can be advanced that 
 the government had a right to bring that matter before the parliament to be debated—the government has no right to put this issue of the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra before this parliament. It should put it to the people first and then let the next parliament decide.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-10,"—I would not normally respond to that type of tedious repetition of falsehood. I do not normally say that, but it is a tedious repetition of falsehood. I am surprised that Senator Forshaw should so engage in that falsehood in relation to my state of Tasmania.
In respect of my comment about the government being elected to govern, it is the right of this chamber to examine matters on their merit, not to use the occasion to filibuster and not to talk about the amendment that it is talking about now. It is the government's right to put before us legislation. It is our right, of course, to amend it as we so desire, and I happen to be desiring to amend this preamble by deleting it.
Be that as it may, I wanted to make a point on the workplace relations legislation. Yes, they said they had a mandate for that but, because of my long years of experience in the trade union movement, I could see that the provisions of that legislation were inadequate to deal with the situation that the government desired to deal with. I voted accordingly, and I will do so on any similar occasion when that judgment is made, but the judgment has to be made at the particular stage.
On this matter, if this legislation goes through this parliament, it will not be proclaimed until after the next election. If you say that you are going to be over on the government benches, it will not be proclaimed. I think the government is very brave—I do not know whether it is wise—to say, `This is the way we are going to go. We're not going to proclaim it until after the election.' Therefore, it will become an election issue.
Those who feel so strongly about the matter know what they can do. One of the reasons why I am not supporting the preamble—I am supporting Senator Lees's motion to delete the preamble—is that it appears to me that 
 some of the paragraphs are not what I consider to be, I will not say factual—
—You should, because they are not.
—Senator Murphy, I suggest you listen.
—I am listening, Brian. Don't worry.
—It says on page 2:
The sale of the Commonwealth's remaining two-thirds equity interest in Telstra will benefit the Australian community with the majority of the proceeds of the sale applied to the retirement of government debt and the opportunity to use a portion of the proceeds to deliver a social bonus.
I have a feeling that that may well tie the government into a sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, whereas this bill does not say that the government has to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra. All this bill does is enable the government of the day to sell more of Telstra. It may choose to sell another tranche of Telstra, up to 49 per cent. In fact, you might want to do that. I do not know. The legislation is an enabling piece of legislation for a future government—after it has gone through an election with this issue well and truly on the agenda for consideration—to sell another tranche or the remaining two-thirds.
I know what is being said and understood all round that the preamble would only be used in exceptional circumstances as an aid to the interpretation of the law where the words are uncertain. It does say at the end of the preamble:
The above considerations are taken into account by the Parliament in enacting the law that follows.
As far as I am concerned, I am not taking into account that particular question if it says, `the sale of the remaining two-thirds equity in Telstra'. Incidentally, I might mention to the committee that I do have an amendment of my own in respect of the proclamation provisions. At the present moment, as has been adverted to by Senator Margetts, Senator Lees and the advice by the Clerk Assistant (Procedure), this is a fault in the bill. It leaves open-ended when this legislation will be proclaimed in the next parliament.
I am proposing that unless it is proclaimed within the two months of the new parliament then it is repealed. So, Senator Schacht, if you are in government you will not have to repeal it. That is the whole point of my amendment. If you had to repeal it, you might run into a difficult Senate or you may not. I am assisting you in that regard. I foreshadow that I will move an amendment which will ensure that if it is not proclaimed within two months of the new parliament then it is repealed. With those thoughts and statements, I indicate that I will be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Lees to delete the preamble.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-10,"—The minister talked about the reason why this legislation was necessary and why it had to go through now. During the minister's contribution in the second reading debate, I recall hearing him say that the reason the Senate had to pass this legislation was to fulfil the government's election promise. The minister did say that ministers have to be careful that anything they say in this place is the truth. Which election promise was this? When was it made? Why does the Senate have to fulfil that promise?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—I acknowledge Senator Harradine's contribution. I particularly acknowledge and understand his comments in relation to the second paragraph on page 2 of the bill, which in some ways may be limiting rather than enabling and in that sense may well have a constricting effect when taken in conjunction with the words towards the top of page 3. On that basis I will not be opposing Senator Lees's amendment to oppose the preamble.
I will just make a few comments that are pertinent in the contributions made so far. The first point in relation to Senator Lees is that, unless I heard her incorrectly—and I must say I could not believe my ears—she quoted three particular surveys—one of them I think was a Monash University study. She said that their conclusion was that who owns it makes little difference; it depends on the quality of management. Game, set and match. Some people are prepared to die in a ditch over who owns 
 Telstra and your first contribution is to say that who owns it makes little difference. I agree entirely, and I am delighted that Senator Schacht also said that he agreed fully with the remarks of Senator Lees.
—He didn't talk about public interest. You are twisting it.
—Who owns it makes little difference. They were the words you quoted. If you meant to say something else perhaps you can elaborate. I am simply relying on the words that you put on the table at the start of this debate.
Senator Schacht gave a phoney commitment about repealing the bill in the first week of sitting. Given the Labor Party's track record, one could not possibly accept even that at face value. Even if they did, what would possibly preclude them from coming back five minutes later with another bill to simply sell down a part of or retain one per cent in public ownership. It is preposterous nonsense.
As we know, only a couple of weeks ago Senator Schacht put out a press release saying that he was in favour of retaining Telstra in majority public ownership. Senator Robert Ray actually squashed that very proposition—he has squashed a few things in his time, I know. He was at great pains to rebuke Mr Gareth Evans, the current shadow Treasurer, when he tried to float the proposition that they could sell down another 16 per cent. All this business of phoney defence of keeping it in two-thirds public ownership has to be regarded as one of the most flexible and open-ended commitments in history.
I also thought it was very significant that Senator Schacht distinguished the Labor Party's approach on Telstra from its approach on other government business enterprises. The point of distinction was that they were not situations in which the government held a substantial majority or a dominant position. That is telling you that he does not really object to private ownership or to privatisation at all; he is simply saying that, whilst you have a dominant government position in terms of the market share, then he is in favour of public ownership. Quite clearly, that means that, if Telstra loses market share, then his objection would fall to the ground and he 
 would then, presumably, no longer oppose the privatisation of the telecommunications carrier because it was just another player on the marketplace.
Again, I thought it was a very significant concession on the part of Senator Schacht, who I presume knows not what he says when he tries to make that distinction. Senator Schacht, I will repeat it for your benefit. In the one breath you say you are opposed to privatising Telstra. You say the difference between Telstra, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank is that Telstra has a much greater market share.
—Absolutely.
—But what follows from that and what you do not even seem to appreciate is that, if Telstra lost a significant proportion of its market share, your objection would, therefore, disappear because that is the only defence you offer as to why you in government were prepared to privatise Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank—because they did not have a dominant position in the marketplace. It follows from that that, if Telstra does not have a dominant position in the marketplace, you would have no policy objection.
Senator Forshaw's contribution to the effect that we should be grateful that he did not speak in the second reading debate and then went on to speak for longer in the committee stage than some other people spent in the second reading debate is hardly a basis for us being very grateful. To the extent that I acknowledge there may well have been some whose names were on the list and who did not speak in the second reading debate, I accept your correction if that is the case.
—But you still put the boot in, didn't you?
—All I am saying is you made up for it by getting up and rambling on on the preamble. You did not need to speak; you know Senator Harradine's attitude. I respond to Senator Margetts's question by saying that, in the last election campaign, we made it very clear that we would not proceed to sell any further portion of Telstra without seeking a mandate. That is what this legisla 
 tion does, particularly with the proclamation date. It ensures that we cannot sell it without having sought a mandate at the next election. That we will do and, having gained it, that we will do again.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I want to go to the preamble of the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 . I am pleased Senator Harradine is going to support Senator Lees in opposing the preamble to this bill because we should not have a preamble such as this to any legislation because it is, in the main, totally misleading. But more important is the question of the government's mandate to do any of this.
Unfortunately, Senator Harradine has left the chamber because I would have liked him to comment on a statement he made during the debate which led to the one-third sale of Telstra. He made a number of comments, but I want to point out two in particular. One comment relates to governments achieving mandates. We know what every single member of the government who spoke in that debate said with regard to the one-third sale and any further sale. Not one of them said that they would seek to do anything other than achieve a one-third sale before going back to the people.
We have legislation here now. Senator Harradine gives an indication in the first instance that, while he was not too sure about supporting the full privatisation, he is on the public record as saying that. Just now he has said that this is enabling legislation so it does not mean that the final two-thirds of Telstra will be sold; it could mean something different. But we know full well what this government means and we know full well why this government has brought this legislation—and I find, unfortunately, with the support of Senator Harradine—with a view to getting it through the parliament now. The government is very afraid that if, after an election, it does not have the numbers in this place—and that is quite likely—it would have no hope of getting this legislation through the Senate. That is the real reason why we have this legislation here now. The government is afraid that it will not be able to achieve it.
Senator Harradine says, `My amendment goes to proclamation and it has to be proclaimed within two months.' But that has nothing to do with this Senate. If this legislation passes, it is not a question of us coming back after another election in this chamber, the states house, as I have heard Senator Harradine put it so many times, and arguing the case and defeating something that Senator Harradine seemed to have held dear to his heart back in December 1996, when he said:
. . . the Senate should apply certain principles which if those principles and values conflict with the government's legislation in discharge of its mandate—
and that is even with a mandate—
then those principles should prevail. On this particular matter I would have voted very strenuously against the total sale of Telstra.
I understood that to have a very clear meaning; now I am not so sure. I ask Senator Harradine if he might explain to me what he meant back then versus the position he is currently adopting, understanding that he has said that this is enabling legislation, understanding that he has said it does not necessarily mean that there will be full privatisation of Telstra, and understanding that he also said back then that he was opposed to the total sale.
You have to wonder about this preamble. It makes all sorts of commitments about universal service obligations and continued access to untimed local calls, and it refers to various other pieces of legislation—one of which is the Telecommunications Act 1997. I would like to hear from the minister how they intended in the longer term to apply the Telecommunications Act 1997 with regard to commitments such as those mentioned when there is a fully privatised Telstra. That is why this preamble should be removed.
I ask Senator Harradine, through you, Madam Chair: on what basis are we supporting this legislation? If, as the government said, they would not do anything prior to this point without a further mandate from the Australian public, why should they not go back to the Australian public and seek that mandate?
—We are.
—The minister says that they are. Yes, they are, after they have passed legislation. If they happen to be lucky enough to come back after the next election and still be in government, and I do not think they will, all they have to do is get the Prime Minister to ring up the Governor-General and say, `Proclaim the bill.'
Senator Harradine's amendment has no relevance in all of this, except to say to me that he is going to support the legislation. I will be very interested to hear, and I will listen very intently to what he says during the debate, what his reasons are. Will the reasons be that we are going to get some big deal, like we were supposed to get before? There were headlines in the local newspapers such as `$160m windfall—Harradine sells Telstra vote for a higher price'. That was the biggest dud in history.
All I can say to the minister, through you, Madam Chairman, is this: you did a great job in conning somebody to get a vote that delivered absolutely zip to my home state. Thus far you have hoodwinked the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, with a phoney phone and, of course, you did the pea and thimble trick on poor old Senator Boswell. You ran the old thimbles around that many times that he did not have a clue which one the pea was under. He just bought it as it was. There he was tonight saying that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister had got to know each other. These blokes have been in parliament, in coalition, for years and, all of a sudden, they get to know one another! What a joke. It is no wonder the bush is upset with the National Party right now. It is no wonder it is going to desert them in droves at the next election.
It is important that we remove this preamble. In fact, I think it is important to remove the lot. Nevertheless, we might get there at the end of the day. I urge senators to support that. Even the minister could not bring himself to argue in support of this preamble, and it is no wonder why. You only have to look through it to see what a load of nonsense it is. It has been denigrated by many reports. The minister said that even a one-third sale of Telstra would deliver all sorts of 
 benefits, that it would bring telecommunications up to speed, with the injection of private funding, et cetera, and this would make Telstra a more commercial organisation. All the reports have said that that did not happen. That is why we should support the Democrat amendment. I urge senators to do so.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-10,"—Senator Murphy obviously has not heard anything that I have said. He was right in suggesting that Tasmania did not get $163 million, I think he said—
—No, it was 160 in that headline.
—It was 160, was it? Tasmania actually received $183 million, so you are wrong.
—No, I'm right in so far as we got zip.
—From here on out, no-one should regard anything that Senator Murphy says as being credible. It was $183 million—not $160 million—plus other things. That was quite legitimate. If Senator Murphy wants to open his mouth and make false statements before this chamber—
—I read out what you said in this chamber.
—Oh, you are getting to those remarks that I made about the selling of the whole of Telstra. Yes, I made those remarks. If you look carefully at them, you will find that I made them quite deliberately. What I said then is not inconsistent with what I might do now. I might, in the end, vote against the third reading but, then again, I might not. In either case what I do now is not in conflict with what I said then. That was said at the time in respect of the issue then before us. What I said was deliberately couched regarding the principles which should govern this chamber.
Furthermore, I elaborated in a press release on the principle that if Telstra is a natural monopoly then the whole of it should not be sold. So put it into context properly and you will know. But I do not know what we are arguing about, because I have said—
—About an hour ago now.
—About an hour ago—that I am opposing the preamble. I am supporting Senator Lees's amendment to delete the preamble. I do not know whether you heard that, Senator Faulkner, but I think there is now a unanimous view that the preamble should be deleted. That is a good start, I would have thought. ",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-10,"—Senator Harradine invites me to comment on this issue. I heard the comments he made. I also heard him say that he may or may not vote for the third reading. I found those comments quite extraordinary. We have had the spectacle all over television bulletins today, all over the media, that Senator Harradine is minded to support the government on this particular issue. As far as I am concerned, from all the evidence I have seen, I believe the deal is done.
Senator Harradine invites me to comment, but that is the only reasonable conclusion I can come to. I happen to believe that the deal has been done. But I take a different view from Senator Harradine not only on the substance of the issue before the chair, not only on the importance of Telstra remaining in public ownership, but also on the key issue of Senator Harradine coming clean about what arrangements might have been made behind closed doors. I think we in this chamber have an entitlement to know what has been said between the government and Senator Harradine.
Earlier on today during the second reading debate I can recall that, after I made some comments about Senator Colston, we had Senator Ian Macdonald take a point of order and suggest that these were most unfair comments because, apparently due to ill health, Senator Colston had left the building. I took those comments from Senator Macdonald at face value.
—That was foolhardy.
—It probably was foolhardy, Senator Carr, because it was not long ago on the 7.30 Report  that we had the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), even though in a very tangled use of the English language, trying to get the point 
 across, in relation to questions asked about Senator Colston, that Senator Colston had gone to Brisbane to have a meeting with the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard) and to do a deal about Telstra. That was what was said by Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister.
—That's not right.
—That is what he said.
—That is what he said. I do not know who is right. Is Tim Fischer right, is Senator Macdonald right or is Senator Alston right? The point is they are not coming clean. There have been sleazy deals, sleazy arrangements, come to, in my view, behind closed doors. Frankly, I think the chamber has an entitlement to know what those arrangements and understandings are.
This would be an appropriate stage of the debate on this bill for Senator Harradine to come clean. It would also be an appropriate stage for Senator Colston to take the unusual step for him of coming in the chamber and have the intestinal fortitude for once in a blue Tuesday and actually make a contribution on the floor. Senator Colston is not well known for having a capacity to stand in his place in this Senate chamber and actually say anything in defence of his actions—
—Except get his TA.
—That might be true, Senator Schacht. That aspect might well be true. But I think the chamber has an entitlement to have those sorts of matters explained to it in more detail.
I simply do not believe Senator Harradine when he says he has not made up his mind on the third reading. Other senators might, but I have come to the conclusion that that is not right. Surely all the evidence that we have seen both in the public arena and in this building can only lead senators to a conclusion that Senator Harradine has made up his mind. We are going through a debate that is a facade. We had Senator Harradine last night coming into this chamber and, for the first time in living memory—perhaps for the first time in his parliamentary career—voting for a gag motion.
—He voted for a motion you moved last year.
—Not once, not twice but thrice.
—A procedural gag.
—I did not move any gag motions last year. I can assure Senator Campbell of that. Sadly, I did not have a capacity to move such a motion last year. Even though you were not manager—maybe Senator Kemp had been sacked as Manager of Government Business by then, I do not know—I certainly was not. Unfortunately, the Labor Party by that stage had lost the election.
—You moved a gag on 27 August; you goddamned liar.
—Order!
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—What I have to say, Madam Chairman, in relation to that interjection from Senator Campbell is that the Labor Party always allowed debate on procedural motions. The Labor Party never once gagged such a motion and did not give senators from either side of the chamber—minor party, Independent senators, opposition or government senators—an opportunity to put a case. That is what Senator Harradine did last night. On three occasions he did not give anyone a capacity to put a case on, of all things, a procedural motion. I do not believe there is any precedent for that. I do not believe we have seen that sort of behaviour previously from Senator Harradine. So when he comes into the chamber—
—On 27 August 1997.
—When he comes into the chamber and says to us—
—You bald faced liar.
—Excuse me, Senator Faulkner. Senator Campbell, I have tried to ignore your bad behaviour, but three times you have used unparliamentary language. If you would care to withdraw it unconditionally now please.
—I withdraw `bad behaviour'.
—Please, Senator Campbell, would you stand and unconditionally withdraw your unparliamentary language.
—Madam Chairman, this man opposite is the only man in politics in Australia who can look you in the face—
—Senator Campbell! Order!
—and lie directly at you and—
—Order! Senator Campbell!
—not even blink. On 27 August—
—Senator Campbell—
—the opposition moved a gag motion that Senator Harradine voted for. I withdraw the word `liar'.
—Senator Campbell, next time I ask you to come to order and to withdraw something, will you do so immediately and unconditionally. This sort of behaviour is not conducive to good behaviour in the chamber.
—Spoilt brat.
—I would expect the Manager of Government Business to set an example.
—You should expect that from the Leader of the Opposition as well.
—Order, Senator! I expect it from both of you. The minister and the shadow minister will stop interjecting as well. As the Manager of Government Business, I would expect you to set an example—not challenging my ruling and disregarding my call. In future when I call you to order, you will come to order speedily.
—Thank you, Madam Chair. I move:
That the committee report progress.
Question put.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—In my earlier contribution on the amendment to the preamble, I did take the opportunity to ask a number of questions about the government's policy on the introduction of the CDMA, being part of the so- 
 called deal to get the National Party to vote for your bill. In particular, I asked questions of the minister about the spectrum that already has been purchased by Telstra. It was not purchased specifically to buy off the Country Party. In fact, according to one account today, only $6 million of the spectrum's $176 million will have to be used for this new CDMA network in the country. So you have diddled the Country Party. Congratulations on that. More woe to them and to Senator Boswell that they have already done $170 million out of the $426 million—
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. I do not know whether it is through stupidity or ignorance, but either way it is out of order for Senator Schacht to continually refer to the National Party as the Country Party.
—Madam Chair, on the point of order: Senator Schacht can refer to the National Party any way he likes. In fact, I think it is a most temperate use of the English language to call them the Country Party, given the other descriptions I have heard used by people who live in rural and regional Australia.
—There is no point of order.
—I apologise if the minister's sensibilities were upset. Of course I should say the National Party, because, as I said earlier, if it was the old-style Black Jack McEwen Country Party they would not have bought this deal at all. They would have brought the coalition down first to protect the interests of their voters out in the bush. Can you imagine Artie Fadden, can you imagine Dr Page—
—I prefer not to.
—No, but on this issue they would have told even Bob Menzies to go jump. No, not the National Party this day—it is just another sub-branch of the Liberal Party completely sold out on this issue. We have found the first loophole, the first loss. In 24 hours the National Party has lost $170 million of the package. Not a bad effort in 24 hours, you would have thought. How much more is going to unravel as we get more detail? I ask 
 the minister to confirm that about the spectrum allocation. I ask the minister to confirm that Telstra were apparently going to do this anyway as a commercial proposition without having it counted as a deal for the Country Party. If that is the case, the Country Party has lost one of the prongs already.
My next technical question, Minister, relates to the CDMA telephone receivers. You said in the press conference yesterday that you thought they would be about $350 a piece. Do you have any prices from overseas? I understand that in Japan and America, where there is CDMA, the price of the hand-held receiver, of which Mr Fischer seems to have the only one in Australia at the moment—
—The line fell out.
—He could not even get it to work talking to John Laws today. It fell out. I understand that they are in fact double that price, maybe $600, $700 or $800. There is some suggestion they may even be over $1,000. I know that when a bigger market grows they may actually come down somewhat in price, but is it not true that the price is more at the moment than the $350 that you suggested? Is it also not true that, despite all your presentation yesterday in that bizarre press conference where two-minute Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, did it all and got you to hold the phone up with him—
—Hold his bag for him.
—Hold up the bag, hold up the diagram, pose whenever the Deputy Prime Minister said, `Oh, Richard, come and join me. Say this, do that.' It was like the Punch and Judy show of old, except this was the punch bag for the Deputy Prime Minister. It is extraordinary that this minister has not only been made the doormat by the Prime Minister over ABC policy and over media cross-ownership law, but he has even been made the doormat for the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. We now have all these announcements of these deals not being made by the minister for communications but being made by Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister. The joint press conference is a special that will last in the memory of all of us for a long, long time.
Then we find today that Tim Fischer is up in Queensland and trying to be on the radio with John Laws. He is doing all the announcement on radio, apparently, about the new deal for the reduced cost for remote telephone calls in outback Australia. Where is the minister for communications in all of this? He has been told to stand aside—`Tim Fischer is the one that can explain this to the people of Australia. Richard Alston can't.' We suspect that in some ways that is probably right. He has got such diminished credibility and so many broken promises, why would you believe him?
But we do like to actually get some answers here in the Senate, Minister. I would like to get answers to a couple of those questions about CDMA. Another one I would like to ask is this: in the new competitive environment that is developing, will there be full number portability between a CDMA receiver and Optus's GSM? Will they be able to have full number portability from one receiver to their new receiver with the GSM? That is a pretty important question in the competitive market. If it is not portable, this may be good for Telstra, and it may be why they have decided to do this anyway as a commercial deal. They are establishing a new sort of monopoly in rural Australia in being the only one to be able to operate a CDM network because the others will not move into it.
—You mean CDMA, do you?
—CDMA—you finally got something right. This announcement today on local call charges for pastoral areas also said there were something like 60,000-odd families—
—Thirty-seven thousand.
—Yes, 37,000 families would be eligible to get this new benefit, and at the top of the press release it said they would all get untimed calls within that zone. But, if you read on further down, it said that many of them, when they telephone their nearest community centre to get essential services, would still have to pay for a timed call—at a new rate that is somewhat cheaper, but they are still going to have to pay for a timed call.
Mr Fischer said in his announcement that this would be worth $150 million. I want to ask: is the $150 million provided out of the social bonus for the one-off capital works to establish the arrangement for this to operate? And, when the new cheaper call rate comes in—even though some of it will still be timed—will that be a loss that Telstra has to bear, will you put it in the CSO or will you make a grant out of the budget each year to pay for this loss to Telstra for having the cost of those charges reduced?
I have one final point to raise in these two areas. Even though we have got very vague information, I find it astonishing that so far there do not seem to be any amendments to this bill—for example, on these new community charge rates. There is nothing here.
—Why not?
—Why not? Where are the National Party? Why aren't they moving an amendment—
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—It is astonishing.
—They've missed another one.
—They have missed another one. You would have thought these brave gentlemen—these tough negotiators for the bush—would have said, `Okay, the money's not bad,' even if they fell for that, `but we will insist that we put in the bill that this will be the new rate so that when we vote for it we can go back to regional Australia and say, ""We've delivered. It is in the legislation.""' No.
—Missed opportunity.
—It is a big opportunity missed. What  the heck is going on with the National Party? We know the Deputy Prime Minister wants to join the Liberal Party. He is actually a sub-branch of the Liberal Party. As I said before, Senator Boswell has made a presentation here over the last few years of being a bit different—trying to be the last old style Country Party representative for bush people.
—Only when it suits him.
—Only when it suits him, and now he has fallen over. He has rolled over, and he missed an enormous opportunity, apparently.
—It suits him now, but he doesn't know it.
—I do not think he realised that he could have insisted that the amendment to guarantee these new rates be put in the legislation by amendment tonight. And he didn't.
—And he could have moved it.
—He could have moved it. He could have had flags flying.
—We could have got an amendment done in big print.
—Yes, and even bigger print circulated out. And, even though it would not have gone out on the Internet—because he has given that away—he could have got it out on ABC radio, where it still operates before this minister's cuts destroy the program. He would have been able to claim a victory, but he missed it.
This is a further spectacular example of why, unfortunately, One Nation is growing so popular in the bush on the backs of disappointed, disaffected, frustrated National Party voters. They suddenly realised that the National Party have sold them out. They cannot even get the technicality right of how to put it in a bill to protect their interests. This is astonishing.
I grew up in a Country Party seat of Gippsland in the 1950s—the days of Black Jack McEwen. Goodness me, he would be turning over in his grave to see how far the party he helped create have fallen over, rolled over and become irrelevant to the people they represent. I say to the National Party: you have one last chance, on the third reading.
—They'll vote against it.
—I will be marginally generous. There is still the third reading. But I suspect the horse has bolted on them, because they do not have the wit even now to find out how to draft the amendment to put what they have negotiated in this bill. So they 
 are going to sit here tonight and tomorrow and keep voting. They will vote on the third reading, they will vote for this package and they will vote with the Libs.
After the bill goes through, I—the shadow minister for communications—am going to enjoy myself in the bush, going around saying in those rural areas, `Whatever you may think about the Labor Party, we ain't done. We know how to negotiate a deal and we know how to put it in a bill to protect the people we look after; unlike the National Party who, through sheer stupidity, let it all slip.' What do they get in substitution for a good bit of committed work to get the deal done and written in legislation? They think because Tim Fischer can run around holding up a mobile phone—
—Which doesn't work.
—Stumble around.
—which doesn't work, and stumble around and issue diagrams, that this is the basis of a deal. We know that this is the demise of the National Party, and I am amazed to see it in my lifetime. As one who grew up in the bush in Victoria in a National Party—then called the Country Party—stronghold and as a Labor supporter who put up with all the stuff we got from the National Party about how they were the only ones looking after the bush, I am going to enjoy the next couple of months. I will be going around rubbing it in that the National Party have sold the bush out. And here is a demonstration of it. There is no amendment to write into this legislation what Senator Boswell told us was a great deal, with three prongs. There ain't no prongs in this bill, Ron. There are none at all. You have missed the game. You have sold your people out—
—Senator Schacht, could you please address colleagues in their correct term.
—I was using a term of endearment for Senator Boswell.
—I would prefer you to address him properly.
—I appreciate that. I will refer to him as Senator Boswell. I put a 
 number of those questions to the minister. I also put the question to Senator Boswell: how did he miss the biggest opportunity he ever had to guarantee something if this deal is so good? In his speech tonight, Senator Boswell said there were two prongs in the deal. He said he could not tell us about the third prong. Senator Harradine has said the same.
—We know what the third prong is.
—I suspect, as Senator Faulkner has said, we know what the third prong is—it is straight through the middle of his heart. He's gone. He's on the old hayfork, pitched right up in the air. Back in the old days in Gippsland we used to fork hay up onto the back of a trailer. You'll have two pitchforks in the backside, Ron, and you'll be up on the top of the trailer. That is where you are going with the National Party—a pitchfork in the back, hogged over the side and you are gone.
—Senator Schacht, could you please refer to Senator Boswell by his correct title.
—Senator Boswell will be pitchforked out of this because he has made a classic blue. I want to know how the minister is going to guarantee these arrangements in legislation.
—He's not.
—It is not in legislation—it is a promise. It does not mean anything. When are we going to get the legislation to guarantee the reduced call rates for these people? (Time expired) .",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I am going to intervene in this debate in the committee stage only once. First of all, I did hear Senator Harradine ask why we were discussing the preamble when he had committed to vote with us. As though that is the be-all and end-all. Thank you, Senator Harradine, we will not have anything more to say; we appreciate your support of Senator Lees's amendment. We will just decamp. Senator Alston, I thought, also gave some indication of impatience on this matter. After contentious legislation is carried at the second reading there will always be a small blow-out 
 on the preamble and the first clause, then the committee as a whole will settle down to solid work considering what will mostly be government amendments but amendments coming from others also and it will proceed in an orderly and structured fashion. But the committee stage provides us with our one opportunity to at least ask for further information. And that really is in three broad areas.
With regard to the first area, we have had the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Timothy Fischer, proceeding around the country throwing money off the back of a truck as fast as he can. We are having difficulty keeping up with the promises he is making. We all saw him this morning ring John Laws and tell  him what a wonderful reception it was. That is the last we ever heard of him. The line dropped out and we heard nothing more. So we do not know precisely what the government's intention is in regard to providing services in the rural areas.
We know the other side of the coin. We know that it was an unequal negotiation field. We know that the slippery characters in the Liberal Party will always outdo their country cousins. I am a city boy; I can remember the good old days when two of my country cousins came down from Brewarrina. We fed them chocolates. The packet was actually labelled `Laxettes' but they thought they were chocolates. They just ate them up. And this is exactly the same. It is precisely the same thing.
On one level we have knowledge that a deal has been done, that offers have been made, with no precision and with no negotiating skills from those who are supposed to receive the offer. It would be nice if the minister would at least try to outline at some stage this evening precisely what is on offer in terms of recompense to rural areas of Australia to overcome their fears of the full privatisation of Telstra. The minister would at least acknowledge that there is some uneasiness out there about this particular policy. I want to know what the package is.
With regard to the second area, have there been any special arrangements made for particular states? When this tends to happen my state is the one that tends to get dealt out 
 because it is regarded as a safe area for the coalition. They have only one National Party senator, who does not amount to anything—absolutely nothing, as you can see from his contribution today; he threw his speech away and sat down with four minutes to go. We do not know state by state whether there are going to be winners and losers. Some people would say, `If you come from a small state and you have a pivotal vote and you want to leverage money into your state, fair enough.' I do not say `fair enough'. That is not good governance. It is not good governance if 10 or 20 or 100 Telstra workers in my state get the bullet for no reason other than political expediency, simply to bring over a crucial vote in another state. That is not what we are about. This may be a states House, but we are all Australians and we should all be treated as equally as possible.
The last area I raised earlier today. I raised the question: why was it that the vote in this Senate will be  determined by a corrupted vote, by someone who had been lured from our side of politics? I indicated, with some complaint and some justification, I thought, that I thought it was a bit red hot that he would come into the chamber last night and three times vote for a gag and make us sit to 12 o'clock tonight and tomorrow night, then jump on the plane and go back to Queensland.
But the coalition had an answer for us on that so we did not press it—`Oh, look, he had a longstanding medical appointment in Queensland.' We all understand that. It would have been nice if we could have debated the motion last night so that anyone on this side of the chamber—and right around it—who may have had urgent medical appointments could have at least put the argument. But we were not given that particular scope. I actually believed the situation. I thought, `That's fair enough.' Despite my particular concerns about this particular senator, no-one would begrudge the fact that he had to return to Queensland for some sort of medical consultation. None of us, in fact, would have objected to that. But what do we find tonight on the 7.30 Report? Oh, no, Senator Colston is having discussions with the Prime Minister.
—About what?
—About what? And what was delivered? That is what we want to know before we continue to consider this particular piece of legislation. Through his normal source, the person he normally drip-feeds in the media, we learnt three things about his demands. We even saw—although we could not read it in full—what was purported to be a letter from Senator Colston to Mr Howard. The camera went on to about the first three paragraphs. I must say I did not bother on this occasion to freeze-frame it, blow it up and find out what it was about. But in the newspaper article written by a journalist very sympathetic to Senator Colston, he had three big demands. First, why wasn't he being consulted and why had no-one talked to him? That has obviously been solved today as he has flown to Queensland and seen the Prime Minister.
His second great complaint was that the government would not accept his vote, and he was still angry about that. His third complaint, apparently, was that he could not put a long list of smears, vicious innuendo and outright lies into this particular chamber. One wonders: if he put those propositions to the Prime Minister, what was the Prime Minister's reaction? Clearly, his reaction is that he has met one of the demands. That is, Senator Colston has met the Prime Minister.
But I do not think you could imagine that the Prime Minister of this country would have countenanced Senator Colston's other two demands. After all, it was the Prime Minister, having defended Colston all the way through until 8 April 1997, who called the Federal Police in and it was just eight days later that the same Prime Minister, against the opposition of certain senators in this place, said they would no longer count his vote. So I cannot imagine that the Prime Minister, having done that, would backslide on that at all. I would never accuse him of it. I would certainly never ever contemplate the Prime Minister of this country acceding to Senator Colston's demands to put those forms of slanders, innuendoes and intended attacks to pervert his own court case so that he could get off 
 without going to trial. No Prime Minister of Australia would do that.
However, after the Prime Minister having met him and having known that those were the demands, we are at least entitled to have some response to say—and I am sure it could be found in the next hour or so—that the Prime Minister of Australia rejected out of hand those two demands. Then all that remains to be said is this: were arrangements made—legitimate arrangements, even though we might not like them—so that special deals were cut with Senator Colston to get his support for this particular bill? Did that occur? If it did occur, what is the nature of them and has the minister been informed? He may not have been informed of those particular arrangements.
When it comes to considering this particular committee stage of the bill, we are entitled to see some of the detail of the arrangements that are not contained within the bill—if you like, the offshore deals that have been made which will reflect back into the consideration of this bill. We really want to know what are the detailed arrangements that have been made with the National Party so we can assess whether they were sold a pup and whether there should be further amendments in the committee stage to reinforce those agreements. We need to know whether there have been any special deals made for any states and whether, when you run the ruler over it, that is fair amongst all of the states of Australia and it is not just a political ploy to drag over votes.
The final thing we need to do is understand what the nature of the discussion was, in terms of the way it affects this bill—and only that part of the discussion between Senator Colston and the Prime Minister of Australia. If those questions can be somewhat answered, I am sure we can proceed to the more detailed consideration of the bill. But I do reiterate, in spite of what Senator Harradine and Senator Alston have said about the initial stages of the bill, that it is to be expected that there will be a few bombastic speeches and others made immediately after the second reading.
—Steady on!
—I exclude your noble speech earlier in the piece, Senator Faulkner—and, if you believe that, you would believe anything. It is not unusual, following a second reading, to have a lot of general speeches, but I am sure it is not too far away before we will be able to get to the detailed consideration of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-10,"—Madam Temporary Chairman, it has taken me a little while to get the call. After I asked the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts what particular promise we were being required to fulfil, I finally wrote down what I think he was saying. That is: the Senate has to pass this legislation now to fulfil the coalition's promise at the last election that they would not sell Telstra during this term of government.
What is more, the government is going to require hundreds of thousands of dollars because, even despite the fact that we were coming back for the anti-Wik legislation, there is still the extra staffing and overtime—of course, you are looking at 7½ hours of overtime today and tomorrow—and getting the House of Representatives back. Minister, that is nearly a million dollars for us to allow you to break your election promise. I have never gone along with the idea of mandate but I think this is the craziest, crankiest idea of mandate that I have ever heard in this particular chamber.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I, too, have some quite broad questions I would like to put to the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts. They go to the government's direction in ensuring that Telstra is not able to, in fact, thwart the stated purpose of the government to enhance competition in the telecommunications area.
Minister, I would like to draw your attention to the experience in the United States, following deregulation, where the consumer benefits allegedly arising from competition policy were delayed by several years because many of the incumbent carriers chose to initiate legal activities and legal action against new entrants for fear that they were encroach 
 ing on their markets in a way that they did not think was fair.
Minister, I ask you for a description on the management of that transition, particularly in the context of Telstra's apparent willingness to take on the rulings and guidance of the ACCC in these matters. We have seen already Telstra vehemently try to hold on to the market advantage it has in Internet service provision. I think there is still a structural issue with respect to Telstra having the advantage of being the provider of most of the wholesale bandwidth to many of Australia's ISPs.
This is a particularly pertinent question for regional Australia because Telstra is one of the few providers of wholesale bandwidth to many regional Internet service providers. Whilst the way they subsequently sell their retail product has already been perused by the ACCC, there is a very clear case of price discrimination between metropolitan, rural and regional customers of Telstra's Big Pond home and business product. This creates quite a dilemma because, whilst Telstra continues to provide a wholesale product and a retail product for Internet services in the region, the ISPs that provide those services in the region are required to purchase the bandwidth from Telstra at a set price and then on-sell it. Telstra could obviously, within their structure, provide those ISP services at a much lower rate.
Indeed, we have heard evidence in estimates committees that the Internet service that Telstra Big Pond provides has an arbitrary pricing regime. For example, we heard at the estimates committee that Telstra imposed an 85-kilometre radius measurement around a regional point of presence for those classified for their Big Pond business product. Minister, I know that you have dwelt on the issue of points of presence and what a glorious development they are for regional Australians who want access to the Internet, but to impose an arbitrary distance radius around those points of presence for the purposes of jacking up the price, or the cost, of that Internet service seems to be quite bizarre.
It gets even more ridiculous when you consider the way that other Internet service 
 providers actually have to charge for services out in the bush. It is my understanding that the ACCC was challenged and asked about comparisons between what Telstra charges for these service and what other ISPs charge. Although Telstra could provide these services for a lower price, they will not. Why? Because it would be an uncompetitive practice because they would undercut the services being provided by other ISPs. I am describing an absolutely ridiculous situation where the ACCC is maintaining, through their regulatory regime, an artificially high price for Telstra Internet customers in the regions.
This whole issue of Internet pricing is highly pertinent, particularly when you look at some of the developments that are taking place with convergence. As the minister will know—and I have spoken on this issue many times in this place—the provision of Internet services has the capacity to actually overtake and become the new form of communications address in the same way as a telephone number is currently viewed. For many rural and regional Australians, their Internet IP address will possibly become their telecommunications address. Of course, the minister would only be too familiar with telephony across the Internet and the fact that the hardware and software necessary to support that technology is currently available and, certainly, will become more available as the satellite technology proceeds and PAS 8 is launched.
This comes back to the inherent contradiction of what we are dealing with here. We have a telecommunications carrier that does have complete or large control over the local area networks in the regions. The only opportunity for other competitors to come in is via these new technologies. But, until that happens, this government has the responsibility to ensure that these people are not at a disadvantage.
Minister, what is your view of Telstra's discriminatory pricing regime for rural Internet users who are utilising the Telstra Big Pond products? What is your view on the comparison between those products and other products offered by other rural and regionally based Internet service providers? How can you guarantee to rural and regional Austral 
 ians, in the context of the package we know nothing about as yet, that they will in fact have a fair, reasonable and affordable access to the Internet at rates comparable to the flat rates now being offered by the major ISPs in metropolitan areas?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-07-10,"—As I understand it, the preamble will be taken from the bill. I think Senator Harradine has indicated that he will be voting to have it removed, and that means it will be removed. It does contain much that can be properly discussed. Some of it is puff, sort of a philosophical war cry, but there is some good material in it which needs explanation.
There is the statement that Telstra will be subject to a 35 per cent limit on total foreign ownership and a five per cent limit on individual foreign ownership. There is also the statement that Telstra's chair and the majority of Telstra's directors will be Australian citizens. I think people listening to this debate would say, `Yes, it should remain in Australia,' but there are a couple of questions that arise out of that. In his second reading speech, the minister said that the business run by Telstra is simply that—a business—and that it is not government's place to be in business.
What comes across from that is that somehow it does not really matter who owns Telstra—in fact, that has been said—and that it is the quality of the services they deliver that counts. But if that is so why, in the government's view, is it important that the majority of the shareholding remains with Australians? If the majority should be with Australians, why isn't all of it with Australians? Why do we seize upon a 35 per cent limit? Is there a reason behind that or is it simply a matter that seems to be about right, to be about a third? Doesn't that part of the preamble indicate that there are very important considerations as to who should own Telstra? The bill itself and the second reading speech indicate that.
It may be helpful, I suggest, if the minister could, as succinctly as possible, explain this: there is at one level a proposition that this is a business and that, as long as the business returns good service to the people who take those services and returns a profit to the 
 shareholders, it does not really matter who owns it. How does that proposition live with the proposition that I think we would all agree with that it should be kept in Australian hands? If it should be kept in Australian hands, why should 35 per cent of it be allowed to go overseas? If it is best left in the hands of Australians, why shouldn't it be left where it is now?
We obviously have moved beyond that point because it seems that this bill will go through and become an act, but I do think that at this point it is useful to use the preamble to tease out those issues.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—Before we put this amendment to the vote—I do not know whether the minister is going to accept the reality; Senator Harradine's indication is that it will go through—I want to know whether there is any chance of getting some answers to the questions I asked about the detail of the introduction of CDMA and the new costing and pricing arrangements announced today for outback Australia. I want to know whether they will be in legislation and, if so, when. Are they part of the CSO? Are they a government subsidy or will Telstra have to pay for them? These are details of the questions that I genuinely want answered.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—I notice that Senator Cooney has left the chamber, so I will give him a very succinct answer. You put foreign ownership limits on in this area for the same reason that you put them on in a whole range of other areas and for the same reason you have the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act and FIRB restrictions. In some areas you take the view that there is a significant distinction between ownership and control and you can accept certain levels of foreign ownership, but you might want to draw the line in terms of control.
The Labor Party would not, of course, put any foreign ownership limits at all on the radio industry. That industry happens to be a part of the media industry in which there are other very significant foreign ownership restrictions built into legislation, as with pay 
 television or simply with the discretion based on the FIRB legislation for other areas of the media.
I am particularly indebted to Senator Ray for his contribution. I am sure Senator Boswell appreciated it as well. Senator Ray once again underlined the absolute disdain and contempt that the Labor Party has for rural Australians. He might think it is particularly amusing to tell his little stories about Laxettes, but he is revealing a great deal and we are very grateful to him. I promise to immediately be in touch with our advertising agency to ensure that he gets prominence in the campaign. It will be very enlightening, I think, for rural Australia to be told that the de facto leader of the Labor Party in this chamber takes that view of his country cousins.
As far as Senator Schacht is concerned, first of all he suggested that it was only today that it was pointed out that Telstra had already spent $276 million on acquiring spectrum for the purposes of mobile technologies, and he referred to the announcement in relation to CDMA. He seems to have enjoyed himself watching the press conference, but he obviously missed my saying just that yesterday: that in fact Telstra had paid $176 million to purchase the spectrum for national coverage. That is what people in the bush are all about: they do not want a local segmented analog service that is incompatible with metropolitan based services. They want a national service.
One of the great attributes of CDMA is that you can have a dual mode handset that allows seamless migration between AMPS, analog and CDMA as digital technology. They have undertaken to spend $250 million on the CDMA rollout. That is their money. It is a commercial decision they made, but it is against the background of the fact that in order to—
—So they are going to do it anyway?
—Just a minute. Senator Schacht well knows—he should be squirming now in his seat for even mentioning the subject—who was responsible for the absolute fiasco that resulted from the phase-out of analog technology. It was Mr Beazley. All roads lead to Beazley. It is just extraordinary 
 that this bloke's fingerprints are on every bodgie decision that you can think of in the technology area.
—Tell us about the timetable.
—Go fishing, son. You'll do a lot better when you are not borrowing cars without permission. Go fishing. CDMA is a superior technology to the existing analog network. Telstra well knew, and so did the other carriers, that they had 30 days in which to resolve their differences in the number of analog base stations that ought to be retained. If they did not reach a satisfactory decision on the basis of the ACA report, it would be important for them to decide on the extent of the digital roll-out. If they chose not to, they would have to, one way or another, face the consequences. On that basis, they decided that CDMA was a technology that they would prefer to adopt rather than simply upgrade the digital. That is not to say that they cannot do both. We very much welcome that decision, which is clearly one taken on the basis of their awareness of the situation which the government found itself in as a result of that earlier predicament.
I notice that Senator Schacht seemed to have difficulty reading to the bottom of that press release. All he had to do was read down a little further and he would have seen the existing pastoral rate of 25c.
—The CDMA was only going to cost $7 million if they had the spectrum.
—I heard you say that. You said that that is the rural component.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—I did not say that. I said that I heard you say that. If you think that is fine, that is fine by me. Everything is fine.
Senator Schacht seemed to have difficulty reading today's release right through to the bottom. It states that the pastoral call rate will be replaced by a preferential rate of 25c for every 12 minutes. It will be a very significant benefit for those finding it necessary to make calls to the designated community service town. The big problem for many years, and 
 about which the Labor Party did nothing, was that calls to neighbours, friends or workmates within those outer extended zones were timed local calls. There was a great deal of resentment about that fact. This decision means that they will be able to have the benefits of untimed local calls within the zone to those people.
Senator Schacht asked whether this would be included in the CSO. The money will be spent essentially on a capital infrastructure upgrade, probably the installation of two megabyte links and other ancillary technology. Part and parcel of that will probably involve upgrading DCS connections. But it is a one-off, so it is a capital item. It therefore does not need to be included in the CSO. It is money that will be available from the social bonus and will, therefore, be clearly dependent upon this bill passing into law.
Telstra has agreed to these arrangements. You do not need legislation to ensure that because you already have in legislation a capacity to impose price caps if any agreements are not honoured. As Senator Schacht well knows, you have licence conditions that can be varied at any time. So let there be no doubt that we regard Telstra as acting very much in good faith on this initiative. We think it is a very important breakthrough for people in rural and remote areas. They have long bemoaned the fact that they were completely and utterly ignored for those 13 long years. They always failed to understand why they should not be entitled to an untimed local call when phoning within the outer extended zones. As a result of that decision, they will have that capacity.
Senator Schacht asked me about the price of handsets. Clearly, that will ultimately be a commercial decision. The indications we got are that we could expect $349 to be an early price of handsets. As you well know, it all depends on some of the arrangements made. You can have airtime reselling, for example, that might result in heavily subsidised or even give-away handsets. It is entirely a matter for the players and the competition that forces them to make differential price and quality of service offerings.
—Number portability?
—As I am sure Senate Schacht again well remembers, we decided to require number portability for fixed line services by 1 May this year. It is a matter for the ACCC and the ACA to make further decisions in relation to mobiles. I have no doubt that they will do that in relation to CDMA in due course just as they will need to do it for the existing analog and GSM services.
Senator Lundy's principal question concerned what we can do to ensure that Telstra acts competitively. She seems to think that it is engaging in price discrimination through the big pond Internet service provider. If that is the case, clearly the ACCC would have a role. It is a watchdog to ensure that people do not take advantage of a dominant or monopolistic market situation in order to price discriminate. I thought I heard her suggest that somehow if Telstra charges less it would be undercutting and that it would be anticompetitive. It is a bit hard to see that it can be acting anticompetitively if it overcharges or undercharges. At the end of the day, it is a decision by the regulator. We have every confidence that the ACCC will attend to those concerns.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I thank the minister for some of those answers. I am not surprised he chose to avoid some questions. It is embarrassing for a start that he did not deny the fact that the figure reported in the press today—it is not my figure; it was in the press—of Telstra's expenditure for spectrum for the CDMA in the bush is actually only $7 million, not $176 million. So that is $170 million off the package. He just chose to let that one go through. I think that is an indication that the point I raised and the point raised first of all in the press today is correct on that.
—On a point of order, Madam Temporary Chairman: I simply indicated that I had heard what Senator Schacht said on a matter which I have no knowledge of. The proposition that that amounts to me confirming his figure is preposterous.
—What is your point of order?
—You should not allow him to make such statements.
—There is no specific point of order. The minister can answer Senator Schacht when Senator Schacht is finished. I call Senator Schacht.
—The minister indicated that the ACCC will look at the issue of number portability for mobiles later on—
—The ACA. I said both, but it was the ACA.
—Yes, it is the ACA for number portability. Is there any technical inhibition on switching the number? If someone switches from the Telstra CDMA carrier to the Optus GSM carrier where they have to take the new phone, they cannot actually switch the number from one to the other. In the competitive market, having full portability and being able to take your number with you when you change carriers is a very important aspect of developing a competitive market. That has already been dealt with in the fixed telephone market, with a local loop, et cetera. I just want to know whether there is any technical difference.
If that means that CDMA subscribers cannot take their numbers with them when they go to a GSM network, they are going to be formally trapped into sticking with the CDMA and will not have the advantage of full competition. I do not know whether that is technically correct, I just want to get it on the record and find out. If it is not portable for technical reasons—even if the ACA chooses to say this is going to be full number portability and then it finds technically it cannot be imposed—Telstra has walked off with a major market advantage in that the alternative network for mobile phones which will be established as the CDMA right across Australia will be the only choice people have got, particularly rural people. They will not be able to negotiate a lower price by going to another carrier. That is a question I would certainly like answered, because I think it is very important in the competition issue.
On the issue of untimed local call charges in pastoral areas, et cetera, which we have already asked some questions on, the minister 
 said that it would not be necessary for legislation because the $150 million was a one-off capital injection provided out of the social bonus from the statement. If it was Telstra doing it, it would get the $150 million, but I notice in the statement that the government is going to allow anyone who can bid to provide the service. Then the minister said that a proportion of the actual phone calls will still be timed telephone calls, even though they will be at a new lower rate for consumers in those areas, but that lower rate is not going to be set in legislation. The minister said that it is only generally covered by price caps, but those price cap arrangements are rather flexible. As I understand it, you get some flexibility as a carrier to average out the price. You do not automatically say, `The price cap is X minus the CPI figure for a particular phone call and carriers can take into account their discount amounts, et cetera.' If it were X minus the CPI, I would have thought that over the last few years the price cap for local telephone calls at 25c would have come down a few cents in this time of low inflation.
What I want to know is what would stop Telstra adjusting the price at some stage in the future? If it is not in legislation, if it is not a disallowable instrument and if it is only covered by a price cap, how do you control it? That was my point before. If I were a National Party senator, at the very least I would have insisted on writing this into the bill, full stop. No matter what they did elsewhere, I would have written this in the bill as an actual amount that could not be changed or increased in any way without referral back to parliament. That is the best protection I could imagine. As I said to Senator Boswell when he was here, I am very surprised they did not take that opportunity.
Minister, do we have any indication of how much revenue Telstra will lose by the new untimed rates that are being set and also the new lower timed rate? Is Telstra going to put that into the CSO or is it going to take that as a reduction of its profit by having a lower call rate charge and more untimed calls available? They are a number of questions I would like answered. ",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—I think the first point was whether there were any technical inhibitions—I cannot read my own writing—in relation to number portability.
—Between the two systems.
—Yes. I would have to get advice on that to be able to give you a definitive answer. Certainly, as you would probably be aware, there have been debates from time to time about the extent of any real technical difficulties in relation to fixed line services because one party says that there are very serious technical difficulties and others say it is a matter of flicking a switch. Ultimately, these matters have to be resolved, if not by agreement. That is why our advice in relation to fixed line was that there were no insuperable technical problems and we were prepared to mandate it, as we did.
—So, in the balance, you think there is no technical problem? I am not saying there is.
—I will get further advice for you on that, but all I can say on first principles is that, to the extent it were not possible to move seamlessly between the two, if anything, that would be a barrier to people transferring to CDMA if they already have digital handsets. Therefore, your suggestion that somehow this constituted a great bottleneck service in the hands of—
—Not in the bush. Sydney is the only one that works. Rural people are trapped.
—In principle, number portability is desirable, and I take your general point that, if you do not have interoperability, in a sense, you are diminishing both competing proprietary technologies. I would certainly expect the regulators to be exploring every possibility and to be ensuring that number portability was introduced as soon as it is technically possible. You will not get CDMA overnight. Obviously, it will involve a progressive build out. I would expect that, as soon as the ACA is in a position to do so, 
 it will examine the issue and we can get some specialist technical advice.
You were correct in saying that the $150 million capital outlay would be a maximum. In other words, we are not simply handing the money over to Telstra. We would put it out to tender. It may well be built by someone other than Telstra. It may even be that another carrier may be prepared to offer the service. All we are doing is ensuring that the capital upgrade occurs. But, assuming that it is still providing a service in remote areas that is offered only by Telstra, the arrangements that you have now in relation to pastoral calls will remain.
As I understand it, they have probably been in place since the early 1980s. In fact, until that time, people in those outer zones, effectively, did have untimed local calls, and it was only with the progressive digitalisation and modernisation of the network when your government came to office that they were phased out. That is why these people have been so annoyed that, throughout that period, they have been deprived of untimed local calls which they had once upon a time.
As I understand it, as for the community call rate, the pastoral call rate is not in legislation but, if there were any need to do it, you would simply be able to introduce modified price cap arrangements as disallowable instruments. You have a particularly jaundiced and, I must say, cynical view of Telstra's bona fides if you say that, even though Telstra agrees on a pastoral—
—Come to a CoT case hearing for a while.
—You know my views on the CoT cases, but that has nothing to do with what Telstra offers the general public by way of a price rate. If they have had pastoral calls in place now for 15 or more years—there has never been the slightest suggestion that they welsh on that offer, similarly with community call rates—I cannot conceivably imagine why they would want to somehow renege on a solemn commitment to offer a more generous preferential rate than the previous pastoral call rate. So it is a complete furphy to suggest that somehow people should 
 look askance at Telstra's agreement to offer a preferential rate.
You asked me what difference that will make to Telstra's bottom line. Now is not the time to give you a lecture on the price elasticity of demand, but it clearly depends on the volume of traffic. There may or may not be more traffic as a result of its being effectively cheaper. If you asked me how many people in rural areas make calls of more than 12 minutes, I would have to say I do not know, and I do not suppose anyone can really guess. You just have to test these things in the marketplace, but I would not imagine that it would make any significant difference. Certainly, for a company with revenue of $23 billion, I do not think Telstra would for a moment come to us and suggest that somehow that ought to be included in the USO or the CSO arrangements.
It is a very welcome initiative, as far as the government is concerned. I am sure it will be very much welcomed by those 37,000 families—probably 100,000 people—in those 111 outer zones. I am sure Telstra itself will find that it will be a very beneficial deal.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I want to speak on the same matter, but Senator Lundy may want to raise some other matters. Minister, was the new community rate, which is still a timed call, set as well as the untimed, and who is eligible for it? In your second reading speech you say `17,000 telephone customers in remote parts of Australia . . . have no access to untimed local calls', but in your statement you point out that it is 37,000. I presume then that 17,000 get no untimed calls at the moment and the other 20,000 have access to some. I am not arguing there is a discrepancy in the figure; it is just that the way it is described in the second reading speech is different from the press statement. The press statement is describing a wider range of local beneficiaries.
Who determined who was eligible for the new untimed rate in the zone? Was it the negotiations you had with the National Party, or was that advised to you by Telstra? Secondly, in relation to those who get access to the new designated community centre for a 
 lower rate timed call, was that new charge, which is a reduction, set by you in negotiation with the National Party, or was it set by Telstra? The reason I raise it is that I want to find out whether this is a commercial decision of Telstra or whether it is a political decision of the government.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—As far as Telstra is concerned, it has never been a commercial proposition for them to offer untimed local calls within those outer extended zones or between the inner extended zones and the outer extended zones. In other words, the amount it would cost to upgrade the infrastructure in their view was not worth the amount of increased traffic that might flow, particularly because an untimed local call clearly brings in less revenue than even the pastoral call rate, let alone the preferential rate. It was not going to happen if it were left to Telstra.
What we did, as a policy decision—and I think very much welcomed by those in these areas—was to provide the funding for the capital upgrade, which would not otherwise have occurred, and thereby give Telstra a platform on which it would well and truly be able to afford to offer untimed local calls within the outer extended zones and between the outer extended zone and the inner extended zone. Those in the inner extended zones already got untimed local calls. Again, that was another source of friction for people living in remote areas.
The price difference in terms of the usage was quite insignificant by comparison with the cost of the infrastructure upgrade. On that basis, once we took the policy decision, Telstra was more than happy to agree to offer an untimed local call which by definition does not need a price gap. We know what it costs. It costs 25c. The preferential rate was one that we determined would be of particular assistance when you are ringing into a commercial service town, many of which are within the outer extended zones but a number of which are outside the outer extended zones.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—Minister, I think you just proved 
 my point. You did not need to have legislation to get an agreement with Telstra. You achieved it by political negotiation with Telstra because you owned two-thirds of the company. You have said here before that things such as CSOs and universal service obligations—a whole range of requirements—are written in legislation and that is the way you protect everybody. Here you reached a political arrangement for the country to meet the concerns of the National Party, apparently.
In your discussions with Telstra, you offered $150 million for the capital program as the sweetener and then got them to agree to what the subsequent charge would be, extending the untimed local call and a reduced rate for the community call charge as a timed rate at a lower rate. You clearly interfered and had discussions with Telstra to change the rate, and you used your position as a government, representing the two-thirds majority ownership of Telstra.
We say, `Good on you.' That is why we want to keep Telstra in majority ownership, so that from time to time when public issues are raised those matters can be sorted out. You sorted it out. You said that you do not need to go to the CSO. You do not need to carry legislation to achieve this. You did it by negotiation with Telstra. There is no doubt that as soon as Telstra is 100 per cent privately owned, the opportunity for you to do anything similar again comes to an end, because they will say to you, `Go and change the legislation for the CSO. Put it in there or put it in particular legislation that applies to all carriers.'
Again, this is why it is necessary to keep Telstra in majority public ownership. We wanted it to be 100 per cent in public ownership; it is now two-thirds. We want to keep it in two-thirds so that these sorts of arrangements can be achieved. I am just surprised, as I said earlier, that the National Party did not have the wit to demand that this be written in legislation so that politically out there in the bush when they are being cooked alive by One Nation—and we are going to go after them very heavily too on this issue—they would have been able to say that this is what they got in legislation. What you are saying 
 is: `We did a deal with Telstra management because we own two-thirds of it, but in another 12 months time, if we get our way, those arrangements will not be able to be achieved.'
—Will they be honoured?
—Will they be honoured?
—We do not know. Again, you may have to come back for a disallowable instrument if you are still in government and still with Telstra. I have no doubt that Telstra has said, `In view of the politics at the moment, we want to be nice to the government.' Senior management are in favour of the full privatisation of Telstra. They are on share bonuses and probably have promises for big increases in salaries or whatever. Telstra has said, `We believe in the full privatisation of Telstra. This is a political decision management will make to help the government, so we are not going to argue about it. It may only be a few million dollars once we have the $150 million—if they choose to bid for it—to put the infrastructure in.' It is a game.
We have not got from Telstra yet whether this was a commercial decision to introduce new untimed local calls and timed calls at lower rates or whether they just gave a wink, nudge and nod to the government to try to negotiate with the National Party. The more we see of it, as Senator Faulkner said, it is another part of the sleazy deal.
—Government and Telstra, eh? A sleazy deal with Telstra.
—Telstra senior management and the board, who are on record as being in favour of privatisation—they put their submission in to say that they favour full privatisation—realise that it would have been politically stupid of them to have said in the last two days, `No, we are not going to cop this new rate in the bush. Leave it as it is.' They knew that you might have lost the National Party on the vote in this place, and they would not have got their privatisation. They knew when to roll over. The only problem is that the poor old National Party fell for the pea and thimble trick and did not get it written into the legislation. It is now 
 much clearer to me, Minister, how the deal was done, and it just proves that you have used your two-thirds ownership of Telstra to get a political outcome, ironically, to get rid of your ability to do that in the future.
I want to raise one other question with the minister. Minister, in your second reading speech you mentioned a local call price parity measure taking effect from 31 December 1997. I asked questions at estimates a few months ago and at that stage the average, the price parity, had not been determined. I may have missed an announcement that it had been set recently. If it has been set, what has it been set at? If it has not been set, what is holding up the works? Half the year has gone. When do the consumers get the benefit? We would like to know this. When I moved my amendment, which was a more bold one, back in March 1997, you refused it—
—The roof would have fallen in, if I remember rightly.
—No doubt the consumers would have done very well. You put up what Telstra wanted. I want to find out what the rate is and how it is going to apply. It is supposed to apply all of this year. Are you going to give rebates or something to people if there is a lower price?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—The price parity arrangements are still to be determined. It is a matter for the ACCC. They need to compile the necessary information, which presumably they are in the process of acquiring from Telstra. Can I simply refute the absurd proposition that we were able to achieve an untimed local call rate in the outer extended zones only because we own two-thirds of Telstra.
—You would have had to use legislation to achieve it if you did not own Telstra.
—You seem to think that people cannot have negotiations with privately owned companies. Of course you can.
—What? Private companies giving up money, giving up profit? No-one believes that, Richard.
—Who says they are giving up profit? Their problem was that they were not prepared to spend up to $150 million. So, once that hurdle is overcome, it is all downhill. There is not a problem in terms of pricing because, as far as they were concerned, all that was stopping them from providing untimed local calls was the cost of the capital upgrade. We found that; we solved the problem. We did not need to put any pressure on them, twist their arm or anything else.
You have such contempt for Telstra. Even the most hated man in the Victorian ALP cannot contain his bile. Time and again he is asking, `Will the deal be honoured?' and making all sorts of reflections on Telstra's propriety and credibility. Keep it up. As far as we are concerned, you hate them with a passion because somehow they have been prepared to go down the sensible track and move towards privatisation.
Senator Schacht was in estimates a few weeks ago saying that senior management would be honour bound to resign en masse if Labor won the next election. That was the proposition. I read the transcript and I could not believe my eyes. There he was saying, `You are hopelessly compromised because you favour privatisation.' If that were a hanging offence, three-quarters of the people who run telcos around the world—all senior management around the world—would have to resign en masse because they think it is a good idea.
To suggest that somehow the senior management of Telstra should resign because they are in favour of privatisation is just about the most preposterous proposition one can put. It is simply another example of the way in which you cannot abide Telstra making commercial decisions.
—When are we going to get a determination of what the local call price parity measure is?
—I suppose as soon as the ACCC is able to provide it.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-10,"—It is obvious by the minister's response to my earlier question 
 about price discrimination for Internet services in rural and regional Australia that this government is going to do absolutely nothing to resolve that problem. In fact, the minister stated he would leave it up to the ACCC. He said that they have made a decision and they are not doing anything about it.
The issue that has been canvassed by Senator Schacht and Senator Alston subsequently I think is one of great interest—that is, the distinction between commercial decisions by Telstra and policy decisions by this government. I made reference in my speech in the second reading debate on this bill to the fact that the minister's vision and scope do not go too far beyond the boardrooms of the commercial organisations.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Would Senator Schacht, Senator Alston and Senator Carr please allow Senator Lundy to continue her remarks and we will progress much more smoothly.
—This question of government policy versus commercial decision by Telstra is worthy of great exploration. As I just mentioned—although you probably would not have heard it, Minister, because you were talking across the chamber—I am of the view that many of the decisions that you have claimed are your policy in response to the needs of the bush are, in fact, inherently linked to commercial decisions of Telstra. As you have just stated yourself, a capital injection on behalf of the government has been what has determined a further expansion of Telstra's network to improve their market share in these areas. This is despite the fact that previously one of the great issues in the bush of all the competitors is that Telstra already has a structural advantage.
So I am saying yes, we need to enhance services in the bush and Telstra is the unique mechanism to do that while it is in public hands. The minute you privatise it, Minister, it does changes hands and then you start to impact and play a role within the varying competitive pressures within the open market. That contradiction cannot be resolved.
I want to go to another example where this contradiction is quite inherent. It is worth canvassing, and I did so in previous debate in this place. That is the current arrangements with respect to Telstra in partnership with a number of groups, including those advocates of the technology called Direct PC, Hughes and Ericsson, providing a satellite service to 1,000 rural and regional customers for Internet access via a company established by the National Farmers Federation called Farmwide.
I want to say a few words about Farmwide in the first instance. First of all, it is achieving its goals. It is getting rural and regional people on-line at less cost than it would otherwise have been. Farmwide is also doing a great service to rural and regional people in exploring their needs and establishing the type of content and the access regime that suits these people.
I preface my comments with respect to Farmwide in that way because I do not want my comments now to be interpreted in any way as suggesting that the aims and goals of the Farmwide project are anything but of the best intention and of very practical and meaningful support to their customers. But listen to this: the rural and telecommunications infrastructure fund—remember that this was the bribe that was paid out: a $250 million bribe to secure the passage of the one-third sale of Telstra bill—is funding the Farmwide project. It is a project that is handled under the auspices of the National Farmers Federation, which is very reasonably placed to provide services to rural and regional customers, but it is certainly not the only organisation capable of doing so.
The partnerships in association with the Farmwide project are Telstra-Hughes-Ericsson in the direct PC technology. This is an Internet technology which uses the capability of both the copper network and satellite technology, allowing a high bandwidth download with only a low bandwidth return. This partnership has the greatest strategic value to Telstra, because it gives Telstra access to a potential new market that is currently sought after by the new satellite technology's Internet access.
There is a fantastic commercial opportunity here for Telstra to participate in that project. Indeed, wasn't it handy for them to be able to get access to RTIF funding through the sale of the first tranche? In fact, it is quite ironic that Telstra had the opportunity to develop this particular technology—direct PC—from a government grant as a result of the payout, the bribe, to allow the one-third sale of Telstra through. I think people can see the irony that I am outlining. The point goes a little further with Farmwide and what is happening with that project. Telstra's Internet product, Big Pond, is the basis of the ISP, if you like, that Farmwide utilises to connect its project clients to the Internet.
In terms of strategic commercial decisions and partnerships, Telstra and its Big Pond product have recently entered into a partnership with 9MSN. Of course, 9MSN is a partnership between Kerry Packer's PBL and Microsoft Australia. Interestingly, Big Pond-Telstra and 9MSN have reciprocal arrangements in place which mean that everybody who dials up Big Pond—and there are 180,000 subscribers to Big Pond around Australia, and that number is growing—get immediate access to 9MSN. They are not required to subscribe to 9MSN. It is a reciprocal arrangement. In return, Telstra is providing some billing services to 9MSN and there are various other elements of the arrangement.
Inadvertently, through all these strategic corporate partnerships, there is a wonderful, fantastic commercial opportunity for Telstra lying in the heart of what, on the surface, is sold by this government as government policy on improving access for rural and regional Internet customers. Because of these arrangements, I believe that everyone in the bush who is accessing the Internet in this way is now doing so on a testbed of a commercial venture of the production of Internet-based content through 9MSN. Rather than our seeing publicly funded Internet content, either through the ABC or other national broadcasters, that has cutting edge digital content production, we see a commercial arrangement, such as 9MSN, utilising the backbone provided by our national telecommunications carrier to develop a cutting edge technology and 
 delivery of satellite Internet services to the bush.
When the minister stands up and says that this social bonus is such a win for the bush and that it has occurred through his efforts to negotiate these outcomes with Telstra, I wonder how captive he is of their boardroom considerations and how long it takes him to convince himself that it is not Telstra's corporate plan and what is going to advantage them commercially. Indeed, it is how you can dress up those strategies and present them to the public in a way that they believe is some form of altruistic government policy.
This is quite an untenable decision. Unless the public are aware of all the strategic partnerships and alliances that Telstra is currently engaged in, we can never know what is government policy being put in place for the purposes of enhancing the lot of consumers and what is, in fact, a commercial strategy on behalf of Telstra itself.
I have asked these questions on notice at estimates but, not surprisingly—like most of the questions I have asked that go to the heart of the matter—I do not get a response, or I get a highly inadequate response. Minister: can you provide to this committee some detail about the level of knowledge you have of the commercial considerations of Telstra? I know you are in a position to say what you like, but I think this is a matter of great principle.
As I have said, Telstra as a corporation have leaned on the fact that they have commercial considerations taken in confidence for their own competitive reasons. That may well mean the public never have the opportunity to assess where they are going with their commercial plans. This conflict is not going to go away without some quite confronting demands being made by the government. I do not believe this government is going to make those demands. They certainly have not indicated that they will to date. I certainly do not think the public will ever know the extent of Telstra's commercial strategic plans as compared with government policy whilst ever we have this coalition government in place and whilst ever Telstra is deadset committed to operating in the private sphere and not in the public sphere.
My warning goes out to rural and regional Australians and to the members of the National Party who are thinking that they have really extracted a commitment from Telstra. I have to say that relying on a commitment to Telstra in the way that you are over this commitment to untimed calls tells me one thing and one thing only—if you are not legislating along those lines then there is no commercial disadvantage. In fact, it will probably enhance Telstra's position with respect to providing those services in some way or another because, Minister, as you know, that is what competition is all about. They have to position themselves in the most effective way possible. Quite frankly, to do so just because you think it is a good idea does not wash with me or anyone else on this side of the chamber. I am sure that in due course the National Party members will wake up to themselves and realise how they have been duped.
On the other hand, legislating to provide these services gives a guarantee to Telstra that the government is putting in concrete the required service levels, and then they are able to structure their commercial decisions around it. There is no avenue for recourse other than legislative change. This might prove to be a bit of a shock to Telstra because, to date, they have been able to walk into the minister's office and mould him like clay. They allow him to espouse their views and construct them in such a way that it sounds as though Senator Alston has come up with a great idea for telecommunications policy. As I mentioned in my speech on the second reading, this minister's great strength is how to make a Telstra commercial strategy or a Telstra corporate plan look like government policy. It is a very lazy way to run a portfolio.
One of the most telling moments about the nature of the relationship between this minister and Telstra will come when there is a change of government, because all those bets will be off. No longer will Telstra be able to work with a compliant minister who is prepared to provide such a grand service to the national carrier as providing the political impetus and political excuses and taking the 
 political heat for any commercial direction that Telstra may choose to go in.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—Minister, you gave an answer that the ACCC is still considering the local call price parity measure. I find it extraordinary that, seven months into the year when it has to first operate, they still have not given you a determination. As I understand it, the consumer is supposed to get the benefit of it operating this year—that is, for calendar year 1998. Your second reading speech states that your ministerial determination:
. . . came into effect on 31 December 1997 to enable lower prices for untimed local calls in markets with competition to also be shared by consumers in markets without competition.
So that means this year. When they finally make the determination, whenever it is, and there is a reduction which might be only ½c or 1c in some markets, how is it going to be passed on to the consumer when they have already paid half their phone bill for the year? They have paid on either a quarterly or a monthly basis. How are they going to get the benefit of it? Is it going to be a rebate system? And so on.
This is extremely lax for a promise that you fought so vigorously for in the debate on the telecommunications deregulatory bills of March 1997. Yet here we are seven months on from the date the determination came into effect and you have not delivered the consumers one benefit from it. Whether Professor Fels is more interested in chasing wharfies or something, I do not know, but why isn't this being fixed and an averaged figure determined? It should not be waiting on the wit of a mathematician down at the ACCC. Even a reasonable accountant could work out the figuring to see whether something applies. That is one matter I would like to be given more detail on, in view of the fact that you went to such great lengths to convince us—against my amendment—that yours was such a wonderful outcome.
I also want to ask the minister about the first amendment moved to delete the preamble and in particular where it mentions the `social bonus' in the second paragraph on page 2. Even though you do not know what the figure 
 is, if you are successful with the full privatisation of Telstra, with the sale of the remaining two-thirds, there are suggestions that it may be worth $40 billion over one tranche, two tranches—or it might be more; it might be closer to $45 billion. Has the cabinet determined yet, and thereby the government determined, what percentage of the total proceeds will be allocated to the so-called `social bonus'?
So far, on my figuring of two of the prongs of Senator Boswell's three-pronged deal that has got the National Party on side, I get that you have spent only $150 million. Telstra is spending all of the $256 million for the mobile phone; that does not have to be paid out of the social bonus. Thus, so far you have bought off the National Party for $150 million. We still have the pitchfork's third prong to come. But I would like to know whether there has been a determination on what percentage of the asset sale would go to the social bonus? I would appreciate those two questions being answered.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—The ACCC is still considering the precise mechanism. I would expect that, in due course, it will ensure that any entitlement is factored into future pricing arrangements.
But as for the proposition that somehow I fought so hard for it, I can assure you that I fought even harder against your idea, which would have meant no price reductions anywhere. Your idea was that, because there is ferocious competition in Sydney and you reduce the price by a couple of cents, you immediately have to apply that to the rest of Australia. In other words, you would have Telstra presumably providing a subsidy, a CSO, to the rest of Australia. That is what you would have said. By definition, there was no competition in that marketplace to justify reducing prices. That was an absurd proposition; fortunately, we were able to resist it. I agree with you that it would have had the attractions of simplicity. It is just that it would have frozen competition for all time.
—Yours is not working. It's not turned up, Minister.
—Order, Senator Schacht.
—I have explained to you that the ACCC makes its own decisions on these matters. We have put legislation in place that requires the ACCC to go down that path, and I have no doubt that it will. If you somehow think that I should be out there giving directions to the ACCC, irrespective of what is—
—I would have thought, as it's in the legislation, you would have given it a bit of a kick along.
—That might be the way you run your business. I am content to rely on Professor—
—You do nothing at all to help the consumers.
—Why do you get so excited if I am not doing anything?
—I would have thought it would be nice for the consumers to get something occasionally.
—It will be very nice in due course. As far as the social bonus is concerned, I am not about to pre-empt any announcements that we might want to make in that regard.
As far as Senator Lundy is concerned, I hope she does not mind me communicating to those at Telstra that she understands they can mould me like clay. I do not think they share that view. Indeed, I think they would take quite a different view, and I am sure they will be greatly amused by the suggestion. So I will have no hesitation in passing it on. If she is happy for me to tell them that they have a compliant minister, I am sure they will enjoy that one as well.
As to Senator Lundy's first proposition that somehow we have allowed Telstra to increase market share in rural areas, the fact is that Telstra is the only game in town. So you really cannot—
—It's a monopoly.
—That is very good, very good indeed. If you are the sole provider in an area, you are the monopoly provider. That is right. I hope you understand the 
 difference between a legal and a de facto monopoly. But the fact is that there are a lot of areas—
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—You would not have allowed competition anywhere. The fact is that there are a number of parts of rural Australia where it is uneconomic to provide services, even for Telstra. That is why you have a universal service obligation to fund—
—Hello! Didn't you hear what they responded with at the estimates hearing? Telstra got up and said that they did not have a monopoly on ISP services at all.
—I am not talking about ISP services. I am talking about your starting proposition that our decision announced yesterday will allow Telstra to increase its market share in rural areas. That is preposterous nonsense, because it already has 100 per cent. You seem to think that direct PC is a technology; direct PC is simply a proprietary name for a service which is offered in a number of places these days. You also seem to be under the misapprehension that we funded the first 1,000 trial.
The fact is that we provided $5.5 million through the RTIF, which I think has been remarkably successful—as even Senator Lundy is prepared to concede. You are getting quite good at conspiracy propositions. If you develop them to a fine point, you will probably be able to qualify for being assistant deputy parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for communications in the next term of opposition. But at this point in time, the idea that somehow we are in the business of providing funds to Telstra, even though it would otherwise have engaged in commercial activities, demonstrates a very poor understanding of the marketplace.
All I can suggest to you is: do what I did and do what a lot of other people do; that is, use your time in this place productively and go off and do a bit of economics on the side, and you will have a much better idea of what is going on. But if you think that somehow any decision we take to provide assistance through a regional fund or otherwise is somehow subsidising activities that would already 
 have been undertaken commercially, then you do not understand what a commercial decision is.
If it is a commercial decision, it would be undertaken. If Telstra is not doing it, by definition, it is not attractive for Telstra to do it commercially. That is why you provide assistance, either through a fund, through the CSO or through a range of other mechanisms. In this case, Telstra was not about to provide those services. Farmwide has had a trial which was successful. The RTIF, which is an arms-length decision making process—in other words, not the government at all; not us writing out cheques—
Senator Schacht interjecting—
Senator Lundy interjecting—
—You copped it; you got up and said in this place that you did not want this to be another Ros Kelly.
—Senator Alston, would you please address your remarks through the chair.
—I am sorry, Madam Chair. Senator Schacht was very keen to avoid another whiteboard fiasco and, accordingly, we spelt out in very clear terms that this would be an arms-length arrangement. Whether or not we liked it, whether or not we supported it, the RTIF—
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—What do you say? Doug is patchy now, is he? You were saying he is a great man and he would not have copped what the National Party cop these days. You cannot have it have both ways. You cannot say that he is a strong man in one breath, and in another breath say that he rolled over.
—Order! Senator Alston, would you please resume your seat. We are not making very much progress here this evening because a lot of the comments are not being made through the chair. We have a long way to go, and I suggest it will be helpful if honourable senators listen to the minister and then respond as they see fit.
—I simply wanted to defend the good name of Doug Anthony and to make it clear to Senator Lundy that the RTIF makes its own decisions. It clearly took the view that, without this funding being available, it was not going to be provided commercially. I think if you asked the National Farmers Federation you will understand that was the basis of their submission. Why else would they want good money spent on something that Telstra was about to do anyway?
You asked me to provide my knowledge of Telstra's commercial considerations. I have only been to one board meeting. I am not really in a position to tell you how they go about making those sorts of decisions, but all I know is that they would much rather go on making them than have your approach, which is to basically second-guess them; in other words, you tell them what to do. You do not like the idea of their operating commercially, so you would be in there telling them how to run the business. I tell you what: anyone who owns shares in Telstra would be selling off right now if they thought you were about to get into government, because the idea of having shareholder value halve overnight would terrify them.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—You have sold yours already, have you? I cannot blame you because you are quite right. You would absolutely decimate this company if you allowed the Labor Party to get in there and give them all these powers of direction to undertake what are otherwise uncommercial activities. That is what I understood the proposition to be. Senator Lundy says, `Just because we think it is a good idea.' If you think proper policy making depends upon you having a good idea and imposing it on a commercial operator, I doubt you would get much support out there in the marketplace.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I want to refer immediately to the minister's previous answers. I have to say that it is easy to know when Senator Alston does not quite get the point on a question because he immediately 
 reverts to his mantras, rhetoric and condescending comments about the issue. He knows very well that my questions were in the context of Internet service provided in rural and regional areas. In fact, I believe the reason he chose to answer them out of context is that he does not know the answers and I do not believe he understood the question.
The minister knows very well that I have chosen to focus on Internet access and Internet pricing equity in rural and regional areas as part of my contribution to this bill. I would appreciate it if he could at least give an indication as to the expansion of the Farmwide project and if there is going to be an extra $400 million as part of the social bonus. Minister, can you indicate whether it is perceived that the government will expand upon the project initiated through Farmwide as a result of RTIF funding and whether you have contemplated the issues to that degree of detail at this point in time?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

If you are asking me to what extent we might be able to assist in bringing about cheaper Internet access in rural and remote areas, in many respects that is a function of competition.
If you believe that Big Pond is acting anti-competitively by overcharging, exercising monopoly power or underpricing because it has got monopoly power, then that is an issue for the ACCC. If you are suggesting that you ought to throw a bucket of money at particular consumers, service providers or whoever else, I would be interested in hearing your policy on it and we could have a sensible discussion. Beyond that, I am not clear on what more you have in mind in asking whether I support lower Internet access prices. We all support the lowest possible prices, we all support the highest possible quality of service and we all support the greatest diversity of products.

There is a review presently under way on the universal service obligation and what it could cover. Minister, when will the report by the ACA on the definition of the standard telephone and extending it under the universal service obligation be available? When do you expect to receive that report? It was due by 15 August. That was a review taken on board as a result of an amendment or discussion when the bill for the deregulation regime was debated in March of last year.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—As I recall, we were principally concerned in that legislation to ensure that we were in a position to properly assess digital data capability by 1999. On that basis there was not a dramatic sense of urgency. It was more important to see how market conditions would shake out. We commissioned that review on advice. There has been no particular difficulty about that. The process has been following a normal course. It is not something that you would want to rush into because it clearly has very significant cost implications. I am sure you recall that, when we had the standard telephone service review chaired by Jock Given, we had a dissenting report from Professor Henry Ergas suggesting that it might cost $8 billion for higher levels. As you and I have discussed before,  Telstra has made it plain that you could be spending up to $26  billion if you were to espouse the 64 kilobit level as a mandatory requirement. It clearly has very significant cost implications. It is a matter that we want to get right.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—No, it is not. I am going from memory, but I thought there was something in the bill to the effect that there had to be a review by 1999. The basic proposition was to decide, by the year 2000, on the extent of any upgrade in the standard telephone service. Just what the parameters were for commissioning that review, I do not recall. To start in March this year and to have a report by 15 August puts us well on track for delivering on that commitment.

 definition in the universal service obligation it would cost $26 billion to provide. You also implied that this was the figure provided to you by Telstra.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—I am not sure whether it is in the Telstra submission. The cost will obviously vary depending on the parameters. I am simply telling you as a matter of record that the advice I have had from Telstra is that it could cost up to $26 billion.
—Up to, now?
—If you do not know the difference between `up to' and `precisely'—
—We do.
—We do.
—If you are talking in figures of that magnitude no-one would be able to give you a precise figure. All I know is that if you gave someone $26 billion I am sure they would be able to spend it for you. But if you ask them to calculate an estimate you will inevitably get a range when you are talking about a project of that magnitude which would involve individual wall sockets being installed in every household. You can set lower standards if you want to and the cost will accordingly be reduced. Twenty-six billion dollars is simply the outer bound of an estimate. It is not something that anyone would lay their life down for. I am only reporting it as an estimate provided to me by Telstra. I am not  vouching for it. Indeed, I would probably want independent advice on it.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—This is quite a change in attitude, Minister, from when you first used the phrase here in the debate as an aside across the chamber directed mainly at me. I was the first person to raise the point, in March last year, that the universal service 
 obligation should start looking at the capacity it provides for online broadband services, not just access to a standard telephone receiver. You put it across the chamber in a way that indicated I was off my cotton-picking head because this was going to cost $26 billion—this was the Telstra figure—and therefore that was impossible. Now you are telling us, `You would be a mug to accept Telstra's figures on this.' You said you cannot confirm whether you perceive this figure as part of the submission to the ACA review on digital capacity, which reports by mid-August.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—I recall being given a briefing which contained the usual slides—
—And the usual suspects too.
—I suppose they were in that regard. But I regard them as honourable men, in marked contra-distinction to the view you presumably have of most of them. I do not know whether Senator Lundy wants to associate herself with those remarks, but the people I have dealt with at Telstra strike me as doing their best with very difficult policy propositions.
—I have met hundreds and hundreds of Telstra workers and they are all decent people.
—Order! Senator Schacht!
—The real issue is: if it is not $26 billion, it is clearly a very substantial sum of money. Let us say it was only a mere $15 billion—right? As I recall it, $16 million was the minimum bound. Let us say it was only $16 billion. Do you know what the CSO currently is? How much is it? Do you know, Senator Lundy?
—Minister, it would be very helpful if you did not provoke interjections.
—I was wanting an answer. 
—No, I am sorry, Minister, it would be very helpful if you did not.
—Two hundred and sixty million dollars.
—Senator Schacht wins. That was a very good guess—$260 million.
—It is not a guess.
—It is about $253 million, isn't it? Anyway it is of that order. So, if you were to go from $250 million in round figures to $15 million or $16 billion in round figures, you can just imagine what that would do for the carrier and for all other carriers who had to contribute to the universal service obligation. In other words, in one fell swoop, you would bankrupt the entire telecommunications industry in this country—a great policy approach, but not one that commends itself to the government.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—This leads me to the next point, Minister. In your own statement recently, you said that by the end of this year—or maybe next year—96 per cent of Australian households will have access to 64 kilobits. Now Telstra is trying to tell the minister to get that last four per cent of Australians—
—No, no, no; wrong!
—To get the last four per cent of Australians—
—The penny has not dropped.
—Hang on—the last four per cent of Australians is going to cost $26 billion. That means the last 600,000, half a million, 300,000 or something is going to cost $26 billion.
—Sit yourself down before you embarrass yourself further.
—Well, Minister, why don't you provide the information, rather than just throw it across the chamber—`Ah, hah, it's $26 billion; you don't know what you're talking about'—which is what you were doing two weeks ago. You talk about when the penny dropped. I will tell you when the penny dropped: it was when some National Party person and other people in the bush—the NFF 
 and so on—said, `Actually, we want 64 kilobits for everybody in the bush,' and you went, `Bingo, my god; I've got to get Ronnie Boswell's vote.'
—That is what they have promised Ronnie's party.
—That is right. That is when the penny dropped. That happened suddenly. There was the abuse of me and other Labor Party people—`This is a ridiculous figure at $26 billion. You can't have that if nothing can be afforded.'—and then the penny dropped: the politics of getting this bill through meant, `Goodness me, I'm going to have to redraft the figure.' We have seen it drop $10 billion in 40 seconds here tonight, from about $26 million to $15 billion. I suspect that when the third prong—
—Madam Temporary Chairman, on a point of order: could Senator Schacht refer to Senator Boswell by his correct title.
—In fact, I have repeatedly requested that all senators be referred to by their correct titles. I would appreciate it if all participants in this debate could direct their comments through the chair and not directly at each other across the chamber.
—Through you, Madam Temporary Chairman: I apologise to Senator Boswell for using his first name. I still want to make the point—through you, Madam Temporary Chairman—that the minister's rhetoric has dramatically changed in the last couple of weeks.
When the government was bagging the opposition that this was a ludicrous idea, that was fine until the National Farmers Federation and other individual members of the National Party—including, I think, Senator O'Chee—raised it. But Senator O'Chee is not a great one for credibility at the moment: I think he promised to walk backwards to the Gold Coast if the One Nation Party won a seat in the Queensland election, and we are still waiting for him to walk backwards to the Gold Coast.
So it is now true and it is now clear that this government is rewriting its rhetoric on 
 this issue because it has been cooked on this issue. A lot of ordinary rural organisations and average Australian farmers are saying, `If you want us to be internationally competitive, to compete in the global market with free trade and all of those things, we have got to have access to the best infrastructure so that we can compete in the marketplace, and the way to have it is access to broadband online services such as the Internet.' That is why the minister is now backing down.
What I find interesting is that this report from the ACA—on a possible redefinition of what is in the universal service obligation and on this issue of how many kilobits could be offered—is now, of course, coming out in August after this bill is carried. I wonder about that. I hope the National Party have not been conned again in that they are going to vote for this bill to go through and then be told in August, `Sorry, Senator Boswell, Senator O'Chee and the National Party; we looked at it but the report says we can't do it.'
Once the bill has gone through, they have got no bargaining position. Again, it might well be that they have accidentally sold out their own bush constituents. We cannot get from this government tonight what the third prong of the deal is. We have got two of them, and it only works out to—
—Don't be too smart; they have been made public.
—I know. But we have found out here tonight—Minister, thank you for your comment—that, instead of it being worth several hundred million, two of them have only cost $150 million. Telstra was going to do one of them anyway for commercial reasons. They are not spending a cent, but they convinced the National Party that it was a special deal. The only one they have got is the $150 million in capital works for cheaper phone calls for the outer zones in rural areas.
The third prong is supposed to be coming. I suspect it is going to have something to do with online digital capacity. The minister abused us two weeks ago for suggesting it could be $26 billion. The $26 billion is to connect the last four per cent. I suspect his 
 next argument is going to be about how they get the $26 billion.
Telstra has told him that figure is based on everybody—whether the cable goes past, comes through microwave, comes off satellite or whatever—who has got a modem all choosing together to use full online capacity. The telephone exchanges of Australia would explode or collapse. I have no doubt that this is Telstra's view. To scare the minister initially, they are saying, `We have got to rework every telephone exchange in Australia—every piece of switching equipment, every little switching pillar at the end of the street—to give it the capacity just in case every Australian household switches on the Internet at the same time and goes for full capacity at 64 kilobits.'
We know that is ridiculous. It will not happen that everybody will switch it on together. But, even if they did, there is the capacity for 96 per cent of Australians to do it now. What would it cost Telstra to meet the demand of 96 per cent of Australians, who have the digital capacity available to them, if they all went out tomorrow and bought a modem and connected themselves to the Internet? We know that Telstra knows that is not going to happen. The entire marketplace is not going to stream out and buy a modem just like that to access the Internet at the same time. It is ridiculous to suggest it is going to cost $26 billion to get the last four per cent onto the Internet.
—$260,000 each, isn't it?
—Yes, something like that. Extraordinary figures. Telstra would love everybody to switch on, get a modem and get onto the Internet with 64 kilobits. Why? Because they will make an enormous quid out of it. It would boost the growth of Telstra's revenues enormously. That is where the biggest growth of all would be. They would say, `Even if it does cost billions of dollars, we will put the infrastructure in because, at a rapid rate, at 15 to 25 per cent return per year, we will get the money back. It will be a magnificent investment.' Telstra would not even blink at the idea if it meant that more and more people were switching on the 
 Internet at a very rapid rate and paying for the capacity to use Telstra's system.
We suspect that the last deal of Senator Boswell's three prongs has something to do with Internet or online capacity. We know that the minister has had to reshape himself, be a real chameleon on this—from abuse to us, only a matter of two or three weeks ago, he is now trying to readapt on the line that Telstra fed him to scare everybody.
I hope that the National Party, in their one last chance, did not have the hell scared out of them when Senator Alston and the Prime Minister said to them, probably in the last couple of days, `You can't have all of that. You can't have 64 kilobits. It is going to cost too much for Telstra.' I hope they did not fall for that. I hope that, whatever deal they have done, they actually had the wit to say that it is going to be in legislation and not on some two bob promise.
Unfortunately, they will be giving their vote away tonight and tomorrow without getting the deal consummated on which online services are going to be available to people in the bush. Another terrible decision by the National Party, and another reason why they are going to be devastated at the next federal election—all brought onto themselves.
Minister, I would like an answer as to how you got the figure of $26 billion. You interjected, `I don't understand.' I think I do understand what your answer is going to be, and it is still not sufficient. Since you are quoting from the Telstra submission to that review, why don't you table it by the time the debate rolls on through tomorrow? Table it in the Senate, either tonight or early tomorrow, so people can judge for themselves whether Telstra are either pulling your leg, trying to scare you, or trying to scare everybody else.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—I did not say that I was quoting from their submission; I said that I have not seen their submission.
—What are you quoting from?
—I do not know when you arrived, but about five minutes ago I said 
 that I got a briefing from Telstra on the matter. As I recall—
—No, your $26 billion—where are you getting it from?
—If you do not think a slide show from Telstra with specific information about likely costs constitutes information on which I can rely, then I will convey your view to Telstra. But I suspect it will not really affect their attitude. I simply say to Senator Schacht that it has always been made clear to me that, if you were to treat it as a mandated service, which is the essence of the standard telephone service, it would cost in that order.
—A mandated service?
—Yes. That is a very different proposition to simply digital data capability.
—Here we go again.
—I know it might be difficult, but it is essentially the difference between capability, which means you have an option to take it—
—That is dead right.
—and a mandated service in which you have no choice because it is provided as a matter of course.
—Senator Schacht, you have just spoken on this matter for 15 minutes.
—I will speak for another 15 minutes, in a moment.
—Please do not interrupt the answer. The decorum in this place at the moment is just appalling.
—Digital data capability is the basis for the ISDN arrangement that has been in place now for more than 12 months and towards which Telstra have been working assiduously. As I have said many times, they have now reached a point of 96 per cent capability. That tells you nothing about the proportion of households that actually have the service; that is simply those who could have the service if they chose to exercise that capability. That is a fundamentally different proposition from the standard telephone service which is required to be provided by Telstra to every Australian, within reason. 
 Currently, something like 97 per cent of households have the standard telephone service. If you were to treat a 65-kilobyte digital data capability as a mandated service—in other words, a minimum mandatory requirement—you would be talking about costs of that order.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-10,"—Considering that figure has been used several times in debates, in question time and so on, considering the minister has indicated how very important it is that ministers check their facts and get them right because they know that they will, to quote him, be sent to the cleaners if they do not get them right, and considering this is such an important and pivotal information piece which has been used in the argument, surely the minister would have asked for some basis to prove what these figures are all about. Surely he would have asked for some structure to that argument. Surely he would not just have relied on a sound and light show in a briefing. This has been used as a factor by the minister in arguments in debates and in question time. Surely the minister would have asked for the background to that figure. Surely there is some data, some basis, some argument, some paper, to back up that figure which has been given out as a fact by this minister.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I would like to seek some clarification from the minister. My understanding is that the $26 billion figure that you saw on the slide show—which is apparently the upper estimate; you mentioned the figure of $16 billion in relation to the lower estimate—applies to the mandated service of 64 kilobits per second to people's homes as opposed to the current capability program which is taking ISDN to the exchanges. Therefore, people have the capability, if they so choose, to subsequently connect themselves via ISDN to the exchange.
The point I want to make is that to connect a 64-kilobit line or an ISDN line from your home to the exchange is, in fact, quite a costly exercise in itself. I might be wrong here, but it is my understanding that, because of the nature of that connection and the physical infrastructure, Telstra charges it on 
 a per kilometre or distance based regime. In fact, the further you are away from the exchange the more the ISDN line will cost. This has great implications for rural and regional telecommunications users who wish to have a 64-kilobit connection with their local exchange. Presuming, in the first instance, that you live near one of the 96 per cent of exchanges that have that capability, you also need to connect yourself up. The further away from that exchange you live the greater the disadvantage you have because it will cost you more.
My question goes to this: to what degree of detail were the National Party—and, through them, their constituents—misled when you talked about a 64-kilobit capability? Was it clear to those people that we were not at the time talking about a mandated standard telecommunications service of this nature to their homes? Was it made explicit to those people that in fact we were not talking about a 64-kilobit service to their homes; we were only talking about upgrading the capability of the exchange to subsequently provide that service to those homes if, indeed, the person had the capacity to pay the connection cost?
I think these are pertinent questions, particularly in the context of the way the $26 billion figure has been used by Telstra, and certainly by the minister, in providing what they described as a `preposterous' notion to mandate a 64-kilobit service throughout the country. To actually mandate that level of service, apart from the costing analysis that Senator Schacht outlined, the discrepancies between rural and metropolitan areas are absolutely vast. Minister, it would be interesting if, while you are pursuing the answers to Senator Margetts's questions about more detail, you could provide us with a level of detail that would show those costings across metropolitan and rural Australia so that we can see what the split is in that regard. That way, those rural and regional members will actually have an idea of the sort of structural disadvantage they have in seeking equitable telecommunications services.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—The contributions by my colleagues Senator Margetts and Senator 
 Lundy made a point that I agree with strongly. I cannot recollect that, when the opposition raised this issue in the bill in March last year, we talked about mandating 64 kilobits. I cannot recollect ever making comments on the public record or even in private conversation about mandating. I always thought I was very careful—and I am sure I have been—to use the word `capability'. I have never argued that you should make it compulsory for someone to be connected to 64 kilobytes. You make sure the capacity is available and, if the consumer—whether they are domestic consumers, business people or farmers—want to connect, they know that at a reasonable time the capacity is there.
Senator Lundy has pointed out that if you are more than about seven kilometres from the telephone exchange in the bush you cannot get ISDN. You have a problem and you need some sort of arrangement booster or whatever, and that is costly. I do not know how many farmers are more than seven kilometres from a telephone exchange and would have that problem. I understand that there are about 100,000 farmers in Australia. I might be wrong; Senator Boswell might tell me.
—There are 125,000.
—There are 125,000 farmers.
—Farms, not farmers.
—Farms. Of those farms, a fair proportion—it may not be the majority—will be within the seven kilometres, but the majority, I suspect, will be beyond the seven kilometres. You only have to drive through any traditional wheat or cereal belt of Australia to see that most of those farms are more than seven kilometres from the telephone exchange.
I am not arguing that each of those farmers has mandated that they have to be connected to 64 kilobits. We want them to say that they understand the advantages for them in running their farming business and that they want access to the minimum of 64 kilobits. How do they go about getting it without Telstra saying, `Sorry, sport. You're more than seven kilometres from the telephone exchange. You 
 can't have it'? This is basically what they are being told now, and that is not good enough.
All I want in the universal service obligation and the review that is going on is a definition that says that you have the right to the capability. I do not even want it written down what exactly the price would be. I think there will be different prices. If you choose to be on a farm that is a bit further out from the telephone exchange than another and you buy the farm at a cheaper price, you might have to make a bit more of a contribution to the infrastructure. But what is happening now in the bush is that they just do not get it full stop. Telstra says no. They are the last four per cent.
No-one can convince me that it costs $26 billion to give those last four per cent—80,000 farms—that capability. That is why we think it is important that this review should have been available for this debate. It is around the wrong way. We are voting on the basis that this is a good deal for the bush. Some secret arrangement has been done. If when the report comes out it says, `Bad luck. We're not making any recommendation to even provide the capability,' the bill will have gone through and we will all be dead ducks. I suspect that the biggest dead duck of all will be the National Party for selling out.
—The Country Women's Association weren't very pleased either.
—I am very glad that Senator Margetts mentions the Country Women's Association. In the Telstra inquiry on this bill, they turned up at the hearing in Sydney and gave us a brief submission. They indicated in their brief letter that they were very gravely concerned about privatisation and what it would do to the continued reduction in services. I normally get on very well with Senator Patterson, the chair of the committee. However, she asked them whether they had read the bill. One woman had to say, `No. We actually haven't read the bill.' Senator Patterson said, `How can you criticise it if you haven't read the bill?' The problem was that, in the time scale this government gave us to deal with it, no-one had read the bill by that stage. No-one would have got 
 hold of it, be it the Country Women's Association or anybody else.
In their own very sincere way, the CWA gave overwhelming evidence of why they did not want Telstra sold. They wanted the services. They have seen the services decline. Even though some other people might say that the Country Women's Association is a traditional rural organisation of middle-aged and older women and so on who might not understand the Internet, they made it very clear that they wanted online broadband services in the bush for everybody and the capability to use it. Even today or yesterday they were on AM or PM radio indicating their still grave concerns about this bill. That is a classic rural organisation. I say in passing to Senator Boswell in particular that my mother was an office holder in the Country Women's Association.
—Where did you go wrong?
—Where did all the rest of you go wrong? I certainly have a respect for the role that country women have played for several decades. These women understand absolutely the need to have broadband online services in the bush.
—That is right.
—Senator Boswell says that that is right, yet he cannot give us the detail of the third prong of his deal. I suspect that it is about broadband services. We do not know what it is, yet we are expected to vote in this Senate on a wish, a promise and a prayer that an undisclosed deal will give all the members of the Country Women's Association and everybody else in the bush decent capability for 64 kilobits per second. From the way the minister has handled this, I am still pretty suspicious that the pea and thimble trick will be pulled and, in the end, it will not be there.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I want to ask a couple of questions about the customer service guarantee in respect of what was promised last time. As part of the debate for the sale of one-third of Telstra, Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy 
 and the Arts, made some very pertinent points in his contribution at that time. I raise these matters in respect of my state in particular, but I think they probably apply all around the country. The minister used Tasmania as a classic example. I will quote him:
Let me give you a classic example. Every capital city except Hobart—
has various things. He went on to say:
There is a world of difference between Tasmania and Victoria or New South Wales, where you are close to capital cities which have world-class telecommunications facilities, where there are enormous incentives by virtue of the population size for the carriers to keep on providing world best services. Those states and their citizens are immeasurably better off than those in a place like Tasmania where you are very lucky to even be able to make a phone call if you live in some parts of the west coast; even if you are in the capital city of that state you are very much a second-class telecommunications citizen.
It is that last part that I really want to go to because later in his contribution, which I will come to in a moment, he commented on the declining quality of service in remote parts of Australia for rural consumers, in particular. That paragraph concluded:
. . . even if you are in the capital city of that state you are very much a second-class telecommunications citizen.
That was reported ad infinitum following the deal that Senator Harradine did to give his vote to the government to support the one-third sale of Telstra. The Hobart Mercury  of 7 December 1996 stated:
A spokesman for the Communications and the Arts Minister, Senator Richard Alston, said the $58 million from the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund was for projects in addition to Telstra's corporate plan.
Fair enough, but if we were second-class citizens then, the government is asking us now to accept that their proposal for the sale of the remaining two-thirds will mean that these things will change.
I go to the report entitled Telstra: to sell or not to sell? Commitments were put forward by the government with regard to the customer service guarantee, but what has happened since? In the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee's 1998 report on the transition to 
 full private ownership, we find the same thing. On the one hand, $3,000 penalties were going to be applied for the non-provision of services, et cetera. However, the report did go on to mention that, ultimately, such penalties could only be applied through the courts. As I understand it, we are talking about $40 per day fines that will get paid to the customer, et cetera.
I would like to tell the minister for his benefit about a case in Launceston in Tasmania. This has just happened today, after we were supposed to have had some benefit from the $58 million RTIF. A small business set themselves up as an Internet service provider. I know that the minister is aware of this, or at least his office is, because this person contacted the minister's office. The small business wanted to put in place 100 lines and become an Internet service provider. Initially, they ordered 26 lines. They got a call from a Telstra officer who seemed to take great interest in the fact that they had ordered 26 lines. The events that followed went something along these lines.
The small business explained that they wanted to become an Internet service provider. They were told by this Telstra person that ISPs were now like video shops when they first opened—that is, they were everywhere, but soon the time would come when they would all be out of business and only the big players would be left. The small business went on to order 100 lines so they could provide the service. They were told that that was not possible but they could get 50. When the technician came out to put in the 50 lines—and he actually said he put 50 in—they only ended up with 30. The difference for their business amounts to some $600 per week. There has been no application of a $3,000 fine to them and no real step has been taken by Telstra. Being a small business, they probably do not have the revenue to chase the thing through the courts, so Telstra is not too worried about that, and we will get to their attitude again shortly.
That was only the start of their problem. Their microlink then mysteriously went off line. They phoned Telstra support in Melbourne—because that is where it now is; it 
 has been transferred out of Tasmania. Telstra support said, `It's got to be your equipment.' They said, `That's not possible because we've checked it all.' They had had it checked by Access One, which was evidently their carrier, and all was fine at their end. Their customers could dial locally and surf the local web pages, which showed that their equipment was fine. The next morning, the microlink suddenly started working again. After a short time, the same thing happened again. They contacted Telstra, which promised to get back to them before 5 p.m. Telstra did not ring back until after 9 p.m., when a technician said that he would come out to do the service but his hours were only between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m and there were huge after-hours fees. They were unwilling to pay those additional fees so they said no. But, mysteriously, the next morning the microlink came back on-line. That is without even getting a technician out there.
In December 1997, they made a decision to move from Access One to Telstra Internet and applied to become part of Big Pond, though they never signed the agreement. They then found themselves in the situation that Big Pond services were more expensive than another service called Vision Internet, so they phoned Big Pond and said, `We don't want to use you at all,' and they went back to using Vision as a carrier. That is, of course, when their real problems started to occur.
The current microlink number belonged to Access One, and Telstra needed to change it. Before they did that, however, they installed the new microlink and put things online, but nothing worked. After hours of frustration, they asked the technician to install the new number. Again, nothing worked. This is after they had had some months of successful work from their Internet service, albeit at less than 50 per cent of what they initially wanted.
They went on to check all of these problems out, and then they contacted Telstra again. The Telstra officer said that they could not be held liable because they have this law that covers them. This law allows them to reach a minimum set of standards, regardless of whether your network has failed due to their error. They are covered by a minimum 
 set of standards. That is what they said. No wonder people doubt, and no wonder we stand here and doubt, the commitment that you say you are going to give, that you are going to install through legislative means. Of course, this is all on the basis that Tasmania was supposed to get an extra $58 million. They were supposed to deliver services over and above what we had ever had before, but it does not seem to be working too well.
They did contact the minister's office, and something actually happened. I must say that, in part, the minister's office probably needs some congratulations for something happening. But I would ask the minister: on the basis of that example, and that is but one, how can we accept the guarantees with regard to the customer service obligations he says will exist, and this is with regard to only a partially privatised Telstra? How can we possibly even begin to accept that those things are not going to get worse under a fully privatised Telstra?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I thank the department for sending me today at my request the terms of reference of the review. I wanted to point out, Minister, quite clearly, as I understand it, that the review is actually talking about capability in its form rather than a mandated form. I stand to be corrected on this but the terms of reference, which are dated 30 April 1998, an instrument under your name, say in (1)(a):
. . . whether a carriage service that provides a digital data capability broadly comparable to that provided by a data channel with a data transmission speed of 64 kilobits per second supplied to end-users as part of the designated basic rate ISDN service should be specified, on and after 31 December 1998, in regulations made for the purposes of subsection 141(1) of the Act.
Subsection 141(1) of the act states:
(1)	 For the purposes of this Part, a prescribed carriage service is a carriage service specified in the regulations.
On page 128, the second dot point says:
The main object of the universal service regime is to ensure that all people in Australia, wherever they reside or carry on business, should have reasonable access, on an equitable basis, to:
(a)  standard telephone services; and
(b)  payphones; and 

(c)  prescribed carriage services.
Maybe your legal advisers will tell me I have got that wrong, but it seems to me that the phrase in the act `should have reasonable access' is not actually mandating 64 kilobits per second. If it is, I stand to be corrected on it.
It seems to me that, even if that was the way you could read it, the way your terms of reference lay out, I think the review does have the opportunity to look at the full range of whether it is access, whether it is mandated and so on. That is why I think it is even more important that this review should have been available before this legislation was finally voted on.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-07-10,"—I asked the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts some questions before with regard to customer service obligations. I raised the matters of the reports that were done and, of course, the government's comments, both of the minister and of the Prime Minister. On many occasions, the minister has said with regard to customer service obligations that they were tantamount to the initial one-third privatisation of Telstra, and yet we do not seem to be getting any answers with regard to but one example.
He has had plenty of other examples in more recent reports with regard to how Telstra has failed to deliver in terms of its customer service obligations. There have been reports that have said the customer service provisions of Telstra and telecommunications in this country have declined and are declining, not increasing. I would like to go back to some statements the minister made back in 1996 with regard to declining services. He said on 9 December 1996:
. . . I am not happy with consistent reports of declining quality of service.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. You have a motion before the chair. You have asked for an indication from the house of its intention on that. We went as far as to decide that it was at the point where we should proceed to the vote. I think the senator is out of order to continue to debate the motion.
—There is no point of order. I was trying to put the question, but the senator wanted to make a contribution. Please continue, Senator.
—If Senator Leadfoot—I mean, Lightfoot—had been listening, he would know that we come into the committee stage with a view to ask questions of the government about the legislation they intend passing. I was going to wait for the minister to get up and answer the questions that I had asked, and he did not. Therefore, I have got up again to remind him of the questions and also make some points with regard to what he said in 1996. He said:
. . . I am not happy with consistent reports of declining quality of service. Austel reports declining quality of service in rural areas. No-one seems to appreciate this. I heard a number of contributions to the effect that somehow things are not all that bad in the bush. Let me tell you what Austel said:
In general, the more remote parts of Australia have benefited last from the introduction of all types of new technology, and telecommunications has been no exception. Rural consumers in several parts of Australia have expressed concern that their services will not keep pace with improvements.
It is on that basis that I ask the minister again how we are expected to accept what you said then and what you have said now with regard to the customer service obligation—the obligation that you said would improve with the one-third sale, the obligation that you maintain will improve with a full sale, despite the fact that there have been even more recent reports that say that telecommunication services and the provision of them is declining. You have said nothing here tonight that would ease the concern of Australians with regard to the problems that confront them from time to time. You have said absolutely nothing.
I gave you an example in the city of Launceston in the `telecommunications backwater', as you referred to my state as being—the state that has the highest unemployment in the country—where people are trying to set themselves up in business under this service provider and cannot get service. I think the minister ought to at least have the decency to get to his feet and explain in plain English 
 exactly how he will enforce the sorts of criteria he says are in this legislation as an obligation to meet the customer service obligations. That is what you have to do, and I need to know that so I can determine how I will vote on this bill at the end of the day. These are the sorts of explanations, Minister, you have to give. It is my role to come in here and ask the questions; it is your role to answer them, so I hope you will get up and do that.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-10,"—I must say that I was intending to answer Senator Murphy, but I thought Senator Schacht was seeking the call first.
—I was seeking the call.
—You are a Johnny-come-lately. We are talking about what happened five to 10 minutes ago before you walked into the chamber.
—I was listening, though.
—Well, you may have been, but you were not seeking the call; Senator Schacht was.
—I was seeking the call then.
—But we are talking about five to 10 minutes ago. Senator Murphy's point was that I had not responded to his question, and my answer was that before you were in the chamber Senator Schacht was on his feet seeking the call, and I was deferring to him. That is why I have not responded, but I now propose to.
The answer to Senator Murphy's question is this: long before 1996 I have on many occasions complained about Telstra's quality of service as found in Austel's quarterly reports. It has never been a source of joy to me to find in areas outside the metropolitan areas that quality of service in terms of installation times and fault repair times had not only been declining but, in many instances, was well below what one would regard as a satisfactory performance level. I note that Senator Murphy has an open mind on this, and he is agonising about whether or not to support the bill before the chamber. I am 
 delighted to hear that at least one person on the other side is seriously prepared to consider his vote.
—You will have to be a lot more convincing than you are at the moment to persuade me.
—If he would like a special briefing at any time I am more than happy to provide it.
—How can you account for the decline?
—I have always regarded you as a lost cause, Senator Carr, but principally on the basis that you could not understand it even if I did explain it, whereas Senator Murphy at least seems to be interested in the subject.
The fact is that the customer service guarantee was something that we promised prior to the last election. It was a direct response to those concerns about declining quality of service. In other words, they pre-dated any privatisation of Telstra. The quality of service had been declining over a period of years completely prior to the privatisation of Telstra.
—I am talking about after the one-third.
—I am just telling you that this has been an endemic problem, totally unrelated to privatisation.
—You've got to be joking.
—You do not have to be too smart to work it out. If we were promising a customer service guarantee prior to the last election on the basis of declining levels of service, by definition that was before there was any privatisation.
—You sacked one-third of the company.
—Do you know when one-third of the company was sold? After the last election.
—You sacked a third of the company.
—I don't know how you could ever round up your own vote, Senator Carr, let alone persuade anyone else.
—I do it a lot better than you.
—I am delighted to see that the Centre Left faction is here tonight to lend Senator Schacht some support.
—Minister, will you please resume the subject matter? Senators on my left, will you cease interjecting?
—I was in the process of explaining that the customer service guarantee is in relation to the standard telephone service. So it does not relate to microlink or macrolink. It relates to the standard telephone service. It requires penalties to be paid when installations are not put in place on time or pursuant to agreements and when repairs are not carried out within specified time limits. I do not think the 3,000 figure that was mentioned ever found its way into law. If it did, it would have been by way of a proposition that was subsequently amended because the current maximum level of penalty that can be paid is $25,000. The rebate to which you are entitled for breach of the customer service guarantee is $11.65 for residential customers and $20 for businesses. We have recently announced that we propose to increase that to $40 per day for every day beyond five working days. What we have in mind is a system that will be increased to the point where Telstra are able to meet the performance levels that are determined.
—How much would that cost in a year? Is it $3 million a year or $5 million a year?
—I do not want them paying any fines, to be quite frank. I just want them to upgrade their service.
—It is much cheaper to pay the fine than employ people. That is the truth of it.
—You should be promoting employing people.
—That is precisely why we announced three months ago that they would be susceptible to a $10 million fine.
—Give us an example of a $10 million fine. No-one can give me one.
—Give you an example of one? No-one has been fined. We have only just announced it.
—Give us an example of systemic breaches.
—I will give you an example of one.
If you set a 90 per cent performance level and they consistently failed to meet that over a period, the scheme would be determined by the ACA. But let us say, for example, that you said for two consecutive quarters they failed to meet that standard—
—The ACA said so?
—They will give us the parameters of the scheme. They will tell us what is a reasonable performance level to set.
—Pigs will be flying before the ACA states the rate.
—There you are, bagging the ACA. You bag the ACA and ACCC. You hate Telstra with a passion. You will be criticising me next.
—Don't look around for support. They think you are a joke—a doormat.
—I am such a doormat that I seem to have rolled the National Party single-handedly, Senator O'Chee will be pleased to know. You cannot have it both ways. This is a killer doormat on the way you interpret it. What you have had me doing is walking roughshod over Telstra, pulling the wool over the National Party's eyes and blinding Tim Fischer with science. You cannot have it both ways.
—You are boasting about it now.
—You didn't ride roughshod over Telstra.
—They rolled me? Ha! Have a word with Frank Blount and see whether he agrees with that assessment. I suspect he will not. I think he will have a quite different view of the subject. Great man that he is—and he has made a great contribution to Australia—I do not think he shares your view on that subject.
—Tell him to come before the estimates and tell us that that is the case.
—He has better things to do with his time. Did you know that the board once had a look at a video of your performance in estimates? They were appalled. I had to tell them not to let anyone know when they went on the road show around the world, because if people had seen the performance of Senator Schacht at estimates the value of that company would have taken a big nosedive. I struck a deal with them. I said, `For God's sake, don't tell the rest of the world. We know here what a shocker he is, but keep it to yourselves.' And they did. That is about the only time I have been able to get Telstra to see it my way.
—You always say these things but you can never verify them.
—You will have to take my word for that. You can give Frank a ring if you do not believe me.
I will now answer Senator Murphy's question. He has picked out one sad little case history. I have great sympathy—
—No, not one sad little case. There are many. That is but one.
—There may be. There may be a million stories in the Naked City , I do not know, but you have trotted out one tonight. That situation may well lend itself to common law damages claims. Senator Schacht will give you chapter and verse about COT cases and how easy it is to recover damages for damage to business operations.
—Especially when you are dealing with a 600 pound gorilla.
—I will tell them that too.
—You started the phrase.
—Keep on abusing them. They love it.
—You started the phrase, Richard.
—It is actually an Americanism. I borrowed it from AT and T.
—A 600 pound gorilla. That is your phrase, not mine.
—It is a translation from America of a description of AT and T.
—But you applied it to Telstra.
—You are quite right; I did.
—Are you going to apologise?
—I thought it was quite graphic, but never mind. Why will things not get worse? I think I have explained to Senator Murphy that not only have they been bad for a period of years, well predating any proposal for privatisation, but also the way to remedy the situation is to impose performance standards to institute a customer service guarantee and to make sure that not just Telstra but all carriers measure up to their social responsibility. It is utterly unrelated to ownership. It is an obligation that the community requires, through the parliament, to be imposed on carriers. We are prepared to upgrade it as many times as is necessary to have them meet that standard, which they have told us they can meet. I have said in this chamber before, in reference to a press release of 31 March last—
—They might be telling you that but they are not meaning it.
—It is not a matter of telling me or taking my word for it. I am saying to you that our government is prepared to keep tightening the screws until those standards are met. It has nothing to do with who owns the place. It is a question of all carriers—not just Telstra—meeting minimum performance standards. In a competitive environment, at the end of the day you have a choice to go elsewhere. I suspect people will go elsewhere.
—But they have not. You said that in 1996 and they have not.
—That is why we introduced the customer service guarantee. It took effect from 1 January.
—Nothing has changed. It is actually getting worse.
—What do you propose? You would renationalise Telstra. You would 
 buy it back. I know that is Senator Carr's favourite proposition. You would put a lazy 14 bill on the table and buy it back. You would then get in there and run the business. You would make sure that the boys performed on time and you would have a well-run telecommunications carrier. That is dreamland. It has nothing to do with ownership. It has everything to do with putting standards in place. I very much hope that you will support us in our endeavours.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-10,"—Madam Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak on the preamble to this legislation. I think that Senator Alston has really misled the committee on a number of the matters that he has been canvassing tonight. I would just remind the committee of a situation which occurred earlier today, with Mr Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, being called in to 2UE. After a very embarrassing problem with the telephone link into the studio, which probably I would put on the Richter scale—
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. I can understand Senator Faulkner wanting to wander into the chamber with five minutes to go. But it cannot conceivably be relevant to any aspect of this bill, including the preamble, for Senator Faulkner to have a bit of a chat about Mr Fischer appearing on the John Laws  program. It cannot have anything to do with what is before the chair.
—There is no point of order.
—It is a point of order on relevance. How can you possibly say that talking about Mr Fischer on the John Laws  show has anything to do with the preamble to this bill?
—Madam Chair, on the point of order: it has everything to do with it. In the last two days, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Fischer, has taken over the job of the minister for communications; he has been making all the announcements on why Telstra should be fully privatised. This minister has been despatched to the outhouse. Mr Fischer has been let loose 
 to try to explain how the new mobile telephone system—which is part of the deal—is going to work, and how all the new cheaper phone calls in the outback for the bush are going to work. That is what I say on the point of order. It is completely relevant to talk about Mr Fischer because he has taken over the job of this hopeless minister and is explaining the policy.
—Order! There is no point of order.
—Thank you, Madam Chair. I know that Senator Alston finds these issues very embarrassing. But eventually, after the phone link had been re-established, I think Mr Fischer was trying to give further publicity to the announcement of a $150 million package to extend untimed local calls to some people in the bush. That is what it was. As I understand it, it is called `extended zones in remote Australia'.
The issue is—and this is something that Senator Alston has not been honest about—that Telstra, of course, can afford to do that anyway, without being sold, without being fully privatised. Why did not the National Party, as part of the coalition, as part of the Howard government for the past two years, insist to Senator Alston that it be done before now? We know that there is a promise, as I understand it, of a new analog-digital combination system, costing some $400 million. We have already had admissions from senior ministers in the government that that particular initiative, again, was not predicated on the Telstra sale. That is the information we know. It has been a hard grind getting it out of the government because you, Senator Alston, appear—
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I am trying to work out how this is predicated on the preamble. There has been no mention of the preamble in any of the 10 minutes to which we have been treated by Senator Faulkner. Maybe it might be appropriate that he try just once to address the preamble.
—I am aware that the debate this evening has been wide ranging, and I am sure that Senator Faulkner is addressing the preamble.
—You are being irrelevant.
—I do not accept Senator Ray's interjection in relation to irrelevance. I did make the point, Madam Chair, earlier in the night that the National Party will not stand up on these issues. It will not stand up for the bush. It will not stand up for regional and rural Australia. But the Labor Party will. This will be a very stark contrast in the election campaign.
The only way the Australian people will be able to keep Telstra in full public ownership is to vote Labor in the next election campaign. I have made that point on a number of occasions. I move:
That the committee report progress.
