Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:00):  My question is to the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. In an article entitled 'Confidence in Liberals lost over education reforms, say Catholics', The Australian reports that, in a meeting with the Catholic Education Commission, the minister was told:


'In the 50 years we have been dealing with governments, we have never had a government not engage with us on major changes to policy.'


Given the Catholic Education Office has labelled the minister as the worst in five decades—please pay attention, Minister; I am asking you a question—how can his colleagues have any confidence in him?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:00):  I thank Senator Farrell for his question, because I am confident that we will deliver fair, consistent, needs based school funding across Australia—that we will put in place the types of measures that the Labor Party commissioned. It was the Labor Party who went out and asked David Gonski and a panel to come up with a report talking about how it is we can fund all Australian schools fairly. It was the Labor Party who then received that report. But what did they do? They put in place 27 different special deals and special arrangements and so on.


What the Turnbull government have been seeking to do is make sure that we take additional funding, $18.6 billion of additional funding, that we invest it across Australian schools and that we do so in a manner fair and according to need, that has received endorsement from David Gonski himself, and that in doing that we provide the additional resources and support that children in schools of need across every education system—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Pause the clock. Point of order, Senator Farrell?




Senator Farrell:
  I asked a very specific question of the minister, and he has not answered it so far. The question, if I can repeat it, is: how can his colleagues have any confidence in him?



The PRESIDENT:  I think the minister was trying to demonstrate how they could have confidence in him. It is a very broad question, Senator Farrell. The minister is in order. 




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  As I was saying, there is additional resourcing for public schools of high need, additional resourcing for independent schools of high need and, yes, additional resourcing for Catholic schools—additional resourcing that will see Catholic school systems enjoy funding growth from $6.3 billion this year to $9.7 billion by 2027—a $3.4 billion increase in terms of what those schools receive—and will see their capacity to then invest that in the schools of need that they identify to ensure that those students and those schools receive the resourcing necessary so their students can excel and so they can get the excellent education that they deserve and that we are committed to ensuring they receive.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:04):  I am confident that we will see all members of the coalition vote to support a package that delivers fairness to all school systems across all states of Australia, because we are wanting to make sure we deliver something that provides for record and growing levels of funding into the future, and that that record and growing investment is distributed fairly, according to need, across those different systems and across those different schools. That is why it is a reform that has received significant endorsement—endorsement from many of the impartial stakeholders and endorsement from David Gonski himself. It is those endorsements and those commitments that demonstrate the fairness in this, as well as, of course, the additional investment that those school systems—the Catholic school systems in particular—will be able to continue to distribute across each of their schools to make sure that they have the support they need to deliver what their students deserve and what their families deserve.

They will see that they are getting the type of resourcing necessary to keep doing the outstanding things that so many Catholic systemic schools do and to keep doing more, with an increasing share of funding and with increasing funding ahead of inflation and ahead of wages growth that allows those schools to support their children to be their best—which, of course, is what everybody in this chamber should rightly want.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:07):  I thank Senator Hume for the very important question. Australian citizenship is a great privilege, and it is something that we should all value and not take for granted. The government's package of reforms to strengthen the test for Australian citizenship has widespread support, and includes some very important measures to ensure that people demonstrate integration into the Australian community and an understanding of Australian values of respect, equality and freedom. 


Unfortunately, to respond to Senator Hume's very important question, I think we are all now aware of alternative approaches to these very sensible reforms. Today, the Australian Labor Party and Mr Shorten, in typical fashion, have confirmed that they have caved to the left wing of the Australian Labor Party in a desperate effort to appeal to Greens voters. Through you, Mr President, Mr Shorten's extraordinary backflip in relation to the government citizenship changes shows that, quite frankly—through you, Mr President—he is a weak leader who is not able to put our national interest first. Who can recall that, but a few weeks ago, on 21 April 2017, Mr Shorten, when he heard about the changes, was initially supportive of them. In fact, he said:


… if there is a discussion about making sure that prospective citizens have got a reasonable grasp of English, well, that's fair enough.


He further went on to say:


If they want to have a discussion about waiting times before you become an Australian citizen, well we will hear the detail of that.  


The bad news is he then heard the detail about Mr Albanese and the fact that Mr Albanese wants to be the Leader of the Opposition. So it is quite clear that Mr Shorten has now backflipped to protect his own interests instead of putting the national interest first.

 (Victoria—Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cabinet) (15:02):  I have some further information from the Minister for Social Services for an answer that I provided to Senator Siewert yesterday. In question time yesterday Senator Siewert asked about the potential sites for the drug testing trial, referring to speculation in a story aired on A Current Affair on 15 June. I can inform the Senate that I am advised the government has not yet announced the locations of the trial sites. The selection of the sites will be carefully considered to ensure the trial is targeted at supporting regions with a high incidence of drug use and will be based on the best available evidence and data, including the AIHW's 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey, treatment availability, state and territory government crime statistics in relation to drug use and possession, administrative data from the Department of Human Services on jobseekers that identify drug dependency issues, and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission's 2017 National Wastewater Drug Monitoring Programreport. Wastewater analysis is widely applied internationally as a tool to measure and interpret drug use within national populations. The government recognises the benefits of wastewater analysis and has partnered with established scientific expertise within academic institutions through this program to build the evidence base on illicit drug use across Australia.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:03):  I appreciate that, Senator Payne, and I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


Colleagues, the question that I put to Senator Payne and the department is one of fundamental importance. I am not surprised that the Minister for Defence and her advisers have been so slow to respond, because the answer would have required facing up to some important truths: 72 years after more than 200,000 people were killed in the twin attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki it is still Australian government policy to endorse the threat and the use of nuclear weapons on civilian populations. 


My question to the minister went to precisely that matter—whether the Department of Defence was part of the reason why Australia is boycotting the most hopeful moves to a nuclear weapons ban that the world has seen in decades. I must admit that they have been slow to come up with an answer. It is in the Defence White Paper, and it has been there for years. It goes by the bloodless term 'extended nuclear deterrence'. That means, in practice, that if you commit indiscriminate mass murder on our population, collapse our economy, irradiate our food and fresh water and unleash a cancer epidemic that will overwhelm your health system—if you do that to us, we will do it to you. And we will do it with weapons a hundred or a thousand times the destructive yield of the ones that turned those wartime Japanese cities to ash. 


All of us here have lived under this obscene global suicide pact for our entire lives—so long that it has come to be seen as normal. It was a visceral truth in the global mass consciousness during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Everyone knew that in a very real sense a miscalculation or aggression by one side or both could kill tens of millions of people over the course of a few hours and leave the survivors to try and make it through the nuclear winter. The nuclear-armed states want us all to believe that this agreement will hold forever, until some imaginary future time when the weapons will be stood down. In the meantime we are meant to believe that the command and control structures will never fail; that these weapons will remain in the hands of rational state actors forever; that the leaders with executive control over this global suicide pact will be sensible, caring people; and that on no single day will a false alarm, slip-up, breakdown or act of malice loose one of these weapons and provoke an escalation. 


This is the definition of insanity. These weapons must be banned before they are used. Nobody is pretending that this will be easy, but nobody should imagine that it is impossible. The alternative, that one of these weapons is actually used, has been treated as unthinkable. Right now I invite the Senate to consider, to think, as our parents and grandparents used to think, about what happens if one of these weapons is used. What happens on the day that a 100-kilotonne bomb, roughly eight times the explosive yield of the bomb that flattened Hiroshima, is detonated over central Sydney? Everything and everyone between Balmain and Double Bay disappears under a radioactive fireball hotter than the sun. Out to a radius of five kilometres—say between Petersham and Mosman—the blast wave kills nearly everyone, most structures are torn apart, and anything flammable ignites. Out to 10 kilometres—say between Rockdale and Manly Beach, half the population dies of blast trauma or burns, and the remainder will be at the highest risk of radiation sickness from the neutron flash or the fission products that will soon begin to fall out. Out to at least 80 kilometres—the distance to Wollongong—depending on wind direction and the height of the blast, people begin to fall sick from acute radiation sickness. Children and the elderly, as always, are the hardest hit. Law enforcement, the health system and emergency services cease to exist. 


I have described one detonation over one familiar city. Hydrogen bombs a hundred times more powerful are deployed right now, at this moment, in the arsenals of the nine nuclear weapons states who hold this threat over everybody else. Colleagues, it may not be Sydney: it may be Karachi, St Petersburg, Seoul or New York. In a full-scale nuclear exchange, in which the hideous agreement of mutually assured destruction is realised, 100 million people die in first half-hour of our species' final war. This is how the World Health Organization describes the aftermath: 


It is obvious that no health service in any area of the world would be capable of dealing adequately with the hundreds of thousands of people seriously injured by blast, heat or radiation from even a single one-megaton bomb. Whatever remained of the medical services in the world could not alleviate the disaster in any significant way. To the immediate catastrophe must be added the long-term effects on the environment. Famine and diseases would be widespread, and social and economic systems would be totally disrupted. Therefore the only approach to the treatment of the health effects of nuclear explosions is primary prevention of such explosions.


With this horror front of mind the global disarmament community has spent decades organising mass mobilisations and building the political will to support diplomatic efforts around test bans, the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty and demobilising and disarming certain categories of weapons. I want to use this opportunity to acknowledge three generations of those organisers from all over the world—leaders and mentors like former senator Jo Valentine and also countless others who played their part in organising a global disarmament movement that reached from street demonstrations all the way to negotiating tables in Geneva and New York. 


Most recently, at the urging of organisations like the International Red Cross, fed up with 40 years of sandbagging and delay, the international community began the process of negotiating a formal ban on nuclear weapons. Australian diplomats, firstly under Prime Minister Abbott and then Prime Minister Turnbull, have spent three years trying to sabotage this process—or, as the DFAT spokesperson put to me in estimates, 'bringing balance to the agreement'. Having pulled a disastrous and counterproductive vote in the UN open-ended working group late last year that simply polarised international opinion against Australia, 130 governments resolved to draft such a treaty—and it shames me as an Australian to know that, with those talks underway right now, having failed to disrupt the process Australia is boycotting those talks.


These negotiations are underway now, and this is happening at long last. In a few days, in the absence of an Australian delegation, I intend to join them in New York to see firsthand what the global community can do when we join together in a common cause. Australians have played a major part in this process, even if not at a formal level. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, ICAN, was conceived in suburban Melbourne and is now a global network that has breathed new life into this movement, now in its third the generation, to stand down these genocidal weapons and to redeploy hundreds of billions of dollars into human security, health care, education and economic development. Think about a familiar place—think about your home town. Think about how you will feel on the day that one of these weapons is used before this ban is sealed and think about what you can do to make that ban happen with foresight and with wisdom rather than with regret.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-06-20,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:12):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to schools funding.


I have to declare a bit of an interest in the questions that were asked. I did start at a Catholic school, Saint Therese's at Colonel Light Gardens in South Australia, where I was taught by the very dedicated Dominican sisters. I then went on to be educated at Blackfriars college in Prospect, where I was taught by the Dominican fathers. I had three daughters who all went to Catholic schools—the older two went to Saint Raphael's School, an excellent school, in Parkside and then all three of them went on to study at Loreto College in Marryatville. As a parent, I was asked to join the board of Saint Raphael's School, so I believe I do have some firsthand knowledge of how the education system works in South Australia but more particularly how the Catholic education system works. I have a pretty good understanding of the dedication of the teachers in that system.


I do not say that this is limited to Catholic schools, but I have seen it firsthand in my own experience the hard work, sacrifice and dedication of parents who choose to send their children to Catholic schools, because of course there is a cost associated with that decision. We are lucky in Australia that we can get a choice of education through a variety of systems, and those parents who make that decision to send their children to the Catholic schools make a contribution to the cost. And I have seen, particularly for my own children, mostly the pretty hard work the students themselves make a commitment to.


But in particular I have seen just how the small Catholic schools work. Most of them run on the smell of an oily rag. These are not wealthy schools by any means. The teachers, the parents and the students are committed to the system. So I do find it rather dumbfounding that an education minister in this government, from my home state of South Australia, should choose to take the action he has taken in respect of the Catholic school system. Over the last few days in particular, but more broadly, I have had an opportunity to talk to some of the people from the Catholic education system in South Australia. And let me tell you what they are saying about what this minister intends to do to Catholic schools in his own state. They tell me that the cuts mean that in South Australia Catholic schools will get $9 million less in 2018 and $25 million less in 2019 than they would have done under the original Gonski model. In South Australia, Catholic Education says that affordability is already cited as the reason the majority of parents take their children out of the Catholic school system. They also say that any further reduction in revenue will place enormous pressure on the viability of small schools in low-SES areas.


What does that mean? Well, already in the Catholic school system in South Australia they offer fee reductions to up to 40 per cent of parents where those parents cannot afford to pay the full fees. So, what Minister Birmingham is doing is simply making that situation more difficult for all of those parents who make a commitment to their children's education. I have to say, I do not think this minister could go two rounds with a revolving door. He has let the people of South Australia— (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-06-20,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:18):  What a fine testament to the Catholic education system we see here in this chamber now: Senator Collins; Senator Farrell; our leader, Senator Brandis; my good self; and I do not know whether Senator Watt or Senator McAllister or Senator Smith—in that true spirit of openness I too have to declare that I started my schooling in 1955 with the Presentation nuns in Goomalling. I then went to the Mercy nuns in Bunbury. Deputy President, you will be interested to know that the very first school in Western Australia, in 1846, was run by a group of Mercy sisters who arrived in the heat of a January summer from Ireland. And do you know, within 20 days, using as desks the very packing cases in which they had brought their belongs from Ireland to Perth, they had started the first school for girls in Perth, including Aboriginal girls—the first Aboriginal girls educated in the then colonies. I then went on to the Marist Brothers in Bunbury and Aquinas College in Perth—for the Christian Brothers—and then, Senator Brandis would be interested to know, I spent a couple of years at Saint Leo's College, run by the Jesuits. In the room next to me was Mr Bob Katter, from the other place. That is not something that I normally publicise, but indeed he was.


I make those points too because I have observed in recent times in the interactions I have had with Minister Birmingham that he is a person who is well and truly across the issues associated with the education sector—higher education and indeed primary and secondary education, including in South Australia, which Senator Farrell has just commented upon.


One of the concerns expressed to me by the group in South Australia is the issue associated with disability funding. I can pick that one up right now, because in response to questions asked of Senator Birmingham he was able to say that over 10 years there will be $21.2 billion spent by this government—promised and actually able to be spent and not the Monopoly money that we know our political opponents throw around—which is an increase of 5.9 per cent. That is something that was of concern to them in South Australia.


Like Senator Farrell, I was on the school board of the Catholic school in Northam, when my children went to school. I went on to the Catholic Education Commission for a nine-year period only because the concept of co-responsibility came in. As a board member from a Catholic school in the bush I thought, 'How lovely. This will be the city schools trying to take money off the country schools,' and I jumped up and down so much that Dr Peter Tannock, than running Catholic Education in WA, and Mr Mike Beech, both said to me that the only way they could convince me as to what they were trying to do with co-responsibility was for me to come onto the commission. Indeed, as Senator Collins has just said, Dr Tannock himself was a co-colleague with Mr David Gonski in the original Gonski report. Where was the importance and where is the importance of the co-responsibility funding? Incidentally, it is a funding process—we call it the systemic process—that will be continued by the government, simply because it enables the system to be able to use funding from schools that are better off, either permanently or in any one year, to assist lower socioeconomic schools that may not be. The way the funding is organised in Western Australia at the moment every child in the system is a notional 103 points. I think more than 50 per cent of the children in schools above that 103 are supporting those in lower socioeconomic city, rural and regional schools. That is the absolute strength of our system. That is something—and this was stated in my discussions with Catholic Education officials and indeed in discussions I have had with Minister Birmingham—that has to be preserved, because it is the strength of the system.


I make the point that the cost of educating all children in Catholic schools in Australia is only 90 per cent of that of state schools. The capital cost of building the schools in Catholic circumstances is about 95 per cent. When a child goes into a state school, taxpayers have paid for that school. When a child goes into a Catholic school you can rest assured that the vast majority has been paid. In response to Senator Hinch, who, unfortunately, I think quite disparagingly said it was time for me to go, I can say to him that the best thing for the taxpayer is for more children to be in Catholic and independent schools.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:23):  On the same matter, I would like to thank Senator Back for raising the unique characteristics of the Australian education system and the special role that Catholic and other systemic schools have played for hundreds of years in Australian education—unique and needing to be preserved, unlike the changes that would occur under Gonski 2.0, which challenge their very capacity to continue to operate and produce the excellent outcomes that they have.


You saw today the revival of the school funding wars and the unfortunate sectarianism that has evolved—not only jokes about ghosts of the DLP but, equally, during the legislation inquiry on this bill we had Crikey describing me as defending Catholic schools from Gonski 2.0—a Greens and coalition tag team. In fact, I wonder whether Senator Bridget McKenzie is going to join the Greens with the way that she has been conducting herself during this debate. 


I too should declare that my children and I have been across all school sectors. Probably most Australian families have experience with government and non-government schools in our unique Australian education system. There is a role for all of them and they should be able to continue to operate without the attacks that we have seen in Gonski 2.0. 


I hope that Senator Back is right, but we did not hear much from the minister today giving any assurance as to what changes might be being contemplated. Indeed, all we have seen so far is probably best described by an article online in the Australian Financial Review by Phillip Coorey. It says:


Senator Birmingham left the door open for the compromise earlier on Tuesday morning when he said the government was working through 'technical issues'. 


He just describes them as minor technical issues. Those of us who understand these matters know that they are far more significant. That is why Senator Back has been prepared to take the risks that he has. Senator Birmingham remains upset at the Catholic sector, which faces a funding cut only because it was overfunded by Labor's Gonski model in order to reach a political deal. This is simply untrue. This is the misinformation that Senator Birmingham goes on to decry when he says:


There's a lot of misinformation that has been spread by vested interests— 


No, by him—


who are keen to get better deals, extract extra dollars during this process. What we want to see though is a final model that puts in place the type of principles that the Gonski report advocated for. 


Again, this is simply untrue. The Gonski report advocated exactly the arrangements that were put in place for Catholic systemic schools. They advocated that, until the SES model had been reviewed, they continue to operate with a system-weighted average. It advocated that we be very careful with the shape of the measure on capacity to contribute. But no, this minister, to make cuts, has unilaterally changed all of that without consultation, modelling and proper policy work. 


Even worse than that, I mentioned the correction that the associate secretary needed to make to the evidence provided to the Senate committee looking into this bill yesterday. Today, I look forward to seeing the minister's correction to the comments that he made today in answer to Senator Farrell, because he is simply wrong. Let me quote to you from an early Hansard what the minister said in question time today. He described the fine work the Catholic systemic schools do and purported that they should be able to continue to do so. What he went on to say is that they can keep doing more with an increased share of funding. Catholic systemic schools do not get an increased share of funding. Under the proposals in this bill, they get a cut in their share of funding. What everybody knows when they understand the figures here is that that is why their growth is so much less than the growth for private schools and less than the growth for government schools. That is why there is this cut in the share of funding for Catholic schools. The minister will need to come into this place and correct what he said on the record today because it is wrong. There is no increasing share of funding for Catholic schools. (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:29):  Mr President, I did not appreciate that you were going to come back into the chair. I thought that the Deputy President was going to be in the chair. I know, being a Lionel Richie fan, she would want to share with me in wishing a Lionel Richie a very happy 68th birthday. 




Senator Watt:
  Hello—




Senator SMITH:
  Hello—I am more of an easy man, Senator Watt. I am more of a Commodores man. 


In all seriousness, it has been quite revealing to hear the contributions from Senator Collins and Senator Farrell this afternoon. That is because Senator Collins has admitted that there is in fact growth happening in the Catholic education system, but, if you listened to Senator Farrell's contribution, you would have thought that there was no growth in the Catholic education system. It has been quite revealing. 


As a boy who went to a state school in a pretty tough part of Perth's northern suburbs it has been interesting for me to listen to people in this place sing the praises of Catholic education—interesting for two reasons. The first is that the Catholic education system in this country does deserve to be praised. The second is: but does it deserve to funded at the expense of other education systems in this country? Absolutely not. 


If Senator Farrell and Senator Collins want to take forward their arguments about the funding of education in this country, particularly the funding of the Catholic education system, then do you know where they should take them? It is not in here to the Senate, not to Senator Birmingham, but to the Catholic education system itself, because the Catholic education system retains the authority to fund Catholic schools. It is interesting that, in Senator Farrell's and Senator Collins's contributions, they did not talk about the $1.2 billion growth in the Catholic education system that will happen as a consequence of this government's education reforms. That is $1.2 billion over the next four years, and $3.4 billion over the next 10 years. There is growth in the Catholic education system, and Labor should at least be honest in admitting that. 


This is an important point. It has been lovely to hear people's lovely stories about their experiences with the Catholic education system. But many children in this country are educated in other systems, and the families of those children deserve to be supported and the school councils for those children deserve to be supported, and that is what this government is doing. What is needed now, and what we are providing, is a dispassionate view of the best way to fund education in our country—dispassionate because we are putting needs first and dispassionate because we are putting a focus on those values that are important.


We have heard everyone come in here and talk about their love for the Catholic education system because that is where they were raised and that is where their children were raised. Big deal. Many other children in this country deserve to have their schools funded properly as well. If someone wants to come into this place and argue that the Catholic education system is being defunded, then I want to hear about it, because in fact—and Senator Collins admitted this; you can see it in the Hansard—there is growth in the Catholic education system. If people are concerned about sectarianism and those sorts of things, I have a very, very simple answer: step back and approach this issue more dispassionately, because we do not want to get into a debate in this country about Catholic versus non-Catholic, or government versus non-government education. What we are interested in is how we best fund each student in each school.


Let me share this with you. I think a great virtue—and, Senator Watt, I hope you agree with me, putting the politics aside for a second—of education in this country over the last 10 or 20 years perhaps has been the growth in low-fee schools to give parents options about sending their children to government schools or non-government schools. Now, my parents would have loved the option of sending me to a low-fee school, but they did not exist when I was going to high school. I went to a state school, and Mr Stitt, Mr Ragan, Ms Kellow and Mr Stone were great teachers. It was an ordinary school in a tough part of Perth, but it was blessed with great teachers. 


I was blessed with parents that put value on education. I could go on and on about this, but—



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Smith. You cannot, because your time has expired.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:33):  I would have very happily listened to you go on and on, Senator Smith, for some time! But there will be other times for that. I also rise to take note of answers by Minister Birmingham to questions asked by a number of opposition senators today concerning the government's proposed arrangements for the funding of schools in Australia. 


Last night, I gave a short speech in the debate on the Medicare Guarantee Bill, and one of the points that I wished I had made—had I thought of it—was that, as well as being a great national institution, Medicare is a great symbol of what governments can do to bring us together as a community. By properly funding public health care that all Australians can receive no matter what their background, we are actually making sure that our community stays together. Similarly, the theme of my contribution today is that the proper and fair funding of all schools in our society is a very important way of making sure all people in our society get an opportunity and, therefore, we help to bring our community together.


Unfortunately, what we are seeing from the Turnbull government right now is not taking us in that direction. We know that their forebears, particularly in the Howard government, rejigged school funding arrangements to advantage wealthy private schools at the expense of public schools and poorer Catholic schools. That is to their eternal shame and it is one of the great contributors to rising inequality within our society today. It is a fact that children from wealthier backgrounds going to more privileged schools have had all sorts of opportunities arising from previous funding arrangements put in place by the then Howard government that in many respects continue to this day.


Of course, the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments attempted to correct this by changing our funding arrangements for schools again to ensure that some of the most disadvantage schools in our community actually got the proper support they needed and, more importantly, that the kids who attended those schools got the support they needed. We are actually seeing the benefits of that come through right now. One of the duty electorates that I represent is the electorate of Forde, which is on the southern outskirts of Brisbane in the Brisbane-Gold Coast corridor. There are many quite disadvantaged areas in the community. I know from personal experience that some of the schools have been using that funding to employ speech therapists and teacher aides to provide much more individualised education and support for children who really need that support in order to reach their own potential. These are the kinds of things that kids from wealthier backgrounds do not necessarily need, and that is what the purpose of this funding was.


Minister Birmingham and the Prime Minister want us to believe that their new funding arrangement is going to continue this sort of support; but, of course, they do not want to acknowledge that their very own policy documents state very clearly that they are going to be taking $22 billion out of the education funding system compare to what Labor in government had proposed to spend. We know that public schools will be worst affected by this; but also there has been significant debate in recent times about the impact on Catholic schools, which also disproportionately service poorer communities, disabled children and children in Indigenous communities, the very kids who most need federal government support and stand to lose most if this funding package get through.


I mentioned that our approach to schools and school funding should be something that binds our community together. But not only is the minister, with his stubborn approach on this funding arrangement, driving individual schools further apart; he is also driving school sectors apart. We have seen the Catholic Education Commission publicly criticise this minister in a way we have not seen for a very long time. In fact, they were reported today as saying that this minister's consultation is the worst they have seen in 50 years. So I guess that makes him an even worse education minister than Christopher Pyne, which is really saying something. The independent schools sector, having supported the government's arrangements up until this point, can see the writing on the wall, can see this minister backing away from his previous statements that he will not be cutting special deals.; and they have warned that they are going to walk away from this funding arrangement if the Catholic schools sector gets some sort of special arrangement from the minister.


So every single school sector is now expressing deep concern about this package. In addition to that, we all know that the minister is driving his own government apart with an increasing number of backbenchers coming out publicly expressing serious concerns and flagging the possibility that they will cross the floor and vote against this legislation. This is no surprise when the minister has been revealed to be providing to the crossbenchers, in order to gain their support, departmental modelling data that he will not even share with his own side of politics. This minister needs to come up with a fair funding arrangement rather than the unfair one he is proposing. (Time expired)

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:47):  I table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 will provide Australia' s national nuclear science and research agency, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, or ANSTO, the flexibility required to successfully establish an Innovation Precinct adjacent to its Lucas Heights campus in southern Sydney, and to potentially establish additional precincts in association with its other campuses. More broadly, the bill will facilitate enhanced collaboration between industry, universities, researchers and ANSTO across all its sites. 


Driving Australian innovation, and the Australian economy, through greater synergies between science and business is a key Government priority. As such, we want to give Australian industries every opportunity to collaborate, partner and engage with our world-leading research agencies and our universities, and remove any impediments that may limit the flexibility of organisations such as ANSTO in doing so. This is at the heart of the Government' s National Innovation and Science Agenda and the National Science Statement. 


Nationally and globally, nuclear science and technology is a major basis for innovation across a range of industries. ANSTO operates much of Australia' s landmark research infrastructure, including the OPAL multipurpose research reactor, the Australian Synchrotron, the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering and the Centre for Accelerator Science. This infrastructure places Australia at the forefront of innovation for the benefit of public health, the environment and industry, and is used by researchers and industry from around Australia and the world.


The proposed ANSTO Innovation Precinct will co-locate and crowd-in scientific partners, knowledge-intensive businesses, high-tech industry and science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine graduates, or STEMM graduates, around Australia' s centre of nuclear capabilities and expertise. The proposed ANSTO Innovation Precinct will have three major components – a Graduate Institute, an Innovation Incubator and a Technology Park. These three core components will enable ANSTO to act as a conduit between research, industry and universities. It will support the achievement of science, innovation and technology excellence, and foster research and industry linkages, technology development, commercialisation, entrepreneurship and STEMM education. These changes to ANSTO' s governing legislation support the vision of the ANSTO Innovation Precinct and enhanced collaboration.


This bill makes minor amendments to the ANSTO Act to provide flexibility around ANSTO' s ability to use its property or facilities for the purposes of an Innovation Precinct or for collaboration. This includes the use of ANSTO' s property to bring together start-ups, high-tech industry and university graduates to create synergies and cross-fertilisation of ideas and knowledge; and the flexibility to use its property to support a graduate institute, for example. 


The proposed Technology Park will crowd-in SMEs, high-tech industry and knowledge-intensive business, which will have the benefit of close access to ANSTO' s unique capabilities, nuclear applications and research infrastructure. Businesses that have already approached ANSTO regarding possible co-location include those in high-end medical manufacturing, next generation food production and 3D data capture. The bill also supports the establishment of an Innovation Incubator, which will be the first nuclear science and technology incubator in the world, and will become the home of knowledge exchange, commercialisation, innovation and entrepreneurship at ANSTO. 


The Graduate Institute will establish a more formal program of postgraduate training and development in partnership with universities. Through co-location with ANSTO and industry, the Graduate Institute will focus on deepening skills in translational research and the application of nuclear techniques for real-world problem solving. It will also foster cross-disciplinary work amongst the STEMM disciplines. The bill supports ANSTO using its knowledge, resources, property and expertise, for example, for the development of a Graduate Institute as part of an Innovation Precinct; and provides greater flexibility to allow for the potential construction of post-graduate accommodation and facilities, for example, which may not necessarily be undertaken on a commercial basis. 


The introduction of the bill also provides an opportunity to update and expand the constitutional limits provision in the ANSTO Act, to support ANSTO' s expanded functions.


Industry groups, universities, state and local government have all been actively engaged in the planning process for the ANSTO Innovation Precinct and are excited about the opportunities it will bring. This includes smart jobs, a boost to the local economy, industry experienced graduates and a drive in Australian innovation. On 14 June, I, like many of my parliamentary colleagues, attended the ANSTO-hosted breakfast event, which showcased the vision for the ANSTO Innovation Precinct and the vital role ANSTO plays in driving innovation and contributing to Australia' s economy. 


This bill will enhance ANSTO' s capacity to contribute to the creation of smart jobs and economic growth in Australia. It provides greater flexibility for ANSTO to fulfil its mandate to support and instigate innovation and research that will benefit the Australian community, industry and broader national objectives. As a Parliament, in passing this bill, we are providing ANSTO with every opportunity for the successful establishment of its proposed Innovation Precinct, and for others that may follow.


I commend this bill to the Chamber.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government fully supports World Refugee Day but cannot support this motion in its current form. It is disappointing that Labor would seek to politicise World Refugee Day in this way. It was this government that successfully delivered an additional intake of 12,000 Syrian and Iraqi refugees and the largest offshore humanitarian program in more than 30 years in 2015-16. The coalition government is increasing Australia's refugee intake in a compassionate and responsible way. The number of places available under the humanitarian program will rise to 18,750 in 2018-19.

  The Greens will be supporting this motion; however, we note that Australia's humanitarian intake should be raised to 50,000 annually, not 19,000 or 27,000. But as it is World Refugee Day I would be remiss if I did not point out that Labor, along with the Liberal and Nationals parties, continues to support the indefinite detention of refugees and people seeking asylum on Manus Island and Nauru. So, to the reasonable senators of the Labor Party: no, you might not be verbally defending these policies, but you keep voting for them, and every time you vote for them you endorse them. So, stop voting to endorse torture, stop voting to endorse offshore detention, stop voting for misery, look at what is happening around the world and start voting for the values you were elected on.

  The government has made significant improvements to the 1800RESPECT service to ensure that those calling the service receive appropriate support.

This change has also seen the average call wait time reduced from 10.3 minutes to the current average of 51 seconds. Importantly, these changes have allowed Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia to focus on what they do best: provide specialist trauma counselling to those people who need it while other calls, including calls for general information, are responded to by trained counsellors who have a minimum three-year degree in a related field and two years of counselling experience.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-06-20,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:13):  The Turnbull government's unfair budget that delivers tax handouts to multinationals and multimillionaires will hurt everyday Australian families. You do not need to have a poll to know that Malcolm Turnbull and his government are so out of touch with the Australian people—they are the most out of touch government we have seen in recent history. The Turnbull government's budget offers nothing positive to everyday Australian families. It puts big business and the big end of town before the Australian community. We all know that Mr Turnbull likes rich people, and this budget proves just how out of touch he is with everyday Australians' ambitions and the difficulties they have in balancing their weekly budgets. You have to ask yourself what sort of Prime Minister rips money out of our kids' schools and out of our health budget just to give the big end of town and millionaires their tax cuts.


At what cost is that? That leads me into the disaster that we have before us. We have seen evidence of that again today in this place, where the minister, Minister Birmingham, has a civil war going on in his own caucus, because he has been caught out not giving all the relevant information to his own caucus. Then he expects them to come into this place and support him and his proposition in the other place. We have seen numerous House of Reps members saying that they are not happy with this. We have had senators in this place coming out and saying that they may cross the floor. In the last week in this place Senator Back is threatening to cross the floor because this is flawed policy. It is unfair policy—that is what it is. We have also had Senator Eric Abetz, from my home state of Tasmania. Once again, he understands and values the education system, particularly what the Catholic education system does for our home state. It is very disappointing that Senator Bushby and Senator Duniam have chosen to be quiet on this and not speak up for Australian kids, and in particular for Tasmanian schools. It is just extraordinary that this minister has been referred to—I would like to quote—this is what the Australian Catholic education sector is saying about Senator Birmingham as a minister: 'He has been told that in the last 50 years we have been dealing with governments, we have never had a government not engaged with us on major changes to policy.' They actually referred to Minister Birmingham as the worst education minister. 


What is even more alarming is that it demonstrates how out of touch the Turnbull government is with what is happening in the Australian community and in our schools. Can I just remind people that under Mr Turnbull's policy 85 per cent of public schools will not reach their fair level of funding, even in 10 years. I have already spoken about it in this place, yesterday and last week, that unfortunately the Turnbull government does not even understand what the word 'fairness' means, because they have done nothing to demonstrate it in any of their budgets, going back to the Abbott government and through the Turnbull government—and who knows whether Abbott is going to come back or not—but they certainly have not delivered anything in the way of fairness to the Australian community.


The Catholic education sector has officially declared a loss of confidence in this government. They have already put on the public record and told the minister that they will campaign every day until the next election, because they will not forget the betrayal that this government has committed. It demonstrates again that this government takes different sectors of our community for granted.


Let's turn to another issue that has come out of this budget. That is the government's failure to stand up for some of the most vulnerable, lowest-paid workers in this country. It is now is some 10 days until 1 July, when Tasmanian and Australian workers will lose their penalty rates. We are talking about people working in the hospitality industry, some retail sectors, hairdressers—the list goes on. We know that under the criteria of this government there is no sector, including the aged care sector, that is off limits for taking away penalty rates for carers and nurses working in that sector, because aged care workers and nurses are not considered to be essential services.


This is very serious. We know that in Tasmania alone, from 1 July, there are going to be some 40,000 Tasmanians who will lose up to $77 a week from their take-home pay. I have attended committee hearings and heard firsthand, because I talked to people in the community. They are devastated that this government has allowed this to happen. This government has ample opportunity. In the House of Representatives they could have voted for the legislation that the opposition, with Mr Shorten, introduced to protect Australian workers from these cuts to penalty rates. But they have failed to do that.


We will see the impact from this roll out into the community and to small businesses. Those on the other side always speak up to say they are the only ones in this place who understand what small business is about, but small businesses are the ones who are going to lose out, because people on very low wages—the people who rely on penalty rates to pay their mortgage, to put food on the table and to support their children through school excursions et cetera—are the ones who spend all their money every single pay. It is not the millionaires. They are not the ones who keep the local economy and small businesses on the move—not at all.


Yesterday, this government, when moving their legislation to make changes to Medicare, had the opportunity, through the amendments I moved, to withdraw it, come back to the drawing board and then come back and give real guarantees for the funding of Medicare and to give real funding to our hospitals. What did they do? They voted against it.


We know, as the Australian people know, that this crowd sitting on the government benches promised so much before the last election. They promised things they could never deliver and they have broken that promise to the Australian people, because they have made cuts to schools.


This minister has bungled any reforms. If he had just stuck with Gonski. The sector and the government and opposition in the past all had an agreement that we would roll out Gonski. But what did these people do? They turned their back on it. Now they have not only the Catholic education sector but also the private schools—the sandstone buildings of Melbourne and Sydney and the prestigious school Friends' in Tasmania, which I am sure Senator Bushby will understand—not getting an increase in their funding. They take away from the state schools in Tasmania and give more funding to Friends'. That is what these people are supporting. So you can never use 'Turnbull government' and 'fairness' in the one sentence.


Not only has the minister been misleading this chamber but he has also been misleading the Australian community. The minister cannot even come to the table with accurate data and give his own caucus a full briefing. That is why you have the situation with Senator Abetz and Senator Back. And I know that Senator Seselja will not be feeling too comfortable, either, because he will have to go out and face the Catholic schools in his community here in the ACT. From the contact I have had with the Catholic Education Commission in my state of Tasmania, I know that they will not rest until they get their funding. After all, the Catholic education system in this country educates one in five Australian children, and most of the time in rural and regional areas, the most disadvantaged areas. In some remote areas it is the only school available to Australian kids.


Our kids come first for us on this side of the chamber. We will fight this every day until the next election. We will fight with the sector to get fair funding for the education sector in this country. (Time expired)

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (16:23):  We have done more than any other government to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax. I want to go back to basics. I think low tax is good and lower taxes are even better. I think small government is good and smaller government is even better. I think freedom is good and more freedom is even better. When it comes to the history of the world and of Australia, when the four horsemen of the apocalypse come, which they surely will, we are going to be divided into two camps: those who believe in freedom and those who do not; those who believe in giving people the liberty to look after themselves and those who want to chain them up through the regulations of government.


It is disappointing that we have this modern Labor Party who like spending—throwing away—other people's money like drunken, horny sailors on shore leave, compared with the pious, sensible Liberal-Nationals government, who believe in spending people's money sensibly, in ensuring that taxes are as low as possible and that services are delivered properly. We believe that lower taxes are good, because that gives the man, the woman or the kids earning money the right to decide how they spend their money. But we do believe that multinationals, corporations, should pay their fair share of tax. We believe that society operates better when people pay their fair share of tax. But we also believe that government should manage that money well, because it is not government's money; it is the money of the people who worked for it. It is not the money of Canberra, not the money of this Dubai-esque four-star Hilton that masquerades as our national parliament sometimes; it is the money of the taxpayers of Australia. It is the money of those who are on their tractor at the moment, listening—poor souls!—in Queensland, to this. It is the money of those who are in their trucks driving around Queensland. It is the money of people at home who are trying to have a nap in the winter sun but have been interrupted by this puerile debate that has been brought on by a puerile Labor Party.


Here we have a Labor Party who look at themselves in the mirror and get a bit of a fright and then move on, because they refuse to look at history. They refuse to look at how they have run this country when they have accidentally won an election, when they have got into power. What they do is they destroy the economy. And I will give you a lesson in history, although I am sure you already know this. Let's talk about the Scullin government of 1929 to 1931. They got into power and then drove Australia into not just a recession but a depression. So, we had to get the Tories—my side—the United Australia Party, along with the Country Party, to get into office and clean up Labor's mess. The same thing happened in 1949, when Labor, under the soft velvet hand of the communists, wanted to nationalise Australia's banking industry. It took a reformed Liberal Party of Australia and a Country Party to win the 1949 election and stay in power for a record 23 years and provide this country with record economic growth.


And then we had the Whitlam experiment. Gough Whitlam danced into office like a fairy on steroids and spent money—wanted to borrow money from the Ba'athist party in Iraq because they had run out of money to steal from Australia or borrow from Australia. So they went to Iraq, of all places, and knocked on someone's door and said: 'How about it? Give us the money.' That sums up the Labor Party: let's go to Iraq and borrow money. It took Mr Fraser, in the 1975 election, to get the Liberal Party—and I think by then the National Country Party—to win that election and clean up Australia again.


Then there was Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, who won in 1983. It took them 13 years, because they were slow learners, to drive the Australian economy into dust. We had the recession that we had to have. We had interest rates that went through the roof. And we had Paul Keating, who racked up $96 billion of taxpayers' money as federal government debt. Mr Howard came in with the right attitude, and Mr Fisher and the Liberal-National government, and they cleaned up Labor's mess once again. They made sure they dealt with taxes. They made sure companies paid their fair share. They looked after the families of Australia.


And when Mr Howard was asked by the people of Australia to choose a nice font for his CV, in 2007, and Labor came in under that paradigm of economic responsibility—Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard and the other members of that circus—what did they do? They were like drunken kids on a tractor, just having so much fun, hooning around the paddock, spending all these people's money, having a ball of a time. These people had never had a real job. They had gone to university, been a student union activist, got a job in a union office, got a job in a lawyer's office. And we do not talk about what happened to former Prime Minister Gillard and that lawyers' office, do we? The lawyers get involved, because of the lawyers' fight in the lawyers' office.


And they have racked up hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. They once again have taken the Australian economy to the brink. So it is up to the Liberal-National Party—because history repeats itself—to come in and clean up Labor's mess. We have said: 'Righto, we're going to clean up the mess again. Off you go, Labor people. You have trashed the Australian economy. We'll come in here and clean it up.' We're the ones who will make sure we look after the money that comes in from the taxpayer. We on this side of the chamber are the sensible party. We understand that, while there should be taxes, they should be low. Those taxes are there to pay for public services. But we will not spend money that we do not have. We will get this debt down, we will get this deficit down, because we are cleaning up Labor's mess. (Time expired)

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-06-20,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:30):  If it were Friday afternoon, you could be forgiven for thinking we had had a claret run in this place. Then again, I suppose it is good to let off some steam. While we are having some fun, perhaps we can play our own version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? My first question is: which big parties in this 45th Parliament voted for a tax cut for millionaires? I will give everybody five seconds to think about it. Which two big parties in this parliament voted for a tax cut for millionaires?



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  You are right, Senator Polley; it was the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. Not long ago we had the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill, one of the first bills that passed through this Senate, which gave a tax cut to everyone in this country on an income above $87,000. So it is fascinating that we have this debating topic today, put up by the Labor Party—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I will call out hypocrisy when I see it, Senator Polley; no doubt you are working very hard to cover up for that. But let us not forget. Let's go to question 2 of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?Which party fought really hard and publicly opposed the most significant legislation we have seen tackling multinational tax avoidance, 'the Marles laws'? That was in the 44th Parliament, to add a degree of difficulty to the question. Which big party opposed the most significant legislation this parliament has seen on multinational tax avoidance?



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Yes, you are correct, Senator Dastyari; it was the Labor Party. In fact, not only did they oppose the laws which increased tax transparency in this country; Senator Dastyari put up billboards in Sydney saying that the Greens voted down tax transparency in the Australian parliament. Every chance we get we ask the ATO at estimates—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—





Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Are you doing a war dance, Senator Dastyari? I cannot hear exactly what you are saying.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Leyonhjelm
):  Order! To the chair, please.



Senator Dastyari interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Dastyari!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I have obviously hit a raw nerve. Senator Dastyari seems very agitated. The Greens took carriage of that bill, as we did for the tax transparency bills, and we opposed the tax cuts for millionaires in this parliament for the simple reason that we know we have rising inequality in this country. We as a parliament owe it to the Australian people, to those who are less well-off in this country, to at every chance call out inequality, and legislation that adds to inequality, and do everything we possibly can to combat that. That is why my party, the Greens, has taken a consistent stance to always oppose tax cuts for millionaires, as we will for any future legislation.


We have also put up some very positive policy solutions to raise revenue—none less so than this week in which this parliament, which I never would have thought possible even six months ago, passed legislation taxing the big banks. That is right. We have gone to the big end of town, some of the most profitable banks in the world, to raise billions of dollars to pay for schools and hospitals. We know the track record of this Liberal government in the last four years has been zombie cuts targeted at the most vulnerable in this country—pensioners, students, the unemployed, the sick and the elderly. Well, we managed to get money off the big banks.


But guess who are throwing mud every chance they get at taking money off the big banks? It is the last question on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Yes, it is the Labor Party again. They are throwing mud at the first opportunity that I have seen in my time in parliament to get legislation up and put in place to take money off big, powerful corporations—$5 billion to $6 billion to help pay for schools and hospitals. So if we are going to be consistent today let's not forget that the Greens are in this parliament and in the Senate to hold big politics to account when they get in bed with big business.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-06-20,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:35):  You have to hand it to Senator Whish-Wilson. He is perhaps the only Green I have ever seen who could take a motion with the terms 'the Turnbull government's unfair budget that delivers tax handouts for multinationals and millionaires while hurting every Australian family' and turn it into a soliloquy—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  You wrote it—




Senator DASTYARI:
  I am sorry that English is my second language, Senator Whish-Wilson! You keep going on about this! That was in jest. I withdraw any inference there. I think Senator Whish-Wilson understands that that was in jest.


But to turn a topic like that into a love letter to this government is just disappointing. I get what is going on here. It is obvious. It is the mating dance. It is the mating ritual that is going on at the moment between the government and the Greens. This happens every time we get to the end of a session. All of a sudden Senator Whish-Wilson starts attacking the Labor Party. That is what he does. Then he starts laying the groundwork. Now we know that Senator Hanson-Young and others are in negotiations at the moment about doing an education deal with the government. They have done it before. It happens at the end of every session. There is nothing that the Greens seem to like more than a dirty deal done dirt cheap late with the government. It happens all the time. That is fine. We see this happen at the end of every session.


Let's be clear: the Labor Party voted for the MAAL. But before that we did everything we could to make sure it was going to be a stronger piece of legislation. What we said at the time—and I stand by this—was that it was a bad deal. We had all the cards for those who wanted very strong action taken on international and multinational tax minimisation and tax avoidance. There had been a crossbench coalition of many parties working together, and the Greens had been part of that. All of it came through inquiries, one of which the Greens had a huge role in. I have consistently acknowledged the previous Greens leader, Senator Milne, who was very, very strong on this and actually brought the issue to my attention and to the attention of many other senators over a number of years. At the end of it, there is nothing better for the Greens political party than to snap defeat from the jaws of victory. They did it once again, and they will perhaps do it again on the issue of education. That is really a matter for them. I understand that they are in a position now where they are holding more meetings than the Liberal Party are these days, and the best of luck to them.


The issue at hand is that there is at the moment a fiscal issue when it comes to where we are going to raise revenue and what we are going to spend it on. We had Senator McGrath before using motherhood statements like, 'We believe that people should be paying their fair share of tax.' Everybody agrees with that principle. The debate in this chamber is: what is fair? Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Leyonhjelm and the libertarians have consistently said that people should be paying their fair share of tax. Now, I believe that the libertarian perspective and perhaps my perspective on what is fair for different people to pay is wholly different, though I note that Senator Leyonhjelm's position is increasingly becoming more and more like mine as time goes by. 




Senator Smith:
  It's the ageing process!




Senator DASTYARI:
  I note that as Acting Deputy President, Senator Leyonhjelm, you cannot comment in a debate or interject! When you reach a debt of half a trillion dollars but are still too weak on taxing multinationals, saying, 'We are going to have $65 billion'—$65 billion!—'in tax cuts for big business', while, at the same time not funding education to the extent it needs to be funded, then you have a government that is lost, a government that has its priorities mixed up and a government that has lost touch in governing for all Australians. It should not come as a surprise. Here we are on the Tuesday of the last week of sitting for this session. We are about to go off for a seven-week break, and those of us sitting here on this side of the chamber are not even clear what the government's position on school funding is going to be 24 hours from now. Why? Because the government itself has no idea. 


Let's be clear: in politics, within parties and in the Senate there is always negotiation, and nothing is settled until it is settled. What the government is facing at the moment is not a question of what they have to negotiate with other parties on for the passage of legislation; it is what they have to negotiate with themselves on to actually have a position that is going to be passable. At 5 o'clock today we will be saying goodbye to Senator Back. Formal speeches will be made about his contribution, which I think has been a considerable one in his time in the Australian Senate. I understand that there will be an opportunity to say a few words about him then. But Senator Back came out this week and made it very clear that he has issues with the education policy as it has been structured. Senator Abetz, and Mr Andrews and Mr Abbott in the other place, and others have raised their concerns repeatedly. Why? Because they are highlighting what is their fundamental problem when it comes to priorities.


There are principles that we all agree on, and the facts are these: budgets are about priorities, and governments have to make decisions with limited finite resources. What this motion is saying is that if you accept that as the basic principle then why is it that the actions that are being taken on multinational tax minimisation are still so weak? I have said before that I believe the government has done some good things in this area. I think we are in a better position now because of some of those measures than had we not done them. I believe a lot of that happened because the government was dragged kicking and screaming to that position, but there has been some good legislation. Do I believe it goes far enough? No. Do I believe there is a lot more that can be done? Yes. There is a lot more that can be done. But to turn around and look at giving tax cuts to big business at the same time as having a debate about how you are going to fund schools and not put on the table the resources that are needed to properly fund our schools shows a complete lack of direction and judgement. When it is the government's own members—the government's own backbench—who are raising and highlighting these concerns, it shows how lost and out of touch the government is.


Tax office data from 2014-15 shows that one in three large firms in Australia pay no tax—one in three. That includes 109 companies that pay no tax despite reporting more than $1 billion in total income. Let's be clear: you only pay tax on profit. Those companies have claimed that they have not made a profit. There are companies, including big companies, that have good years and bad years. There are big companies that occasionally do not make a profit and legitimately have a reason to pay no tax. When you see numbers as large as this, the concern is that there are companies—and we know this happens; we have seen evidence of this happening—who are gaming the system and creating a pretence in their books through accounting tricks and strategies. Many of these practices are legal, but some are dubious and some are—I think the term used in the industry is—'sharp practices', where companies give the pretence of not being profitable or where they appear on paper as not being profitable for the sole purpose of minimising their tax obligations. Many companies have done this. We have had Senate report after Senate report and inquiry after inquiry, including one large inquiry with many, many hearings, that has exposed this. Frankly, all the measures that have been taken have not been enough. The government's priorities are wrong, and the government has lost direction.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-06-20,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:46):  I commiserate with you, Mr Acting Deputy President Leyonhjelm, having to sit there silently in the chair while Senator Dastyari verbals you in a most egregious and defamatory way for having moved positions on issues of economic freedom towards Senator Dastyari. I am pleased to be able to exonerate you of such crimes, Chair. As far as I am aware, you have not done so, and I would certainly be alarmed to learn if it were the case. I hope it is never the case. 


No issue better highlights the economic illiteracy of the Australian Labor Party than the issue of taxation, and this motion before us today moved by Senator Dastyari is yet more evidence of it. On what economic planet does a tax cut which returns money earned by people back to those same people constitute a handout? On what planet is it a handout to allow people to keep their own money? There are two initiatives of the Turnbull government that have returned money earned by individuals and companies back to them. I want to talk about why those are important and positive initiatives and why they do not constitute in any way or in any form a handout. 


A handout is a gift by government of someone's money to someone else in society. For example, if the government were to provide a bailout or assistance to industry in the form of a subsidy that would be a fair description of a handout. What is not a handout is the taking of a little bit less tax than you used to take from someone the previous financial year, and the Turnbull government has done this in two ways. The Turnbull government has ensured that the temporary budget deficit levy enacted in the 2014 budget has come to an end, as it was scheduled to come to an end after two financial years, having collected extra revenue for the government. It means that an income earner earning more than $180,000 a year will go from a tax rate, including the Medicare levy, of 49½ per cent to 47½ per cent. On what planet is allowing people to keep only 47½ per cent of their income over $180,000 a handout? On what planet is confiscating nearly half of someone's income a handout? It is a strange place, indeed, if you seriously think that is a handout. My view is that it is a very good thing that that levy has come to an end, and I hope it is the first of many more reductions in personal income tax rates for all income tax earners at all levels, because the truth is that Australian individuals are relatively highly taxed by world standards. We are relatively highly taxed in our region. We are relatively highly taxed among our competitors. When looking at our top income rate, we are, believe it or not, even relatively highly taxed compared to the OECD, which has been described not by me but by others as a club of high taxing countries. So that is indeed quite an achievement. 


The other way in which the Turnbull government is returning to taxpayers money that they have earned is through the enterprise tax plan, which reduces the tax rate to 27½ per cent for small- and medium-sized businesses with revenues of up to $50 million. It means that, instead of the government taking 30 per cent of the profit that companies make and spending it, the government will now take only 27½ per cent. That, in any plain language understanding of English, does not constitute a handout in any way, shape or form. It is a very important initiative because, as we know, there will be significant economic benefits that will flow from that. Companies, knowing that they will receive a lower rate of tax on their profits in the future, can have confidence today that the investments they make will earn them better returns than they would have earned otherwise. They can have confidence today that they will have the capacity to invest in their businesses by employing more people today, and we know the economic benefits that will flow from that. 


But you do not have to take my word for it, as I have said in these sorts of debates before, because, happily and helpfully, we have extensive comments on the public record from the Labor Party themselves. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, and the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, have been extensive in their praise of the idea of tax cuts, including for companies. I will cite just two examples, although there are dozens and I have cited them before in these sorts of debates. It was in the House of Representatives on 23 August 2011 that Bill Shorten said:


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


Amen, Mr Shorten. You were absolutely spot-on, then, and you would be spot-on today if you had upheld that position. His colleague the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, said:


… it's a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investments, creates jobs and drives growth.


I could not have put it better myself. I could not have put it more eloquently myself. Chris Bowen is absolutely right to say that all those benefits will flow from reducing the company tax rate. Unfortunately, it seems that the Australian Labor Party have been caught by the siren's song of Corbynism, the economics of Bernie Sanders and perhaps the Australian Greens, and have gone to the populist far Left on these issues and are now railing against the things they once believed in and advocated in this very place.


Most important, though—and I think it goes to the heart of Senator Dastyari's motion today—is the suggestion that, in some way, tax cuts for businesses and individuals do not benefit families. Nothing could be further from the truth. Families benefit more than anyone else from a competitive company tax rate that ensures that companies have the incentive and the certainty to invest and to employ more people. No-one benefits more than families from a reduced income tax burden that will make it easier for them to balance the household budget. If we are really concerned about the cost-of-living pressures facing Australian families, if we are really concerned about their ability to make ends meet, then the best thing we can do is give them back their money which they earned through their own hard work. That is the best thing we could do to help them afford all the many pressures they have in their family household budgets.


Finally, I want to turn to the issue of so-called multinational tax avoidance that Senator Dastyari and others have talked about this debate. Firstly, let us start with some economic theory and talk about why it would be that a company would choose, if it were able to, to try and avoid paying tax in Australia. Of course, the government has a number of tough measures to ensure that there are no legal means of doing so. But what are the economic reasons why a company would seek to place its profits elsewhere in the world? 


They would do so if they were able to get a better return on their investment elsewhere in the world. In a modern, capitalist economy, where so much of the benefit derived from a company's innovation is in the form of intellectual property, and that intellectual property can be based anywhere in the world, it makes sense that companies will choose to base their intellectual property in countries which have lower rates of company income tax because that ensures that they get a better return on the investment for that intellectual property. They are acting in the interests of their shareholders when they do so because it is their obligation to return the best investment to their shareholders. 


So, if we really want to ensure that companies are booking more of their profits within Australia, that their taxes are being paid in Australia, the best thing we can do is ensure that our company tax rate is internationally competitive. While ever it is the case that there are like jurisdictions that offer secure property rights and competitive tax rates—Ireland is one such example—that are far lower than Australia's, then there will be an economic incentive for companies to try and move their profits elsewhere. We could ensure that that was not the case by further lowering our own company tax rates here in Australia. 


One person who is not an economic illiterate is my great colleague and friend from Western Australia Senator Back. I will not be contributing to the valedictory debate later on, so I take the opportunity now to say what a pleasure it has been and what an honour it has been to serve with him for just a little bit over a year, and how sorry I am to see that he is retiring. We would have loved to continue having his company and his service here in the Senate. He has been a distinguished servant of the people of Western Australia. He has been a dedicated member of this Senate, he has upheld its traditions in the proudest way and he is a great Liberal, and I have been very proud to serve with him.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:55):  This matter of public importance is blaming the Turnbull government for the unfair budget that delivers tax handouts for multinationals and millionaires while hurting everyday Australian families. They do not need a budget for this to hurt everyday Australian families. I find it very hypocritical that Labor are actually blaming the government for this because I remember that, when I spoke in the other chamber in 1996 about multinationals not paying their fair share of tax, I was basically looked down upon, laughed at and ridiculed. If I recall correctly, it had been years under Labor—the Hawke government and the Keating government—and 1996 was the year when the Howard government took over.


I do not believe it just comes down to what is in the budget and looking after the multinationals. I think it goes further than that, right across the board in government legislation. I actually had a meeting today with a gentleman from Queensland. His name is Kane Booth. He is a farmer, he has a wife and he has two children. Actually, Mr Booth is in the chamber. Welcome. Mr Booth has an issue with government which is all about the fact he has a property at Chinchilla—he has 1,100 acres—that has been taken over by coal seam gas mining.


We actually have to look at this. This gentleman, for seven years, has been fighting this. It is about the multinationals. Labor talks about multinationals, and here you have APA Group, who own the gas piping on Mr Booth's property. APA Group have most of the gas pipes and are the most profitable gas company. But APA group have donated $10,492 to the Labor Party. It is the Labor Party in Queensland—the state government—who are not doing anything about Mr Booth's problem, which is an environmental problem. Mr Booth has gone to the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection to put in a complaint. They have investigated, but they have not brought down their report after 10 months. It has been 10 months, and they are still waiting. It should have been brought down, under legislation, within 40 days. Why are they shutting it down? So we do not need to really look at the budget here.


There is another thing I must tell this chamber and the people of Australia. They know what I am talking about, because the people of Australia have been very angry about the multinationals and what is happening in our country: the sale of our land, foreign ownership and the question of the gas off the North West Shelf. We are getting nothing from it, and we are paying dearly for it because of the multinationals and what is happening in Australia. Also, a small number of petroleum companies in Australia donated $300,000 to the Labor Party. Should I also mention Sam Dastyari and his $5,000 for legal expenses or his $1,600 for travel expenses?


Both sides of politics need to clean up their act to what the public expects. There is a pub test here. To Mr Booth and his family, I will continue to fight for your right to have justice and for those many other Australians, especially around Chinchilla. Because of the coal seam gas and the state government allowing for these wells to be put in, I have seen children with their noses running with blood and black under their eyes. They are sick, and no-one is taking responsibility for this. We cannot allow multinationals to take over our country and have control of it and have their tax benefits and cuts and not be paying taxes in this country. I would like to finish by saying that this is not just the Turnbull government's problem. It is the problem of both sides of this parliament. It is the Liberals', the Labor Party's and the Nationals' problem, for consecutive years, for not reining in and making the multinationals pay their fair share of tax.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-06-20,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:59):  I rise to speak in this matter of public importance debate to wholeheartedly condemn the Turnbull government's unfair budget, which delivers tax handouts for multinationals and millionaires while hurting every Australian family. The facts do not lie. In this budget, every worker who earns more than $21,000 a year will pay more tax, and at the same time millionaires will receive a tax cut of over $16,000 a year. Multinational businesses have been let off the hook. In this budget, workers in receipt of the minimum wage face a tax increase of at least $170 a year. Teachers, nurses and many small-business people face a tax increase of over $300 a year. The premise of the budget is quite simple: reduce taxes on the rich and increase taxes on the lower and middle-income earners—at the same time as wages are now falling in real terms.


What is truly remarkable with this budget is that it actually goes one step further. The budget locks in a wage cut for 700,000 of Australia's lowest-paid workers—workers who give up valuable time on the weekends, late at night, early in the morning and on public holidays. These workers face losing hundreds of dollars a year in wage cuts, and in some cases thousands, and they are facing a tax increase to boot. And the Prime Minister and those opposite have the gall to talk about cost of living pressures as an excuse for their inaction on Australia's energy crisis. What is clear is that the Australian people are watching, and for the 14th poll in a row the Turnbull government trails the Labor opposition on a two-party preferred basis. This budget is completely out of step with Australian values and completely out of step with what Australians want.


Turning to some specifics about my home state of Tasmania now, we have the Mercy hospital deal, which hands back the hospital to the Tasmanian government and locks in a reduced rate of Commonwealth funding over the coming years. It sets the Tasmanian government up to rely on the stock market to meet the funding gap over the coming years. The funding package that the Tasmanian Liberal senators are so confident about is supposed to last for 10 years, when in fact this money will last that long only under a high-return and low-inflation scenario. So, if the Tasmanian government is unable to achieve a high return, or if the cost to the hospital services continues to rise at a rate above the budget inflation rate, then the Turnbull government appears to be expecting the Tasmanian government to just foot the bill. Who knows what the Turnbull government's plans are if the Tasmanian government's investors lose money on their investments. It might have been a nice announcement for the Prime Minister to make, but we are watching the progress of this deal with detail. Relying on the stock market to fund a vital hospital service might be innovative but it is definitely risky, and it is no wonder the Tasmanian Premier did not bother to attend the announcement. It just gets worse with health—with over 8,000 people in north-west Tasmania saying they will skip going to a GP because of cost, yet the Turnbull government's budget fails to drop the Medicare freeze immediately.


For our schools and TAFEs, this budget locks in a cut of $85 million from Tasmanian schools and millions of dollars of cuts to TAFE and training programs. This is leaving thousands of Tasmanians behind and leaving Tasmanian industry without the skilled workforce that it needs. Tax cuts for millionaires and multinationals will not grow jobs in Tasmania. What Tasmania needs is strong growth, strong economics, strong investments in education and training, and support for industry to grow. Yet there is no money for the Cradle Mountain Master Plan, with the Turnbull government continuing with a pointless feasibility, when Deloitte Access Economics have already completed one which shows that the project would create around 140 jobs and $29 million worth of investment. It is the No. 1 project for the Tasmanian tourism industry, yet the Turnbull government has failed to give it due attention in its budget. It is a budget based on a strange set of ideologies. It fails the Australian people. It is clear—very clear—that the Turnbull government have prioritised millionaires and multinationals over Australian families yet again.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (18:14):  I will conclude my comments on this crucial and urgent bill amending the Australian Passports Act—the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Bill 2017. Last Wednesday morning, I was privileged to sit in the roped-off guest section in the other place to watch the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, introduce the changes—my changes—to the passport act which will take passports off all convicted paedophiles on the child-sex offender register and curtail the perverts going on child-rape holidays in South-East Asia. 


I want to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the Minister for Justice, Michael Keenan; and the Prime Minister and his office for allowing me to participate in the drafting of this legislation and for the speed with which it has come before this chamber. I know that in this town the wheels of justice can sometimes grind exceedingly slowly. I also want to thank the Australian Federal Police for their input about this disgusting trade, which has stained Australia's reputation throughout South-East Asia for decades. We will get our good reputation back, because this is the first country in the world to impose such travel restrictions. I have already had preliminary discussions with the foreign minister about approaching her counterparts in New Zealand, in Canada and in the UK—and I have debated it on the BBC—and maybe even in the USA, where they have had a national public register of convicted sex offenders for more than 20 years.


This is just a start. As I mentioned earlier, the government is working with me on more-protective laws for our most vulnerable here at home, for the spring session of parliament. I also say thanks to the Nick Xenophon Team. Because of them we now have Carly's law, aimed at internet stalkers. As I speak, I know that there are deviants right here in Australia using their credit cards and Skype for real-time sex crimes. I was given evidence today of an Australian paedophile in Australia hiring a baby from her mother in the Philippines for less than $100 for his real-time gratification on Skype, and that baby was three months old.


I will be working closely in the months ahead with a group called IJM Australia, International Justice Mission Australia, to fight what they called cybersex trafficking in our region. I know that the Xenophon team, through Senator Kakoschke-Moore, has an amendment to cover cybersex traffickers. Going forward, I will happily work with her on all of this, and with the government.


Finally, I stand here tonight a very proud man. I am very proud of you all, in both houses, for rescuing hundreds and thousands of children from a truly evil and depraved culture. Thank you.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (18:16):  I rise to speak on the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Bill 2017. The Nick Xenophon Team supports this bill, which responds to increasing community concern about Australian convicted child sex offenders travelling overseas to sexually abuse vulnerable children in countries where the law enforcement framework is weaker and the activities of offenders are not monitored. That community concern is justified. We must never be complacent where the innocence, safety and exploitation of children are at stake. I acknowledge Senator Derryn Hinch's contribution to the genesis of this bill, and his strong advocacy for the measures contained in it.


This bill will amend the Australian Passports Act and the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act so that, upon request by a competent authority as defined in the Passports Act, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be required to refuse to issue or required to cancel an Australian passport, or demand the surrender of a foreign travel document, where an Australian citizen is on a state or territory child sex offender register with reporting obligations. The decision to refuse to issue or the decision to cancel a passport will be mandatory and not subject to administrative review following a request by the competent authority—namely, a state or territory court, sex offender registry or police.


This bill will also amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to make it a Commonwealth offence for a registered child sex offender with reporting obligations to travel or attempt to travel overseas without permission from a relevant authority. The new offence is crucial and complementary to the passport measures. The new offence ensures that child sex offenders can be prosecuted, should they try to evade the passport measures.


The bill also amends the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act by inserting new law enforcement grounds for a competent authority to request the minister to order the surrender of a foreign travel document because the person is an Australian citizen. This is intended to prevent Australian dual nationals from travelling overseas on foreign passports to sexually exploit or sexually abuse vulnerable children in overseas countries. 


There are about 20,000 registered sex offenders in Australia who, having served their sentence, are subject to supervision and reporting obligations because they remain a risk to the community and innocent children. Approximately 2,500 child sex offenders are added to the list each year. The passport measures introduced under this bill will apply to the existing cohort of registered child sex offenders with reporting obligations, and they will also apply to future child sex offenders registered annually. The Nick Xenophon Team remains satisfied that, if there are compelling reasons such as bereavement, offenders with reporting obligations will be able to obtain permission from authorities to travel overseas.


The Nick Xenophon Team will always fight to protect vulnerable children who are the victims of terrible abuse. Convicted child sex offenders must be stopped from fuelling the child sex trafficking trade, which flourishes overseas. The statistics are alarming, with more than 770 Australian registered child sex offenders travelling overseas in 2016. Alarmingly, a third of them violated an obligation to notify police of their intention to travel. Under existing laws, a failure to report intended overseas travel or to comply with other obligations can result in up to two years imprisonment. However, the penalties handed down by the courts are generally warnings or small fines which provide little incentive to comply. This is completely unacceptable and clearly ineffective. These offenders have a high propensity to re-offend in countries where they are not monitored and where child sexual exploitation is rampant.


Registered child sex offenders are subject to reporting obligations in Australia specifically because of their ongoing risk to children. This bill will address current deficiencies and will prevent Australian registered child sex offenders with reporting obligations with the measures I have outlined. Once their reporting obligations have concluded, offenders will be able to apply for a passport in the usual way. While the Nick Xenophon Team supports the bill, we are concerned about the unintended consequences of the measures fuelling cybersex trafficking, which is why I will be moving amendments to the Criminal Code to tighten existing sections of the code to prevent these unintended consequences emerging. I will move those amendments during the committee stage.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:21):  I would like to thank all senators for their contribution to this debate on this bill, which will combat the sexual exploitation of vulnerable children overseas by Australian child sex offenders. In particular I would like to commend Senator Hinch for his dedicated contribution to this debate over many years. I also thank the senators from the Nick Xenophon Team for their proposed amendments to the bill. We appreciate your shared concerns in ensuring that vulnerable children are protected from the dangers posed by child sex offenders. However, the government would like to consider those proposed amendments in further detail to ensure that they function with the existing provisions. We will progress this as part of the package of child sex offender reforms being progressed for the spring sittings.


This bill reflects the seriousness with which the government is addressing child sex tourism. These tough new measures send a strong message to child sex offenders that they cannot use overseas travel to sexually exploit and abuse children. Such abhorrent crimes will not be tolerated. The risk posed to vulnerable children overseas by Australian child sex offenders is utterly and completely unacceptable. There is currently no effective mechanism to stop Australian child sex offenders from travelling overseas to countries with weaker law enforcement frameworks where their activities are not monitored.


The measures are intended to capture all Australian registered child sex offenders with current reporting obligations. When an offender's reporting obligations end, they can apply for a passport as usual. This is necessary and appropriate because registered child sex offenders are subject to reporting obligations in Australia specifically because of their ongoing risk to children.


For these measures to be effective in stopping child sex offenders from travelling overseas to commit horrific acts against children, it is essential that passport decisions are mandatory and not subject to merits review following a competent authority request for passport denial. Unless these tough new laws are introduced, Australian child sex offenders will continue to travel overseas and be in a position to commit those offences. These laws will make Australia world leader in protecting vulnerable children from child sex tourism, and I urge senators to support this legislation as a matter of urgency.


Question agreed to.

In Australian households and workplaces paedophiles are paying to direct the live sexual abuse of children located anywhere in the world. I will let that sink in for a moment: Australians are paying for children in developing countries such as the Philippines to be sexually and physically abused for their gratification while they sit in their homes watching and directing the abuse. Sadly, this despicable act is not being committed by just a few. The crime is known as cybersex trafficking—a form of trafficking that is transnational and involves offenders in Australia who commission the abuse of children in developing countries on a pay-per-view basis.


Cybersex trafficking is much more common than people may think. According to the International Justice Mission, the annual number of tips to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children rose from 4,560 in 1998 to 76,584 in 2006. In 2015, that figure ballooned to 4.4 million. Australian law enforcement agencies are well aware of the prevalence of this crime and are doing what they can to combat it. They face significant hurdles given that this crime is transnational and they must work with international authorities and laws.


The unintended consequence of the bill before us was highlighted in The Sydney Morning Herald on 3 June 2017 in a piece by Lindsay Murdoch entitled 'Children as young as two rescued from Philippines cybersex abuse dens'. The article states:


Detective-Inspector Rouse said more cases of child cybersex are being uncovered because of the increasing capabilities of law enforcement agencies, including in tracing financial transactions.


""We are detecting it more because we are looking for it more,"" he said, adding that Australians have been known to be involved in the online sexual exploitation of children for almost a decade.


Asked whether the involvement of Australians was growing, Detective-Inspector Rouse said ""it is already quite an established market"".


The International Justice Mission (IJM) helped rescue 201 children who were forced to participate in online sexual exploitation between 2011 to May 2017.


More than half of the victims were under 12 and 70 per cent involved parents, relatives or close family friends of the victims.


I pause again to let that sink in: parents are sexually exploiting their children for the gratification of Australians. The article continues:


Evelyn Pingul, IJM's director of communications in the Philippines, said the alarm needs to be sounded that online sexual exploitation of children has become an epidemic in the Philippines.


""We need the police to continue rescuing these children, we need the prosecution to continue convicting more sick criminals,"" she said.


IJM's National Director Samson Inocencio called for law enforcement agencies to be given more resources ""to fight this horrific crime against children"".


One such resource is the ability of Australian law to capture this type of behaviour so that it can be successfully prosecuted and offenders properly analysed. Not only is IJM carrying out life-saving work on the ground in South-East Asia; IJM director of corporate and legal, Kimberly Randle, has also identify the gap in the law which exists here. Despite the number of instances of cybersex trafficking in Australia, the Criminal Code does not adequately address the specific nature of this crime. Prosecutions of cybersex trafficking occur under sections 474.26, 474.27, 272.8 and 272.9 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. According to I JM, sentences for these offences have tended to be significantly lower than hands-on offences and do not currently reflect the fact that the sexual exploitation of the victim is being conducted in real time. The offences of sexual intercourse or activity with a child outside Australia were intended to capture Australians travelling overseas and engaging in sexual intercourse in person. In the case of cybersex trafficking, the physical abuse inflicted on children occurs overseas but is commissioned, directed and paid for by a perpetrator in Australia. That is why I have moved an amendment to these sections of the code which will make it abundantly clear that a person committing an offence under these sections does so when they are out in the presence of the child by means of communication that allows the person to see or hear the child. In other words, committing the offence virtually should make them no less culpable.


It is important to note that in two recent cases of cyber sex trafficking the defendants pleaded guilty. Had they pleaded not guilty, and the Criminal Code in its current form been tested in its ability to capture their online pay-per-view crimes, then they may have gotten away with their dreadful acts. In the much-publicised case of Bryan Beattie it has been reported that he was charged with cyber sex trafficking, but as this does not exist, what he did plead guilty to was 21 counts of causing a child under 16 to have sexual intercourse outside Australia in the presence of himself, as well as other charges. The offences occurred between 2012 and 2014 and involved his paying amounts ranging from $12 to $540 to watch 17 children being sexually assaulted in the Philippines via Skype. These children were between the ages of eight and 15. He also gave instructions on the type of abuse he wanted to see. Beattie was sentenced in March 2017 to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment, but he will be eligible for parole in February 2021.


Kyle Dawson pleaded guilty to offences of procuring a child to engage in sexual activity outside Australia as well as child abuse material offences. He paid approximately $60 to watch the abuse of children in the Philippines via Skype. His victims were girls aged about six, 10 and 12 and a boy who was about eight. He recorded the sessions to view at a later date and possibly to share. His defence counsel said he had an addiction to child sexual abuse material. The AFP, who arrested Dawson, examined his computer, were able to trace the location from where the live streaming was taking place and provided the information to police in the Philippines. IJM assisted in the Philippines in arranging a sting operation where the offender was captured. The offender was the aunt of some of the victims. The total sentence was five years of imprisonment with a two year non-parole period.


In another recent case Queenslander Stephen James Sheriff started sending money to the mother of two girls, the youngest aged 10, residing in the Philippines. The mother sent sexually explicit images to Sheriff, and he was convicted of soliciting and accessing child exploitative material. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment but was ordered to be released forthwith upon paying a $500 fine and being of good behaviour for three years. One has to wonder how that is a deterrent.


I have been told of cases involving babies, multiple children present at one time who are forced to abuse each other, and other situations that can only be considered torture. It is for this reason that I will move, through my amendment, to expand the types of aggravating factors in section 272.10. The new factors that will be considered aggravating factors include where the child is, or reasonably appears to be, under 10 years of age. This is designed to capture offences committed against very young children, such as those who are three or four, quite clearly under the age of 10, because it recognises it may be difficult for law enforcement agencies to obtain birth certificates to confirm the exact age of a victim.


The aggravated offences will also include where more than one person is watching the abuse being committed against the child. This recognises that often paedophile networks are involved in the abuse of children. The aggravating factors will also include where an act of torture, cruelty or degrading treatment is done to the child while the underlying offence is being committed. This is necessary, because I have heard of cases involving babies having hot wax dripped on them in the course of the offence. Where a person pays a fee or reward for the abuse to be perpetrated against the child, this will also be considered an aggravating factor. Not all abuse against a child is paid for, but this amendment recognises that, where a fee or reward is paid, profit is essentially being derived as a result of a child being abused.


I will also move amendments which relate to the obligation of internet service providers and content hosts to report to the AFP if they become aware that the service provided can be used to access child exploitation material and pornography. Currently the maximum penalty for this offence is equivalent to $18,000. As it currently stands the offence does not specify particular information required to be reported, such as IP addresses or personal details of the subscriber. Accordingly, the proposed amendments to sections 474.25 include the specific information to be provided to the AFP and an increase in the penalty units for noncompliance with their request. It is the case that cyber sex criminals are utilising the infrastructure of telcos to commit their crimes. I believe it is therefore incumbent upon—and even a social duty for—those telcos to ensure that they do everything in their power to assist the AFP in tracking, identifying and building a case, through the online footprint captured by the ISPs, against people using their service to offend.


The amendments will seek clarity for ISPs about the type of information they need to provide and, for avoidance of any doubt, about how vital the provision of this information to the AFP is; the penalty for noncompliance has increased. There is no excuse for allowing this activity to go on under our noses. Our law enforcement agencies should be armed with everything they need in order to do their job without the hardship of a Criminal Code that has not kept up with the online environment for ISPs who may not see this as a priority.


In conclusion, my amendments plug a gap in the Commonwealth Criminal Code that is expected to be exploited even further once passports of registered sex offenders are stripped. While the government's bill to stop registered child sex offenders from travelling overseas to commit despicable crimes is supported by the NXT, the unintended consequences of the increase of exploitation crimes being committed from Australian lounge rooms instead, as I have just described, should be dealt with now. The fact that the abuse is happening virtually should be no barrier to a predator being charged and prosecuted, yet the law as it stands does not make it clear that a person need only be in the virtual presence of a child. The crime might be virtual, but the children are being sexually abused in the real world. And in our world, I believe it is our duty as lawmakers to ensure that Australian laws adequately protect children no matter where in the world they live. Thank you, and I commend the amendments to the Senate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:36):  I certainly agree with Senator Kakoschke-Moore that it is our job to ensure that our laws protect children, wherever they are in the world. However, while the government supports in principle what these amendments are trying to achieve, we need to undertake the necessary due diligence, examine any possible unintended consequences and consult with our law enforcement agencies and industry. We have only just received these amendments, and we are not prepared to make a judgement on the spot, given the potential for the unintended consequence of weakening existing child sex offences.


As outlined in the second reading speech, the Minister for Justice will be proceeding with a further tranche of reforms to strengthen our child sex offender laws in the spring sitting. In the drafting of this upcoming bill the government gives an undertaking that we will consider these amendments that have been put forward. Our government has a strong track record on protecting children from child sex offenders. It was just last week that the Senate passed the protecting minors online bill, which will target online predators who are preparing or planning to cause harm to procure or engage in sexual activity with a child. But we will not allow the strengthening of child sex tourism laws to be delayed any further, not with two registered child sex offenders travelling overseas every single day. This bill must be passed today. We thank the Nick Xenophon Team for their continued support in this area, but the government is not in a position to support these amendments today until we undertake the necessary due diligence.

 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:38):  It is with a certain amount of regret that I, on behalf of the Australian Greens, am unable to support these amendments either, but certainly we do support the intent. The Australian Greens will be supporting this bill, and I do want to acknowledge the work of Senator Derryn Hinch for bringing this matter before us tonight and also the passion and commitment with which Senator Kakoschke-Moore has stated her case and that of the Nick Xenophon Team—and indeed everyone in the chamber tonight. It is one of those issues, when I first became aware that the government had brought this bill forward, where you wonder why this is not already part of Australian domestic law. So, I do acknowledge that the government has brought it forward, and I look forward to committing the bill to the chamber.


Through no fault of Senator Kakoschke-Moore—because the government flipped around the order of business tonight rather rapidly and without warning—we have had less than an hour to assess the amendments that have been brought forward by the Nick Xenophon Team. We are very happy to work with crossbenchers, the government and the opposition to assess these amendments, which are far reaching. Having just heard the harrowing case that was put by Senator Kakoschke-Moore on the horrors that have been perpetrated against very young children here and around the world, anything this parliament can do to make it harder for people to do these horrifying things to young children anywhere in the world, we should do. Whether these things are being carried out on Australian shores or overseas or they are enabled by the internet, it should not be possible for this to take place, and it should certainly not be possible for it to fall through a legal loophole. We do not think that child sex offenders should benefit from ambiguities, if they exist, around the information that ISPs must provide to authorities relating to offences.


So it is through no fault with the intention of what you have brought forward; it is simply that, having only had such a brief time to consider this amendment, we are unable to support it at this time, but we are willing to work with anybody of good intent and goodwill to bring an amendment, or indeed a bill, whether it be a private senator's bill or a government bill, forward to close these loopholes as they exist. We look forward to that being committed to the chamber.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:41):  Can I indicate that I make these remarks in the spirit of this debate, where there is enormous goodwill in the chamber to pass an important piece of legislation necessary to protect children. I commend unreservedly the work of Senator Hinch in relation to this. I also commend the way in which the government has acted and the spirit in which the opposition and my crossbench colleagues have dealt with this.


In relation to this specific amendment from Senator Kakoschke-Moore, this is something that was raised by the International Justice Mission Australia. It is something that has long been advocated by them in terms of reform, that the act of cybersex trafficking falls within the definition of trafficking under the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking of persons, especially women and children, to which Australia is a party. They have said—and I think they have been saying this for quite some time—that section 270 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code needs to be updated to include cybersex trafficking and the application to child victims. Given the harrowing example given by my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore, the enormous sympathy that the government has for this particular amendment, the fact that the International Justice Mission of Australia—among others—have said we need to sort this out and that we have been a party to this protocol for some time, my question to the government is—and, again, I say this with absolute goodwill and in the spirit in which this legislation is being dealt with by the chamber—can the minister indicate whether the government is broadly supportive of and committed to changing the law to cover the sorts of circumstances dealt with in this amendment by the end of this year?

We will look to pursue those amendments in the context of the further reform in this area that we intend to bring forward in the spring session. The justice minister is already working on a further tranche of reforms to strengthen our child sex offender laws in the spring sittings and, subject to the due diligence indicating that there are no unintended consequences from the amendments that have been put forward, it would be our expectation to proceed along those lines.

Can we be advised that, in states and territories where sex offender registries capture offences other than just child sex offences—the registries only list people as 'sex offenders', without definition—the bill will impact only on people who have a child sex offending history and not everyone caught up in the various laws?

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (18:14):  I will conclude my comments on this crucial and urgent bill amending the Australian Passports Act—the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Bill 2017. Last Wednesday morning, I was privileged to sit in the roped-off guest section in the other place to watch the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, introduce the changes—my changes—to the passport act which will take passports off all convicted paedophiles on the child-sex offender register and curtail the perverts going on child-rape holidays in South-East Asia. 


I want to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the Minister for Justice, Michael Keenan; and the Prime Minister and his office for allowing me to participate in the drafting of this legislation and for the speed with which it has come before this chamber. I know that in this town the wheels of justice can sometimes grind exceedingly slowly. I also want to thank the Australian Federal Police for their input about this disgusting trade, which has stained Australia's reputation throughout South-East Asia for decades. We will get our good reputation back, because this is the first country in the world to impose such travel restrictions. I have already had preliminary discussions with the foreign minister about approaching her counterparts in New Zealand, in Canada and in the UK—and I have debated it on the BBC—and maybe even in the USA, where they have had a national public register of convicted sex offenders for more than 20 years.


This is just a start. As I mentioned earlier, the government is working with me on more-protective laws for our most vulnerable here at home, for the spring session of parliament. I also say thanks to the Nick Xenophon Team. Because of them we now have Carly's law, aimed at internet stalkers. As I speak, I know that there are deviants right here in Australia using their credit cards and Skype for real-time sex crimes. I was given evidence today of an Australian paedophile in Australia hiring a baby from her mother in the Philippines for less than $100 for his real-time gratification on Skype, and that baby was three months old.


I will be working closely in the months ahead with a group called IJM Australia, International Justice Mission Australia, to fight what they called cybersex trafficking in our region. I know that the Xenophon team, through Senator Kakoschke-Moore, has an amendment to cover cybersex traffickers. Going forward, I will happily work with her on all of this, and with the government.


Finally, I stand here tonight a very proud man. I am very proud of you all, in both houses, for rescuing hundreds and thousands of children from a truly evil and depraved culture. Thank you.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-06-20,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (18:16):  I rise to speak on the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Bill 2017. The Nick Xenophon Team supports this bill, which responds to increasing community concern about Australian convicted child sex offenders travelling overseas to sexually abuse vulnerable children in countries where the law enforcement framework is weaker and the activities of offenders are not monitored. That community concern is justified. We must never be complacent where the innocence, safety and exploitation of children are at stake. I acknowledge Senator Derryn Hinch's contribution to the genesis of this bill, and his strong advocacy for the measures contained in it.


This bill will amend the Australian Passports Act and the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act so that, upon request by a competent authority as defined in the Passports Act, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be required to refuse to issue or required to cancel an Australian passport, or demand the surrender of a foreign travel document, where an Australian citizen is on a state or territory child sex offender register with reporting obligations. The decision to refuse to issue or the decision to cancel a passport will be mandatory and not subject to administrative review following a request by the competent authority—namely, a state or territory court, sex offender registry or police.


This bill will also amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to make it a Commonwealth offence for a registered child sex offender with reporting obligations to travel or attempt to travel overseas without permission from a relevant authority. The new offence is crucial and complementary to the passport measures. The new offence ensures that child sex offenders can be prosecuted, should they try to evade the passport measures.


The bill also amends the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act by inserting new law enforcement grounds for a competent authority to request the minister to order the surrender of a foreign travel document because the person is an Australian citizen. This is intended to prevent Australian dual nationals from travelling overseas on foreign passports to sexually exploit or sexually abuse vulnerable children in overseas countries. 


There are about 20,000 registered sex offenders in Australia who, having served their sentence, are subject to supervision and reporting obligations because they remain a risk to the community and innocent children. Approximately 2,500 child sex offenders are added to the list each year. The passport measures introduced under this bill will apply to the existing cohort of registered child sex offenders with reporting obligations, and they will also apply to future child sex offenders registered annually. The Nick Xenophon Team remains satisfied that, if there are compelling reasons such as bereavement, offenders with reporting obligations will be able to obtain permission from authorities to travel overseas.


The Nick Xenophon Team will always fight to protect vulnerable children who are the victims of terrible abuse. Convicted child sex offenders must be stopped from fuelling the child sex trafficking trade, which flourishes overseas. The statistics are alarming, with more than 770 Australian registered child sex offenders travelling overseas in 2016. Alarmingly, a third of them violated an obligation to notify police of their intention to travel. Under existing laws, a failure to report intended overseas travel or to comply with other obligations can result in up to two years imprisonment. However, the penalties handed down by the courts are generally warnings or small fines which provide little incentive to comply. This is completely unacceptable and clearly ineffective. These offenders have a high propensity to re-offend in countries where they are not monitored and where child sexual exploitation is rampant.


Registered child sex offenders are subject to reporting obligations in Australia specifically because of their ongoing risk to children. This bill will address current deficiencies and will prevent Australian registered child sex offenders with reporting obligations with the measures I have outlined. Once their reporting obligations have concluded, offenders will be able to apply for a passport in the usual way. While the Nick Xenophon Team supports the bill, we are concerned about the unintended consequences of the measures fuelling cybersex trafficking, which is why I will be moving amendments to the Criminal Code to tighten existing sections of the code to prevent these unintended consequences emerging. I will move those amendments during the committee stage.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:21):  I would like to thank all senators for their contribution to this debate on this bill, which will combat the sexual exploitation of vulnerable children overseas by Australian child sex offenders. In particular I would like to commend Senator Hinch for his dedicated contribution to this debate over many years. I also thank the senators from the Nick Xenophon Team for their proposed amendments to the bill. We appreciate your shared concerns in ensuring that vulnerable children are protected from the dangers posed by child sex offenders. However, the government would like to consider those proposed amendments in further detail to ensure that they function with the existing provisions. We will progress this as part of the package of child sex offender reforms being progressed for the spring sittings.


This bill reflects the seriousness with which the government is addressing child sex tourism. These tough new measures send a strong message to child sex offenders that they cannot use overseas travel to sexually exploit and abuse children. Such abhorrent crimes will not be tolerated. The risk posed to vulnerable children overseas by Australian child sex offenders is utterly and completely unacceptable. There is currently no effective mechanism to stop Australian child sex offenders from travelling overseas to countries with weaker law enforcement frameworks where their activities are not monitored.


The measures are intended to capture all Australian registered child sex offenders with current reporting obligations. When an offender's reporting obligations end, they can apply for a passport as usual. This is necessary and appropriate because registered child sex offenders are subject to reporting obligations in Australia specifically because of their ongoing risk to children.


For these measures to be effective in stopping child sex offenders from travelling overseas to commit horrific acts against children, it is essential that passport decisions are mandatory and not subject to merits review following a competent authority request for passport denial. Unless these tough new laws are introduced, Australian child sex offenders will continue to travel overseas and be in a position to commit those offences. These laws will make Australia world leader in protecting vulnerable children from child sex tourism, and I urge senators to support this legislation as a matter of urgency.

SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (QUEENSLAND COMMISSION INCOME MANAGEMENT REGIME) BILL 2017


This Bill will amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to allow the Income Management element of Cape York Welfare Reform to continue for two additional years until 30 June 2019.


Income Management ensures welfare payments are used to meet the essential needs of vulnerable people and their dependents. 


Income Management sets aside a percentage of a recipient's welfare payment to ensure it can only be spent on priority goods and services such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care.


People on Income Management are also provided with support to improve money management skills. Centrelink assists Income Management participants to identify expenses and helps them budget so their welfare payments can meet these expenses. 


Income Management supports 25,693 vulnerable people in locations across Australia, including individuals referred by child protection authorities. 


Funding for Income Management was due to cease on 30 June 2017. Government has decided to extend Income Management in all existing locations until 


30 June 2019. 


Extending Income Management for two years ensures continuity of support for vulnerable participants while allowing Government time to work through future directions for welfare quarantining. 


There are high risks associated with ceasing Income Management without a mechanism to replace it.


An influx of cash into Income Management sites could lead to an increase in levels of violence, hospitalisation and abuse. 


Income Management also increases food security in communities as it encourages community stores to stock plenty of food and household goods. If Income Management ceased on 30 June 2017, this could be compromised.


Income Management in Cape York is the only Income Management measure with a legislated sunset date. Current legislation allows for all other Income Management measures to continue beyond 30 June 2017. 


Cape York Welfare Reform is a partnership between the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge, the Australian Government, the Queensland Government and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership. It aims to restore local Indigenous authority, rebuild social norms, encourage positive behaviours, and improve economic and living conditions.


Income Management is an important component of Cape York Welfare Reform. Currently, a person can be placed on to Income Management after a decision by the Family Responsibilities Commission made before 1 July 2017. Where welfare recipients are referred to the Commission, the Commission can also discuss the issues with the individual and link them with relevant support services.


Cape York Welfare Reform commenced in the four partnership communities on 


1 July 2008. 


In 2016, Income Management was extended to the community of Doomadgee. Doomadgee is not formally part of the Cape York Welfare Reform Partnership, however the same referral pathway for Income Management applied in the four communities applies in Doomadgee. 


There are currently 196 participants on Income Management in Cape York and Doomadgee.


The Income Management component of the Cape York Welfare Reform is a powerful tool, designed to be used both as a mechanism for ensuring that welfare payments are spent on necessities and as an incentive for individuals to engage with social supports and make positive behavioural change.


The approach of Cape York Welfare Reform has yielded positive results for both individuals and communities. 


Participating communities have seen significant improvements to their economic and living conditions. 


A 2012 evaluation of Cape York Welfare Reform found that progress has been made at the foundational level in stabilising social circumstances and fostering behavioural change. This was particularly in the areas of sending children to school, caring for children and increasing individual responsibility.


The evaluation also found there was evidence that Income Management assists in reducing behaviours that lead people to being referred to the Family Responsibilities Commission. 


Further, 78 per cent of income managed people surveyed reported that the program had made their lives better.


This Bill extends the date before which the Families Responsibilities Commission can make a decision to place a person on Income Management to 1 July 2019. This enables Income Management to continue in Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale, Mossman Gorge and Doomadgee for a further two years. 


This amendment aligns with the end date of Income Management in all existing locations across Australia.


The proposed approach to the extension of Income Management in Cape York was discussed with Queensland Government and the Cape York Partnership which agreed this was the best approach and met the needs of Cape York Welfare Reform at this time.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:49):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Queensland Commission Income Management Regime) Bill 2017. This bill amends the Social Security (Administration) Act to enable a two-year continuation of the income management element of Cape York welfare reform in the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge. The Cape York Welfare Reform is an initiative of the Cape York Partnership, an Indigenous organisation that has led a wide-ranging reform agenda in Cape York. And although not formally part of the Cape York Welfare Reform partnership, this bill also applies to the community of Doomadgee. The Commonwealth government announced in the 2017-18 budget that it will extend income management in all five locations for two years until 30 June 2019, so this bill extends by two years the income management component of the Cape York Welfare Reform.


Labor will support this bill following consultations with local communities, and as a result of a Senate committee inquiry that Labor insisted on so that the parliament was able to receive submissions from the local stakeholders in the Cape. The feedback from local groups is that income management in Cape York is working and having a positive impact on the local communities. I want to detail some of those views for the Senate. The BBN Aboriginal Corporation in Mossman Gorge says:


There is a broad base of support in Mossman Gorge for the direction of the reform journey that we have been on and need to stay on. Welfare Reform has supported good progress but still there is still a lot to be done.


In their submission, the Coen Regional Aboriginal Corporation said:


Giving local people real power to hold other community members to account through the FRC gets our 100% support. 


They note that:


Coen now has the best school attendance of any Indigenous community school in Queensland and we are the only one that can beat the Queensland Average School Attendance.


The Aurukun Shire Council said:


The FRC must stay strong for our people. In Aurukun we have been down a hard road but we need to keep on going to make more positive changes.


The Hope Vale Aboriginal Shire Council stated:


In Hope Vale the FRC has done some very good work since 2008, especially in terms of school attendance … The FRC and Cape York Welfare Reform have made big, transformational changes to our community and this is very clear to people that knew this place beforehand and now.


The Cape York Institute made it clear:


Income Management applied through the FRC model gives Indigenous people the power and authority to help their own community members build basic capability to understand their primary obligations to their children and their community, and their obligation to use welfare payments to pay the rent and electricity, and to provide food and clothing for the household.


They further note:


A number of people, particularly women stay on Income Management because it protects them from humbugging. This is not a sign of further dependency, but a sign of people wanting to meet their basic responsibilities using the best methods available to them.


The Cape York Institute also expressed concern that many of the advances made as a result of income management in the region would be lost if the system was to abruptly end on 30 June 2017.


This last point is an important one. The existing arrangements are due to expire on 30 June, and the manner in which this government has handled this legislation has been disappointing. Unfortunately, this legislation has been rushed through by the government, allowing only a very short Senate inquiry. The government could have introduced this legislation into the parliament months ago so as to enable a more thorough consultative process. The last evaluation of the Cape York Welfare Reform was released in 2012, so in our view it is time that an updated evaluation be carried out. There really should have been a further evaluation before this extension. We call on the government to make sure that a proper independent evaluation is done in the next two years. Nonetheless, we are satisfied that the continuation of income management does have the support of the leadership of the local communities and we will support this bill today.


Labor believes in community-driven approaches to deal with chronic alcohol abuse. Any legislation that extends income management in a particular jurisdiction must be driven and supported by the local community. We understand that the vast majority of social security recipients are more than capable of managing their personal finances. However, where individual communities believe that income management can make a positive difference we will discuss it with them. Labor's position on income management is very simple. We do not believe it should be rolled out on the national scale. We do not believe it should be imposed on communities that do not want it.


Shadow Minister Macklin has personally spoken with the mayors in each of the communities in the area affected by this legislation. They believe that income management is a positive thing for their communities and they support its continuation. As the Indigenous affairs minister in the previous Labor government, Shadow Minister Macklin was responsible for working with the Aboriginal leaders in the Cape to deliver these changes. The Cape York Partnership's work is based on the principles set out in Noel Pearson's 2005 Cape York agenda. The Cape York Welfare Reform Agenda aims to support people in the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge to take responsibility for the wellbeing of their families and their communities. The primary aim is to ensure that kids are safe, fed and educated.


The Family Responsibilities Commission was established under Queensland legislation in 2008. As the Family Responsibilities Commission's submission sets out, local commissioners are elders or respected community members who encourage individuals appearing before the commission to take the necessary steps to make lasting changes that will benefit their health, wellbeing, home and community life. The submission goes on to say:


The Local Commissioners have continued to grow in local authority since 2008 with the majority of conferences being conducted in the four Welfare Reform Communities without the presence of the Commissioner or his Deputy Commissioner in the financial year to date.


All Commissioners have equal authority in the decision-making process.


The authority of the FRC is the strength of its Local Commissioners, with decisions in conference involving community members (FRC clients) being made by their own Indigenous leaders.


The commission commenced operating on 1 July 2008 and conferencing began on 12 August 2008, with the first sitting being held in Coen. The primary objective of the commission, as set out in the FRC Act, is to hold conferences with community members to encourage individuals and families to engage in socially responsible standards of behaviour whilst promoting the interests, rights and wellbeing of children and other vulnerable persons living in the community.


The commission may work with a community member who is a social security recipient living in an area prescribed by regulation as a welfare reform community, if the person or their partner is in receipt of certain welfare payments. The FRC can direct part of an individual's income support payments to be managed by Centrelink to pay for the priority needs of their family. The percentage of payment income managed varies between 60 per cent, 75 per cent or 90 per cent.


Since Cape York Welfare Reform began in July 2008, the four communities have seen improved school attendance, care and protection of children and community safety. A 2012 evaluation of Cape York Welfare Reform found that progress has been made at the foundational level in stabilising social circumstances and fostering behavioural change, particularly in the areas of sending children to school, caring for children and increasing individual responsibility.


I want to reiterate that the most recent evaluation of income management was in Cape York in 2012. A further evaluation is overdue. We thank the various local community groups for making submissions to the Senate inquiry at very late notice. Those submissions have played an important role in showing that the communities support the continuation of income management in Cape York. On that basis Labor will support this bill.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:00):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Queensland Commission Income Management Regime) Bill 2017. This bill extends the income management element of the Cape York Welfare Reform initiative for a further two years. The Greens, as I am sure everybody in this place knows, have opposed compulsory income management since it was introduced by the Howard government in 2007. In fact, the 10th anniversary is tomorrow, and I will speak further on that in my adjournment contribution. This will occur in the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale, Mossman Gorge and Doomadgee. Income management there is part of a sanction that can be imposed by the Families Responsibilities Commission on individuals who have breached their obligations. I should note here that this is a very different sort of approach to addressing some of the issues in communities, and it is very different to the Northern Territory intervention. However, it still includes a compulsory income management component. We do not support that. Income management is also intended to act as a deterrent to encourage individuals to uphold their obligations.


There was an extremely short Senate committee inquiry into this bill, where no hearing took place. I am extremely critical of that for two reasons. One is because we received very few submissions. We received no submissions from individuals, because they simply did not have time and there was not time to adequately contact them. Those are the people that I want to hear from—the people that this affects. We heard from organisations, but we did not hear from other organisations that we would have heard from if there had been more time. We also would have had time to listen to the evidence about outcomes from this process. There were only seven submissions received, none of which provided any documented evidence. There was a lot of talk about perceptions about how things are better. I clearly remember that that is what happened during the intervention and some of the evaluations there. There were perceptions that thing were better. When those were actually tested, in fact the outcomes in those communities were the same as comparable communities that did not have income management. So I am very wary when we talk about 'perceived as better' when that is not properly evaluated through properly conducted, peer reviewed evaluations. 


The major source of information about income management in Cape York is the evaluation report commissioned by the government in 2012. In fact it was unable to demonstrate conclusively that income management in Cape York had met its stated aims. This is the same thing that happened with the Northern Territory intervention, where the final evaluation in fact showed that the intervention met none of its objectives. The evaluation found that there had been some improvements in areas such as school attendance and reductions in crime. However, income management is just one of the number of measures that have been implemented by the Cape York Welfare Reform initiative, and which contributes to these changes. Two of the evaluation report's authors, Ilan Katz and Margaret Raven, subsequently noted in the Indigenous Law Bulletin that it is difficult to draw conclusions from this given that many other Indigenous communities in Queensland have also shown the same improvements. In other words, you cannot prove that income management is the tool that has driven these particular changes. In the report it states:


… the evidence suggests that the impact of the local FRC Commissioners is in their listening, guiding and supporting role, rather than in the exercising of their punitive powers to order income management.


It also states in the report:


The data indicate that some community members had become habituated to income management or had found ways around it. This appears in some cases to have produced unintended consequences, such as clients on income management harassing relatives for access to alcohol or drugs. It appears that for this group income management (and welfare reform more generally) has little effect.


The evaluation report also notes that there is some community dissent about income management and the basics card, including concern about the paternalistic nature of the intervention. The majority report said that the committee inquiry points to a survey conducted as part of the evaluation, saying that 78 per cent of people said that they felt their lives were better. I refer again to the Northern Territory intervention where people said that they felt their lives were better when, in fact, a proper qualitative and quantitative analysis showed that there was not any difference between the outcomes in that community and other communities. 


On the weight of evidence, the Australian Greens believe that income management is a failed and expensive policy that the government is persisting with in the absence of real justification. Compulsory income management is a paternalistic top-down approach. Voluntary income management is something different and should be treated differently. There are a number of other programs that are not coercive in nature, such as Centrepay, that could be used to help people manage their money better. I also think that the sorts of supports that the FRC provides, which is that guidance and that support that was articulated in the report, mean we can better support people, offer wrap-around services and ensure they get access to the services that are needed. 


We do support direct investment in programs and communities that address the underlying causes of disadvantage that people are facing, rather than income management which is expensive to implement and does not address the underlying causes. Money spent on income management around Australia could be better invested directly in communities in order to provide specialist direct programs—for example, to better assist the FRC in terms of better access to programs such as financial management, some of those wrap-around services, education and better access to fresh food et cetera. 


We do not believe that the evidence supports the continuation of compulsory income management. We do not support this bill, but we do acknowledge the work of the Families Responsibilities Commission. We do acknowledge that it was a different approach taken to the intervention; however, we do not think compulsory income management works. The evidence is not there. There has not been any further evaluation to back up the government rolling out another two years of income management—there has been no evaluation of that program since 2012. The evaluation of the Northern Territory intervention, which was subsequent to that, shows that the Northern Territory intervention and new income management did not meet their objectives. I think we need to be better evaluating Cape York, and look at where we can invest the resources that are committed. I do not mind the resources being committed; I just object to the way that those resources are being committed. We do not support this bill.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (19:20):  I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the coming anniversary of the election of the Turnbull government, because whilst we are on our break the 12th month since the Turnbull government was elected will come up. We know what has happened in the last couple of weeks. We have seen the dysfunction and disunity on the Finkel report. We have seen the dysfunction and disunity this week with regard to Gonski 2.0. But I wanted to focus on what we have seen in Queensland over the last 12 months, because it really is a sorry tale that is particularly disappointing to many Queenslanders.


At a time when we know that there are some significant economic challenges in our state, this government has failed to deliver. They went through the election campaign last year, promising all sorts of projects up and down the state, but the reality almost 12 months on is there has been a failure to act on some of those key promises. The obvious one which deserves significant attention is the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. The National Party have been championing this for years. For three years they have been talking about it. For 12 months they have had it set up, yet it still has not created one job in regional Queensland and still has not spent one dollar. It has no doubt been a failure.


The other, particularly disappointing program that I highlight—Senator Nash did this—was from when they went around regional Queensland during the election campaign, promising regional jobs packages. Here we are 12 months later, still with not one job created and not one dollar spent, particularly in areas where there is significant unemployment. This government went around making promises and once again have failed to deliver.


There has also been a real slowness to act and crack down on the 457 visa issue, something that is of particular concern in regional Queensland, particularly as we are seeing an increase in labour hire and casualisation. That is another failure of this government to act.


And then of course there is the growing clamour for a banking royal commission. We are seeing lots of talk from the member for Dawson, but when push comes to shove he has always got an excuse for why he will not actually back a royal commission into banking. Again we have seen that in the other place in the last half hour. He talked a big game and he crossed the floor, but he did it on a vote that did not matter. We will absolutely be holding him to account because, when you look at those economic circumstances in regional Queensland, the looming penalty rates are going to be a real blow to those communities not only in regional Queensland but around Australia.


But the failure from this government continues. We also saw no money for infrastructure funding in Queensland out of the budget. We saw no commitment to Cross River Rail. The state Labor government in Queensland have had to go it alone on that vital infrastructure project for the growing South-East Corner. It is no surprise that the federal government did not put any money into Cross River Rail considering that in the five months before the budget was delivered the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, did not set foot in Queensland once. He had actually been to Germany more times than he had been to Queensland as he prepared that budget. It is no wonder it was a failure in the eyes of Queenslanders when the key architect of it does not spend any time in Queensland.


We also see this week cuts to education. If this is supported by this government, it will see in Queensland over the next two years a $732 million cut to public schools. They talk about innovation and agility, but how is that going to improve educational outcomes in Queensland and in particular regional Queensland, where we know the job opportunities are not as great as they are in other places? That is something we need to have a real focus on and which this government has not been able to.


And, again, the dithering on energy: we know they have failed to deliver on policies and announcements they made during the election campaign, but they have dithered on energy. They are backtracking on Finkel. They made some announcements today that are not going to have a short-term beneficial impact on the gas market that is so important to manufacturing jobs and jobs from industry—once again, another cross against this government. Here we are, almost 12 months on—a government that has failed Queensland; it will continue to fail Queensland, and we will continue to hold it to account on that matter.
