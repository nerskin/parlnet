Dear Mr Allen
I refer to our discussions with you and your colleagues on Thursday, 24 September 1998. At that meeting we, on behalf of the Government, made a number of undertakings regarding consultation and the finalisation of the Government's taxation policy. As agreed, this letter puts those undertakings in writing.
May we begin by acknowledging the MTAA's constructive approach to our negotiations. In particular, we note that at the meeting the MTAA supported the need for taxation reform and acknowledged the overall benefits of the Government's plan for the Australian community.
For its part, the Government acknowledged three particular issues raised by the MTAA at the meeting:
The potential transitional problems faced by the MTAA's members in the lead-up to the abolition of the wholesale sales tax (WST) and the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST). The MTAA are concerned that in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST they will face transitional costs that need to be accounted for in the Government's tax plan.
In addition, the MTAA stated that under the existing WST they operate under arrangements, agreed with the Taxation Commissioner, that account for the timing of the payment of WST. Under the taxation plan no similar agreement has been proposed for the collection of GST on motor vehicle sales.
The MTAA are concerned about the impact of GST on the used car market. They have raised concerns about the margin system  of taxation being proposed by the Government. They are also concerned about the relative impact of the GST on used car dealerships vis a vis private sales of vehicles.
In response to these concerns, the Government stated at the meeting that it is prepared to enter into a process of consultation with the MTAA to address these concerns. In doing so the Government stated at the meeting that its objective was to ensure the livelihood of motor vehicle dealers. It would seek to develop a practical transition arrangement that would address the concerns about the crossover from the WST system to the GST system. Further, the Government would seek ways to address the cash flow benefit issue raised by the industry.
The Government also recognised that the impact of the transition issues would become of immediate importance to the industry as from the re-election of the Government on 3 October. Therefore the issues at hand, including the cash flow issue, will need to be dealt with expeditiously. The Government stated that a meeting between the Treasurer 
 and the MTAA would be held within a fortnight of the election result. The meeting will be preceded by a meeting between the MTAA and Treasury officials.
With respect to the impact of GST on the used car sector, the Government said it would consider an alternative to applying the margin system  to calculate GST due. The Government noted that the Cole Committee report into the 1993 GST proposal of the Coalition recommended that notional input credits be paid on the purchase of a used car from non-registered members of the public (eg private citizens). This is also the system that applies in New Zealand. The Government thinks that this system may have merit and will give favourable consideration to it in the finalisation of the Government's taxation legislation after the election.
The Government also noted that the MTAA had raised the option of marginally increasing the stamp duty paid on private transactions of used cars as an offset to the fact that registered dealers would have to charge GST while private sellers would not. This matter could be raised by the MTAA with State 

Governments (who levy the stamp duty). The Federal Government believes one option would be for State Governments to reduce stamp duty on used cars sold by registered dealers.
The MTAA has also raised a number of other issues with the Government. These include the impact on small service stations of the Government's petroleum industry reforms. The Government will continue its discussions with the MTAA on these matters. However, the Government is prepared to refer the legislation dealing with the repeal of the relevant petroleum legislation to a Senate legislation committee.
As discussed at the meeting we are quite happy for this letter to be made public and in fact urge you to copy it to all your members.
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Allen
I refer to our discussions with you and your colleagues on Thursday, 24 September 1998. At that meeting we, on behalf of the Government, made a number of undertakings regarding consultation and the finalisation of the Government's taxation policy. As agreed, this letter puts those undertakings in writing.
May we begin by acknowledging the MTAA's constructive approach to our negotiations. In particular, we note that at the meeting the MTAA supported the need for taxation reform and acknowledged the overall benefits of the Government's plan for the Australian community.
For its part, the Government acknowledged three particular issues raised by the MTAA at the meeting:
The potential transitional problems faced by the MTAA's members in the lead-up to the abolition of the wholesale sales tax (WST) and the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST). The MTAA are concerned that in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST they will face transitional costs that need to be accounted for in the Government's tax plan.
In addition, the MTAA stated that under the existing WST they operate under arrangements, agreed with the Taxation Commissioner, that account for the timing of the payment of WST. Under the taxation plan no similar agreement has been proposed for the collection of GST on motor vehicle sales.
The MTAA are concerned about the impact of GST on the used car market. They have raised concerns about the margin system  of taxation being proposed by the Government. They are also concerned about the relative impact of the GST on used car dealerships vis a vis private sales of vehicles.
In response to these concerns, the Government stated at the meeting that it is prepared to enter into a process of consultation with the MTAA to address these concerns.

The MTAA has also raised a number of other issues with the Government. These include the impact on small service stations of the Government's petroleum industry reforms. The Government will continue its discussions with the MTAA on these matters. However, the Government is prepared to refer the legislation dealing with the repeal of the relevant petroleum legislation to a Senate legislation committee.
As discussed at the meeting we are quite happy for this letter to be made public and in fact urge you to copy it to all your members.

—Is there any objection to this notice being taken as formal?",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 1998-99</title>,<title>Consideration of Estimates</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-11-26,"—by leave—The supplementary round of estimates was due to occur in August. It was then postponed to September, and it was then subsumed by the election. The opposition believed that it was not only impractical to schedule them this side of Christmas but was impossible. Nevertheless, those questions that hang over from those inquiries can be pursued in February.
Senator Campbell has given us an indication that estimates committees will sit on 8, 9, 10 and 11 February, with 11 February, I think, being a spillover day for the first group and February 19 a spillover day for the second group. Whilst it is not in the resolution carried earlier today, Senator Campbell has given me an indication that if there is need for further spillover hearings they will be held on 22 and 23 February. It would be convenient if Senator Campbell could confirm those arrangements, although, from the opposition's point of view, we doubt that those extra informal spillover days of 22 and 23 February will be necessary.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 1998-99</title>,<title>Consideration of Estimates</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-26,"—by leave—I have been informed that we have just voted on that, and the two extra spillover days are con 
 firmed. They were in government business notice of motion No. 1 apparently. We delivered ahead of time and on budget.
—There being no objection to the motion being taken as formal, I call Senator Ian Campbell.

—Yes.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,6,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-26,"—by leave—I thank the Senate for this opportunity to make a statement on the important issue of the programming of the sitting days of the Senate until the end of this calendar year. The opposition will not oppose this motion when it comes before the Senate. I do, however, want to place on record some substantive concerns about the way the legislative program is being managed by the government. The government released its program for parliamentary sittings on 16 October. The extra week was described as an `if required' week. The opposition accepts that that is the case. A mere 11 sitting days were placed in the sittings program plus this extra `if required' week.
It was absolutely unrealistic of the government to expect the Senate to process the huge number of bills it wanted the Senate to deal with. Senator Hill, after all, publicly indicated that there was a backlog of some 80 bills that, in his view, needed to be dealt with by Christmas. It was unrealistic to expect that 
 number of bills to be dealt with even in 15 days, let alone 11.
It is also true to say that the government had an opportunity to include this extra sitting week in the original sittings program. That could have been moved in the motion that went before the chamber two weeks ago. I assumed the Manager of Government Business would tell us that the government was going to assess progress with the legislation program before making a decision whether this extra sitting week was required. There has been a huge dose of lack of realism in relation to this particular matter.
But there are more substantive issues that I want to concentrate on very briefly. I do hope that the government takes some of these comments seriously and does try to address them. You cannot really expect the chamber—whether it be the opposition, the minor parties or Senator Harradine—to cooperate fully with the government if the government continues to handle its programming in the way it has been. It is becoming absolutely impossible in this chamber to prepare for legislation. Forward legislation programs have gone past being an endangered species now—they are actually extinct.
 All we get these days is a document called a `draft legislation program' for a sitting period which consists of an impossibly inflated wish list of bills. It is distributed within just days of the commencement of the Senate sittings and it does not give senators an opportunity to understand the order in which the government proposes to bring on bills. There is no indication of that in the draft legislation program. So it is of no assistance to the chamber and senators in determining what the priorities are for the examination of bills. It makes it extremely difficult from the opposition's perspective—I do not know about the minor parties and Senator Harradine—as far as its internal processes are concerned in preparing draft submissions for the shadow cabinet, for caucus and so forth.
I remind senators that we received the draft legislation program for the 1998 autumn sittings, which began on 2 March, on 23 February. That was a list of 98 bills, 10 days in advance of the sittings. We received the 
 draft legislation program for the winter sittings, which began on 12 May, on 4 May. That was a list of 18 bills, minus budget related legislation, just eight days before the commencement of sittings. We received the draft program for the current spring sittings—a list of 27 bills—on 10 November, the same day that the sittings began.
It is important to remember that this draft program does not even contain or provide an indication of the order in which bills are going to be brought on. For the current sittings we have simply been given a list of 27 bills which are proposed for debate. The earliest indication you get of the proposed order for debate in the chamber is usually on the Friday before a sitting week. I say very seriously to the government and other senators in the chamber that this is increasingly becoming a very serious problem. It is not a surprise in those circumstances that an increasing number of bills are being referred to legislation committees.
As an opposition, we do need time to examine legislation and, just like the government has, we have internal party processes which we expedite but which are important to the proper functioning of the opposition and I think important to the proper functioning of this place. We are entitled to take legislation through our internal party processes. So the government cannot complain about delays if there is not this level of information, if there are not clear indications, well in advance of parliamentary sittings, of the order in which the government proposes to bring bills on for debate in this place. Let me say again that the opposition has very limited resources to scrutinise legislation. If the government expects and wants the opposition to meet the government's priorities, the government has an obligation and a responsibility to get its act together, work out these priorities and—this is my point—share these priorities with other parties in the chamber. It needs to do it much sooner than is occurring with current practice.
I want to make this substantive point for the government to consider. I know that the Parliamentary Library is experiencing the same sorts of problems—as you may well know, Madam President, given your responsi 
 bilities—in preparing the Bills Digests. The government would know from their many years in opposition that these are an invaluable tool for senators in scrutinising legislation. The Library cannot possibly prepare 27 Bills Digests in just a matter of days. They also need assistance in prioritising their work. I think it is in the government's interest, as much as it is in the interest of the opposition, minor parties and Senator Harradine, for that level of assistance to be given. Given that the opposition has these difficulties in keeping up with the legislation program in these circumstances with our resources, I assume that others in the chamber have similar problems, if not more difficulties, in keeping up.
In the spirit of this contribution, I am not suggesting that when the Labor Party was in government our record on these matters was perfect, but I do draw the government's attention to the fact that we did circulate forward programs that indicated not only the legislation that we were proposing for sittings but also the order in which it was proposed to bring it on for debate in the chamber. I draw the government's attention to the commitment that we gave in 1993 to circulate that sort of program at least four weeks in advance of a sitting period. I can say, as the then Manager of Government Business, that we honoured that commitment for the remainder of the period that we were in government. I think it is a good practice and a useful practice for all senators, including the government, and I urge the government to revive that practice. I also suggest that forward programs which are issued by the government ought to be published on the Internet so that they can be made immediately available to interested parties, whether it be senators, the Parliamentary Library, members of the public or interest groups and the like.
The opposition will support the motion that will soon be before the chair. We do not understand why the government could not have anticipated this need and made the necessary adjustments previously, but I suspect that is just another example of the problem that we face. It is symptomatic of the fact that there has been an absence of forward planning on behalf of the government. I 
 believe that this is something the government needs to seriously address if we are to improve the approach to handling legislation in this chamber, for which the government has responsibility. If the government expects the cooperation of non-government senators in this chamber for the remainder of this parliament, I ask them to take on board very seriously these issues, particularly the constructive suggestions that I have made today on behalf of the opposition.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,6,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-26,"—by leave—I appreciate the advice the former Manager of Government Business has given us. I did listen carefully to what he said. Even though I know that Senator Faulkner tried not to use a gratuitous tone of voice, I do regard some of what he said as gratuitous, but much of it was sound.
The government does seek to provide all honourable senators with as much advance notice of the program as possible. I think even Senator Faulkner would recognise that slightly unusual circumstances occur after an election where you do have a whole range of bills, many of which are on the program now, which have got to a certain stage in the Senate before an election but which, because of the prorogation of the parliament, have to go back to the House of Representatives. Even though some people in this place may argue that there is a more efficient route to go, the government has taken the decision that the proper course within our democracy is to see those bills basically start their life again in the House of Representatives and find their way here.
The reality in relation to this Senate program at the moment is that all of the pieces of legislation that we were dealing with last week, and will deal with this week and next week, were before the previous parliament, with a couple of important exceptions: the  Space Activities Bill 1998 , which I expect we will be getting onto shortly, and the  Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 —and there may be another one that I have missed. So with the exception of those two important bills, one dealing with sheep and the other with space—
—That is National Party stuff.
—That is right—it is important stuff.
—Lost in space!
—Lost in space, Senator Carr! With the exception of those bills, all of the other bills are matters that have been before the previous parliament—the 38th Parliament, as it was officially called—so, in terms of the Parliamentary Library, I do not regard that, with the exception of the space and wool bills, there would have been any additional load because all of these matters would already have been the subject of bills digests.
The second point is that a number of the pieces of legislation that we are seeking to deal with are stuck in committees. One of the reasons why we have not been able to get them out of the committees is that the committees were only formed late yesterday afternoon because there were delays in nominations to those committees. The government was ready to re-man and re-woman—re-person—those committees at the beginning of the last sitting week, but there were hold-ups with other parties in the Senate in manning those committees.
Contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition has said, the coalition government and myself as manager, seek to provide lists of legislation for the forthcoming week as early as possible.
—Why didn't you do it four weeks in advance like we did?
—The Leader of the Opposition interjects. It is very hard to do something four weeks in advance, particularly during a sitting period. I know that the Senator suggests that we would do that prior to a sitting, but looking at the sittings for this week—and I am not sure whether it was circulated by the new opposition whip, but I know that he is coming to grips with a new job, and I know that our government deputy whip is coming to grips with a new job, a job which is hard and onerous—we distributed the list for this sitting week the Monday before last.
—So did we.
—The opposition manager of business says that he circulated it, or the whip circulated it, or someone circulated it over there, so you have had at least a week, if not more than a week's notice, of the program for this week. It is impossible to determine what we are going to be doing next week until we find out at about lunchtime today what we have actually done this morning. We will circulate, as we always do—and I sign off on a list this evening—
—What about the priority order? How did we manage to do it for three years?
—As Senator Faulkner told the people at the last election, as Mr Beazley told the Australian people, these guys, with a couple of exceptions, got it almost perfect for 13 years. They ran the country beautifully, they ran the parliament beautifully! They did things like bringing in the biggest bill, as it was at the time—the Native Title Bill—on the last day of sitting in one session and then making the parliament sit for eight days, using the guillotine and the gag.
—Not the gag.
—Sorry, Senator Ray, not the gag, but the guillotine. They were fantastic managers, they were fantastic managers of the economy. We all know that. Senator Cook and Senator Faulkner keep convincing themselves of that. One day they might convince the Australian public to forgive them for the disgraceful way they managed the place.
I share Senator Faulkner's view. We do try. It is in the government's interest to ensure that all members of the Senate are given as much notice of the legislation program as possible. There are things that are outside our control. We cannot, in many respects, control how long bills are sent to committees for, what committees they get sent to, and when they report. We have a number of bills that we would like to deal with at the moment that are stuck in committees and could not be taken out of committee because the committees were not formed until yesterday afternoon, nearly two weeks into the first sitting period.

 and I accept the opposition's support for the motion that we hope to see declared formal.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,6,1,speech

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-11-26,"—On behalf of Senator Gibbs, I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report by 31 March 1999:  

(a) the extent and cost of all market research undertaken by all government departments and agencies in the period 11 March 1996 to 3 October 1998;
(b) whether on all occasions a full and open tender process was observed; and
(c) what steps were taken to avoid the use of such market research for party-political purposes.
Let it be said from the outset that Labor does not oppose the use of quantitative and qualitative market research by governments when they are devising and testing the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. It is a useful tool in developing communications strategies for government policies that have been passed in parliament in the form of legislation or adopted by government through legitimate processes of executive government. It is not, however, legitimate to research areas that are the province of election campaigns, especially where one's party is seeking a mandate on a specific issue.
The current government has not provided, in any meaningful detail, data relating to market research undertaken by government departments. In response to questions from both Senator Faulkner and me, some departments have provided detail of market research undertaken by them. Other departments have refused outright to disclose any information about their market research programs. Hence, it is not possible to quantify total expenditure in this area.
Today we have put further questions on notice seeking detailed disclosures of such expenditure and would expect the government to come clean and outline how much taxpayers' money has been spent in this area.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—In response to a question on notice from Senator Faulkner in June of this year, Senator Minchin informed the Senate that, according to OGIA records, Commonwealth departments and agencies let out 78 contracts for market research. He was unable to provide details of the costing of these proposals. Based on FOI requests, we do know the following.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—The Department of Social Security and Centrelink spent 
 $90,000 on qualitative market research to gauge community attitudes to social security fraud—
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—Order! Senator.
—and to assist in developing an advertising campaign aimed at raising public awareness of the government's efforts in this area.
—It is a shambles.
—Order, Senator!
—Of course, this area was a key element in the Liberal Party advertising in the recent election.
—You are a bunch of hypocrites.
—Senator Campbell!
—They are a bunch of hypocrites.
—Senator Campbell—
—A further contract worth up to $145,000 was let out—
—Just a moment, Senator Ray. Senator Campbell, I ask you to withdraw that.
—Madam President, these blokes are hypocrites.
—There is no need to debate it. I ask you to withdraw.
—They said that we should be informing them about the government's program in advance and we have just had this brought on without any notice to the coalition whatsoever. They are a shambles. They have given us a lecture about giving advance notice and they have now brought this matter on with no advice through the whips, no advice from the manager—they are absolute, unadulterated hypocrites.
—Senator, I ask you to withdraw that and remain silent. You will have your chance to speak.
—I withdraw that word.
—Madam President, a further contract of up to $145,000 was 
 let by the Department of Social Security to benchmark and evaluate the government's campaign to promote the new youth allowance. The department of finance reported through their lead brokers in the partial sale of Telstra that they spent a grand total of $460,035, in two bites, to conduct qualitative research into the attitude of shareholders and Telstra staff, amongst others. The original budget for this research was $200,000.
Environment Australia, through a consultant—a former staffer for John Hewson and Andrew Peacock and also a Liberal Party operative, Jane Seaborn—paid Mark Textor, from the Australasian Research Strategies Proprietary Limited, the sum of $7,541 for focus group research regarding the Natural Heritage Trust.
The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs allocated $184,850 to a research company for a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research in the preparation of the anti-racism kits for schools. A developmental research concept testing and tracking polling for an information campaign for the Office of the Employment Advocate is budgeted up to $300,000.
These are just six contracts of the 78 recorded by OGIA. The total expenditure is massive and the government must be forced to give parliament accurate figures as to the total expenditure.
The extent of the government's reliance on market research techniques is not surprising. They have learned the hard way not to ignore the merits of qualitative research. During their first term, they were twice saved from going ahead with potentially disastrous advertising campaigns because of qualitative research employed to test their effectiveness. In both cases the advertising campaigns were cobbled together by the Liberal Party apparatchiks, whose employment clearly owed more to political debts of gratitude than to any expertise in the field.
It was revealed in September 1996 that qualitative researchers Elliott and Shanahan had reported to the government that the forthcoming guns buyback campaign, proposed by DDB Needham with the theme of `Bite the bullet', was overwhelmingly rejected 
 by focus group participants. They found that it generated considerable anger, that it would lead to non-compliance, and that it presented a message in a way which suggested that the government was dictatorial—`We are coming to get you.' The researchers found that it was the worst of all proposals.
However, it did not stop the ministerial council, via a blatant political fix, allocating the contract to DDB Needham as a reward for services rendered by key operatives in the previous federal election campaign. This research resulted in DDB Needham changing strategy. The campaign that finally emerged was dull, ineffective and, basically, a waste of taxpayers' money. But, thanks to market testing, it was at least no longer insulting, offensive and counterproductive.
In January this year, yet another PR disaster was narrowly averted. The Prime Minister's office, in disarray over native title, proposed to cabinet a massive advertising campaign to push the government's position on the Wik issue. Drafted by self-appointed advertising experts in the Prime Minister's office, the proposed advertisements were, at the last minute, sent for market testing.
The results of that testing were damning in the extreme. This report showed that, one, the ads tested poorly across all demographics. Secondly, the reaction to the ads ranged from outright disgust to apathy, with respondents commenting that they were alarmist, racist and corrupt. Thirdly, far from reinforcing the desired message, the ads would have actually damaged the government's position.
Now the government—exposed by the opposition in Senate estimates, ridiculed in the national press and lampooned by its own market research—killed the advertising campaign, thus saving Australian taxpayers $3 million. The government, however, did not escape entirely unscathed from this shabby, amateurish effort. Caught out giving misleading evidence to the estimates committee, exposed as incompetent cowboys, they were nonetheless saved from total humiliation by the appropriate and timely application of market research.
All this highlights is what the government should already know. There is a place for the 
 use of market research techniques in devising and testing appropriate government promotional campaigns. There is absolutely no place for taxpayer funded market research to be used for purely party political purposes.
Because market research companies essentially conduct opinion polling and focus group research, the potential for crossover into the party political arena is self-evident. Therefore, when the government funds market research programs, there must be detailed public scrutiny because of the nature of the techniques involved and, especially, the high risk of inappropriate and unethical use.
It is proper that a number of ethical issues are considered to test the appropriateness of government actions in this area. For the benefit of government senators who seem to be unclear about these issues, I will outline some of the broad and non-controversial matters for consideration in the use of market research by governments.
Firstly, there is legitimacy. Any research conducted by the government must be designed to meet public policy and not party political objectives.
There is ownership. When the government commissions research for use in promotional campaigns, the question of who owns the information is critical. Because such research has the potential for political partisanship, it should be either quarantined from ministers' offices or made available for all to see via parliament.
There are tender processes. As with all external contracts, the tender process must be conducted in a fair and appropriate way with equal consideration given to all tenderers. Given that this area is often subject to contract changes, if there are substantial changes, they should be retendered.
Then there are the budgetary issues. There are too many examples where a budget has been set and then blown out with no thought of retendering. These budget blow-outs are usually in direct proportion to the political panic at the time.
The final issue is accountability. Given the sensitivity of government sponsored market research, the process must be transparent and 
 as accountable as possible. All information relating to these projects—that is, the tender process, the departmental briefs, detailed budget information including estimated and actual costs, and the research findings themselves—should be made available at the soonest possible time for parliamentary and wider scrutiny.
Let us measure off these principles as they apply to the latest government outrage in market research—the tax reform market testing. In this case the research was conducted by Worthington Di Marzio to prepare the government's tax advertising campaign. Leaving aside the outrageous expenditure of taxpayers' funds on a partisan political exercise, the research aspect itself is nothing more than a scandal. The research project went well over budget, and we are still waiting for the Treasurer to provide details of the actual expenditure. At the moment we are working off the estimated cost as presented to the Treasury by Worthington Di Marzio.
On 3 June this year, the Senate Finance and Public Administration estimates committee was told that the research budget for the tax advertising campaign would be up to $200,000. On the following day, Treasury bragged to the economics estimates committee that they were able to keep the budget to just under $100,000 despite the earlier estimate of 200,000. At no point, despite questioning from the opposition, did Treasury officials provide details of any future expenditure, some of which would be allocated just a few days after the estimates hearings. Further evidence was given that the research would be overwhelmingly qualitative.
The contracts let out to Worthington Di Marzio were, firstly, research into community views regarding tax reform. The final report was due 3 June 1998, there was a budget of up to $100,000 but Worthington's quote was $93,850. Then we had the amended brief to test advertising concepts and information products with target groups. There was a $16,900 quote from Worthington, let on 18 June. Then we had the research brief for the `concept for tax reform information program'. Worthington's quote was $29,750, let on 17 July. Then in August 1998 there was `bench 
 mark tracking and evaluation results for message delivery and effectiveness evaluation'. Worthington's quote was $221,350, let on 21 July. In addition, Worthington Di Marzio were charging $1,000 per day for each consultant when required in Canberra. This comes to a total cost of $361,850—$161,850 over budget, as outlined at the estimates committee hearings; an 81 per cent blow-out.
If there were any decency in government life or public life, Worthington Di Marzio's account should be sent not to the Treasury but to `Lightweight' Lynton, c/- Robert Menzies House, Barton, ACT.	You might ask why. We asked this question: was the research purely for public policy reasons or was it research for the Liberal Party of Australia for its upcoming federal election campaign. The documents tabled by the Treasurer clearly show that it was commissioned for partisan political reasons. Worthington Di Marzio were instructed by Treasury to do extensive research on the Australian Labor Party's 1993 campaign commercials.
In the Wave 2 lines of inquiry document, the moderators were instructed to show the Singleton ads from the 1993 ALP election campaign to test recognition, to test respondents' overall opinion of the campaign, to evaluate which components hit the message home and why, and to ascertain where respondents thought they had failed and why. This section of the report, referring to ALP ads, is entitled `Towards a counter-attack strategy', so there is nothing subtle about this. This is most inappropriate subject for taxpayer funded research that I have ever seen or could possibly imagine.
Elsewhere in the documents there are several other references to the need to devise responses to potential criticisms of the tax package. In a campaign the government claims is to inform the electorate about a government proposal, how can it be appropriate to engage consultants to research a counter-attack strategy which, by definition, is less about information than about partisan political persuasion?
The next question that arises is what happened to the research when the election was 
 called. The welter of information collected by Worthington Di Marzio would have been of massive assistance to a political party going to the electorate with tax reform as its key issue. The research provides detailed analysis of voter attitudes to tax reform across all age groups and education and income levels across metropolitan, rural and regional voters by gender.
This is precisely the kind of data which political parties use to develop campaign strategies, to analyse policy strengths and weaknesses and to mould campaign messages to target a range of groups within the community. It is the very information that political parties pay for themselves—but not the Liberal Party. Why pay for it yourselves when you can get the taxpayer to fund it?
We know that the research would have dovetailed beautifully with the Liberal Party campaign strategy. After all, the report contained 312 pages of detailed, quantitative data which analyses in great detail public attitudes towards what would become the centrepiece of the Liberal Party campaign in 1998. It includes focus group research testing attitudes towards an opponent's campaign conducted just weeks before the campaign was called.
We still do not know what happened to the tracking polling. Was it ever done? If so, where is it? Why wasn't it tabled? When did it start? When did it finish? Was any of it done during the official election campaign period? What guarantees can the government give that none of this research found its way into the hands of the Liberal Party organisation? We are entitled to have doubts about these matters because the government will not come clean on the extent and nature of market research done.
We must give credit to some departments for being transparent and accountable. But this may no longer be the case as OGIA has been shifted from DoFA across to PM&C under the direct control of the Prime Minister's office rather than the department. As the auditor-General said in relation to government advertising, there would be major benefit in a parliamentary inquiry into the use of market research by governments. There can be no more opportune time than now to 
 review the ethical guidelines which cover advertising and market research, given that supervision has been transferred from DoFA to PM&C. Such a committee inquiry could establish both the scope and the cost of market research by government and make recommendations as to appropriate guidelines that would govern the use of such techniques.
This is a government that has systematically rorted advertising and research. It rorts the selection processes to give jobs to its mates. It rorts the research briefs to acquire taxpayer funded political research. It flagrantly rorts copyright so that the Liberal Party can use government artwork. It covers up by refusing to table all relevant material for parliamentary scrutiny. It covers up by refusing to answer questions on notice. It covers up by rejecting freedom of information requests. It covers up by giving misleading answers at Senate estimates committees.
Only a full Senate inquiry can get to the bottom of the murky, rorted research activities of this government and make sensible recommendations to ensure cleaner, more accountable and more honest arrangements in future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-26,"—I am not going to speak on the substantive motion; I am going to explain why we received a lecture less than half an hour ago from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on his advice that the government should inform other senators of what the advance program should be.
At the whips meeting last night at approximately 7 o'clock the opposition whip advised that the motion which is listed at item 6 under discovery of formal business under Senator Gibbs's name would be deferred. That was clearly either a mistake—to give the new whip his due, he may have made a mistake. He certainly made a series of mistakes the day before when he advised all parties that every motion was going to be declared formal and embarrassed his colleague Senator Lundy. But we all make mistakes, as I said earlier.
We were told that this motion would be deferred. Clearly, the government had not been told that the motion would be brought 
 on and debated. Senator Ray has obviously wanted to pull on what is a stunt. He has obviously done that. It is sad to see a former distinguished senior minister in a former government brought down to the level of having to dig around, jump up and down, scream and yell, and try to keep his name in the public spotlight. It is very sad to see, because we all know that Senator Ray is far more capable than that.
—I am a has-been; you're a never-been.
—Senator, I thought you were supporting my ministerial aspirations. I thought you were the one bloke over there who was trying to help me. I was modelling my career on you, Senator Ray. I thought I'd get to the front bench in the same time as you made it.
—You're better than Senator Kemp. We're all on your side.
—Thanks, Senator Ray. As I said in, I guess, an intemperate interjection at the beginning of Senator Ray's adventure, speech, whatever you might call it—
—Opus.
—Opus, rage, rave, it was hypocritical to give the government a lecture by leave about giving advance notice about the government's program and then to deceive the whips meeting, to in fact inform us that that matter would be deferred and then bring it on with certainly all of the senators on this side not being informed about it. I understand some Independent senators were not informed either. So I will not bother going to the detail of the motion. I just say that we will not take advice from the opposition on our management of the program, when it is hypocritical for them to give that advice, because within half and hour of receiving that advice they basically not only did not tell us what they were doing; they actually told us they were doing the opposite and then did it. It is hypocrisy; it is deceit. I give Senator O'Brien the benefit of the doubt. He has only been in the job for a few sitting days. We look forward to dealing with this motion in the way that it should be—with 
 ultimate contempt both for the motion and also for the process with which it has been brought on.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I will let the opposition whip debunk the last contribution from Senator Campbell and I will address the substance of the motion before the chair. The Liberal machine has always boasted of the roles played by many of its key operatives—
—This is a disgrace. You have no honour at all.
—in support of the Country Liberal Party in Northern Territory elections. The DDB Needham ad team of Toby Ralph and John King, the Prime Minister's former chief of staff, Grahame Morris, and the Liberal Party pollster, Mark Textor, all cut their political teeth in the Territory while working on CLP campaigns.
The coalition are proud of these operatives and the work they did in the Territory. They are proud of the racist, lowest common denominator campaigns that they have run—campaigns which not only `de-Territorianise' the Aboriginal community there but also dehumanise them, campaigns that are based on character assassination, fear and loathing.
These were the operatives who assassinated Terry Smith in 1990 in a vicious personal campaign that scarred him and his wife and children. The Needham operatives later boasted in the Adelaide Advertiser—
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. Not only has the senator on his feet at the moment deceived the chamber and breached any honour; he is now flagrantly breaching standing order 187. He is reading word for word—
—Order, Senator Campbell!
—some speech that a staffer has written out for him.
—Order, Senator Campbell!
—This man is a senior member of the Senate. He should not have to read a piece of puerile—
—Order, Senator Campbell! Will you please resume your seat.
—political rubbish word for—
—Order, Senator Campbell, will you please resume your seat. Would you please withdraw the word `deceived', which is unparliamentary, I am advised.
—He flagrantly misled other honourable senators, and he is in flagrant breach of standing order 187. I ask you to call him to order.
—There is no point of order.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a new point of order. The opposition leader in the Senate is reading word for word a prepared text in large full spaced orator font, which is in flagrant beach of standing order 187.
—I am aware of that standing order, but I am also aware of the general practice of this place—certainly in my experience—that a number of senators do refer to copious notes. I believe there is no point of order to be taken.
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. There is a difference between copious notes and a speech that is written out word for word in full orator font being read word for word by a senator who cannot look up, who cannot even extemporise. He has to read every single word  of it. This guy is a leader of the opposition in the Senate. He has been in the parliament for nearly 10 years; he should be able to make a speech without reading it word for word like a grade 4 school student who is learning to read.
—Senator Campbell, this is an issue that is occasionally raised. I think it would be appropriate for me to refer it to the President to make a comment on, but I think you will 
 agree that senators on both sides, on all sides of the chamber, do refer to copious notes.
—You've never read a speech, Senator Campbell.
—Once. That's it.
—Order, Senator Ray.
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President.
—I was going to let you resume your speech.
—I would like to speak to the point of order. As you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, I have an excellent record in this chamber in relation to making extemporaneous speeches. It is very unusual for me to take a point of order like the one that Senator Ian Campbell has raised. It is also very unusual for me to use copious notes. On this occasion I intend to use copious notes because there are certain facts here that need to be placed on the public record. I want to ensure that they are absolutely accurate. In relation to this contribution I am, unusually, going to use copious notes. But if Senator Campbell wants to set a new example—
—Go outside and make this speech; Robert Ray won't. It is 10 yards to courage.
—I will be one senator who would be very happy every time a government senator in this chamber refers to copious notes to draw it to the chair's attention. I do not use notes on even an irregular basis. It is unusual for me, as you would know Madam Acting Deputy President, but I intend to do it in this speech because there is certain factual material. When the point of order was taken, I was quoting directly from the Adelaide Advertiser . I want to get these quotations right. I want to get this material right. I know we are going to have the government engage in a cover-up here, but I am afraid we are going to get this material on the public record whether Senator Campbell or other members of the government like it or not.
—Senator Faulkner, your comments are not a point of order. The reason I am referring this question to the President is that it is often used as a device by all sides in this place to restrict debate. I think it is time that we looked closely at the way in which copious notes are used because everybody uses copious notes in this place at different times when, as Senator Faulkner has indicated, they want to be sure to get particular facts on the public record. I think it would be appropriate if you finished your speech, Senator Faulkner, so that we can continue the business of the Senate.
—I will continue this quote from the Adelaide Advertiser  from the Needham operatives. They said:
. . . from a marketing perspective, the less decisive, the less interested, the less informed the voter, the more desirable, the more influential and the more seducible their vote.
In the same article, Toby Ralph bragged:
. . . the first part of our negative strategy was a vicious attack on Labor leader, Terry Smith . . . we called him Terrence—not Terry—because it sounds more contrived and effeminate and very un-Territorian.
These are the operatives who in 1993 put together the Liberal Party ad that showed Australians in the crosshairs of a telescopic gun sight while a deep male voice asked who would be next. This was an ad that was supposed to be about unemployment. The Coalition for Gun Control issued a press statement calling the ads `a cynical exploitation of the tragic gun violence problem in this country'. In response, the then Deputy Director of the Liberal Party, Grahame Morris, dismissed complaints about the ads as being `mild by political standards'.
Mark Textor is the notorious Canberra by-election push pollster and the first known user in Australia of this invasive, anonymous and cowardly technique. He learned the technique in the USA and perfected its use in the 1994 Northern Territory election when voters were asked whether they knew that Labor planned to introduce two sets of laws, one for blacks and another for whites. Morris, Ralph, King and Textor—these are the operatives of whom this coalition is so very proud.
The coalition embraced them into the Liberal Party. It entrusted them with the key role in developing the Liberal Party election strategy in 1996. It gave Morris the key role in the Prime Minister's office. It gave the others key government contracts such as the rorted guns buyback advertising contract awarded to DDB Needham, with the research component of the public relations campaign carried out by Textor. It was Morris who orchestrated the fix to get them this work, despite their concepts testing disastrously.
The coalition threw other government work their way. There was a research contract for Textor on the Natural Heritage Trust. Waterfront reform research conducted by Textor cost taxpayers $42,000 alone. Who is Mark Textor, the Liberal Party pollster who was recruited out of the Northern Territory by Andrew Robb? We know that both his methodology and his analysis are morally bankrupt. He is a push pollster obsessed with negative campaigns based on emotive and racist research findings. He is unprincipled and he is dishonest. In 1990 he participated in a scheme to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory. Shane Stone, Mark Textor and Andrew Coward conspired to corruptly bill the Northern Territory government for $35,540 worth of qualitative research into various governmental and political issues in the Northern Territory.
—You are so gutless and so cowardly; you won't say this outside. You are disgrace to the Senate.
—Order! Senator Campbell, that is inappropriate language. Please do not use it.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, he is gutless and cowardly. He won't say this outside. He is disgraceful and does not deserve to be a senator. Why don't you step outside? Go and say it outside.
—Senator Campbell, regardless of your feelings about the subject matter, you must withdraw the comments you have made about Senator Faulkner—regardless of the content, which I understand you feel strongly about. Would you please withdraw your remarks?
—Madam Acting Deputy President, all senators should feel strongly about a senator defaming a character.
—Withdraw your remarks!
—I will be withdrawing. These are words that this senator would not say outside.
—You withdraw; this is not your speech.
—Senator Campbell, would you please withdraw?
—This is a premeditated character assassination of a person who cannot defend himself. I withdraw what I said about Senator Faulkner.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a further point of order. You should ask Senator Campbell to apologise to the chair. You were on your feet and he constantly interrupted, sniping from his seated position. He knows better than to put on this puerile performance, but because he cannot counteract any of the arguments we get this smearing interjection from him time and time again. It will go on all the time, Madam Acting Deputy President, unless you are firm with him.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, it might be in the interests of the good conduct of the chamber if Senator Robert Ray's point of order is noted, but we proceed with the business. In question time we have similar interjections from Senator Faulkner on the other side when Madam President is trying to keep order. I think we should just get on the business.
—That is a useful contribution, Senator O'Chee. We certainly do have interjections constantly in this place which are inappropriate and unparliamentary. That is why I asked Senator Ian Campbell to withdraw. The public is unimpressed with those kinds of interjections which both sides of this chamber engage in. I think that Senator O'Chee's suggestion, notwithstanding the comments of Senator Robert Ray, is appropriate. Senator Campbell, I ask you, notwithstanding your feelings on 
 this subject, to restrict your comments to comments that are parliamentary and not unparliamentary so that Senator Faulkner can proceed.
—Madam Deputy President, I appreciate that and I appreciate the offer made by Senator O'Chee, but I think Senator Robert Ray's advice is absolutely accurate and I should not have spoken while you were on your feet. I should not have interjected upon you and I unreservedly apologise to you and to the position of President of the Senate. I think what I did was wrong.
—Thank you.
—Madam Deputy President, could I indicate on a point of order that I kept addressing the chair because Senator Ian Campbell stood in his place and was addressing you without taking a point of order. Of course, if there was a point of order and Senator Campbell was called, I would have resumed my seat. I ask you to rule that, if a senator wishes to take a point of order—which they can at any time during a senator's contribution, particularly if they want to cover up what a senator is saying because it is so embarrassing to the Liberal Party and the National Party—they must stand in their place and seek the call. They just cannot stand up and scream across the chamber like the Manager of Government Business in the Senate who is setting such a poor example.
—I think we are all aware of the normal rules of procedure in this place and I would ask you to proceed with your speech.
—Thank you. Shane Stone, now the Northern Territory's Chief Minister, was the President of the CLP at the time. Mark Textor was employed as a researcher for the CLP and Andrew Coward was the key operative in Chief Minister Perron's office. The same research that cost Northern Territory taxpayers over $35,000—conducted by the same researcher, using the same focus groups, on the same days, in the same locations—was made available to the CLP for a mere $3,700. Every aspect of the research provided to the territory government 
 was also passed on to the CLP, but large sections of the document received by the CLP were never included in the research commissioned and paid for by the Northern Territory government.
The scheme was for the CLP and the Northern Territory government to simultaneously request research from Brian Sweeney and Associates into various governmental and political issues in the Northern Territory. The Chief Minister's office informed public servants of the parameters of the research and who would be conducting it. The public servants were never told that the CLP would piggyback on the government's research, that it would receive all of the findings and more. This is in total breach of copyright.
The public servants were also never told that taxpayers would bear the full cost of the group discussions, the group moderation expenses and the group recruitment expenses. They were never told that while the Northern Territory government would be billed $4,800 for focus group recruitment alone, the total cost to the CLP for the entire project, using the same focus groups, would be only $3,700. The public servants were never told that only swinging voters would participate in the focus groups. The public servants were never told that every focus group, in every locality, would comprise only white territorians, even though Aboriginals comprise approximately one-third of the territory's population.
The public servants were never told that the real reason for the research was contained in a memo dated 2 April 1990 and sent under the signature of Mark Textor to key CLP operatives. In that memo, Mark Textor specifically recommends that government and CLP research be run simultaneously. This memo is the genesis of the conspiracy hatched by Textor, Coward, Stone and Klein to falsely bill the territory government for the CLP's campaign research. The public servants were never told any of these things. Nor were they told that Mr Klein would totally breach his signed undertaking to the Secretary of the Chief Minister's department that all copyright would vest with the Northern Territory government. They were never told that all the research would be provided to the CLP. Nor 
 were they told that Mr Ron Klein's letter of 14 June 1990 outlining the subjects to be covered in the research, included an attachment, which no public servant ever saw, which separated the governmental from the political information requirements.
This letter makes it absolutely clear that it was always intended to illegally bill the Northern Territory government for research that was purely for the political purposes of the CLP, research that was never intended to be made available to government.
Ron Klein's 12 focus groups resulted in two reports. The first is entitled A 1990 Insight into the Northern Territory and was prepared by Ron Klein for the Northern Territory government in July 1990. I shall refer to that as `the government report'. The second report is entitled A 1990 Insight into Northern Territory Politics and was prepared by Ron Klein for the confidential attention of Shane Stone and Mark Textor of the Northern Territory CLP in July 1990. I shall refer to that as `the CLP report'.
The government report is numbered 6706, while the CLP report is numbered 6697. I ask: who from Brian Sweeney and Associates made the decision to use the deceptive device of non-consecutive numbers for these reports? I ask Brian Sweeney and Associates whether its researchers are routinely instructed to provide advice on ways to conceal copyright and billing breaches to clients? Is it standard practice for their researchers to aid and abet the defrauding of taxpayers?
The government report commences with the quote, `This document reports the findings from 12 group discussions conducted across the Northern Territory between 25 June and 3 July 1990.' The CLP report commences with the quote, `This document reports the findings from 12 group discussions conducted across the Northern Territory between 25 June and 3 July 1990.' This is not surprising. After all, the methodology of each report, contained on pages 7 and 4 respectively, is exactly the same. The group numbers, the locations, the age and gender profiles and the dates are exactly the same. The only difference is that the CLP report contained the observation that the respondents had no involvement or strong 
 affinity with any political party and every respondent in every group was white.
These two facts were deleted from the report provided to the government. In other words, the government never knew that the focus group samples were unrepresentative. They needed to be unrepresentative to suit the political parameters of the CLP. The government report, costing $35,000, runs to 46 pages. The CLP report, costing $3,700, runs to 65 pages. The CLP report includes page after page of material that they never asked for in their formal brief but, since it had been provided to the territory government, it was passed on to the CLP, in total breach of copyright.
Page after page of the report matches one another verbatim—the same layout, the same font, the same quotes, the same observations. Both reports contain the same chapter headings. In some cases, political quotes are left out of the government report but blended into the CLP report. Under the heading `The Northern Territory economy and federal funding', on pages 13 and 10 of the reports respectively, the CLP report contains the focus group quote, `It could be doing better if the government (NT) didn't waste so much money'. This quote was deleted from the government report, as were other comments relating to NT government waste.
Even though the government brief specifically sought information relating to the Sheraton hotels in Darwin, Yulara and Alice Springs, unfavourable political comments on these projects were deleted from the government report. The comments were, however, included in the CLP report. This must constitute, on Mr Klein's part, a massive breach of his legal, ethical and contractual obligations to provide the full findings of the research to this clients—the copyright for which vests with the territory government.
Time and time again aspects of the report are softened or altered so that the government report, for which taxpayers were billed over $35,000, is a weaker, less precise and less informative document. Time and again, salient observations and quotes are left out. The only conclusion is that the Northern Territory government was provided with a useless 
 document—research without any hard edges—a document which would gather dust.
The real findings, contained in the CLP report, start on page 44. Remember, the government report ran to only 46 pages. The first of the chapter headings in the CLP report that is not matched in the government report is headed `An introductory comment on the local political arena'. Mr Klein's research told the CLP that there were perceptions of government waste; that the government lacked experience and maturity; that they were helping out their mates—and he wasn't wrong there—and that too many territory contracts were being offered interstate. That, I might say, was from the Melbourne-based Mr Klein. On it goes until page 64—20 pages of political findings. So one-third of the research the government never saw.
The NT public servants were merely the mugs who provided the taxpayer-funded structure around which the CLP could conduct its real political research. This research then formed the basis of the CLP's election campaign, run by DDB Needham, in October 1990. This is not only dishonest and unethical, it is also corrupt. The operatives involved—Textor, Stone, Klein and Coward—conspired to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory.
Mark Textor's involvement in territory politics did not end with the Sweeney swindle of 1990. On 14 April 1993, Mark Textor's business—Territory Focus Consulting—entered into a contract with the Northern Territory government to provide research during 1993-94. The business name was registered with the ASC on the same day. In other words, registering the business name was simply a device to enable a paid coalition political operative to be engaged on voter research at taxpayer expense in the run-up to the election. The contract was for 12 months and the fee was $740 per day. The services that Textor was to provide were described, in deliberately vague terms, in two lines in schedule 3 of the contract. I quote:
The consultant shall provide to the Territory advice on community attitudes towards government programmes and initiatives as required. 

It was never intended that Textor would perform anything other than political research for the CLP. By July, Textor was providing advice to the private staff of Chief Minister Perron. In a letter to Andrew Coward, dated 16 July 1993 and marked `private and confidential', Textor, a consultant engaged by the NT government on a $740 a day taxpayer-funded consultancy, provided details of the voter research that he intended to conduct.
Time and again his research intentions refer to voters. He writes of determining `what factors are most important in influencing voter behaviour'. He advises Coward that `a campaign researcher needs regular voter contact in order to put his or her findings in their proper historical context and to properly interpret subtle changes in attitude'. He writes:
My groups were intended to be nothing more than a `snap shot' read, or the first of a series of updates of the general political mood of the under 35 target market in the northern suburbs to see what (and if) further research was required and in what directions.
That goes to the heart of the scam. Textor's work was political. The letter to Coward was faxed from the Liberal Party's national headquarters in Canberra. In further faxes in September 1993, Textor describes the focus groups he is setting up for further research. He describes the processes that will be used to weed out committed voters. The evidence is unambiguous. Textor's research is political. Indeed, he boasts that he has seen `more political focus groups than anyone in Australia over the last two years'. It is totally political. It serves no other purpose than the development of campaign strategies for the CLP. Yet it is paid for by the taxpayers of the Northern Territory.
The documents that we have in our possession and which are now being tabled, or soon to be tabled, in the Northern Territory parliament show the contempt that Mark Textor has for public accountability and ethical standards. They show that he is both an initiator and an active participant in conspiracies to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory. This man is John Howard's own political pollster. This is a person appointed by the Liberal Party, nationally, to conduct their research.
Some of these scams were actually conducted by Textor while operating out of the Liberal Party national secretariat and using their equipment. This is a person considered suitable for government research projects for the Commonwealth of Australia. But we say this about Mark Textor. We say that he is a person unfit to receive government work in this country. We say that, in a democracy, political parties must observe some standards in respect of their own advertising and research.	We say that Mark Textor is not fit to be retained as the chief pollster of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister of Australia.
We say that Mark Textor conspired with Shane Stone, Ron Klein and Andrew Coward to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory and we say that Mark Textor also conspired to use his business name, Territory Focus Consulting, to further defraud territory taxpayers by conducting political research for the CLP under a bogus government contract. We say that both the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party are tainted by their association with and involvement in dealings with one of the lowest, most unethical, most grubby political operatives Australia has seen.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I take a point of order. We have been very restrained on this side while the Leader of the Opposition has been reading his speech and ranting and raving and carrying on. I would like to seek some advice from you. He is constantly slandering and abusing an individual, making wild and extreme claims about this person. What protection does this person have in this parliament to stop Senator Faulkner behaving in this quite disgraceful manner?
—There is no point of order. I think you, like all other honourable senators, are aware of references to the Privileges Committee.
—We do need a committee of inquiry in order to establish whether the Textor modus operandi has ever been used at the federal level. I think the parliament needs to know whether Textor was given contracts for market research by this government and, if so, whether those contracts were for backdoor, taxpayer funded polling 
 for the coalition or whether they were won on the basis of the merits of his bid.
We say that Textor's market research for the federal government needs to be examined in detail and we also say that a only a Senate inquiry is likely to do that. I commend the motion to the Senate.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-11-26,"—On behalf of Senator Gibbs, I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report by 31 March 1999:  

(a) the extent and cost of all market research undertaken by all government departments and agencies in the period 11 March 1996 to 3 October 1998;
(b) whether on all occasions a full and open tender process was observed; and
(c) what steps were taken to avoid the use of such market research for party-political purposes.
Let it be said from the outset that Labor does not oppose the use of quantitative and qualitative market research by governments when they are devising and testing the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. It is a useful tool in developing communications strategies for government policies that have been passed in parliament in the form of legislation or adopted by government through legitimate processes of executive government. It is not, however, legitimate to research areas that are the province of election campaigns, especially where one's party is seeking a mandate on a specific issue.
The current government has not provided, in any meaningful detail, data relating to market research undertaken by government departments. In response to questions from both Senator Faulkner and me, some departments have provided detail of market research undertaken by them. Other departments have refused outright to disclose any information about their market research programs. Hence, it is not possible to quantify total expenditure in this area.
Today we have put further questions on notice seeking detailed disclosures of such expenditure and would expect the government to come clean and outline how much taxpayers' money has been spent in this area.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—In response to a question on notice from Senator Faulkner in June of this year, Senator Minchin informed the Senate that, according to OGIA records, Commonwealth departments and agencies let out 78 contracts for market research. He was unable to provide details of the costing of these proposals. Based on FOI requests, we do know the following.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—The Department of Social Security and Centrelink spent 
 $90,000 on qualitative market research to gauge community attitudes to social security fraud—
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—Order! Senator.
—and to assist in developing an advertising campaign aimed at raising public awareness of the government's efforts in this area.
—It is a shambles.
—Order, Senator!
—Of course, this area was a key element in the Liberal Party advertising in the recent election.
—You are a bunch of hypocrites.
—Senator Campbell!
—They are a bunch of hypocrites.
—Senator Campbell—
—A further contract worth up to $145,000 was let out—
—Just a moment, Senator Ray. Senator Campbell, I ask you to withdraw that.
—Madam President, these blokes are hypocrites.
—There is no need to debate it. I ask you to withdraw.
—They said that we should be informing them about the government's program in advance and we have just had this brought on without any notice to the coalition whatsoever. They are a shambles. They have given us a lecture about giving advance notice and they have now brought this matter on with no advice through the whips, no advice from the manager—they are absolute, unadulterated hypocrites.
—Senator, I ask you to withdraw that and remain silent. You will have your chance to speak.
—I withdraw that word.
—Madam President, a further contract of up to $145,000 was 
 let by the Department of Social Security to benchmark and evaluate the government's campaign to promote the new youth allowance. The department of finance reported through their lead brokers in the partial sale of Telstra that they spent a grand total of $460,035, in two bites, to conduct qualitative research into the attitude of shareholders and Telstra staff, amongst others. The original budget for this research was $200,000.
Environment Australia, through a consultant—a former staffer for John Hewson and Andrew Peacock and also a Liberal Party operative, Jane Seaborn—paid Mark Textor, from the Australasian Research Strategies Proprietary Limited, the sum of $7,541 for focus group research regarding the Natural Heritage Trust.
The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs allocated $184,850 to a research company for a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research in the preparation of the anti-racism kits for schools. A developmental research concept testing and tracking polling for an information campaign for the Office of the Employment Advocate is budgeted up to $300,000.
These are just six contracts of the 78 recorded by OGIA. The total expenditure is massive and the government must be forced to give parliament accurate figures as to the total expenditure.
The extent of the government's reliance on market research techniques is not surprising. They have learned the hard way not to ignore the merits of qualitative research. During their first term, they were twice saved from going ahead with potentially disastrous advertising campaigns because of qualitative research employed to test their effectiveness. In both cases the advertising campaigns were cobbled together by the Liberal Party apparatchiks, whose employment clearly owed more to political debts of gratitude than to any expertise in the field.
It was revealed in September 1996 that qualitative researchers Elliott and Shanahan had reported to the government that the forthcoming guns buyback campaign, proposed by DDB Needham with the theme of `Bite the bullet', was overwhelmingly rejected 
 by focus group participants. They found that it generated considerable anger, that it would lead to non-compliance, and that it presented a message in a way which suggested that the government was dictatorial—`We are coming to get you.' The researchers found that it was the worst of all proposals.
However, it did not stop the ministerial council, via a blatant political fix, allocating the contract to DDB Needham as a reward for services rendered by key operatives in the previous federal election campaign. This research resulted in DDB Needham changing strategy. The campaign that finally emerged was dull, ineffective and, basically, a waste of taxpayers' money. But, thanks to market testing, it was at least no longer insulting, offensive and counterproductive.
In January this year, yet another PR disaster was narrowly averted. The Prime Minister's office, in disarray over native title, proposed to cabinet a massive advertising campaign to push the government's position on the Wik issue. Drafted by self-appointed advertising experts in the Prime Minister's office, the proposed advertisements were, at the last minute, sent for market testing.
The results of that testing were damning in the extreme. This report showed that, one, the ads tested poorly across all demographics. Secondly, the reaction to the ads ranged from outright disgust to apathy, with respondents commenting that they were alarmist, racist and corrupt. Thirdly, far from reinforcing the desired message, the ads would have actually damaged the government's position.
Now the government—exposed by the opposition in Senate estimates, ridiculed in the national press and lampooned by its own market research—killed the advertising campaign, thus saving Australian taxpayers $3 million. The government, however, did not escape entirely unscathed from this shabby, amateurish effort. Caught out giving misleading evidence to the estimates committee, exposed as incompetent cowboys, they were nonetheless saved from total humiliation by the appropriate and timely application of market research.
All this highlights is what the government should already know. There is a place for the 
 use of market research techniques in devising and testing appropriate government promotional campaigns. There is absolutely no place for taxpayer funded market research to be used for purely party political purposes.
Because market research companies essentially conduct opinion polling and focus group research, the potential for crossover into the party political arena is self-evident. Therefore, when the government funds market research programs, there must be detailed public scrutiny because of the nature of the techniques involved and, especially, the high risk of inappropriate and unethical use.
It is proper that a number of ethical issues are considered to test the appropriateness of government actions in this area. For the benefit of government senators who seem to be unclear about these issues, I will outline some of the broad and non-controversial matters for consideration in the use of market research by governments.
Firstly, there is legitimacy. Any research conducted by the government must be designed to meet public policy and not party political objectives.
There is ownership. When the government commissions research for use in promotional campaigns, the question of who owns the information is critical. Because such research has the potential for political partisanship, it should be either quarantined from ministers' offices or made available for all to see via parliament.
There are tender processes. As with all external contracts, the tender process must be conducted in a fair and appropriate way with equal consideration given to all tenderers. Given that this area is often subject to contract changes, if there are substantial changes, they should be retendered.
Then there are the budgetary issues. There are too many examples where a budget has been set and then blown out with no thought of retendering. These budget blow-outs are usually in direct proportion to the political panic at the time.
The final issue is accountability. Given the sensitivity of government sponsored market research, the process must be transparent and 
 as accountable as possible. All information relating to these projects—that is, the tender process, the departmental briefs, detailed budget information including estimated and actual costs, and the research findings themselves—should be made available at the soonest possible time for parliamentary and wider scrutiny.
Let us measure off these principles as they apply to the latest government outrage in market research—the tax reform market testing. In this case the research was conducted by Worthington Di Marzio to prepare the government's tax advertising campaign. Leaving aside the outrageous expenditure of taxpayers' funds on a partisan political exercise, the research aspect itself is nothing more than a scandal. The research project went well over budget, and we are still waiting for the Treasurer to provide details of the actual expenditure. At the moment we are working off the estimated cost as presented to the Treasury by Worthington Di Marzio.
On 3 June this year, the Senate Finance and Public Administration estimates committee was told that the research budget for the tax advertising campaign would be up to $200,000. On the following day, Treasury bragged to the economics estimates committee that they were able to keep the budget to just under $100,000 despite the earlier estimate of 200,000. At no point, despite questioning from the opposition, did Treasury officials provide details of any future expenditure, some of which would be allocated just a few days after the estimates hearings. Further evidence was given that the research would be overwhelmingly qualitative.
The contracts let out to Worthington Di Marzio were, firstly, research into community views regarding tax reform. The final report was due 3 June 1998, there was a budget of up to $100,000 but Worthington's quote was $93,850. Then we had the amended brief to test advertising concepts and information products with target groups. There was a $16,900 quote from Worthington, let on 18 June. Then we had the research brief for the `concept for tax reform information program'. Worthington's quote was $29,750, let on 17 July. Then in August 1998 there was `bench 
 mark tracking and evaluation results for message delivery and effectiveness evaluation'. Worthington's quote was $221,350, let on 21 July. In addition, Worthington Di Marzio were charging $1,000 per day for each consultant when required in Canberra. This comes to a total cost of $361,850—$161,850 over budget, as outlined at the estimates committee hearings; an 81 per cent blow-out.
If there were any decency in government life or public life, Worthington Di Marzio's account should be sent not to the Treasury but to `Lightweight' Lynton, c/- Robert Menzies House, Barton, ACT.	You might ask why. We asked this question: was the research purely for public policy reasons or was it research for the Liberal Party of Australia for its upcoming federal election campaign. The documents tabled by the Treasurer clearly show that it was commissioned for partisan political reasons. Worthington Di Marzio were instructed by Treasury to do extensive research on the Australian Labor Party's 1993 campaign commercials.
In the Wave 2 lines of inquiry document, the moderators were instructed to show the Singleton ads from the 1993 ALP election campaign to test recognition, to test respondents' overall opinion of the campaign, to evaluate which components hit the message home and why, and to ascertain where respondents thought they had failed and why. This section of the report, referring to ALP ads, is entitled `Towards a counter-attack strategy', so there is nothing subtle about this. This is most inappropriate subject for taxpayer funded research that I have ever seen or could possibly imagine.
Elsewhere in the documents there are several other references to the need to devise responses to potential criticisms of the tax package. In a campaign the government claims is to inform the electorate about a government proposal, how can it be appropriate to engage consultants to research a counter-attack strategy which, by definition, is less about information than about partisan political persuasion?
The next question that arises is what happened to the research when the election was 
 called. The welter of information collected by Worthington Di Marzio would have been of massive assistance to a political party going to the electorate with tax reform as its key issue. The research provides detailed analysis of voter attitudes to tax reform across all age groups and education and income levels across metropolitan, rural and regional voters by gender.
This is precisely the kind of data which political parties use to develop campaign strategies, to analyse policy strengths and weaknesses and to mould campaign messages to target a range of groups within the community. It is the very information that political parties pay for themselves—but not the Liberal Party. Why pay for it yourselves when you can get the taxpayer to fund it?
We know that the research would have dovetailed beautifully with the Liberal Party campaign strategy. After all, the report contained 312 pages of detailed, quantitative data which analyses in great detail public attitudes towards what would become the centrepiece of the Liberal Party campaign in 1998. It includes focus group research testing attitudes towards an opponent's campaign conducted just weeks before the campaign was called.
We still do not know what happened to the tracking polling. Was it ever done? If so, where is it? Why wasn't it tabled? When did it start? When did it finish? Was any of it done during the official election campaign period? What guarantees can the government give that none of this research found its way into the hands of the Liberal Party organisation? We are entitled to have doubts about these matters because the government will not come clean on the extent and nature of market research done.
We must give credit to some departments for being transparent and accountable. But this may no longer be the case as OGIA has been shifted from DoFA across to PM&C under the direct control of the Prime Minister's office rather than the department. As the auditor-General said in relation to government advertising, there would be major benefit in a parliamentary inquiry into the use of market research by governments. There can be no more opportune time than now to 
 review the ethical guidelines which cover advertising and market research, given that supervision has been transferred from DoFA to PM&C. Such a committee inquiry could establish both the scope and the cost of market research by government and make recommendations as to appropriate guidelines that would govern the use of such techniques.
This is a government that has systematically rorted advertising and research. It rorts the selection processes to give jobs to its mates. It rorts the research briefs to acquire taxpayer funded political research. It flagrantly rorts copyright so that the Liberal Party can use government artwork. It covers up by refusing to table all relevant material for parliamentary scrutiny. It covers up by refusing to answer questions on notice. It covers up by rejecting freedom of information requests. It covers up by giving misleading answers at Senate estimates committees.
Only a full Senate inquiry can get to the bottom of the murky, rorted research activities of this government and make sensible recommendations to ensure cleaner, more accountable and more honest arrangements in future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,12,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-26,"—I am not going to speak on the substantive motion; I am going to explain why we received a lecture less than half an hour ago from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on his advice that the government should inform other senators of what the advance program should be.
At the whips meeting last night at approximately 7 o'clock the opposition whip advised that the motion which is listed at item 6 under discovery of formal business under Senator Gibbs's name would be deferred. That was clearly either a mistake—to give the new whip his due, he may have made a mistake. He certainly made a series of mistakes the day before when he advised all parties that every motion was going to be declared formal and embarrassed his colleague Senator Lundy. But we all make mistakes, as I said earlier.
We were told that this motion would be deferred. Clearly, the government had not been told that the motion would be brought 
 on and debated. Senator Ray has obviously wanted to pull on what is a stunt. He has obviously done that. It is sad to see a former distinguished senior minister in a former government brought down to the level of having to dig around, jump up and down, scream and yell, and try to keep his name in the public spotlight. It is very sad to see, because we all know that Senator Ray is far more capable than that.
—I am a has-been; you're a never-been.
—Senator, I thought you were supporting my ministerial aspirations. I thought you were the one bloke over there who was trying to help me. I was modelling my career on you, Senator Ray. I thought I'd get to the front bench in the same time as you made it.
—You're better than Senator Kemp. We're all on your side.
—Thanks, Senator Ray. As I said in, I guess, an intemperate interjection at the beginning of Senator Ray's adventure, speech, whatever you might call it—
—Opus.
—Opus, rage, rave, it was hypocritical to give the government a lecture by leave about giving advance notice about the government's program and then to deceive the whips meeting, to in fact inform us that that matter would be deferred and then bring it on with certainly all of the senators on this side not being informed about it. I understand some Independent senators were not informed either. So I will not bother going to the detail of the motion. I just say that we will not take advice from the opposition on our management of the program, when it is hypocritical for them to give that advice, because within half and hour of receiving that advice they basically not only did not tell us what they were doing; they actually told us they were doing the opposite and then did it. It is hypocrisy; it is deceit. I give Senator O'Brien the benefit of the doubt. He has only been in the job for a few sitting days. We look forward to dealing with this motion in the way that it should be—with 
 ultimate contempt both for the motion and also for the process with which it has been brought on.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,12,2,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I will let the opposition whip debunk the last contribution from Senator Campbell and I will address the substance of the motion before the chair. The Liberal machine has always boasted of the roles played by many of its key operatives—
—This is a disgrace. You have no honour at all.
—in support of the Country Liberal Party in Northern Territory elections. The DDB Needham ad team of Toby Ralph and John King, the Prime Minister's former chief of staff, Grahame Morris, and the Liberal Party pollster, Mark Textor, all cut their political teeth in the Territory while working on CLP campaigns.
The coalition are proud of these operatives and the work they did in the Territory. They are proud of the racist, lowest common denominator campaigns that they have run—campaigns which not only `de-Territorianise' the Aboriginal community there but also dehumanise them, campaigns that are based on character assassination, fear and loathing.
These were the operatives who assassinated Terry Smith in 1990 in a vicious personal campaign that scarred him and his wife and children. The Needham operatives later boasted in the Adelaide Advertiser—
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. Not only has the senator on his feet at the moment deceived the chamber and breached any honour; he is now flagrantly breaching standing order 187. He is reading word for word—
—Order, Senator Campbell!
—some speech that a staffer has written out for him.
—Order, Senator Campbell!
—This man is a senior member of the Senate. He should not have to read a piece of puerile—
—Order, Senator Campbell! Will you please resume your seat.
—political rubbish word for—
—Order, Senator Campbell, will you please resume your seat. Would you please withdraw the word `deceived', which is unparliamentary, I am advised.
—He flagrantly misled other honourable senators, and he is in flagrant breach of standing order 187. I ask you to call him to order.
—There is no point of order.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a new point of order. The opposition leader in the Senate is reading word for word a prepared text in large full spaced orator font, which is in flagrant beach of standing order 187.
—I am aware of that standing order, but I am also aware of the general practice of this place—certainly in my experience—that a number of senators do refer to copious notes. I believe there is no point of order to be taken.
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. There is a difference between copious notes and a speech that is written out word for word in full orator font being read word for word by a senator who cannot look up, who cannot even extemporise. He has to read every single word  of it. This guy is a leader of the opposition in the Senate. He has been in the parliament for nearly 10 years; he should be able to make a speech without reading it word for word like a grade 4 school student who is learning to read.
—Senator Campbell, this is an issue that is occasionally raised. I think it would be appropriate for me to refer it to the President to make a comment on, but I think you will 
 agree that senators on both sides, on all sides of the chamber, do refer to copious notes.
—You've never read a speech, Senator Campbell.
—Once. That's it.
—Order, Senator Ray.
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President.
—I was going to let you resume your speech.
—I would like to speak to the point of order. As you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, I have an excellent record in this chamber in relation to making extemporaneous speeches. It is very unusual for me to take a point of order like the one that Senator Ian Campbell has raised. It is also very unusual for me to use copious notes. On this occasion I intend to use copious notes because there are certain facts here that need to be placed on the public record. I want to ensure that they are absolutely accurate. In relation to this contribution I am, unusually, going to use copious notes. But if Senator Campbell wants to set a new example—
—Go outside and make this speech; Robert Ray won't. It is 10 yards to courage.
—I will be one senator who would be very happy every time a government senator in this chamber refers to copious notes to draw it to the chair's attention. I do not use notes on even an irregular basis. It is unusual for me, as you would know Madam Acting Deputy President, but I intend to do it in this speech because there is certain factual material. When the point of order was taken, I was quoting directly from the Adelaide Advertiser . I want to get these quotations right. I want to get this material right. I know we are going to have the government engage in a cover-up here, but I am afraid we are going to get this material on the public record whether Senator Campbell or other members of the government like it or not.
—Senator Faulkner, your comments are not a point of order. The reason I am referring this question to the President is that it is often used as a device by all sides in this place to restrict debate. I think it is time that we looked closely at the way in which copious notes are used because everybody uses copious notes in this place at different times when, as Senator Faulkner has indicated, they want to be sure to get particular facts on the public record. I think it would be appropriate if you finished your speech, Senator Faulkner, so that we can continue the business of the Senate.
—I will continue this quote from the Adelaide Advertiser  from the Needham operatives. They said:
. . . from a marketing perspective, the less decisive, the less interested, the less informed the voter, the more desirable, the more influential and the more seducible their vote.
In the same article, Toby Ralph bragged:
. . . the first part of our negative strategy was a vicious attack on Labor leader, Terry Smith . . . we called him Terrence—not Terry—because it sounds more contrived and effeminate and very un-Territorian.
These are the operatives who in 1993 put together the Liberal Party ad that showed Australians in the crosshairs of a telescopic gun sight while a deep male voice asked who would be next. This was an ad that was supposed to be about unemployment. The Coalition for Gun Control issued a press statement calling the ads `a cynical exploitation of the tragic gun violence problem in this country'. In response, the then Deputy Director of the Liberal Party, Grahame Morris, dismissed complaints about the ads as being `mild by political standards'.
Mark Textor is the notorious Canberra by-election push pollster and the first known user in Australia of this invasive, anonymous and cowardly technique. He learned the technique in the USA and perfected its use in the 1994 Northern Territory election when voters were asked whether they knew that Labor planned to introduce two sets of laws, one for blacks and another for whites. Morris, Ralph, King and Textor—these are the operatives of whom this coalition is so very proud.
The coalition embraced them into the Liberal Party. It entrusted them with the key role in developing the Liberal Party election strategy in 1996. It gave Morris the key role in the Prime Minister's office. It gave the others key government contracts such as the rorted guns buyback advertising contract awarded to DDB Needham, with the research component of the public relations campaign carried out by Textor. It was Morris who orchestrated the fix to get them this work, despite their concepts testing disastrously.
The coalition threw other government work their way. There was a research contract for Textor on the Natural Heritage Trust. Waterfront reform research conducted by Textor cost taxpayers $42,000 alone. Who is Mark Textor, the Liberal Party pollster who was recruited out of the Northern Territory by Andrew Robb? We know that both his methodology and his analysis are morally bankrupt. He is a push pollster obsessed with negative campaigns based on emotive and racist research findings. He is unprincipled and he is dishonest. In 1990 he participated in a scheme to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory. Shane Stone, Mark Textor and Andrew Coward conspired to corruptly bill the Northern Territory government for $35,540 worth of qualitative research into various governmental and political issues in the Northern Territory.
—You are so gutless and so cowardly; you won't say this outside. You are disgrace to the Senate.
—Order! Senator Campbell, that is inappropriate language. Please do not use it.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, he is gutless and cowardly. He won't say this outside. He is disgraceful and does not deserve to be a senator. Why don't you step outside? Go and say it outside.
—Senator Campbell, regardless of your feelings about the subject matter, you must withdraw the comments you have made about Senator Faulkner—regardless of the content, which I understand you feel strongly about. Would you please withdraw your remarks?
—Madam Acting Deputy President, all senators should feel strongly about a senator defaming a character.
—Withdraw your remarks!
—I will be withdrawing. These are words that this senator would not say outside.
—You withdraw; this is not your speech.
—Senator Campbell, would you please withdraw?
—This is a premeditated character assassination of a person who cannot defend himself. I withdraw what I said about Senator Faulkner.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a further point of order. You should ask Senator Campbell to apologise to the chair. You were on your feet and he constantly interrupted, sniping from his seated position. He knows better than to put on this puerile performance, but because he cannot counteract any of the arguments we get this smearing interjection from him time and time again. It will go on all the time, Madam Acting Deputy President, unless you are firm with him.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, it might be in the interests of the good conduct of the chamber if Senator Robert Ray's point of order is noted, but we proceed with the business. In question time we have similar interjections from Senator Faulkner on the other side when Madam President is trying to keep order. I think we should just get on the business.
—That is a useful contribution, Senator O'Chee. We certainly do have interjections constantly in this place which are inappropriate and unparliamentary. That is why I asked Senator Ian Campbell to withdraw. The public is unimpressed with those kinds of interjections which both sides of this chamber engage in. I think that Senator O'Chee's suggestion, notwithstanding the comments of Senator Robert Ray, is appropriate. Senator Campbell, I ask you, notwithstanding your feelings on 
 this subject, to restrict your comments to comments that are parliamentary and not unparliamentary so that Senator Faulkner can proceed.
—Madam Deputy President, I appreciate that and I appreciate the offer made by Senator O'Chee, but I think Senator Robert Ray's advice is absolutely accurate and I should not have spoken while you were on your feet. I should not have interjected upon you and I unreservedly apologise to you and to the position of President of the Senate. I think what I did was wrong.
—Thank you.
—Madam Deputy President, could I indicate on a point of order that I kept addressing the chair because Senator Ian Campbell stood in his place and was addressing you without taking a point of order. Of course, if there was a point of order and Senator Campbell was called, I would have resumed my seat. I ask you to rule that, if a senator wishes to take a point of order—which they can at any time during a senator's contribution, particularly if they want to cover up what a senator is saying because it is so embarrassing to the Liberal Party and the National Party—they must stand in their place and seek the call. They just cannot stand up and scream across the chamber like the Manager of Government Business in the Senate who is setting such a poor example.
—I think we are all aware of the normal rules of procedure in this place and I would ask you to proceed with your speech.
—Thank you. Shane Stone, now the Northern Territory's Chief Minister, was the President of the CLP at the time. Mark Textor was employed as a researcher for the CLP and Andrew Coward was the key operative in Chief Minister Perron's office. The same research that cost Northern Territory taxpayers over $35,000—conducted by the same researcher, using the same focus groups, on the same days, in the same locations—was made available to the CLP for a mere $3,700. Every aspect of the research provided to the territory government 
 was also passed on to the CLP, but large sections of the document received by the CLP were never included in the research commissioned and paid for by the Northern Territory government.
The scheme was for the CLP and the Northern Territory government to simultaneously request research from Brian Sweeney and Associates into various governmental and political issues in the Northern Territory. The Chief Minister's office informed public servants of the parameters of the research and who would be conducting it. The public servants were never told that the CLP would piggyback on the government's research, that it would receive all of the findings and more. This is in total breach of copyright.
The public servants were also never told that taxpayers would bear the full cost of the group discussions, the group moderation expenses and the group recruitment expenses. They were never told that while the Northern Territory government would be billed $4,800 for focus group recruitment alone, the total cost to the CLP for the entire project, using the same focus groups, would be only $3,700. The public servants were never told that only swinging voters would participate in the focus groups. The public servants were never told that every focus group, in every locality, would comprise only white territorians, even though Aboriginals comprise approximately one-third of the territory's population.
The public servants were never told that the real reason for the research was contained in a memo dated 2 April 1990 and sent under the signature of Mark Textor to key CLP operatives. In that memo, Mark Textor specifically recommends that government and CLP research be run simultaneously. This memo is the genesis of the conspiracy hatched by Textor, Coward, Stone and Klein to falsely bill the territory government for the CLP's campaign research. The public servants were never told any of these things. Nor were they told that Mr Klein would totally breach his signed undertaking to the Secretary of the Chief Minister's department that all copyright would vest with the Northern Territory government. They were never told that all the research would be provided to the CLP. Nor 
 were they told that Mr Ron Klein's letter of 14 June 1990 outlining the subjects to be covered in the research, included an attachment, which no public servant ever saw, which separated the governmental from the political information requirements.
This letter makes it absolutely clear that it was always intended to illegally bill the Northern Territory government for research that was purely for the political purposes of the CLP, research that was never intended to be made available to government.
Ron Klein's 12 focus groups resulted in two reports. The first is entitled A 1990 Insight into the Northern Territory and was prepared by Ron Klein for the Northern Territory government in July 1990. I shall refer to that as `the government report'. The second report is entitled A 1990 Insight into Northern Territory Politics and was prepared by Ron Klein for the confidential attention of Shane Stone and Mark Textor of the Northern Territory CLP in July 1990. I shall refer to that as `the CLP report'.
The government report is numbered 6706, while the CLP report is numbered 6697. I ask: who from Brian Sweeney and Associates made the decision to use the deceptive device of non-consecutive numbers for these reports? I ask Brian Sweeney and Associates whether its researchers are routinely instructed to provide advice on ways to conceal copyright and billing breaches to clients? Is it standard practice for their researchers to aid and abet the defrauding of taxpayers?
The government report commences with the quote, `This document reports the findings from 12 group discussions conducted across the Northern Territory between 25 June and 3 July 1990.' The CLP report commences with the quote, `This document reports the findings from 12 group discussions conducted across the Northern Territory between 25 June and 3 July 1990.' This is not surprising. After all, the methodology of each report, contained on pages 7 and 4 respectively, is exactly the same. The group numbers, the locations, the age and gender profiles and the dates are exactly the same. The only difference is that the CLP report contained the observation that the respondents had no involvement or strong 
 affinity with any political party and every respondent in every group was white.
These two facts were deleted from the report provided to the government. In other words, the government never knew that the focus group samples were unrepresentative. They needed to be unrepresentative to suit the political parameters of the CLP. The government report, costing $35,000, runs to 46 pages. The CLP report, costing $3,700, runs to 65 pages. The CLP report includes page after page of material that they never asked for in their formal brief but, since it had been provided to the territory government, it was passed on to the CLP, in total breach of copyright.
Page after page of the report matches one another verbatim—the same layout, the same font, the same quotes, the same observations. Both reports contain the same chapter headings. In some cases, political quotes are left out of the government report but blended into the CLP report. Under the heading `The Northern Territory economy and federal funding', on pages 13 and 10 of the reports respectively, the CLP report contains the focus group quote, `It could be doing better if the government (NT) didn't waste so much money'. This quote was deleted from the government report, as were other comments relating to NT government waste.
Even though the government brief specifically sought information relating to the Sheraton hotels in Darwin, Yulara and Alice Springs, unfavourable political comments on these projects were deleted from the government report. The comments were, however, included in the CLP report. This must constitute, on Mr Klein's part, a massive breach of his legal, ethical and contractual obligations to provide the full findings of the research to this clients—the copyright for which vests with the territory government.
Time and time again aspects of the report are softened or altered so that the government report, for which taxpayers were billed over $35,000, is a weaker, less precise and less informative document. Time and again, salient observations and quotes are left out. The only conclusion is that the Northern Territory government was provided with a useless 
 document—research without any hard edges—a document which would gather dust.
The real findings, contained in the CLP report, start on page 44. Remember, the government report ran to only 46 pages. The first of the chapter headings in the CLP report that is not matched in the government report is headed `An introductory comment on the local political arena'. Mr Klein's research told the CLP that there were perceptions of government waste; that the government lacked experience and maturity; that they were helping out their mates—and he wasn't wrong there—and that too many territory contracts were being offered interstate. That, I might say, was from the Melbourne-based Mr Klein. On it goes until page 64—20 pages of political findings. So one-third of the research the government never saw.
The NT public servants were merely the mugs who provided the taxpayer-funded structure around which the CLP could conduct its real political research. This research then formed the basis of the CLP's election campaign, run by DDB Needham, in October 1990. This is not only dishonest and unethical, it is also corrupt. The operatives involved—Textor, Stone, Klein and Coward—conspired to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory.
Mark Textor's involvement in territory politics did not end with the Sweeney swindle of 1990. On 14 April 1993, Mark Textor's business—Territory Focus Consulting—entered into a contract with the Northern Territory government to provide research during 1993-94. The business name was registered with the ASC on the same day. In other words, registering the business name was simply a device to enable a paid coalition political operative to be engaged on voter research at taxpayer expense in the run-up to the election. The contract was for 12 months and the fee was $740 per day. The services that Textor was to provide were described, in deliberately vague terms, in two lines in schedule 3 of the contract. I quote:
The consultant shall provide to the Territory advice on community attitudes towards government programmes and initiatives as required. 

It was never intended that Textor would perform anything other than political research for the CLP. By July, Textor was providing advice to the private staff of Chief Minister Perron. In a letter to Andrew Coward, dated 16 July 1993 and marked `private and confidential', Textor, a consultant engaged by the NT government on a $740 a day taxpayer-funded consultancy, provided details of the voter research that he intended to conduct.
Time and again his research intentions refer to voters. He writes of determining `what factors are most important in influencing voter behaviour'. He advises Coward that `a campaign researcher needs regular voter contact in order to put his or her findings in their proper historical context and to properly interpret subtle changes in attitude'. He writes:
My groups were intended to be nothing more than a `snap shot' read, or the first of a series of updates of the general political mood of the under 35 target market in the northern suburbs to see what (and if) further research was required and in what directions.
That goes to the heart of the scam. Textor's work was political. The letter to Coward was faxed from the Liberal Party's national headquarters in Canberra. In further faxes in September 1993, Textor describes the focus groups he is setting up for further research. He describes the processes that will be used to weed out committed voters. The evidence is unambiguous. Textor's research is political. Indeed, he boasts that he has seen `more political focus groups than anyone in Australia over the last two years'. It is totally political. It serves no other purpose than the development of campaign strategies for the CLP. Yet it is paid for by the taxpayers of the Northern Territory.
The documents that we have in our possession and which are now being tabled, or soon to be tabled, in the Northern Territory parliament show the contempt that Mark Textor has for public accountability and ethical standards. They show that he is both an initiator and an active participant in conspiracies to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory. This man is John Howard's own political pollster. This is a person appointed by the Liberal Party, nationally, to conduct their research.
Some of these scams were actually conducted by Textor while operating out of the Liberal Party national secretariat and using their equipment. This is a person considered suitable for government research projects for the Commonwealth of Australia. But we say this about Mark Textor. We say that he is a person unfit to receive government work in this country. We say that, in a democracy, political parties must observe some standards in respect of their own advertising and research.	We say that Mark Textor is not fit to be retained as the chief pollster of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister of Australia.
We say that Mark Textor conspired with Shane Stone, Ron Klein and Andrew Coward to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory and we say that Mark Textor also conspired to use his business name, Territory Focus Consulting, to further defraud territory taxpayers by conducting political research for the CLP under a bogus government contract. We say that both the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party are tainted by their association with and involvement in dealings with one of the lowest, most unethical, most grubby political operatives Australia has seen.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I take a point of order. We have been very restrained on this side while the Leader of the Opposition has been reading his speech and ranting and raving and carrying on. I would like to seek some advice from you. He is constantly slandering and abusing an individual, making wild and extreme claims about this person. What protection does this person have in this parliament to stop Senator Faulkner behaving in this quite disgraceful manner?
—There is no point of order. I think you, like all other honourable senators, are aware of references to the Privileges Committee.
—We do need a committee of inquiry in order to establish whether the Textor modus operandi has ever been used at the federal level. I think the parliament needs to know whether Textor was given contracts for market research by this government and, if so, whether those contracts were for backdoor, taxpayer funded polling 
 for the coalition or whether they were won on the basis of the merits of his bid.
We say that Textor's market research for the federal government needs to be examined in detail and we also say that a only a Senate inquiry is likely to do that. I commend the motion to the Senate. I have provided the minister at the table with a copy of documentation and I seek leave to table that material.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,12,2,speech

There are some hundreds of pages, by the look of it, in this material. The normal courtesies, as usual with Senator Faulkner, were not observed.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—I was the person who denied formality when this motion was proposed in the first place. I must admit I was disorderly, to the point of interjecting a little later and saying, `Nobody tells us anything.' There was, I believe, a message left last night on my answer phone from the Manager of Government Business to call him. I received the message this morning but I have not had that call. There has been no discussion between the government and the Greens (WA) in relation to the matter of the sitting weeks.
I wanted to ask basic questions like, `Is this going to be government business only? Will we have a normal sitting period? Can we debate the issues?' The point was to say that the government ought to put some words on the record as to what is happening with their program and why they have made their mind up.
Now I notice that there was an agreement between the government and the opposition. They made an agreement to swap statements when the formality was going to be pushed through this morning. That arrangement was not passed through to me either. So, if the government wants to progress at this time of the year, I would suggest a better form of communication. Don't just take parties like the Greens for granted. Try to actually discuss with us the reasons for making decisions.
In fact, we are having difficulty at the moment: we are running out of legislation. I realise, as was hastily mentioned at the whips meeting last night, that there is more legislation coming on as a result of committees that have not finalised their deliberations. I also note that it has been suggested that a bill which was never on the list of 10 November is now coming on—an environmental bill that was not even on the list. The government is going to be ranting and raving at some stage about the recalcitrance of the Senate when there is a major environmental bill which, we are now told, it is hoping to debate before December, before Christmas.
It has to have it one way or the other. It has to tell us what it is doing. Quite frankly, there are great difficulties. We are supposed to be debating a bill, whenever this debate finishes, when we still have not had the government's amendments. The government did not tell us until the day before yesterday that it was not planning to take anybody else's views into consideration. All the different parties, I can see, are now just circulating amendments; nobody has had a chance to look at them. I think if the government wants cooperation on its program it has got to give cooperation to everybody else. We have just received the amendments from the opposition; the Greens and the Democrats have been working all hours to try to get our amendments together; and the government was sitting on its hands, not giving advice on that particular bill, and we will deal with that more when we get back to the committee stage of the bill.
Fair is fair in this place. If the government is going to get up and rant and rave about the Senate, then it has to look at not just the management of the program but its own means of communication—what it is doing and when—with ample time for all parties to be adequately covered and for the Senate system—the library system, the legal system and everybody else who needs that time—to be properly prepared. It would have been nice. Now I can see that the deal has been done and finally the vote is going through, but I simply wanted to say that this kind of motion should not have gone through as a formal nod and a wink motion because it 
 needed to be at least explained and put on the public record.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-26,"—Madam Temporary Chairman, I know that we are waiting for the minister to come. I have circulated a number of amendments. I have not actually moved them. As I understand it privately, the government has accepted the opposition's amendments. Is that correct?
—Yes.
—These are the ones that have been circulated in my name. I think that, in view of the information that the government has accepted my amendments, it might be best if we now move to the minor parties' amendments and have the debate over those.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—As I was venting some of my spleen in the debate on the previous motion, I would like to round that off by explaining why I was so concerned about this Space Activities Bill 1998  as we move into the committee stage. We are all finding that as we come into the chamber there are amendments which we have only just seen, which have just arrived into our hands. The government may say, and the usual set piece is, `Why weren't people well prepared?' We have been trying very hard over the last week to move as quickly as possible on this bill.
It is one of those bills which is potentially of much greater import than meets the eye initially because we may discover—or find out later on with subsequent bills in the next week or so—that sometimes a bill which seems to be dealing with just one issue may in fact potentially be dealing with other issues in the future. So a lot of work had to be done to find out what the issues were. There did not seem to be time to get the usual assistance 
 that would normally speed things along—like the ability to get a Bills Digest in time—because of the government's handling of this. Our officers have been trying to gain information from the government about concerns we have had for some time and they were very late in coming back to us. I understand the situation was similar for the Australian Democrats. Getting amendments circulated by today required a great deal of effort.
In this particular case, all the parties involved have been working their way through this bill. As I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, it is very useful to have legislation dealing with space activities because Australia is getting more into those activities and is likely to have some commercial pressure for future activities. However, all of these kinds of activities ought to be carefully considered. If there are military or corporate implications or implications for Australia being a good global citizen then these ought to be carefully considered. We need the opportunity to look at the bill carefully. We also need the opportunity to look at the amendments.
The last amendments we received in this flurry of activity leading up to the bill being called on again in the committee stage were in fact the government's. So the last group of amendments to be looked at and considered are the government's amendments. It may well be that there has been discussion between the government and the opposition on these issues, but there has been less discussion between the government and parties like the Greens (WA) on these issues. There may even have to be a new running sheet. Senator Schacht has suggested that we go straight to the Democrats amendments and the Green (WA) amendments. That is fine, but where do the government's amendments fit in, and why weren't we given these a little earlier than now?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-26,"—On the same subject of this Space Activities Bill 1998 , I echo some of the comments of Senator Margetts. I should note that my office has received excellent assistance from the 
 minister's office. I have found the minister's office particularly agreeable in assisting my office.
—Don't encourage them.
—Senator Schacht, I would appreciate it if you would not walk between the speaker and the chair and have a conversation between the speaker and the chair.
—The difficulty for everyone concerned has been the time line. Senator Margetts is correct in saying that the response to some particular queries came through fairly late before we began this debate yesterday. I note now that the Greens (WA) amendments and the Democrats amendments have been circulated. Certainly my amendments have been drawn to the attention of the minister's office. I understand that you have given us indications as to what is acceptable and what could perhaps be amended. We have yet to see the opposition's amendments. I am not suggesting that there is any fault on anyone's behalf in getting these.
—It is not a conspiracy.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-26,"—Are you suggesting that we defer the committee stage to a later time? The opposition is happy to continue with the committee stage now. The opposition amendments are being circulated, as I understand it. The government has accepted our amendments, as I understand it. The Democrats amendments and the Green (WA) amendments, as I understand it, are not acceptable to the government, and they are not acceptable to the opposition. That is what I am advised.
In order to continue with the committee stage now, I am proposing we progress this by dealing with the Democrats amendments and the Green (WA) amendments, which, it appears, neither the government nor the 
 opposition support. That is the advice I have received. The government has apparently accepted the opposition amendments, though the Greens (WA) and the Democrats may oppose them. I propose we deal with those later on if it does not affect the running sheet order too much.

The government agree with the opposition; we want to proceed with the committee stage. We do regard this bill as urgent. It has been introduced to the Senate so we can have this debate. Then it will go to the House. I point out to Senator Stott Despoja that, as a senator for South Australia, it is important she recognise the importance of this legislation in relation to a most important project in South Australia—the Kistler project. One of the reasons we regard this as urgent legislation is to enable the Kistler project to proceed within the framework of this legislation. I appreciate the pressure on the minor parties in relation to legislation but in this case we do have the opposition and government by and large in agreement as to where this bill should go. There is urgency with it. We will debate the amendments. There are a few that are acceptable to the government; others we oppose.

This really is not acceptable, and I think that in this particular case I am 
 prepared to move that the debate on this bill be adjourned. Quite frankly, it is not acceptable. It is a case of, `We have a deal stitched up, so we are all right, mate.' There is no context of what that deal is and what the government amendments say, and I don't think it is reasonable. I move:

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-26,"—For the record, this is not so much a case of rocket science, as Senator Schacht has pointed out, but it is a case of Lost in Space. I suggest that it is the opposition's amendments that were lost in space.
—They are now circulated.
—Terrific. Thanks.
—Senator Margetts was correct in suggesting that perhaps in this committee stage debate a couple of the parties may have been somewhat disfranchised in this process. I and my office have had 15 minutes to look at the amendments—the deal, if you like, that has been struck between the government and the opposition. You have a perfect right to exchange those amendments and make decisions, but, Senator Schacht, we have not had an opportunity to examine your amendments. I realise that they are acceptable to the government and therefore they will be passed. Yes, I do note also, Minister, that I am sure it is no coincidence that there are three South Australians debating this bill, so the significance is not lost on me.
—Two parties want space activities, one doesn't.
—However, there are some significant elements of this bill which we believe should be teased out and in fact amended. I suggest that not the least of these relate to environmental concerns that we have with the bill and concerns to do with weaponry and harm. These are not trivial matters, and I guess we will proceed on that basis. I move my first amendment:
(1)	 Clause 8, page 5 (lines 24 to 31), omit the definition of  liability period , substitute: 

 liability period  means:
(a)	 for the launch of a space object—the period beginning when the launch takes place and ending when the return period begins; and
(b)	 for the return of a space object—the period beginning when the relevant re-entry manoeuvre or other re-entry event begins and ending when the object has come to rest on Earth.
	 Note:	 The liability period for an object which does not return to Earth is therefore open-ended.
The clause that I seek to amend provides definitions for the operation of the bill. The term `liability period' is defined in that clause to mean:
(a)	 for the launch of a space object—the period of 30 days beginning when the launch takes place or such other period as is specified in the regulations; and
(b)	 for the return of a space object—the period beginning when the relevant re-entry manoeuvre has begun and ending when the object has come to rest on Earth, or such other period as is specified in the regulations.
—That could be 30 years, if it is a satellite.
—That is in the bill. The effect of this provision is to specify a liability period which is limited and in particular leaves out the period after the launch and before the re-entry manoeuvre. This is particularly concerning because this creates a scheme which is incomplete.
The amendment that I am proposing on behalf of the Democrats would make the liability period cover the entire time from the launch until the time the object returns to the surface of the earth. This is achieved by changing the definition of the term `liability period', which then flows into the operation of the bill, for example, in clause 62, which provides for damage covered and distinguishes between a launch and a return. The amendment proposes extending the launch period to cover the existing launch period as well as the time the object is in space and until the object begins a planned re-entry or an event which results in re-entry. Where there is no re-entry, such as where the object is sent out of the earth orbit into the furthest regions of space, 
 like the Galileo probes, the launch period will be open-ended.
Importantly, removing the existing definition avoids unfairness in the application and apportionment of liability. For example, the period of 30 days after a launch appears to be a fairly arbitrary figure. Certainly the minister can feel free to explain the rationale for that figure. I accept the assurances from the minister that damage after this period is improbable. But should we again overlook the risk—this is something I touched on in my speech on the second reading—just because there is a low risk? And, if it is very improbable, then the indemnity will reflect this. Further, the launches are supposed to be low risk, yet there is a distinction between damage within 30 days and another later period after the launch.
The change to the return provision is also necessary to take account of the chance of an accidental return to earth as a result of an event causing re-entry. Accidents do happen, and this may result in the return of materials to earth. These are events that do happen and, although infrequent, they should be taken into consideration in this legislative scheme. I set out in my speech on the second reading an outline of the number of objects in space and the increasing numbers. The ESA, the European Space Operation Centre, has a debris database of more than 1.7 million elements, and it is adding nearly 30,000 new elements each month. This does not include the tens of thousands of elements less than 10 centimetres wide which can be deadly. For example, a one-millimetre object travelling at 10 kilometres per second will penetrate most satellites and can cause failure of the satellite. These can cause accidents.
—They won't hit someone in Australia.
—You will have your turn, Senator Schacht. On 24 July 1996 a French military satellite was struck by a piece of space debris from the break-up of an upper stage of an Ariane rocket in November 1986. The debris, travelling at nearly 15 kilometres per second, severed the satellite's gravity gradient boom. This event disabled the satellite and turned it into debris. These 
 fragments are returning, albeit slowly, to earth and, although unlikely to cause damage to the earth's surface because most of it is water or unpopulated, there is always the potential that it can cause damage.
We all remember the 90-tonne Skylab which returned to earth in Senator Margetts's home state of Western Australia in 1979. It would have caused devastation had it struck the east coast. Similarly, a stainless steel container weighing several hundred kilos from the Delta second stage of a US MS-X satellite survived re-entry to land near Georgetown in Texas. Although there have been no recorded fatalities, the potential is there. This is increased with the amount of debris. These are the potential events which are not covered by the present provisions. I think they should be covered.
Finally, the cost to those launching objects into space will undoubtedly increased. This is a cost which eventually will have to be taken on by somebody. If an accident happens and a third party is affected, this amendment says that they should look to the party responsible for the launch or return. An Australian national should not have to use the common law to enforce their rights because of an omission in this bill. The Commonwealth should not be liable by virtue of its international obligations to foreign nationals. The cost shifting in the present provision is unfair and the Democrats believe that this amendment will reflect this.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—The Greens (WA) are certainly prepared to support Senator Stott Despoja's amendment No. 1. I want to refer to two interjections made by Senator Schacht. In the first he said, `Two parties want space activities, one doesn't.' I think he was saying that the government and the opposition want space activities, but the minor parties—the Greens and the Democrats—do not.
I would like to clarify that. I remind the space cadets here that what the Greens and Democrats are saying is that, if we have space activities, we want well-regulated and safe space activities. That is not the same as one wanting it and one not. That is a fairly puerile way of dealing with the issue. The way this has been negotiated is along those lines. It is 
 a matter of testosterone-pushed, big guys toys. We are interested in community concerns. I remind Senator Schacht that he is not the minister. He has the same responsibility as everybody else to look after the concerns of his electorate.
The second interjection from Senator Schacht was, `They won't hit people in Australia.' He is forgetting the fact that there may well be potential for space junk to create damage elsewhere or in space. If we are getting the benefits and profits of having commercial operations in Australia, then we should also take the responsibility of any problems associated with those commercial operations.
I do not think it is a good example of how this debate is going to go when puerile comments are made across the chamber, with people doubting that the concerns of the community—and of informed members of the community—ought to be taken into consideration. When in the past I dealt with the issue of shipping liability, I did not get a good responses from the then government, which is now the opposition.
In my opinion, liability is about taking responsibility for activities that are in your waters or, in this particular case, taking responsibility for the activities in your region from which you are prepared to take profits. If it is considered that, on balance, these space activities are going to be beneficial, then we must also be prepared to accept liability for anything that goes wrong as a result of these activities. These are the real costs of those activities.
Yesterday, I mentioned the example of the Cassini probe. If any reasonable risk analysis had been done in any way, shape or form by any reputable company throughout the world, the risks of the Cassini probe would have far outweighed any potential benefits, but it was never done. The responsibility for that was never accepted by the United States. The enormous, horrifying, appalling risk was just pushed under the carpet under the guise of secrecy, national security or something else.
That risk was never accepted by the United States, NASA, or anybody else just for the sake of seeing how far technology could go. 
 It is amazing that 72 kilograms of plutonium could, with impunity, be put at risk and that the lives of so many billions of people throughout the world could be put at risk for the sake of a technological achievement. Would anyone in their wildest imagination have said that this would pass any reasonable risk analysis? The answer is: no, of course it would not.
Does Australia think this is the kind of thing we should be aspiring to? As we get to some of the later amendments, you will see that this kind of use is not beyond the scope of the legislation as it has been written. It does not preclude military operations, it does not preclude what the space activity is used for, and so we have to deal with the issue of liability.
We have to deal with the government taking a responsible role in calculating and having some input into whether the liability is reasonable and into who is going to manage that liability—whether the companies involved have the wherewithal to manage the liability for any reasonable risk that they are associated with.
This is not a laughing matter. It is not a matter of people who want space activities or do not want space activities. It is a matter of taking seriously the responsibility that we are all given as members of parliament and the responsibility which, in this particular case, is being shared by the people who definitely have fewer resources than the government and the opposition to deal with it. We are trying to do that. I support Democrats amendment No. 1.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I appreciate that some of my interjections may have been misunderstood by Senator Margetts, but when Senator Stott Despoja gave a technical list of the amount of space junk that was floating around—I am not disputing the list and the material—it did not contain those many thousands of items of less than a very small size that are floating around in space.
My understanding of the physics is that, if very small items the size of a bolt, a nut or a piece of metal fall back into the atmosphere, they burn up because of the speed they are 
 travelling at. I may be wrong, but that is how I understand it. Therefore, to citizens on the globe—on the surface of the earth—it is not a risk. I accept that it may be a risk to another satellite and it may be a risk to astronauts who are in a space station, but that is not what this legislation is about. It is about providing the protection for Australian citizens going about their general daily business in Australia.
—What about international citizenship and international obligation?
—We are about protecting Australian citizens from—putting it crudely—having a piece of space junk or a part of a rocket fall on them and causing substantial injury, either personally or to their property. The basis of my interjection was that when material that was unlisted in Senator Stott Despoja's information falls back—
—What about plutonium in the atmosphere?
—I don't think Senator Stott Despoja indicated that those small pieces of space junk were pieces of plutonium, which you are now trying to imply, Senator Margetts. I think that this argument that we are getting into is not about the question of liability for protection of Australian citizens.
—We never said it was.
—I interjected on Senator Stott Despoja—which I think you choose to misinterpret—because I am  trying to clarify. The issue I want to put to the minister, vis-a-vis the impact of the clause moved by the Democrats, is whether we have any estimations of the costs of taking out insurance to cover the impact of the Democrats—
—That is the real cost of the operation.
—Yes, that becomes a cost of the operation. Secondly, Senator Stott Despoja wants to amend page 5, lines 24 to 31 of the bill. I want to ask the minister whether what the government has proposed in its bill is similar to legislation for insurance liability of other countries in the Western world. I want to know whether the government's proposal to provide protection and 
 liability is operating elsewhere in the Western world. If it is similar, then I think that it is reasonable that the government supports it. Minister, is the structure about the liability period in lines 24 to 31 similar to what the United States, Canada and the European countries use in drafting their regulatory regime about liability?  What Senator Stott Despoja is moving is significantly different. Her amendment says:
(a)	 for the launch of a space object—the period beginning when the launch takes place and ending when the return period begins; and
(b)	 for the return of a space object—the period beginning when the relevant re-entry manoeuvre or other re-entry event begins and ending when the object has come to rest on Earth.
Minister, if the rocket is launching a satellite that is going to be in orbit around the earth—whether it be low earth orbiting or geostationary or anything else in between—does the Democrat amendment mean that the liability period applies forever and a day until that satellite disappears or burns up? In 30 years time, if it did re-enter the atmosphere and a small part of it came down to earth, does that mean the liability would have to cover the life of that satellite until it either completely burnt up or was removed by some other means in space? If so, is it equivalent to other Western countries with space programs, and do they have similar liability arrangements? If they do not, I would imagine there is going to be a substantial difference in insurance liability costs to meet the demands of Senator Stott Despoja.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-26,"—In putting together this bill, the department has undertaken significant consultation with the space industry in Australia and overseas and has examined all international practice to determine an appropriate regime for Australia. The 30-day period that we have set reflects the best international practice. It does mirror the US arrangements. It is at the high end of the commercial requirements that are set internationally. There is no nation on earth with a space industry that has a clause like the one proposed in the Democrats amendments. It would mean, as Senator 
 Schacht has implied, that a liability would fall on the launcher to cover or accept liability for a period which could run for years and years.
We think that the periods where there is danger are the launch itself and a controlled re-entry, which our bill covers. We think the period of 30 days after launch is more than appropriate and complies with and mirrors best practice internationally. We are about endeavouring to get a space industry under way in Australia. We think that has enormous benefits for Australia, with significant spin-offs in technology, science and other things that, we understand, the Democrats support. There is a real risk that an amendment like this would render the space industry stillborn and that we would be so unattractive a place to engage in launches that people simply would go elsewhere. We are adopting best international practice in our proposal.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—If countries like the United States or the former Soviet Union are limiting their liability, I would not consider that to be world best practice. It is probably a very low hurdle, and I do not think it is something we should be aiming to mirror.
One should ask whose liability it is. Having put stuff into space on the basis of making profits—and these are commercial operations to make money—who should accept the liability? I would argue it should be the people who are making money out of it. It might be shared by the people who are using the satellite. I would argue, quite distinctly from Senator Schacht, that that is the real cost of those operations.
If we do not include that liability, then we have a subsidised cost. If there is no risk whatsoever, then the liability insurance obviously is not going to be particularly high—and that can be argued. If all the technical arguments say that the risks are almost infinitesimal, then the insurance companies will be able to work out those risks themselves. They have to operate in a commercial environment themselves.
If, however, there are substantial risks—and those risks could be extremely costly at some stage in terms of, for instance, possible pollution of the atmosphere or some other 
 major concern—then they must be built into the cost of the operation. You cannot talk about international competitiveness unless you have built those costs in at some stage; otherwise the global community will be subsidising this operation on the basis of satellite users and launch operators making a profit or getting a benefit.
If there is a benefit, and if it is a reasonable benefit, then the users and profiteers, the people making the profit—and that is fine—should work out what those real costs are. There is no point in saying, `Well, these costs go so far into the future it is unreasonable to cost them.' It is like someone putting major radioactive waste into the ground—assuming that someone can make a profit by putting it there—and then, after 10 or 20 years, pretending that their responsibility or liability is finished so they plant trees over the top and go away. 
The Greens (WA) have always argued that that should not be the case. There should not be the ability for people to do that with things like nuclear waste. If this is the way the government and the opposition are dealing with the 30-year issue of liability, what on earth could we expect should there ever be the horrifying concept of a major international radioactive waste dump in Australia? I hope it never happens. Can you imagine—if this is the attitude to liability now with a 30-year proposal for putting something into space—that somehow or other, because it is there for so long, the liability for having put it there in the first place should stop? I do not think the arguments hold water.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-26,"—Like Senator Margetts, the Australian Democrats believe in the concept of intergenerational equity; that is, that we have responsibility—
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I notice the exchange of looks across the chamber between the men. It is a concept where you—
—Are we going to be hounded all day because we just happen to be blokes at this end of the Senate?
—I think it is more symbolic than that. We believe in that concept, which does ensure a degree of responsibility for those who inhabit the earth now, hopefully leaving it, if not in the same state, in a much improved state for those who follow us. Senator Margetts is correct in claiming that, if this risk is so small, the insurance and the liability will reflect that.
To answer Senator Schacht's comments earlier about space debris, I mentioned that lots of space junk is larger than 10 centimetres. I also talked about space debris that is smaller than 10 centimetres, and I acknowledge that that can be deadly. Senator Schacht talked about that burning up. One of the examples that I gave was of debris actually having the potential to disarm satellites, to break up satellites. But there are many examples.
So I was not necessarily talking about objects smaller than 10 centimetres rushing to earth, knocking senators on the head and causing some kind of fatal accident. But there are possibilities for this space junk to cause other accidents. It can disarm satellites, which again could cause accidents. We have many examples of fragments coming to earth—with not too many fatal consequences thus far, but that is not to say that it will not happen.
I acknowledge the minister's response to Senator Schacht in relation to comparable international laws. I mirror again some of Senator Margetts's concerns in that area. Just because legislation exists in other countries in the Western world—such as in Canada and the United States—it does not mean that we cannot seek to improve and refine it and, as the minister stated, have legislation that is an appropriate regime for Australia. That is all we are seeking to achieve with these amendments.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—I move:
(1)	 Clause 18, page 14 (after line 9), after paragraph (a), insert: 

(aa)		 the Minister is satisfied that all necessary environmental approvals under Australian law have been obtained, and that an adequate environmental plan has been made, for the construction and operation of the launch facility; and
(ab)	 the Minister is satisfied that all necessary processes and consultations required under the Native Title Act 1993  or other Australian laws relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land or cultural rights in relation to the construction or operation of the launch facility, have been completed; and
Here we are looking at the issue of environmental and Aboriginal approvals. It is one of the issues that we worked through to find what was missing from this legislation.
It may be obvious that major projects like spaceports need environmental approval, but it is not in the legislation. We believe that it is too important to be left to regulation at some later stage.
Possible environmental issues include construction and clearing, especially if you are dealing with areas which are considered remote, such as island communities like Christmas Island or areas where Aboriginal land is concerned—and I will get to that later. Clearing of areas in tropical wetlands or otherwise is of concern, as are geotechnical issues and foundations; aesthetics; materials used in the containment of waste and rubbish, radioactive or otherwise; the impact on the coast of any marine facility; and the processes for minimising the impact of construction.
We should be looking at the impact of the facility; the security of the fuel or the containment processes, the communications systems, transport in and out—roads, airstrips, et cetera—and issues regarding materials being transported; the use of resources by the facility—that is, water and power, especially if they are remote or arid areas; waste project management—that is, domestic or industrial; and basically all the things you would expect to be reviewed in any major project. And we are talking major projects here.
There are also the impacts specific to the space facility—issues of the types of launcher vehicle, the fuel system, the payloads, and so on. Possibly most important are the proced 
 ures in place to minimise the impact of accidents. The possible impact of a variety of accidents would need thorough examination. In the case of the proposed space probe at Christmas Island, it means looking at the equipment and the technology that is being used and asking for specific information on what that would be. Currently, there is an environmental review process into that, but if such a process  is not made necessary by legislation the community will be left out of that process. The launch pad, following take-off, further into the flight and so on, are other things to be considered.
I am not just concerned about accidents to do with the launch; I am concerned about other aspects of the facility, for example, an explosion in its fuel store or leaks of toxic materials. Another issue to do with the proposal on Christmas Island is that superheated steam will come from the launch process. It is not an accident; that is what happens. We have to consider the rainforest, important bird species, and so on. All those things have to be taken into consideration. There needs to be a process of examining the environmental impacts on each of these areas in which activity takes place.
The list of things which make for a thorough environmental impact statement could go on and on, but the most important thing is the process that is set in train to ensure there is full and open consultation with the affected communities—the scientific community and the broader community. It is not just the local people who have specific information on these issues. The way to ensure this is to have a reference to the necessary environmental approvals written into the bill.
The second part of our amendment deals with Aboriginal approvals. This part of our amendment has been moved for the same reason as the first part: to get specific mention of these things in the act so that nothing can be done to get around the necessity for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be respected. Unfortunately, the record of the government on this is not good. The opposition will remember the debates that have occurred on this. The debacle over the proposal for a space facility at Cape York is 
 a very clear example of the government's record on this issue.	Aboriginal people must have the right to negotiate on any major development on their land, and there is no room for any exemption for space activities.
One aspect of the current proposals that is of concern is the haste with which the issue is being pursued. Contracts have been entered into and deals done already. If this is the way the industry operates, enormous pressure will be put on Aboriginal communities. These must be taken into account in planning for these projects. If it means the project is held up for awhile, then so be it. The project will be better in the long run if it is done in full consultation with local Aboriginal communities. The project should be required to include consideration of cultural impact as well as environmental impact.
I do urge support. I believe the government are prepared to look at this amendment, and I urge the support of the rest of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we support these amendments to clause 18, page 14, after line 9, as described by Senator Margetts. I do not know whether this means that my testosterone level is dropping at all, Senator Stott Despoja, but they are reasonable amendments. The opposition is always reasonable about improving legislation.
—I did not make that comment.
—I'm afraid that was me.
—I see. I am sorry—it was Senator Margetts. Anyway, we think that these are quite reasonable. I understand the government will probably support them, and I think that is good. The opposition does not in any way want to railroad anything that the law requires elsewhere in environmental investigation and research into the development of environmental impact statements. That is now a natural part of Australian public policy. It should be supported.
We strongly support the rights under the Native Title Act. As some of these areas, including Woomera, are clearly areas where the Native Title Act will operate, there are 
 Aboriginal people who have an appropriate and proper claim—an association with the land that Woomera itself covers. As I understand it, they have been consulted in considerable detail going back several years to when the previous government started the process of trying to reactivate Woomera as a space launching facility. Those consultations have continued. As I understand it, only a few months ago the representatives of the Aboriginal people who have a claim to that area approved the Kistler project. As understand it, those consultations have been agreed to.
This is an example of how good land rights issues should be dealt with between government, between the private sector and between the appropriate aboriginal people. Therefore the opposition supports this amendment.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-26,"—Similarly, the Australian Democrats will support the Greens (WA) amendment which adds some requirements to the existing measures set out in the provision, namely, necessary environmental approvals,  together with the necessary processes and consultations under the Native Title Act 1993.
We think it is a worthy amendment because of the fact that it clarifies the requirements for the granting of a space licence, and it also reflect worthy ideals and considerations. For those reasons we will be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-26,"—We are prepared to accept part (aa) of the amendment. I understand it exactly reflects an opposition or ALP amendment which we had already indicated we would be prepared to accept. All these projects will have to satisfy all necessary environmental approvals anyway and a requirement of this kind was to be in the regulations, so we do not object to it being brought forward into the act.
I have only just been able to turn my mind to part (ab). I would have to say I have always had a concern about the extent to which Australian parliaments want to legislate to excess, to the detriment of every Australian, and include in bills completely unneces 
 sary clauses which become lawyers' picnics and create extraordinary difficulty for Australians who want to just get on and create jobs and wealth.
It seems to me that (ab) is an unnecessary paragraph. The fact is that a launch facility cannot be built unless all the requirements under the Native Title Act or other laws relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights are satisfied.
—Because of the Native Title Act itself.
—Yes, a state government would be acting illegally if it granted the right to construct a launch facility in contravention of either its own or the federal Native Title Act. Therefore, this is completely unnecessary. I do have some concern about the extent to which we introduce completely unnecessary clauses, the extent to which we create an additional regulatory burden, the extent to which we create the avenue for hostile, time wasting and resource consuming legal action. I therefore have great concern about (ab), simply on that ground—that you cannot proceed to construct a launch facility unless all the relevant Aboriginal land and heritage matters have been dealt with. Any government  proposing to authorise such a construction would be acting illegally if it attempted to do so, and that would be actionable. Any affected party could bring an action to prevent the construction in the first place. So, on balance, I would much prefer that this paragraph was not there. At this stage I indicate my opposition to (ab).",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—The existence of the 1993 Native Title Act—can I be churlish enough to mention—has not stopped the Western Australian government from failing to undertake a number of their commitments in relation to mining under the 1993 Native Title Act. So the very existence of it does not stop state governments from acting against the interests of—nor compel them to participate in proper consultation with—indigenous land-owners. In the case of some islands that Australia might be negotiating with, the Australian government might be the administrative body, so the reality is that there is a very good 
 reason that we should put this in legislation, that we should make it as clear as possible in relation to such activities. I would still urge the government to take responsibility for making sure that this is clear in this legislation.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-26,"—I simply repeat the point that the law is clear in relation to native title and other Aboriginal cultural matters. Any state government purporting to act in contravention of them would be acting illegally and would be subject to legal action under those pieces of legislation to prevent them authorising—in this case—the construction of a launch facility. The Western Australian state government has not knowingly contravened any law.
Every state government, after the passage of the 1993 act, based on the understood law at that time and in relation to the statements of the then government, understood that, in relation to pastoral leases, native title had been extinguished and they could therefore issue various licences and leases over such land. That was made in good faith. We did not know that that was illegal until the Wik decision at the end of 1996. From that point on, no leases or licences were issued over pastoral leases—once it became evident that as a matter of common law native title could survive on a pastoral lease. That was anyone's understanding of the law up to that point. So it is not true to say that the Western Australian government was acting knowingly in contravention of any such law.
As I say, there is every legal avenue for complainants to stop any illegal activity by a state government in relation to space launch facilities now. Therefore, I assert that this paragraph is completely unnecessary and should not be accepted.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—If (aa) is acceptable, there is no reason, except the fact that we happen to have mentioned indigenous people and money in the same clause, for the government to make a distinction. I really think this is an appalling process of bracketing out any issues of rights under indigenous people as an exception whenever there is money to be made.
Amendment agreed to.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Margetts, (1)(ab), be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I move:
(1)	 Clause 18, page 14 (after line 9), after paragraph (a), insert:
(aa)	 the Minister is satisfied that the person has sufficient funding to construct and operate the launch facility; and
(ab)	 the Minister is satisfied that the probability of the construction and operation of the launch facility causing substantial harm to public health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is sufficiently low;
This amendment expands the government's proposal relating to the granting of a space licence. We believe that this will strengthen what should be required. We believe the amendment will bring about better public policy because it will improve the conditions to be satisfied before the minister will grant a space licence.
The first part of the amendment ensures that a person has sufficient funding to construct and operate a launch facility. I can remember many of the proposals that floated around when I was a minister. For the Cape York Peninsula proposal we made it very clear that before the government would even attempt to start the process of an environmental impact statement and other approvals, a substantial amount of money had to be transparently deposited in an appropriate bank to show that the consortium proposing the project had the financial resources to see it through.
We believe that there will always be some people with a brilliant idea who hope that the money will turn up at a later stage. We certainly do not want to have proposals which are half-completed and then left in limbo because the money runs out. This is a very important proposition.
The second part of the amendment seeks to ensure that the minister is satisfied that the probability of the construction and operation of the launch facility causing substantial harm to public health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is sufficiently low. I believe that that gives a broader indication to the community that these are the issues of public safety which the minister must take on board.
In moving this amendment, Minister, I want to ask a specific question. When the minister, under this legislation, approves the licence for a space activity, will that approval be publicised in the government Gazette, in an appropriate document of the government, or in a press release well before the launch so that, if there is any public debate needed or somebody has a concern about the particular project, they can raise that issue? I think it is important for public transparency and for confidence in the process that a licence given by the minister for a particular launch or a group of launches is made public and, if there is any contention, public debate can take place about the approval well before the launch is committed or the consortium has started to expend what may be large amounts of money. I do not have this as an amendment, but how do you envisage making public the minister's approval for granting a space licence for a launch to take place?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-26,"—I expect that, without legislative prerogative, the granting of a space licence would be a matter of wide public dissemination. Obviously the government would be very keen to ensure that the whole world knew that you had agreed to grant a space licence. The community concerned would obviously be very interested to know. The imperatives would clearly be to ensure that there was widespread knowledge of such an occurrence. I really do not think it is necessary to build in a regulatory or legislative regime to ensure publicity that a space licence has been granted—it is hardly going to be a big secret.
There is a long process to go through in relation to the grant. The recipients of the licence would be very keen to ensure that everybody knew they had it, as would the government of the day, whether it is you or us. So I really do not believe there is any necessity whatsoever to build in any legislative requirement in relation to that and I am not sure whether you are suggesting that it could somehow be kept a secret.
We have indicated that we are prepared to accept parts (aa) and (ab) of the opposition's 
 amendment. We believe these things would be required anyway in practice. It is unlikely that a minister would grant a licence unless the government felt confident that they were able to proceed with the necessary funds. This also applies to part (ab), which was something that was proposed to be in the regulations.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I thank the minister for stating the obvious that, if he were the minister and there was a launch to be made in the future, particularly from Woomera, being a South Australian senator and minister, it would be announced with all bells, whistles and shouting.
—In a multi-million dollar government advertising campaign.
—Yes, and I suspect you might even insist that the Prime Minister have a cabinet meeting in Woomera to be there to watch the first launch. It is on the record now and I accept that that would be the process. I do not want to support unnecessary legislation. I think there will be enough publicity so that those who may have a concern get a chance to create a public debate. You never know in this game. Maybe after some experience somebody may want to propose, for example, a two-stage approval process where you approve it and there is a period of 30 days for the public to lodge objections, et cetera. I am not proposing that at the moment. The proof of the pudding is in the eating and I do not think we should propose unnecessary legislation.
As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, this is the first act. Experience will dictate subsequent amendments that clearly will come as we get experience in the area, but I am pleased it is on the record that the minister has no intention of hiding his success under a bushel.

I congratulate Senator Schacht not only for considering the financial aspects but also public health and public safety considerations.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-26,"—I move:
(2)	 Clause 26, page 19 (after line 21), at the end of the clause, add:
(5)	 The Minister must not grant a launch permit to a person if the space object that is the subject of an application for a permit includes radioactive or toxic material, unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:
	 (a)	 the Minister has caused to be prepared a risk and hazard assessment in relation to the material;
	 (b)	 the Minister has caused a copy of the risk and hazard assessment to be tabled in each House of the Parliament;
	 (c)	 the Minister has specifically authorised the inclusion of radioactive or toxic material in the space object.
(6)	 In this section:
 radioactive material  means material that has an activity of more than 35 becquerels per gram;
 toxic material  means any material which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death or harm to life forms.
This amendment relates to the granting of launch permits. Clause 26 sets out the powers to grant a launch permit and some of the criteria the minister should take into consideration when making such a grant.
The amendment before the chair from the Democrats adds a requirement that space 
 objects should not contain radioactive or toxic material without special consideration and reporting requirements being satisfied. This amendment accepts that there may be some very limited circumstances where these materials may be launched into space. I am unclear as to what exactly these occasions might be.
I generally oppose—and my party generally opposes—the use of radioactive material in places where there may be a risk. Basically, we believe that there are no safe levels of radioactivity, as we know any radioactivity can cause harm. I would like to see a blanket ban on radioactive material and other toxic materials in space, but this amendment is a compromise in an effort to get the government and the opposition to recognise that there is a community concern about radioactive and toxic materials and that there need to be very good reasons why such materials should be put into space. These reporting arrangements and requirements will alert the parliament and the broader community to any of these activities and ensure that the minister responsible accounts for his or her decision.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—Likewise, the Greens (WA) have been very concerned about toxic materials being launched into space and the potential for some harm to occur as a result of some event occurring later on, whether at the time of the launch or some time later—even if it is 30 years later. We keep mentioning Cassini, but that is an issue that must be seen as very real. It is still seen, potentially, as a very real issue if it ever came back into the earth's atmosphere. That is something that we all ought to be concerned about. It is a pity that we cannot exclude it altogether. We have a situation where the minister is making a decision, but if you are sending up highly toxic and in this case radio-toxic materials, in effect you have something that could be as bad or worse than a nuclear weapon and, therefore, it ought to be controlled. We support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-26,"—In one sense you cannot argue against the Democrats' and the Greens' support for this amendment in that these are 
 dangerous materials and obviously dealing with them in the Australian community, or the world community, can create considerable concern. No-one denies that. Certainly, the opposition does not deny it. However, we believe that, on balance, the amendment is unnecessary. In the procedures in the bill itself under the full section—that is, clause 26—concerning the granting of launch permits, 26(3)(e) states:
the minister is satisfied that the probability of the launch or 	 launches, or any connected return, causing substantial harm to public 	 health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is sufficiently low;
If the proposal for a rocket launch with a satellite in any form had any of these materials—radioactive materials, et cetera—any minister would have to be extremely derelict in his duty, or basically a certified dill, not to take into account before he or she granted the licence that one of the issues that they would be dealing with and getting advice on was the fact that the satellite at the top of the rocket had some of this material in it and the reason it had it. As the minister has said, there will be more than a lot of publicity at any stage about the announcement. If the minister or the government of the day were willing to approve such a launch and did not properly take into account such issues, I think that public debate would be more than a little robust and I suspect the minister might have a rather short-term life—a life much shorter than radioactive life—in his or her portfolio.
Again, we in the opposition say, `Let us take the present act on board. We do not want to restrict it unnecessarily. We are going to learn by experience'. If it is shown that many launches regularly take place with satellites or vehicles in them that have this material and there is consistently a debate about it, I think we will have to revist it. However, at the moment what is before us is the possibility of space launches from Australia. Such material may not be in every launch and it may only occur very occasionally.
On balance, we believe that the act in its present form should be allowed to work, although I do place it on record that this is an area the opposition will follow very closely. If we do think that the minister or the govern 
 ment of the day is deficient, we will ask for the act to be revisited. We always think that, if you try to prescribe everything initially, you end up making the act unworkable.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—I am not sure whether the shadow minister is aware of the fact that the current launch proposed for Christmas Island is already dealing with issues of radioactive waste as a result of the launch. So it is not perhaps something we are thinking of that might happen in the future. It is something that is already there and is already part—
—Christmas Island has not been approved yet.
—Christmas Island is not even in this legislation because it does not need this legislation. The shadow minister is saying that if it happens in the future we will look at it—as if he were the minister. In fact, he is supposed, as is his party, to be representing the interests and concerns of the community and protecting the community. There are already issues involved. The community of Christmas Island have already had to have public meetings to express their concern about proper management of potential cast-out radioactive materials of quite high levels of radio-toxicity.
Therefore, we are not dealing with a potential `might happen' situation in the future. We are dealing with things that potentially could happen within a relatively short time. These things ought to be, by any responsible legislation, built into the legislation so that it is clear where the responsibilities lie and clear that there is a line of contact that the community can make with the minister to express their concerns. It is not just something that is put into an environmental impact statement. It is something about which there is clearly a responsibility and on which the parliament can be questioned directly.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-26,"—I am not satisfied with the current arrangements, or provisions, particularly the paragraph to which Senator Schacht referred. This is not a case of making unnecessary legislation. It is not a case of being too prescriptive. For goodness sake, if 
 you prescribe anything it should be in relation to matters dealing with radioactive and toxic materials. This is not an amendment that stops these particular materials being launched. It is just an amendment that ensures that a risk and hazard assessment has taken place and that the minister satisfies other reporting and accountability provisions by ensuring that that is tabled in parliament. I suggest that public debate would be robust, but public debate would be greatly assisted by a risk assessment.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-11-26,"—The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1998  is a non-controversial bill and as such is supported by the opposition. It provides the untied Commonwealth financial assistance to the states and territories for 1998-99. The untied assistance is that which may be spent according to the states' own priorities. The bill authorises payments for the funding agreed to at the 1998 Premiers Conference of $17.1 billion for the financial year 1998-99. In doing so, the government has continued the Labor practice of indexing the pool of funds on a real per capita basis; that is, increasing population. This is a fair funding formula in the view of the opposition as demand for state services such as health, education, infrastructure and the like is often driven by both inflation and population changes.
The bill also authorises revenue from the safety net arrangements introduced to make up for the state revenue shortfall arising from last year's High Court decision in the Walter Hammond case which invalidated state business franchise fees concerning tobacco and the like as being uncontroversial; that is, $6.5 billion for 1998-99. I indicate that the opposition is supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-26,"—I think it is rather interesting to call the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1998  non-controversial. It depends whether you think national competition policy is controversial or non-controversial. From the Greens (WA) point of view, right from the beginning we have considered that the whole concept, which was brought in by the Labor Party, was controversial. The purpose of this bill is to amend the states grants acts for the provision of general revenue, including competition payments, payments under the business franchising arrangements and agreed fiscal contributions by state and territory governments to the Commonwealth in 1998-99.
Let me give you some historical context, Mr Acting Deputy President. National competition policy payments initially were essentially a bribe to the states to get them on side without public consultation or widespread debate. When were we asked about this? When the general purpose grants were reduced—and I do not blame the states for being tempted by the allure of increased finances—it meant that national competition policy was adopted without proper consultation or examination, and for the wrong reasons.
In terms of accountability, national competition policy fundamentally affects all aspects of Australian society and has been introduced and implemented through bureaucratic processes that avoid public accountability, the accountability of the parliament and the Senate. The payments are conditional on satisfactory progress being made by the states and the implementation of the competition policy, but who effectively decides what is satisfactory? In this case it is the National Competition Council, an unelected body that makes recommendations to the government on what money should be allocated.
There has been no real, proper and open political debate on this issue. National competition policy relies heavily on intergovernmental negotiations in COAG, which are largely remote from open political debate. The competition principles agreement in the Competition Policy Reform Act of 1995 was rolled 
 through in 1995 with almost no debate. I remember it very well. Competition policy has been presented as a given, something not open to negotiation. The reality is that national competition policy is a policy choice. It was a policy choice made by the federal government at the time and it was a choice, albeit under the duress or bribe of increased funding, by the states.
Before the last Queensland election, most people had been experiencing massive changes in their communities but did not know that competition policy was related to many of these changes. They did not know where to direct their anger or lobbying efforts, and often thought that national competition policy was beyond reach and non-negotiable. In some instances I think the government and perhaps the opposition think that this is true.
Compare this to the goods and services tax proposal. There has been much debate over this and the government has offered further funds to the states to get them on board on this occasion as well. Everyone knows that they can lobby the government on this issue and that they can have their say and possibly achieve some amendments or changes. We also know that there is massive debate within the media and within the community, and that is important on these major issues.
The recent Queensland motion on national competition policy exemplifies that at least some states are not happy with the way competition policy implementation is proceeding and possibly indicates that they never really understood what they were signing up for in the first place. Indeed, Mr Borbidge, Leader of the Queensland National Party, actually added weight to the motion calling on both federal and state governments to negotiate changes to the administration of national competition policy to take into greater account the adverse social implications of these policies.
The major point I would like to make in the context of this bill is that the use of financial penalties to compel state governments to comply with the agreement is undemocratic and should be abandoned. The power of the National Competition Council to make recommendations concerning the payment or 
 withholding of such grants means that an unelected body uses the carrot and stick approach to push along a raft of reforms which are not necessarily in the public interest. At the very least, this process should be paused.
There is still ambiguity as to whether eligibility for payments depends on the implementation of the competitive reform process, including the public benefit test, or on the adoption of particular reform options with or without a bona fide public benefit test. But the decisions are being made by individuals, in this case the head of the National Competition Council.
Let us look at the public interest. The public interest test is a concept of public interest which I have been very concerned about since 1995. National competition policy involves an approach to policy which differs in important respects from the standard economic approach. It is focused on the nature of market processes, not equity and efficiency. For example, section 44X(1) of the Competition Policy Reform Act directs the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, to take account of `the public interest in having competition in markets'.
So we have the wonderfully circular logic of competition equals public interest equals competition. When people argue for exemptions, they have to argue on the basis that they are not anticompetitive. So public interest in other issues has to be linked to anticompetitiveness. This absolutely undermines the concept of public interest as a benchmark for when ideal economic assumptions are not satisfied.
This bill provides for up $217.2 million in competition payments to the states and territories in 1998-99. The National Competition Council has recommended that all states should receive competition payments except New South Wales, which may incur a reduction of $10 million if they fail to reform their domestic rice marketing arrangements. I believe we need to revisit the whole carrot and stick approach of these competition payments to analyse the distortions created by the fear of losing the payments.
There is no requirement that any so-called reforms have the majority of public support, and that is a fault of this legislation and this process. There is no requirement that the broader policy changes have the majority of public support—indeed, any public support at all. Public opinion is not an issue in the implementation of national competition policy, unlike the way the issue of the GST is being dealt with. There is just a paternalistic approach that says, `We know what's good for you people. Don't question it and don't complain if there are problems, because we will work it out. Besides, if you are complaining, you obviously don't understand.' That seems to be the theme. Even the recent report from the National Competition Council, which recognised the range of concerns and issues, said that what we have to do to address this is to provide more information so that people understand that it is really doing them good.
Queensland is current negotiating to subsidise a number of water facilities, including dams, to be involved with operations which I believe are largely of a non-commercial nature. I would like the minister to explain whether or not this way of dealing with water resources in Queensland means there will be any problem with obtaining their National Competition Council approved payments. That is a very important question and perhaps the minister could respond to it. It is only New South Wales, according to this, which is getting a deduction for its domestic marketing arrangements. Perhaps the minister can clarify whether there is going to be any holding back of Queensland's National Competition Policy payments as a result of the current processes about to be signed up in relation to subsidies relating to dams. I believe there are a whole lot of dams in Queensland.
In the opinion of the Greens (WA) there needs to be a major review of the whole nature of national competition policy, the way it was pushed through, the unintended consequences of it—that is the most charitable way I can say it—and its method of implementation. There needs to be a review of the framework and administration of national competition policy, of which payments are a fundamental part.
I am hoping that all the statements that have been made in recent times, including those in Queensland and those made during the election by Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, will actually result in some action in dealing with these consequences and the necessity to make changes to deal with them.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-11-26,"—This States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1998  is an annual reminder of the ludicrous state of state-federal relations in this country. Under this bill the Commonwealth will transfer $17.1 billion to the states in general revenue assistance. Combined with special purpose payments and the $6.5 billion in revenue replacement payments collected on behalf of the states, the Commonwealth now provides the majority of running costs of the states. That level of fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states is obviously excessive and needs to be changed. To the government's credit, I must say, it has tried to address some of those problems in its taxation package, although we do have concerns about the financial robustness of the package. We are concerned that the functions provided by states and local governments are still at risk of getting squeezed.
This is a very important area for the tax inquiry process that the Senate set up just yesterday. However, the Australian Democrats also believe that spending powers ought to be reviewed as well. In some areas, such as health and the TAFE sector, where most of the funding already comes from Canberra and the policy setting is also nationally driven, I think we should ask whether the states should hand their powers over completely, thereby saving them around $8 billion a year.
The Democrats see merit in a national taxation system rather than breaking it up into nine separate tax systems. But I also recognise that the current system is unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory because the states can make cuts and blame Canberra, and of course Canberra so often makes cuts to the states grants knowing that it will be the states that bear the odium, not the Commonwealth. The Hawke-Keating government worked out very early that the states grants were an easy target for cutting spending in what was for Canberra 
 a fairly painless way of extracting a few extra billion dollars. Grants fell in real terms every year from 1984 to 1991, falling from 18 per cent of Commonwealth outlays to just 12.6 per cent. The cuts in grants during the 1980s forced the states to shed around 12,000 jobs. Since then, grants were largely retained on per capita terms.
Mr Howard, as part of his federalism policy, promised to retain states grants in real per capita terms. That was a promise that his Liberal colleagues Jeff Kennett, Richard Court, Dean Brown, Ray Groom and Bob Borbidge were hoping he would keep. But at the 1996 Premiers Conference they, like the other 18 million Australians, found that what Mr Howard regarded as a promise and a core promise was quite different. The genuine anger at that Premiers Conference, and again last year, exposed the agenda of Mr Howard and Mr Costello. A fiscal contribution of $1.5 billion over three years was agreed upon, and that represents another 10,000-12,000 jobs lost. In 1997 it was TAFE, public housing, local government, public health, rail infrastructure and privatisation receipts that were raided. It is little wonder that the state premiers have so much to complain about with this government.
This year the issue was health funding, but I want to focus my comments today on one key aspect of the bill: the application of competition policy, particularly in relation to the local government sector. The Australian Democrats' opposition to the national competition policy goes back to and before the passage of the legislation through parliament in 1994. We do of course support the aim of improving the efficiency of Australian industries, utilities and infrastructure provision to reduce the cost to consumers and industry and to provide us with our international competitiveness. The problem, as is so often case, is the implementation. Often the broader effects of micro-economic reform are lost in pursuing economic neo-liberal or economic rationalist agendas. Governments have often become consumed with the figures and have forgotten the human dimension. This has been felt in cities but especially in the bush.
Where previously government instrumentalities had recognised a social obligation in the operations, this has now become a somewhat awkward extra tacked onto the commercial activities of corporations. The arguments over the cost of the universal service obligation for telecommunications is an excellent case in point. Those in rural and regional areas are particularly vulnerable in those kinds of circumstances. As government institutions have increasingly had to compete with corporations concerned with higher returns for shareholders, they have had to shed large numbers of jobs. One tenet of the theory underpinning competition policy is that more efficient industries will free up funds for more investment and that there will be greater consequent employment—the so-called trickle-down effect. But we see very little evidence of a jobs dividend; the dividends seem to be accruing squarely on the shoulders of the private sector companies rather than to directly productive industry.
The competition principles agreement talks about public benefits and costs in implementing the national competition policy. It is essential that there is consideration of a broad interpretation of public interest. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre propose that the public interest is more than `the balancing of competing collective interests'. They say :
. . . the public interest will vary, but will always include some element of social justice, empowerment and participation in decision-making.
Working for the public interest means challenging the self-defining right of those in positions of power to make decisions on their own behalf or on behalf of narrow constituencies, which will have a negative impact on those at the other end of the power or income spectrum.
In this connection, the recent resolution adopted by all parties in the Queensland parliament is very significant. They called on governments to take greater account of the social impacts of competition policy and to change the public benefit test so that it would:
. . . give full weight to issues including jobs and job security, social welfare and equity considerations, health and safety, and regional development as well as the interests of consumers.
I would add environmental issues to that as well. I foreshadow the Australian Democrats' 
 support for the motion by Senator Margetts in this respect.
The Australian Democrats will use these tests to closely monitor the implementation of competition policy to ensure that the interests of all Australians, particularly low income families, small businesses and those in regional Australia, are properly addressed. Clearly they have not been thus far.
The act before us makes available to the states a pool of $217.2 million in payments to promote competition policy. That is a recognition of progress in this area. The Commonwealth will take into account the advice of the National Competition Council as to whether the states have made sufficient progress in implementing the NCP and the principles laid down in the agreements. That was all agreed at COAG and, even though the Democrats believe that competition policy is yet another ideological attack on the public provision of public services, at least both levels of government agreed to it.
But competition policy has also been inflicted, without agreement and with only the minimum amount of consultation, on the local government sector. Right across Australia, local government is being turned upside down in an effort to come to terms with that. We see local government workers, particularly in my home state of Victoria, losing contracts to private contractors from, in many cases, outside their immediate area. When they lose those contracts, the area loses employment opportunities and money flows out of the community.
Competition policy reform has, for many rural and regional areas, been a very significant force in centralisation too. Local councils are not able to engage in the `buy local' policies and campaigns they might have had previously because that breaches competition policy. As the regulatory review processes crank up, locally determined by-laws will be reviewed, reducing the options available to communities to determine what they think are appropriate rules on, for instance, town planning and community amenities if the National Competition Council regards them as potentially anticompetitive.
In Victoria all councils must put to competition virtually all of their services. Forced competition policy was introduced at a time when local government in Victoria had government appointed administrators and it was used to significantly reduce services and conditions of staff. It also turned out to be a very costly policy to implement in terms of administration and very uneven in terms of delivering cost benefits.
Competition policy will be, and in some states already is, very intrusive into local government democracy and services. Yet, in spite of all that, there is no guarantee that local government will receive any of the payments from the competition policy bonus under this act, because these payments are subject to agreement between just two levels of government and not three, as is so often the case. I think this is a very clear breach of coalition policy before the 1996 election. That policy said:
A coalition government will build an effective partnership between federal, state and local governments based on frequent and high level consultation.
The coalition also promised to recognise the important role of local government in its policy. It said it would:
. . . seek to resolve issues of long-term importance to local government, including the declining share of revenue allocated to local government and the best way local government can participate in the benefits of national competition policy.
It would also:
. . . monitor the impact of the Hilmer reforms on rural communities to ensure that they receive their fair share of the benefits.
Principle 7 of the competition principles agreement signed in 1995 makes it clear that the agreement applies to local government, but it is entirely up to each state government as to how that is achieved. I would argue that, if competition policy is to be seen as a partnership between all levels of government—and it should be—then local government needs to be brought into the loop.
For the benefit of the Senate, the situation at present is that the Victorian state government has promised to local government a share of the competition payments and that 
 these will be delivered to local government at $50 million over five years. But, of course, this is dependent on assessment in council annual reports, a statement of compliance with the Trade Practices Act, achievement of the compulsory competitive tendering target, methods used to achieve competitive neutrality and undertaking of review of local laws for anticompetitive elements.
In Western Australia, local government has secured $5 million over three years at this stage. But there is a shining example; the Queensland state government has made an agreement with the local government association up there and it will give over $150 million over a five-year period. I must say that local government in Queensland, in so many respects, seems to be ahead of the game when compared to other states.
Our policy in this area is very clear. We oppose the use of competition policy to compel local government to tender out its services, as is the case in Victoria. We would also like to see the complete overhaul of our tax system as an opportunity for safeguarding the funding of local government. The financial assistance grants to local government should be restored to real terms per capita levels, as was promised by the federal government back in 1996. We would also generally prefer to untie federal grants to local governments, but encourage Commonwealth-local government agreements for the delivery of national programs and services.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-11-26,"—I thank the senators for their contributions. I would like to briefly correct a misunderstanding that the national competition policy benchmarks are in any way undemocratic. I think that point was raised in the contributions we have had. These benchmarks are mainly based on the COAG agreements that were already in place when all other jurisdictions agreed to implement national competition policy. Water is a second tranche issue which will be assessed by the National Competition Council in June 1999.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I was just about to quote a poem by Banjo Paterson the other day when time caught me out. Just to put it in context, this is Banjo Paterson, one of the great poets in Australian history, talking about the effects of economic theory. He was saying that, when we talk about economics, we should put that in the context where it properly belongs—that is, as a servant of a good community—and that harsh economic theory should not be the thing that dominates the way we go about our business. Matters social, cultural and spiritual should also be taken into account. What he was talking about here was the way a run—a farm in those days—changed its character because of the imposition of harsh economic theory. I think it is worth quoting what he wrote: 
The owner lives in England now
Of Kiley's Run.
He knows a racehorse from a cow;
But that is all he knows of stock:
His chiefest care is how to dock
Expenses, and he sends from town
To cut the shearers' wages down
On Kiley's Run.
There are no neighbours anywhere
Near Kiley's Run.
The hospitable homes are bare,
The gardens gone; for no pretence
Must hinder cutting down expense:
The homestead that we held so dear
Contains a half-paid overseer
On Kiley's Run.
All life and sport and hope have died
On Kiley's Run.
No longer there the stockmen ride;
For sour-faced boundary riders creep
On mongrel horses after sheep . . . 
He goes on in that theme, but I think those words give the sense that Banjo Paterson intended.
The same sorts of things could be said today. I say for the record that the poem appeared in the Bulletin on 20 December 1890, about 108 years ago. The sorts of themes that we talk about now were talked about then. It is unfortunate that the great issues are still to be resolved.
I suppose, as generations go by, the same questions will arise and the answers will be sought. Whether the problem will be solved is another matter. When we look at Australia, we must look beyond simple economic theory—in particular, simple harsh economic theory. Otherwise Australia will go down the path of Kiley's Run.
In further consideration of the speech by His Excellency the Governor-General, which was given in this chamber on 10 November 1998, I mention the heading `Jobs and the workplace'. There is a lack of proper research into how the workplace operates. There is a lack of good investigation in Australia into how the workplace runs: whether it is better off when it is unionised or when it is not unionised or whether there is some other position. That is a trend around the world.
There has been some very interesting work done in the United States of America. I was given an article by Max Ogden, a very emi 
 nent intellect, who works with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. He is a man of great quality. Many a time he has stood with me behind the goalposts when Fitzroy have unfortunately lost more than they have won. But there were great days when we had great encouragement. We stood there for years. Unfortunately, Fitzroy has gone—another sacrifice to forces that operate, not always to the good of the country.
In any event, he referred me to an article which was published in Scientific American, a highly respected journal that deals with issues of science and related issues in America. The work was done by Sandra Black and Lisa Lynch. They put out this working paper No. 6120 for the National Bureau of Economic Research. I have an abstract from it and I think it is worth reading into the record. It says:
Using data from a unique nationally representative sample of businesses, the Educational Quality of the Workforce National Employers Survey (EQW-NES), matched with the Bureau of the Census' Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), we examine the impact of workplace practices, information technology and human capital investments on productivity. We estimate an augmented Cobb Douglas production function with both cross section and panel data covering the period of 1987-1993 using both within and GMM estimators.
I will interpolate there. As you can see, some highly technical processes have been gone through, which are set out in the article. I cannot fully appreciate it. Somebody with your great intellect of course could, Mr Acting Deputy President. All I am pointing out now is that this is work done on the basis not of impressions or anecdotal evidence but very scientific processes. The abstract goes on:
We—
that is, Sandra Black and Lisa Lynch—
find that what is associated with higher productivity is not so much whether or not an employer adopts a particular work practice but rather how that work practice is actually implemented within the establishment. We also find that those unionised establishments that have adopted what have been called new or `transformed' industrial relations practices that promote joint decision making coupled with incentive based compensation have higher productivity than any other similar non-union plants, while 
 those businesses that are unionised but maintain more traditional labor management relations have lower productivity. We also find that the higher the average educational level of production workers or the greater the proportion of non-managerial workers who use computers, the higher is plant productivity.
What they are saying is something that I think my colleague Senator Forshaw, who has vast experience in the union area, would no doubt have known for a long while—that the best way of getting productivity raised is to have high productivity workers in unionised companies. If the union and the company work in a proper relationship, that gives you higher productivity than where you have high productivity workers in non-unionised companies. Of course, where you have the union and the company in conflict, there is not so much productivity at all.
The point that is being made in this article, and that research shows, is that our national policy ought to encourage people to join unions and to encourage unions and employers to work on the basis of an understanding between them. If we get that going, then productivity is going to be higher.
We do not get higher productivity by making workers subject to employment where there is no protection. We do not get higher productivity, for example, through Australian workplace agreements. We get higher productivity by having a good, strong, sensible union in a good, strong, sensible company. I close with that. I think that Australia, and the nation as a whole, ought take on board the need for better economic policy and for a stronger union force.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,17,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-11-26,"—At the outset, I pay tribute to the speech of my eminent friend Senator Cooney, not just because of his eminent status but also because of the content. Indeed, listening to him quoting from Banjo Paterson, I was for a moment transported back to my days at university studying literature. I wish I had more time to read today. As they say, as one book closes another chapter opens.
Indeed, we are here responding to the address of the Governor-General, Sir William Deane, given at the opening of this parliament on 10 November. May I, at the outset, also 
 pay tribute to an eminent Australian, Sir William Deane, who is respected and loved by all Australians for his decency, his openness, his tolerance and his commitment to a fair go for all Australians, particularly for those less privileged. Whilst I pay tribute to the man, I have to take issue with a number of the remarks in the speech, a speech which was written for him by the government of the day. The Governor-General, outlining the government's program for the ensuing parliament, at the outset stated:
Above all, the government is committed to implementing the priorities for its second term on the basis of its unequivocal commitment to the Australian values of decency, openness, tolerance and a fair go for all.
I have to say that it is my belief—and I believe it is the view of the vast majority of Australians—that this government pays lip-service to those values and to that commitment. Far from being a decent, open, tolerant and fair go government for all Australians, I would submit that their record of two short years in government has demonstrated to be one of indecency, intolerance, hypocrisy, secretiveness and ignorance of history.
This coalition government obtained a huge majority when it was elected in 1996 at the end of 13 years of Hawke and Keating Labor governments. Yet within a short 2½ years, at the election on 3 October, they suffered the biggest first term reversal in Australian political history. They went from a position of having an overwhelming majority and the confidence of the people expressed in 1996 to a position where they lost 18 seats in the House of Representatives and two Senate seats. Furthermore, one of the six states, Tasmania, no longer has any representatives from the coalition in the House of Representatives.
—Hear, hear.
—Hear, hear. I congratulate my colleague, Senator Mackay, on her efforts in ensuring—not that they needed much assurance—that the people of Tasmania sent their views back to this government in a resounding manner.
—They'll be sorry.
—The people of Australia are very sorry for what your government has inflicted upon them since they misguidedly or mistakenly gave you a vote of confidence in 1996. They went very close to tipping you out in 1998, and I am confident that they will finish the job at the next election.
Let us have a look at what actually happened at the election on 3 October. I want to address some remarks to the supposed mandate that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—the government—claim for their GST.
The government won the election. They won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. I acknowledge that. It is a statement of fact. Therefore, they retained government. It is also a fact that they did not get a majority of the votes of the Australian people. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party obtained a majority of the votes on a two-party preferred basis in the House of Representatives. They obtained 51.2 per cent of the votes of the Australian people on a two-party preferred basis—almost four per cent more than the coalition obtained on a two-party preferred basis.
This is not the first time that it has happened in the history of this country that the party that has won or retained government has not obtained a majority of votes. That is the nature of the way in which the votes have been distributed according to the seats. But it is very important because of some remarks that I will quote from the now Prime Minister that he made some years ago.
As I said, firstly, in the House of Representatives the majority of people voted against the government and voted for the ALP on a two-party preferred basis. Secondly and most importantly, in the Senate the majority of voters overwhelmingly supported those parties and those candidates that were specifically and implacably opposed to the introduction of a GST, namely the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and the One Nation Party. Over 50 per cent of people voted for those parties or groups who were specifically opposed to the GST in the campaign. The Democrats had a position which was opposed to the government's GST proposal but nevertheless one 
 whereby they were prepared to consider it. If you add in their vote, 55.8 per cent of people voted for parties that rejected the government's proposed GST.
You can talk all you like about having won a majority of seats and having won government and talk all you like about the supposed mandate theory of politics but the facts of the matter are that there were more people in this country at the last election, just as there were more people in this country in 1993 when the GST was on the agenda that voted against the coalition's proposed GST. They voted against the coalition's proposed tax policy changes. So, when the Prime Minister talks about his mandate and talks about what the people of Australia want, let us remember that the people of Australia, by majority, have voted against a GST.
I would just like to quote, and I am sure that my friends on this side—and, indeed, members of the government—will recall these words. Those opposite do not like remembering them, but I will quote them again. This is what the now Prime Minister had to say back in 1987, following an election where the then Labor government had proposed the introduction of the Australia card as part of its policy. Whilst we retained government, this is what Mr Howard had to say:
By any measure of any politician with any experience, the majority of the Australian people have turned against the identity card. If the Prime Minister and government members doubt our assessment of this, if they really believe that the Australian people have bought their argument about people opposing the card being friends of tax dodgers, why do they not put that belief to a test at a referendum and not hide behind the argument that there is some kind of mandate out of the last election? That suggestion is invalid, not only in terms of the number of votes cast but also on the simple proposition that when people vote in an election, they do not vote on only one issue. The mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney. The one thing that would not be phoney would be if this government had the guts to submit this proposal to a referendum.
I would invite the Prime Minister to take up his own words and have the guts to submit the GST proposal to a referendum. It is clear from the last election results, where the GST 
 was a major issue, that a majority of voters rejected the GST, notwithstanding that the government won the election as a result of having a majority of seats.
This Prime Minister, through the Governor-General's speech, talks about openness and commitments to decency and honesty. Of course, the Prime Minister no longer adheres to his views on the mandate theory that he announced in 1987 and he has not followed really any of his pronouncements at all since then.
—He wasn't too keen on them when he was destroying Whitlam.
—Senator Quirke reminds me of that incident, but I also remind this chamber of a promise that he made not so long ago. Again, holding himself out as honest and decent and committed to these noble principles that we all should follow here in this country and particularly here in this parliament, he said he would not accept the vote of Senator Colston. Look how quickly he changed his position on that after the election. Why has he changed his position on that? For one simple reason: it gives him the opportunity to possibly get his GST legislation—which, as I have said, the majority of people in this country have said they do not want—passed by this Senate before the full results of the 1998 election are represented in this chamber after July next year when the government will have two fewer senators than it has today. He has reversed his position on that, but he still claims this is an open, decent, honest and tolerant government.
Let us also look at the way in which the GST was put before the people at the last election. Back in 1993, John Hewson at least had the political honesty and decency to put the proposal before the people well in advance of the election. It was out there and it was debated every day and every night through the media and in this parliament and everywhere else. But what happened on this occasion? Having indicated to the parliament and to the people months beforehand that he was going to bring down a tax package and allow plenty of time for people to debate it and assess it, what happened? The tax package was only released for people to scrutinise 
 after this parliament rose in July. The tax package was released first on 13 August this year. With no opportunity for the parliament to give it any scrutiny, for any of the parliamentary committees to have a look at it or for any proper debate to occur, the Prime Minister, rather than recall parliament, went to his election on 3 October. Just a bare six weeks after this major change in taxation policy in this country was put forward, he called the election.
During the election campaign the Prime Minister said, `We really haven't got all the detail for you at this stage but let us have the election and after the election we will set up an inquiry of some eminent business people to have a look at it.' We did not have the detail; we did not have the legislation. We particularly did not have, because the government refused to put it before the people—even after it was called for by the Labor Party and others—the Treasury analysis of the GST. When that was released after the election, it demonstrated that the GST was going to have a far worse impact upon pensioners, for instance, than had been acknowledged by the government. This was the GST that John Howard said we would never, ever have—another reversal of his position. Yet he says he runs an open, decent and honest government.
One of the most extraordinary arguments that has been put forward in order to suggest that the Senate should simply roll over and rubber stamp the GST has been that put forward by the Treasurer. He argued in an article on 11 November that senators who are currently in the Senate, having been elected in 1993—and will be here until July next year—should vote for the GST that was part of the election in 1998. Peter Costello's argument is that, because Paul Keating said in 1993 that if the people voted for John Hewson and his GST then the Labor senators would not stop it becoming law, that promise made by Paul Keating in 1993 should somehow be binding on senators in 1998, after an election has been held whereby a majority of the people voted against a GST.
The illogicality of the Treasurer's argument is that in 1993, when that promise was made 
 by then Prime Minister Paul Keating, the people rejected the GST and they rejected the coalition. They re-elected the Labor government, with the majority of seats and with the majority of votes. I do not know what has happened to the Treasurer's thinking of late but certainly, if that is the only logic that he can bring to bear and the only argument that he can put forward as to why this Senate should support his GST, then one has to wonder about all of the other arguments that he will be putting forward in support of his tax policy.
I will now turn to one other issue mentioned in the Governor-General's speech—the proposal to hold a referendum on the issue of a republic. I welcome that, just as I welcomed the fact that the people had the chance to elect delegates to the Constitutional Convention earlier this year and that those delegates then participated in the convention. The overwhelming view of the Australian population then was that they supported Australia having an Australian as their head of state. I have often wondered why it is that in the United Kingdom the House of Commons has greater power, particularly with respect to the position of the monarchy and their constitutional arrangements, than we do in our own country.
It is a fact in the United Kingdom that the House of Commons, if they so desired, could vote to change their own constitutional arrangements including—dare I say it—the abolition of the monarchy. They had a go at it in about 1630 with Charles I but later they did not think it was such a good idea. But that is certainly the political and constitutional position. I note that only yesterday Her Majesty, in giving the opening speech in the British parliament, indicated that they will be moving to abolish the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords. I welcome the day when we will become a republic and follow the example of the British House of Commons.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-11-26,"—Hear, hear, Senator. I rise to speak on the address-in-reply, and there are a number of issues that I want to canvass. The first is the appalling performance by this 
 government in the lead-up to the last election, and since, in its management of the people who are unemployed in this country. I refer in particular to the Job Network. I notice the good senator from Victoria over there frowning. She knows as well as anybody what a total—
—I did not frown. I was reading a bill.
—Never mind, Senator. You have invited yourself in as not frowning and therefore not aware. Your good colleague knows very well about it. We have had a Senate inquiry into regional unemployment, which meant the members of the committee traversed and travelled very widely across Australia. Unlike lots of committee inquiries, we took the opportunity to go deep into many parts of regional Australia. The story everywhere was the same: the cuts to government services—to social security, to tax offices, to the Public Service, and not only in Canberra but in particular in regional Australia—have had a devastating effect on these small regional communities.
When you add to that the retreat of the banks, the closure of many branch banks, you have a compounding effect. The retreat by government was faster and cut deeper than any previous experience, and that was very devastating. Public sector money was no longer available for spending in the local community. The people who had jobs are no longer participating in community activities, whether that involved the local football club, the netball club, the hospital board or whatever. Communities were suffering dreadfully.
On top of that came very high unemployment. It was bad, but it got worse, dramatically worse, under the Howard coalition government. Senators opposite can remind us of those figures but they are much worse under the Howard government. In the two and a bit years you have been here you have managed to increase youth unemployment considerably—to well over 30 per cent in most of regional Australia.
What did you do? You established a thing called Job Network. What a fiasco! What an unmitigated disaster! At its hearings around Australia, the Senate inquiry heard almost no 
 good news about Job Network. A few people said they were coping, a few people said that they were able to manage, but almost invariably those who were coping were those who had FLEX 3 people, the long-term unemployed, on their books, because they were getting an up-front contribution for that. They were able, therefore, to carry the cost of their FLEX 1 and FLEX 2. For everyone else the Job Network was a disaster.
We all know about Mr Khadar Roude who earned $1 million. He was successful in tendering for $1 million to provide Job Network services in outer Sydney. He turned out not to have a phone, an office, or any facilities at all. He did not last very long in the system.
Then there was Hospitality Horizons, a firm that won a contract for $15 million. I was particularly interested in that contract because, operating out of Sydney, they had responsibility for delivering a lot of those Job Network provisions to the Northern Spencer Gulf region, previously known as the Iron Triangle. Not one Hospitality Network outreach job service was provided in Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie, the three cities we visited in this region. We have since discovered that Hospitality Horizons has gone the way of a lot of the things that this government has had its finger in. It has gone to no good and to nowhere.
The big problem is that the providers who are left in the system are desperately overworked and receiving very small remuneration for their services. They are going to the wall too. The most decent and proper and hardworking of those people and organisations are now closing down in increasingly large numbers.
Also, many of the employers were vastly annoyed at having to pay up to $250 for assistance and for advertising to get people onto their books where previously the service was provided at no cost at all. In South Australia, some of the employers were furious because it costs $250 per advertisement and in certain parts of South Australia, particularly the Riverland area, much of the work is seasonal. They would be advertising four times a year for the one position, effectively, 
 compared to other people who might advertise once for somebody to hold a job for a year or longer. This is grossly unfair.
There is a rumour that those people do not have to pay. However, it is terribly interesting to know how many people did have to pay and so decided the Job Network was a useless organisation and they would be no part of it. They went back to putting `Job vacant' signs in their windows, and they went back to advertising in the newspapers. No wonder there are increased job ads for those people who count them as a sign of economic recovery. It is because they are no longer getting jobs through Job Network. It is an unmitigated shambles.
I come now to the dreadful treatment of the unemployed people for which this system is designed. It is designed to assist them back into the work force. However, at every opportunity the Job Network has made it hard, if not impossible, for such people.
The first group of people who were upset were those people who were not on any benefit. Suppose somebody, some man or some woman, loses his or her job and they are currently not eligible for any benefit. They are not on single parent benefits, they are not on unemployment benefits, but they have just lost their job, so they go to look for jobs. If they go to the local Job Network, what do they find? They are told, `You are eligible for no assistance at all. We want your name and your number, but we are not going to give you any assistance. You are not on any benefit.' It was very, very unkind and it was very, very inefficient. It was very, very heartless. The unemployed people were the last of your considerations.
When I continue this contribution in the address-in-reply debate I will pick up your recognition that you know it is hopeless. You may frown, Minister, but you know it is hopeless, which is why you are having yet another go at fixing it. Why was it that in the course of the election campaign Senator Kemp's brother, the minister—he may be a great brother but he is a drongo minister—
—Order! Senators on my right will cease contributing.
—Thank you very much. He may be a great brother but he was a hopeless minister. Even Mr Howard agrees with that, as the minister has lost responsibility for Job Network. He has been demoted, dumped, as they say.
—You can talk!
—Fifty million dollars was found by the government on the eve of the election to patch up the Job Network mess. Aren't you glad you did not get that portfolio, Senator Minchin?
Tom Allard in today's Sydney Morning Herald has an article where he says the government itself recognises it must have yet another run at trying to fix this. And the way they wish to fix it? First of all, let us make it even rougher and tougher for the unemployed people. He says:
The unemployed face a cut in their benefits if, after registering, they do not seek assistance almost immediately from Job Network, under reforms to be put to Cabinet by the Federal Government's employment ministers.
I will come back to that again.
I have to say that in the midst of this mess that is Job Network there was the failure of Centrelink to refer any names at all for up to eight weeks in the beginning of the Job Network operation. This government stands condemned on all of those fronts.
The people voted, although they did not quite vote in the right place. You can smile again, Senator Minchin, you are there, but we got the numbers. The people are not convinced and at every opportunity they will tell you that, as you recognise yourself.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-26,"—My question is to Senator Ian Macdonald, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. Minister, I refer to your statement a short while ago that the cost of big trucks will fall in price by 22 per cent. Will the minister guarantee that a big truck which retails for approximately $250,000 will fall in price by 22 per cent, or about $55,000?

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-26,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, in response to my question, you failed to give a guarantee that the price would fall by 22 per cent or, if it was a $250,000 truck, by $50,000. In the light of the claim that big 
 trucks will fall in price by 22 per cent, how does this compare with the government's tax package which states that the price effect of the GST on the category of motor vehicles and parts, other transport and equipment will be an overall reduction of only 8.3 per cent?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Transport Industry</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-26,"—I invite Senator Hogg to get out his calculator—he can do the sums. I have said it before and I am not sure whether I should waste the time of the Senate again, but trucks currently attract a wholesale sales tax of 22 per cent. Under our tax reform package, all wholesale sales tax goes completely—gone, kaput, finished, whatever language you want. We then impose a 10 per cent GST. Are you with me? It is quite a clear part of our package—
—Is that on big trucks—the real big trucks?
—It is on big trucks—trucks over 3.5 tonnes; B-doubles and B-trebles—but it is even on fairly ordinary trucks that run around the street. We will impose a 10 per cent tax on those. Having done that, if those trucks are used for business—for example, if the truck was being used to deliver champagne to a Labor Party branch function on Melbourne Cup day—
—You'd need a huge truck for that.
—You would need a huge truck for it? Who said that; was it the left or the right? Senator George Campbell—you think it should be a huge truck. I could say something, but I will restrain myself.
—Oh!
—Order! The behaviour in the chamber is totally disorderly.
—It is true that if the truck was taking champagne to the Labor Party branch Melbourne Cup party, where several notable people were guests—
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—There's Senator Faulkner going off. Have you framed that coffee pot you used when you got the great star recruit in from the Democrats? Was it your idea to have her featured on the champagne? Was it your idea, Senator Faulkner? You are trying to reprieve yourself.
—Senator Macdonald, you are not addressing the chair. Senator Faulkner, you have constantly been interject 
 ing and are totally disorderly. There is a time to debate the issue later, if you wish.
—Madam President, the way Senator Faulkner is going on, one would think he is—
—Senator, I ask you to stick to the question you are answering.
—Yes. It is on the truck delivering champagne to the Labor Party function. Obviously, Senator Faulkner got the label going; he seems to be very sensitive about it. If that truck were taking champagne, it would be a truck used for business. If it is used for business, then all business tax inputs are rebated fully when the businesses put in their returns. So there we have it: 22 per cent gone, 10 per cent added on as a GST but, because it is a business, that comes off. You work out the figures.
—Do you guarantee that?
—I am not in the business of guaranteeing calculations. You calculate it; it is pretty simple. And while you are at it, I emphasise that the big part of transport is not just the capital cost of trucks; it is the tyres and the spare parts. They are very expensive. Currently under the Labor regime, they have 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on them. We who live in the country have to pay for that by way of freight.
It does not matter so much to those of you who live in the city, and that is most of you on the other side, including your shadow minister for regional development. You would not understand the impact of freight on those of us who live in the country. That is why it is such an important part of our program. I know I am repeating myself, Madam President, but they keep asking me the same question. Not only will the capital cost be reduced; as well, the running costs, the fuel on those B-doubles and B-trebles, the trucks over 3.5 tonnes, will fall by 25c a litre.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-26,"—Madam President, obviously the honourable senator has not read the report properly. He asks me to guarantee some calculations while on my feet in the chamber. That would be similar to me asking Senator Hogg whether he could guarantee that what the label says the champagne does actually happens. It is like asking me to guarantee those sorts of things; they are hypothetical. Senator Hogg, I would not ask you that, and you would understand that I am not in the business of selling trucks. Have a look at the package. It is all very clear. Then you will understand how it is such a good package for those of us who live in rural and regional Australia because it does reduce our costs. That is why rural and regional Australians, almost to an electorate, voted for the coalition at the last election.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government (Senator Ian Macdonald) to questions without notice asked by Senator Mackay and Senator Hogg today, relating to the goods and services tax.
This is probably the first time the minister has had a number of questions addressed to him. On the basis of that performance, he is going to get a whole lot more from this side of politics. I will leave it to others to talk about the issue of the big trucks, the little trucks, the medium sized trucks and the B-doubles. I will talk about the question which I asked in relation to local government. It was pretty specific. This is what local government wants 
 to know: where will the GST apply to local government activities? They do not know. The Local Government Association does not have a clue. Unfortunately, after what has become very apparent today, neither does the minister.
The minister does not have a clue how the GST will apply to council activities. He was unable to answer one question that we put up in relation to specific activities. He did not have an idea. In fact, what he said, quite frankly, was I thought disgraceful. He said, `They don't pay GST—hang on a second; they do pay it, but then they get it back.' You cannot have it both ways.
The other thing he said which I thought was very interesting—and we have had this sort of response previously from Senator Kemp—was, `We will look at these matters over the next few months.' This is supposed to be a tax package which was taken to the election, in its entirety, with all the answers. This government said that there was no requirement for consultation, there was no requirement for the sort of Senate select committee that has been set up because the government had all the answers. But now we have ministers from this government saying, `We will look at these sorts of matters over the next few months.' That simply is not good enough.
The minister's own council, the Burdekin Shire Council, identified 201 out of 402 of their charges—half—on which they did not know whether or not a GST would be applicable. It is not simply the Burdekin shire that is looking for an answer. All of local government—in fact, most of Australia—is anxiously waiting to find out whether or not the GST will apply to the charges which they use every day. The reason this is so important to local government is that they need to advise their ratepayers whether there will be any consequential impact on rates. It is not correct for the minister to say that local government is happy with the GST. They are not happy with the GST.
When the minister made his fairly misleading comments about what was carried at the Australian Local Government Association meeting, he omitted to say that the reason 
 the motion was withdrawn or lost was that it was not adequate to meet the concerns that local government had with the entirety of this government's tax package. In fact, the motion that they carried referred to the abolition of financial assistance grants. They wanted a guaranteed six per cent share in relation to any GST; they wanted to make sure that a GST applied to the scope of commercial activities; they wanted to have questions answered with regard to community service obligations; they wanted to know whether a GST applied when only a nominal charge was levied. And on it went.
Local government want to know the answers. It is completely incorrect for the minister to come in here and say that local government support the GST and the tax package, because they do not. I will tell you what: the councillors that do not support it the most are from councils in Victoria. When Jeff Kennett gets his hands on local government, with the abolition of financial assistance grants, God help the councils. And they know that. It is not good enough for the minister to say, `We will look at it over the next few months. I don't have any of the answers.' The bottom line is that this government is supposed to have the answers, and it is absolutely outrageous that he was not able to answer one single question that we raised.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Transport Industry</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-11-26,"—I must say that this is about the most pathetic line of questioning from the opposition that I have ever seen in my life. It seems as though you have sunk almost to a new low. Yesterday Senator Conroy tried to earn his spurs as a new shadow minister by trying to take note of an answer when, in fact, he was completely slaughtered by the minister in question time.
Senator Mackay comes in here as a new shadow minister for regional services—I think she is the junior to a shadow minister in the other place, Ms Kernot—and suggests that what is planned by this government for local government is not accepted by them. That is not true. What she is saying is simply not true. Senator Mackay, you only need to go and talk to a different range of councils. If you are going to be Labor's shadow spokes 
 person on rural and regional areas and dealing with people living in all those outlying areas, you want to start talking to some of the councils that are going to benefit from tax reform.
—Name them.
—Senator Macdonald started to name a few of them. Any council in regional Australia using heavy vehicles will get a rebate on the GST paid, plus a reduction by 22 per cent in the wholesale sales tax. Let me tell you that anybody who lives in those outlying regions cannot wait for tax reform to lower the costs that they are currently facing in order to run their councils on budgets that are as low as possible.
Senator Mackay, you may live in a metropolitan area of Tasmania, but let me tell you that in all of the areas that I happen to visit in rural South Australia in particular, the councils cannot wait for tax reform. When the Local Government Association meeting was held in Canberra, I took the opportunity to meet with a number of CEOs and chairmen of councils from that area. All of them support tax reform. All of them support the introduction of a GST. When these reforms are put in place, those councils that are going to receive the benefits will be coming to the fore—once the details are understood.
It is all very well for Senator Hogg and Senator Mackay to ask for detailed answers. The detail will be there. You cannot expect everybody to know everything right from the start. I can give you an example of one situation where I was questioned as to the effect of a GST in a certain area of council. The person who asked the question said, `I'm not really concerned about what is going to happen right now. When the final bill goes to the parliament, then will be the time that we will look at what the effect will be.' That is what most people are doing. Most people are prepared for the tax reform to take place. They will try to make sure that they understand how it will affect their own area, or that small part of their responsibility in their council, and they will be told.
—Why don't you tell us?
—The bill is coming into the House.
—When?
—Probably in the middle of next week. Once the bill has been passed, they will know. Once they do know these things, those sorts of questions and the petty things that you are raising will be—
—Petty?
—Senator Ferguson, you might like to address the chair and Senator Mackay might like to cease interjecting.
—Madam Deputy President, I apologise. I was provoked by Senator Mackay with her constant interjecting. I will address the chair. I go back to what I said originally. The line of questioning that was pursued by the Labor Party today shows that they have a dearth of policies throughout the whole of their shadow portfolios. In fact, they have not come up with anything constructive in any of their questions. They have not come up with anything constructive in any of the criticisms that they try to make about the comprehensive tax reform proposals that this government has brought forward and taken to the people at an election.
That comprehensive tax reform, when taken in its overall package, will be of great benefit to all Australians, including those involved in local government, but particularly those people in local governments which are situated a long way from major population centres. In a country like Australia with the geography we have, there are a vast number of those areas. Those councils are getting larger and they have smaller populations and fewer ratepayers. Without the benefits coming from the reduction in costs for people in remote areas, they certainly would not be able to get the benefits that they would get from this comprehensive package.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I want to comment—I think that is the right way to phrase it—on answers given yesterday and today by Senator Macdonald in relation to the road transport industry. I preface my remarks by saying that I am still the president of an organisation that is an 
 affiliate of the Road Transport Forum. I have a bit of an interest in and knowledge of the road transport industry. I can say that, from my own knowledge and from information I have received from my colleagues, the view of the Road Transport Forum is far from unanimous in accepting the government's GST package.
I might add that the road transport industry over the last few years has experienced a lot of attention in relation to accidents and safety. One of my concerns in relation to the government's GST package is that, even though there may be pressure placed on the road transport industry to reduce costs to clients or customers, there is no legal device by which we can put pressure on those clients to pass that on to consumers. That is one of the great dangers that we have seen outlined by this GST package. Since the government has been in power, national road funding has been cut by $684 million. However, we are still expecting road transport to run on the bare bones it is running on now.
What I am concerned about is that there is a lot of hope being pinned on the fact that by the introduction of this package there will be a reduction in costs passed on to consumers. In the end I believe the road transport industry will become the middlemen in this tug of war between producers and retailers and consumers. We already have an instance of the relationship in the deregulation of fuel. At the moment, in the City of Dubbo, Woolworths have been able to supply fuel through their retail outlet. They are able to purchase that bulk fuel 9c a litre cheaper than can any of the franchisees in Dubbo. Yet, they have a marketing strategy of reducing the price to consumers by only 2c a litre below the price at which franchisees make it available to the consumer. There is no device to make Woolworths look at their profits or to pass those reduced prices on to the consumers of a town like Dubbo.
My concern is that if and when this new tax regime gets under way, we will have a situation where road transport will be further pressured to provide even more efficiencies and cost efficiencies and, at the same time, the government is going to institute a new 
 police force through the ACCC to try to see that those prices are passed on to consumers. It will not be the road transport industry's fault if those reduced prices are not passed on to the consumer. You may well think that, by having the ACCC do that, that will reduce the costs. That will not occur because there is no legal device, as I said earlier, to make the retailers pass those savings on to the consumers.
What will happen is that we will have so much pressure once again placed on the road transport industry that the only area at the edge and the margins is safety. My concern and, I am sure, the concern of a lot of Australians, particularly a lot of road transport users and workers, is that we will see this occur because of the pressure that will be placed on our people to make these deliveries. The savings will not be passed on to the clients as there is no mechanism whatsoever in any of the government's proposals to ensure that that occurs.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Transport Industry</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1998-11-26,"—The GST will have a big impact in terms of reducing costs to rural and regional Australia. Australia indeed is a great country, with great distances, and the wholesale sales tax and other taxes keep adding to costs, particularly in decentralised areas. My state in particular, because of the costs of transport and in terms of bringing passengers to the state, is going to be one of the big beneficiaries. It is going to have a big impact, not only on the transport sector but also on other sectors like the rural sector, the mining sector and so many of those other important industries that have had a big impact in terms of Australia's competitiveness overseas.
Let us take the mining industry as an example. The mining industry, like some of the transport industries, will no longer pay the hidden wholesale sales tax on so many of its business inputs. The mining industry will be able to claim tax input credits just as the transport industry will be able to claim that. I can recall that in Tasmania, when the Road Transport Forum conducted their seminars, they were wholly behind the coalition's goods and services tax because it will reduce the costs of road transportation, particularly for 
 those heavy trucks that our good colleague from Queensland was referring to.
—The big trucks.
—The big trucks. They are the ones that are going to have savings. They are the ones that do not just run on four tyres, Senator. They are the ones that are going to benefit from the huge reduction in sales tax in terms of spare parts for the trucks, tyres, the rigs, tarpaulins and all those high input costs that just kept on escalating. These get added to the costs of the produce from rural and regional Australia, taking it to the ships, taking it overseas, et cetera. So this is good news.
What we have to emphasise, and this is the hard thing, is that transport, mining, rural and regional industries—every business—will be able to claim input tax credits for the whole thing because the wholesale sales tax will go and in its place we will have tax debits and tax credits. If you are in business you get a credit in respect of all your input taxes for that period.
It is not only the wholesale sales tax that will go; we will see lower costs of fuel and this is going to benefit our state because the fuel costs—the excise costs of the diesel which is used for the trains, the trucks, the ships and so on—will reduce quite considerably. Off-road use of diesel, particularly by the mining industry—and I emphasise that because the mining industry is important for Tasmania, just as it is important for Queensland, Western Australia and the other states—will be one of the big beneficiaries.
In addition to the GST input tax credit on diesel, real benefits come to on-road businesses using vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes. Heavy trucks of a certain mass load weight and railways will get a GST credit equal to around half the excise paid on the fuel. The impact of that will be a reduction in the effective excise rate from 43c per litre to 18c. If you cannot tell me that is not going to reduce the cost of fuel, perhaps you need to go back to school again. This will have a big impact.
The new tax system will see mining costs fall by something like 4.4 per cent. It will 
 also mean lower industry costs. That is certainly good news. And my state is going to be one of the big beneficiaries in terms of the lower price of bringing goods into the state, transporting goods out of the state, and making Tasmania much more competitive.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Transport Industry</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-26,"—Having listened to the two government senators who have spoken in this debate, I wonder whether they were in the chamber yesterday and today. Senator Ferguson referred to the line of questioning today by our side in respect of big trucks. That was the issue: it was about big trucks—not little trucks, but big trucks. It was about the road transport industry.
It should be no surprise to Senator Ferguson or anyone else on his side of the chamber that we took the issue up. Yesterday, in response to a question from Senator Ferguson—a dorothy dixer—Senator Ian Macdonald tumbled into the road transport area and started to tell us about big trucks. And that is all we heard about—big trucks. But what did we find out? Nothing.
We were told in yesterday's answer that there was going to be a 22½ per cent reduction. In my question today I asked about this 22½ per cent reduction, and Senator Macdonald, without batting an eyelid, moved into 22 per cent mode. The fact is that when answering the question yesterday—the dorothy dixer—it was 22½ per cent. If you look at the Hansard it will show 22 per cent, but if you listen to the tape and look at the pink you will find that it was 22½ per cent. So, obviously, half a per cent disappeared in the correction process.
It is legitimate for us to ask a question about the savings. One only has to look at the government's own documents. Today I also asked the government about the savings as per their own document. Page 169 of their tax package contains a table headed `Cost effects (by industry) of indirect tax reform'. In category 61.01, Road transport, the cost to the operator is down by 6.7 per cent. I do not know if that is an accurate figure. One can only assume that there will be cost reductions based on the tyres, the tarpaulins, the ropes, 
 the chassis and everything else. But page 172 of the Taxpack contains a table headed `Price effects (by industry) of indirect tax reform'. Price effect is the price to the consumer. Under this heading, the same item—61.01 `Road transport'—shows an increase of 2.6 per cent.
When I asked the minister today to explain the difference, the minister had no idea. He could not even grapple with it. We ended up going down the road of a champagne luncheon or something like that. What did we want from the minister? We wanted a clear, concise answer as to why the difference. We wanted to know whether the savings would be passed on. We were told the savings would be passed on. But—and this was raised by Senator Hutchins who spoke before me—there is no guarantee at all that the savings will be passed on. The minister did imply that the savings would be passed on. But when he was asked latterly, by me, about whether or not there would be a 22 per cent reduction in the cost of the big trucks, we found there was no guarantee at all. The minister was not able to give a guarantee.
This was supposed to be an issue of no interest. The government could not see why it was of interest to us today although it was of interest to them yesterday as a dorothy dixer. Yesterday it was an issue with a real place in the sun. The government—as demonstrated by the minister—do not understand what they are talking about. Obviously, they do not understand what the impact will be, particularly in rural and regional Australia.
According to their own documents, there is going to be a price impact on the consumer out there in rural and regional Australia. That is because it is these big trucks which take the building materials, the food, the clothing, the produce, the livestock, the grain, the feed and the agricultural needs into rural Australia. And in decentralised states like mine, it will undoubtedly have a real impact indeed. So the minister really botched it. He did not understand what the question was about and it is a shame that he did not stick around to participate in this debate.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Transport Industry</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,speech
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1998-11-26,"—I do not rise very often to speak 
 during debates to take note of answers, but in this case I believe I should say a few words, particularly in defence of our minister, Senator Macdonald. It is a joke to come in here and attack a person as Senator Mackay did. She attacked him about his lack of consultation with local government and she raved on about what happened in Tasmania. Well, for her information, Senator Macdonald was in Tasmania last week and he had consultations there with local government. I know for a fact he had a meeting with the chairman of the Local Government Association there, Tony Bisdee, and their director, Stewart Wardlaw. I spoke to both those people afterwards and they are very impressed with Senator Macdonald, I can tell you, because they know of his local government background—that he is a former local government member from Queensland.
I do not recall Senator Mackay ever being involved in local government; yet I notice she is the spokesman here for ex-Senator Kernot. I believe she is also the go-between between ex-Senator Kernot and the Democrats. I do not think ex-Senator Kernot will discuss anything with you, John, so we have to have this two-way conversation. It must be very difficult for you to conduct negotiations—
—Senator Calvert, would you like to address the chair, please.
—Through you, Madam Deputy President—
—To me, thank you.
—It must be very difficult to conduct negotiations with Cheryl Kernot. So I feel very sorry for you about that.
This all started back in 1993 when we first put up the Fightback package. Ever since then the Labor Party over there have not put up one iota of a policy. Perhaps they put up one: they were going to bring in a capital gains tax pre-1985—the granny frightener. That is about the only thing they have done since 1993. We are now in 1998 and all we have heard from that lot over there is their trying 
 to pick to pieces what we are trying to do for Australia, and that is to reform taxation.
 They have been running around trying to frighten all the local government areas—before the election, during the election and since the election. They have been absolutely lying about what is going to happen as far as local government is concerned.
Let me put this on the record: general rates are going to be GST-free. That was a great furphy the Labor Party put around—that there was going to be 10 per cent on rates. That is definitely not right. They said that there was going to be a 10 per cent charge on water and sewerage. That is not right. Charges for water and sewerage are going to be GST-free. Charges for zoning, planning fees and dog licences will be GST-free—not 10 per cent as people like Senator Mackay have been running around saying. Fines and penalties such as car parking will be GST-free.
—Have you passed this on to Senator Macdonald?
—Senator Macdonald is big enough to answer questions for himself. Senator Sherry, I think he answered the question very well.
Apart from all this, my colleague Senator Watson pointed out some of the advantages to the transport industry in reply to Senator Hutchins. But he failed to mention a couple of other areas that are going to be of great benefit to Tasmania. You, Senator Sherry, would know the benefits there are going to be to the catamaran ferries across Bass Straight. It will be a big advantage to our tourism industry. Tourism in Tasmania is booming at the moment. Your state colleague Jim Bacon has forecast that tourism is going to be the big winner in Tasmania. The things that the Liberal government have done, the initiatives we have taken, such as the subsidy on passengers on Bass Strait and the proposed tax cuts in diesel will have a huge effect on tourism in Tasmania.
Take your mind back to our train system in Tasmania. Senator Sherry and Senator O'Brien will have noticed that for the first time for a long time the railways in Tasmania actually showed a profit. What happened 
 under your government and previous governments when they were government owned? They ran at huge losses every year. It just shows what can happen if you can change the regimes and get into privatisation, tax reform and the like.
Another big winner for local government that has not been mentioned here today is that under our proposed tax reform package a lot of those employees are going to be heaps better off under the income tax system. A lot of people in local government in middle management are paying up to 50c in the dollar tax at the moment. They are going to be much better off under the tax reform package because they will be coming back to about 30c in the dollar. They cannot wait. (Time expired)

Pursuant to standing order 75 I give notice that today I propose to move that in the opinion of the Senate the following matter is a matter of urgency: the failure of the government to properly manage its World Heritage areas.
Yours sincerely

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-11-26,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The government has failed to properly manage its World Heritage areas. 

Getting a world heritage listing is like getting a Nobel prize for the environment. It is only given in some cases to the places on our planet with the most outstanding cultural and natural values. It is a tribute to Australia that we have a disproportionately high number of places of world heritage value—13, in fact. This should not be taken lightly. These places must be treated and managed in a way that does justice to the very special places that they are.
I am very sad to report that this government is unfit to manage world heritage. This government has no idea of the value of world heritage and little understanding of or interest in maintaining their outstanding characteristics. The government tries to tell us that they are doing good things for world heritage and that they are only allowing things to happen inside the borders that will not destroy or threaten world heritage values.
The Democrats know that this is rubbish. The majority of the people of Australia know that this is rubbish and want the Jabiluka mine stopped. And now the highest international umpire of world heritage has been given a report by their investigating team saying that the government's spin is implausible. What is the response of the government when faced unequivocally with their evidence? The Minister for the Environment and Heritage wants to grab the ball and go home.
According to the minister, the report is biased. This is surprising because the field mission was in fact informed by the very people the coalition government suggested. It was Senator Hill who wrote to the Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Humanities and asked them to make a submission on the Jabiluka mine and they said that, in their opinions, the mine was wrong and that it would wreck the values of the area. And now they are supposed to be biased. It is clearly the case that the government does not like the responses. The only thing that they can try to do is build up a case that everybody else in the world except the coalition government and the uranium company is wrong.
There comes a time when even the most stubborn people must admit that they are wrong. I suggest that that time has come for 
 this government. The minister must pull out of this mess now and proclaim Kakadu world heritage area and use that as the lever to stop this mine.
It is not just Kakadu that is in deep trouble because of this coalition government. It must be clear to UNESCO by now that Australia is not protecting the areas it has listed. The feeling coming back from UNESCO is a complete exasperation with our government's attitude. There are, of course, other uranium mining leases in Kakadu ticking away like time bombs.
The Great Barrier Reef is a vast area and no-one expects economic activity there to stop. However, the Bjelke-Petersen spectre of oil drilling still occasionally rears its head. A massive open-cut shale oil mining industry is about to take off on the coast of Queensland, with a mine and a processing plant coming into operation this week just north of Gladstone. At Gladstone and alongside the Whitsundays, huge shale oil deposits and mining tenements reach down into the intertidal zone well within the world heritage property. Propped up by public subsidies, this is a massive growth industry whose greenhouse gas emissions and potential to damage world heritage values have so far been totally ignored by the federal minister for the environment.
There are the significant impacts of the Port Hinchinbrook development and the run-off of acid sulfate material on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. Nearly the entire reef is open to heavy trawling, with by-catch devices to protect turtles and other marine life still not mandatory. Reef areas are supposedly protected but they are still subject to trawling.
Significantly, today the National Greenhouse Strategy is released, in the same week as the international experts are saying that global warming is causing massive coral bleaching and coral die-off worldwide. I think this is particularly ironic for Australia, which has repeatedly upset international attempts to come to a unified position on climate change. The Western Australian government wants to excise 3,000 hectares of world heritage property at Shark Bay. This is the home of the famous Monkey Mia dolphins. Shark Bay 
 is a stunning natural area which will pull in more tourist dollars as its popularity grows. But, inexplicably, it faces the proposed expansion of a salt mine into the world heritage area—as if salt was not a commodity available elsewhere. Oil exploration licences cover a very significant proportion of land and water, and there are mooted proposals to develop a very large mineral sands operation.
In Queensland also, the Cape York nomination process goes on and off the agenda with every change of government. In Tasmania, forests along the buffer of the south-west world heritage area are being cleared for logging, and the coalition government refuses to nominate the Tarkine area. In Victoria, the magnificent East Gippsland forests, which are highly likely to pass the world heritage test should any government be wise enough to nominate them, are being pulped and exported to create milling jobs overseas. Overall core budget money for world heritage has declined significantly, despite Minister Hill using Natural Heritage Trust Fund money to mask this.
The final insult is that taxpayers are paying to destroy or damage our world heritage. Subsidies given to loggers and miners are very high: more than $200 million in the case of shale oil mining and tens of millions in the case of forests. When the full economic arguments are presented, conservation and sympathetic use of world heritage areas would, I expect, come out way in front. This coalition government is destroying a number of our precious world heritage areas, and the Democrats submit it is a national and international disgrace.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>World Heritage </title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-11-26,"—Rarely have I heard so many falsehoods, inaccuracies and prejudices in such a short contribution.
—You were on the phone.
—I can talk on the phone and listen to a speech in here at the same time, Senator. It is a skill you learn with time.
I thought what I should do in my short time is to address briefly the report that has been put down by the UNESCO mission to Aus 
 tralia on Kakadu. This was a mission that was sent out to look at the effect of the Jabiluka mine on the world heritage values of Kakadu. It was sent out basically at the request of protesters, principally those who protest against uranium mining per se but also, no doubt, some who have concern about mining in an area in a region that clearly has very important natural and cultural values. That is what the key to this is all about, because the easiest thing to do when faced with such a challenge as to whether an alternative use threatens particular environmental or cultural values is to say that it should not go ahead, to in effect answer no. The much harder task is to do a thorough analysis and make a fair and objective judgment on the facts.
We were faced with a situation here where there is an existing mine, the Ranger mine, in the vicinity of the world heritage area. It has existed for 18 years. It is an open-cut mine supervised by the Supervising Scientist on behalf of the Commonwealth government and the Australian people. Basically, it has been found that it is operated in that very fragile region without any environmental damage whatsoever. The second prospect that we were faced with is the Jabiluka prospect, which has been around for a long time. It was specifically excluded from the world heritage area and from the park also, because it was a mining lease upon which a uranium mine was intended to take place. Not only was Jabiluka not included within the world heritage area but, at the time of the creation of the world heritage area, the Aboriginal people, the traditional owners, had given their consent for a mine at Jabiluka.
We assessed that mining prospect with the challenge of determining whether it could be conducted in a way that was safe for both environmental and cultural purposes. We did that last year through an assessment of the mine itself, an assessment that involved periods of public consultation and analysis of public submissions. It was a very comprehensive process. We found that, subject to 77 conditions that were imposed, the mine could proceed without any threat to environmental values, consistent with the experience of the Ranger mine.
This year we addressed what was, in some ways, a greater challenge—whether milling and disposal of waste could take place at the Jabiluka site, again without threat to environmental or cultural values. The preferred option was that it take place in the existing Ranger plant so it would add no significant extra challenge. If we erred in relation to addressing that task, we erred on the side of caution. Although the mining company suggested the use of new technology—which was cementing the waste into specifically created disposal pits—my department's view and some of the scientific observations were that there was some risk associated, based on both the new technologies and the geomorphology of the site.
We erred on the side of caution by rejecting the mining company's preferred option, which I have just described, and said that we would only consent to the milling and disposal if the waste was disposed back into the regional mine void—in other words, put back from whence it originally came, where there is no doubt at all that it would be no threat to the environment or other values, basically forever at that depth. It is a very stable natural system, and I do not think anyone suggested that there could be any leakage of any waste element in the future. We chose the most cautious of all options.
The advice that I had was that, on choosing that option, we could be absolutely confident that there would not be a detrimental consequence to the environment. After the assessment process this year—and bear in mind that this is the latest of a series of assessment processes over the year in relation to Jabiluka—we also reached that conclusion. This does not satisfy those who are opposed to uranium mining and it does not satisfy some who are opposed to uranium mining in that region. They have been agitating for the world heritage organisation to play a part and, ultimately, a mission was sent to look at this issue. That is what has been addressed in the last few days.
To say the least, we were disappointed by that mission, basically because it came to the following conclusion:
The mission seriously questions the compatibility of mining, and particularly uranium mining and milling, in such close proximity to a World Heritage property.
On the basis of that, it said that the mine should not go ahead. It totally ignored the fact that there has been an existing mine there for 18 years and that it has been demonstrated that, important though the natural values are in the region, they can be properly preserved while mining takes place. Ultimately, the mining site will be rehabilitated and all that has come from it is the advantages of wealth—money to the Aboriginal community. 
It is worth noting in passing that over $2 million will go to indigenous interests from Jabiluka. A  substantial amount of money—over $48 million—has gone to indigenous interests from Ranger, with jobs and all the other benefits that come from a prospect such as this. Jabiluka is big money. There is no doubt about that. It is a $14 billion resource, ultimately for the betterment of all Australians. Having said that, however, no matter what the money is, no matter what the material benefits are, if we believed that there was any threat to the environment or cultural values from it, then we would not have given it our consent.
Without developing a case to oppose the mine, the inquiry simply found that it should not go ahead because it is hard to imagine that it could be compatible with those values. It ducked the difficult issue—the three years of detailed analysis that we undertook to test whether mining could be compatible with those other important values. The mission simply dropped in for four days in Kakadu, talked to some interests, and determined that it was incompatible and should not go ahead. That sort of shallow evaluation is what we particularly criticise. There will be major consequences from such a superficial evaluation, which we could not but help think, on the basis of looking at this document objectively, amounts to prejudice more than anything else.
Apart from that, they talked about the scientific uncertainties. What were the scientific uncertainties? That was a submission 
 from four scientists from the ANU who did not want the mine to go ahead. That is four scientists as against all the in-depth scientific evaluation that has gone through the assessment processes, and also the 18 years of scientific supervision of Ranger.
The next factor they got onto was a concern about the cultural issues in relation to the indigenous people. The indigenous people in the region are divided on this issue. I table a letter from Jonathan Neidjie—the son of Kakadu Bill, a legend in the region—who speaks on behalf of the indigenous people as a whole and asks me and the Australian parliament, `Why is it taking so long to get this mining venture under way in order that we can get the material and other benefits from it? Why are we being prejudiced by one small group of Aborigines—traditional owners in relation to this site, but only a part of the total indigenous community that has a right to have a say in the development of this prospect?'

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I must say at the outset that that was a very disappointing intervention by the minister. It is disappointing because, once again, we have the minister trying to gloss over the truth. Once again we have the minister getting stuck into the UNESCO committee and, once again, we have the minister not being prepared to address point by point the concerns.
We are not talking about just any matter here at all. We are talking about a matter that is of immense national importance to Australia. It is a matter which has and will affect our international standing. I have to say that after 2½ years of lobbying for Senator Hill to become foreign minister, I think the Prime Minister has made the right choice. Senator Hill, you are no diplomat. We have seen that in the last 24 hours from the way you have handled this committee. Your behaviour has affected our international standing, and it will continue to do so. It also affects our national priorities. Internationally, it will affect how we are treated and how we are respected. At every meeting an Australian minister goes to until this matter is cleared up, the issue of Kakadu will be raised. If Kakadu is not 
 placed on the endangered list, this is an issue we will not be able to avoid in our international relations.
Nationally, both economically and socially, we have to get this right. When you are talking about world heritage property areas, when you are talking about an area such as Kakadu, you have to recognise that this is one of the chief tourist magnets in Australia. If you jeopardise that, those jobs you are talking about in respect of uranium mining will be insignificant compared with the number of jobs we will lose in the tourist industry and related areas.
This is not the only area that Senator Allison referred to in her urgency motion. She talked about the way this government handles our world heritage areas. It is no secret that the World Heritage Committee does have concerns, not just in relation to Jabiluka but also with the way we are proceeding with the Great Barrier Reef, Shark Bay, the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage areas, and so on. This is a government that is not meeting its national responsibilities or its international commitments, and the world community is starting to look at us.
I must say that nowhere is this behaviour more demonstrated than in respect of the proposal for Jabiluka. We have had over the last almost 24 hours now a bizarre attack on UNESCO and on internationally respected personalities by a minister who has, over the last 12 months in respect of this issue, shown a mixture of, I must say—and I say so in sorrow—recklessness and ineptness.
This issue of protecting Kakadu is of importance to all Australians. Poll after poll shows that some 70 per cent or more of Australians are concerned that we do protect this area. Seventy per cent or more are concerned that mining does not go ahead in Jabiluka. With that backdrop, it is quite amazing for the minister not to go through the adequate processes and not to go through a full defence of his position; rather, he has chosen to go through an attack on the other side. He said, `It was a hard decision for the government to make, but we erred on the side of caution.'
This is a government that had a report from Environment Australia, the minister's own department, which was quite damning in the way it criticised quite a number of aspects of the proposal. It is a report that identifies some 77 conditions, most of which have been watered down by the minister, and particularly by other ministers in the government. It is a report that makes very clear the view of his department. On page 125 it says:
There remains potential for significant adverse impacts upon World Heritage and National Estate values, especially indigenous values . . . 
This is what the minister's own department said. How do the government respond to that? How do they respond to concerns from their department? They responded in a quite cursory way. You would have thought, listening to the minister on television again today, that this would be a minister showing enormous care to make sure that habitat, environment and cultural values are being protected.
The report of his own department on page 54 quite clearly says that they did a flora and fauna ecological assessment, but they did it in a way which did not please the minister's own department. This is a government acting contrary to its own department's advice. Environment Australia says, quite rightly and not with any sense of hysteria, on page 54 of its report to the minister:
Environment Australia does not consider that the flora survey conducted by helicopter for the draft environmental impact statement (D 6-39) constitutes an appropriate study of vegetation potentially affected by the project.
So careful are they that in terms of a critical aspect of this proposal, of the critical implications of it, of checking out the impact on fauna, flora and ecology, they do a study, and they do it by helicopter! Come on, Senator Hill, you do not expect us to believe your glib rhetoric when your own department exposes a lack of caution, care and concern in respect of this!
The story so far is that we have had a committee come to Australia. We know that UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau is meeting in Kyoto in Japan this Friday and probably next week. We do know that the UNESCO mission came here. Before they came here we 
 had the minister saying they were welcome to come here, that we wanted them here, that they will give us a chance to show off our assets, and that we are very proud of our management of world heritage in Australia. He went on to say further that the World Heritage Bureau has in fact commended Australia on its standards in protecting world heritage and that that was not surprising because we are up to the world's best standards. He was prepared to invoke them in support. But by the time they got here on 30 October, when he got a sense that the tide was running against him, this minister who wanted the bureau here said, `Oh, well, we've said that we believe that the mission is unnecessary.' Senator Hill, you did not believe that the mission was unnecessary at the start. It is only when you got wind of their concerns that you did not want them here. And it has only been in the last 24 hours since you have had access to a report that is quite damning in its nature that you have decided that you would not address the report, and you personally attacked members of the commission.
I have to put on the record that, in its report, the mission said:
The Mission noted the serious concerns and preoccupations expressed by some of Australia's most eminent scientists as to unacceptably high degree of scientific uncertainties relating to the Jabiluka mine design, tailings disposal and possible impacts on the catchment ecosystems.
The mission shares these concerns and therefore recommends application of the Precautionary Principle which requires that mining operations at Jabiluka be ceased.
It is a very clear statement, and the implications are very clear. Of some 552 world heritage sites listed on the World Heritage list, Kakadu may very well become only the 26th to be listed as `in danger'—and this in Australia, a developed nation with the economic resources to protect its World Heritage assets. If Kakadu is listed, then it will become a major and severe embarrassment to Australia.
I have to say once again that the minister's behaviour in the last 24 hours of attacking the committee in the sense of trying to intimidate the committee will do nothing but backfire. 
 The minister has maintained his cool for the last couple of years, but he has lost it on this issue. When you personally attack people of the status of Mr Francioni, the only reaction in the world community will be for them to wonder what sort of hick mentality is dominating this government and this parliament.
The approach of the minister and the government is of concern. The minister raises a couple of points, but consistently, over the course of this process, there has been a systematic attempt by this government to keep vital and critical information away from the public—not only away from the Australian public, but also from this international commission that was in Australia.
In this place we have tried to get released and to have produced all the relevant documentation in the lead-up to the approval. We know that the approval was made in haste before an election to placate rich and powerful industry friends. We know that. We know that there are major inadequacies in the process that the minister embarked upon.
If the minister has nothing to fear in this respect, he should come into this place and table the documents. As I said, two weeks ago we tried to force disclosure in this place, but the government, together with their newfound lackey, Senator Colston, resisted that attempt.
Senator Hill, if you believe in what you say, if your case can stand up, come in here and table the documents and let us see how it stands up after that. I have to say that every document that has been leaked against the government on this particular matter shows—in document after document in sequence—that this is a government that has not met its responsibilities in terms of the environment.
The attack on the UNESCO body is extraordinary and bizarre. It ignores the fact that the mission to Australia was the highest level ever UNESCO mission to this country. In fact, it was the highest level UNESCO mission to anywhere in the world in terms of the expertise and seniority of its membership, so do not try and vilify the chairman by calling him just `a mere lawyer'. That was a strange comment to come from this government, which has so many `mere lawyers' on 
 their front bench, not only in this place but in the House of Representatives.
Do not try to belittle this committee, its status and reputation; recognise that this is one of the highest status committees of UNESCO to come here, and one of the most respected in terms of expertise and seniority of membership. In fact, it comprised representatives of the eminent US advisory bodies IUCN, ICOMOS, the World Heritage Bureau and the World Heritage Committee.
Also, do not try to misrepresent the facts by saying the numbers on the committee were against protection on environmental grounds. The only two people on this committee who stuck with the government, the only two people on this committee of seven who did not advocate listing, were the two scientists hand-picked by the minister. Every other impartial member of this committee has gone against Senator Hill and the government. I think his performance on television last night, trying to manipulate the media into believing that the numbers were in fact stacked against the proposition that the mine should not go ahead on environmental grounds, was a misleading one.
Let us face it: we have a government here that does not really care about international responsibilities. We have a government here which, in every case when the previous Labor government tried to protect property—whether it was the Franklin, Uluru, the Great Barrier Reef and so on—always resisted the use of national powers to protect those areas. It is a government that does not believe in the utilisation of those powers. It is no surprise that in this particular instance we have a government not prepared to meet its responsibilities.
So what does Senator Hill say now? He has had the committee here: this process has been going for some time. He himself published the report. Now he says, `I want another six months; the Kyoto conference should not be ready to consider this because we have not had a chance to put Australia's case to the committee.' You have wined and dined the committee, Senator Hill. You had them within your care and responsibility for some time. It 
 is only when they disagreed with you that relations blew up.
To now come out, at this last moment, and say, `We want six more months', should be seen by Australians and the international community as Senator Hill trying to buy time to lock up the process. He wants to be able to come in here in six months time and say, `It's too late; the mine has gone ahead.' Once again, that really is a failure of responsibility by the minister.
This is a minister who did not fight Senator Parer in the early processes but who now wants to be in a position to lock up the mine and lock international and national concern out of it. I remind the minister again that over 70 per cent of Australians want to protect Kakadu from this particular mine.
The other line he runs is, `We've had another mine. We've had Ranger there for 18 years, and there have been no environmental impacts of concern in respect to or arising out of Ranger.' It has to be said that it is not only the view of the opposition, but also the view of eminent independent scientists, as well as the view of the minister's own department, that we are talking about two different propositions altogether here.
Let us place on record that there have been problems with Ranger in terms of the release of waters and so on, and let us also put on record, from a document which the minister did not want to publish, what his department thinks in respect to Ranger and Jabiru. On page 128 of Environment Australia's assessment report, the department says:
More importantly, however, is that there are a number of significant differences between the two projects.
That is from the minister's own department. And the advice of scientists is the same.
When you look at the advice of scientists like Dr Bob Wasson with respect to the Jabiluka mine, you find that they are talking about a mine which, in many respects, because of the physical configuration of the site, has enormous problems. It is a mine—particularly because of its proximity to important waterways—which has important problems that we need to take into account. 
 For instance, it should be placed on the record that the Australian Academy of Science has nominated a group of prestigious scientists, led by Professor Bob Wasson, to present concerns to the inspection team.
What did the Wasson report put to the inspection team? It noted:
. . . the design of bunds and all other structures to contain tailings, water and other wastes at both Jabiluka and Ranger is based upon principles that are grossly inadequate. We simply do not know if the designed structures can withstand the major rainfall events of the future so the integrity of Kakadu National Park cannot be guaranteed with any probability.
Let me repeat that: their view is that the integrity of Kakadu National Park cannot be guaranteed with any probability. The report is also highly critical of the waste management strategies and water analysis associated with the Jabiluka EIS. It states:
The EIS consultants have underestimated the extreme rainfall and overestimated evaporation at the mine site and take no account of climate change.
We are talking here of eminent Australian scientists. They are not just concerned about the two factors they mention; they are concerned that the assessment process for this mine has some fundamental flaws.
Firstly, there was a desperate and hasty decision to permit the proponent to meet the requirements of tailings disposal by returning 100 per cent of tailings to the pit. There is enormous concern about that. Secondly, there is enormous concern that the original advice of Environment Australia to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage was not made public for many weeks; in fact, it was made public only after the visit by the mission. Thirdly, there is concern that the project should not have been commenced in the construction stage prior to the completion of the PER.
The minister's own department is saying, `Look, this mine is too critical to allow it to go ahead unless conditions are met. But this government is giving approval for the mine to go ahead even before the preconditions laid down by the minister's own department were met. The minister comes in here and says, `We decided 77 conditions would have to 
 apply to the mine.' What he did not say in his glib disregard for the truth is that his department put down 77 conditions and that those conditions were watered down substantially by his colleagues in cabinet—by Senator Parer. For instance, one of the conditions is that the Office of the Supervising Scientist be in control of supervision in the area and should have responsibility for the crucial aspects of the management of the mine. That condition has been watered down to read that ERA has a responsibility as far as is practicable to meet environmental concerns.
We have here advice from a government department saying that there has got to be strict regulation, but the government is saying, `Oh, well. Self-regulation is good enough.' Self-regulation is not good enough in this area because the implications of damage to Kakadu, both nationally and internationally, are enormous. It is not good enough for the minister to come in here and glibly make references to those 77 conditions when he knows that the conditions set by the government are nothing like the conditions laid down by his own department.
I have not even got to cultural values.	We are talking about Jabiluka, we are talking about Kakadu—an area which was inscribed on the world heritage list as:
. . . representing a masterpiece of human creative genius and for being `directly or tangibly associated with ideas or the beliefs with artistic or literary works of outstanding universal significance.'
The Australian Academy of Humanities notes:
The Jabiluka area is archaeologically rich. There are over 100 rock art sites within the lease. A site known as Malakunanja 11 is one of the most significant rock art sites in Australia and may be more than 50,000 years old.
What did the government do to monitor and make sure that they had got a full appraisal before they went ahead and gave a licence? They checked out the area by helicopter.
Senator Hill has not met his national responsibilities as environment minister on this particular issue for quite some time. In the last 24 hours he has lost the plot, he has lost his cool. As a consequence, he has ensured that this particular area of Kakadu will be on the endangered list. If that happens, then this 
 government will stand condemned for not meeting its responsibilities.
It is the responsibility of the Senate to pursue this matter. I give notice now that the best and most immediate way we can pursue it is to bring Senator Hill to task and make him produce documentation which is quite critical. That documentation has to be tabled. The opposition will keep pursuing that. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>World Heritage </title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-11-26,"—The motion before us today is that, in the opinion of the Senate, the following matter is a matter of urgency:
The failure of the government to properly manage its world heritage areas.
Not surprisingly, that is the motion presented by the Australian Democrats on this occasion. I would contrast it very starkly with a motion that is today before the Northern Territory parliament which is so vitally affected by this issue, whether it is Kakadu or Jabiluka. The motion that will be passed in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly today reads:
That this assembly reaffirms our commitment and support for uranium mining in the Northern Territory and the continuing development of the Jabiluka Mine.
That motion will be passed, and I will be very surprised if it is not passed without the support of the Labor Party in the Northern Territory. So there is a conflict between the comments just made by Senator Bolkus and the actions that are so very important to the people of the Northern Territory, both in the wider community and specifically in the Aboriginal community.
It is also important to look at the report that has been highlighted by Senator Allison—the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation report on this particular issue. As Senator Bolkus said, it has an important membership—seven members, including two Australians. The most important part of the report is annex 1—signed by Professor Jon Altman of the Australian National University in Canberra—which has been developed jointly with the other Australian on the team, Dr Roy Green. In his letter 
 to Professor Francesco Francioni, Chairperson of the World Heritage Committee, Professor Altman highlighted the total dysfunctionality of the complete report. I draw the detail of that letter to the attention of everyone. There are two full pages that go into specific details.
I emphasise that Professor Altman has in the past carried out work for the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council and the Australian Labor Party. He is certainly no stooge of this Commonwealth government or the Northern Territory government. I will quote from what he says in that letter:
We remain disappointed, however that our views on a number of major issues have been disregarded without an attempt to mediate our differences on whether the final report should have a no-mining statement.
He further says:
Recommendation 1: There was no recommendation from the majority calling for immediate halting of the Jabiluka mine.
He also says:
Recommendation 2: The treatment of scientific issues is selective, accepting evidence to support the position not to countenance Jabiluka and disregarding all other evidence, including the world-class work carried out at Ranger. We are concerned at the dismissal, without discussion or argument, of credible scientific evidence put forward by scientists with two decades experience in the region.
Very obviously this UNESCO report is pre-written by a fundamentalist green team with no regard to local evidence, to evidence properly presented or to local knowledge. It is prepared, I would say, by impractical, interfering, international busybodies—sticking their noses into other areas.
The economic benefits of Jabiluka include a capital investment of $70 million just to develop the mine. The earnings from Jabiluka and Ranger are estimated at more than $12 billion in revenue over the next 25 years; 87 per cent of this revenue, or almost $10.5 billion will remain in Australia. There will be a $6.2 billion increase in GDP. Jabiluka will increase Australia's wealth by $3.8 billion over the anticipated 28-year life of the mine.
In the area of employment, there will be over 160 jobs in the construction phase. When the new mine becomes fully operational, 110 
 new permanent jobs will be available. Both Ranger and Jabiluka will generate 1,500 indirect jobs.
The Aboriginal benefits include $210 million in royalties over the anticipated 28-year life of Jabiluka for the Aboriginal community. To date, Aboriginal landowners have received a total of $48.2 million in royalties, up-front payments and rent from Ranger. An additional $87 million in royalties has been distributed through Commonwealth agencies among Aboriginal communities across the Northern Territory.
What else should we have regard to? We as a Senate should have regard to the Kakadu regional social impact statement, which was prepared, properly discussed and debated at various places. That report is now being implemented under the proper and appropriate chairmanship of former senator Bob Collins, who has a job looking after interests in that area. That report says at page 9:
Traditional ownership is not a static construct and such issues can be, and are, fiercely contested in a region like Kakadu that has been depopulated and repopulated.
It also says:
There is no ready means to return to some pristine pre-uranium mining, pre-national park regional state that is independent of government.
I also turn to a report of a committee that you chaired, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling that was tabled in this place in May 1997. This is the document we should be debating—not some document prepared by a mob of international tourists who flitted into the place with preconceived concepts and did not spend the time that your committee did, Mr Acting Deputy President. That important report is totally owned by and signed off by Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Margaret Reynolds of the Labor Party. I quote from it:
The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian uranium mines.
The Senate select committee found that the principal findings of the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry, the Fox report, re 
 mained valid as the foundation for policy on mining of uranium. I quote from page 35 of that report:
The ERA mine at Ranger is widely regarded as the most regulated mine in the world. This observation is especially true of supervision and monitoring of Ranger's impacts on the environment.
Sure, there is an impact of uranium mining on Aboriginal communities but employment is important. It certainly is one of the impacts. There are also issues relating to parks and tourism. Also, the draft environmental impact statement indicates the number of people who are looking at this area.
The Territory ALP's position on uranium has been well documented. Senator Bob Collins is on the record in this place as having recognised the reality of uranium mining in the Territory. Mr Jonathan Nadji in a letter to Senator Hill has expressed his extreme disappointment.
This whole issue of Aboriginal consent is vital. In 1982 and 1991 the people approved it. The next generation have now walked away from that. We cannot have this sort of inconsistent decision making. It is time the Mirrar people took seriously their obligation to use uranium resources to contribute to their own economic and social welfare—and also recognised their privileged right to contribute to other Aboriginal needs and to the wider Northern Territory community. It was their elder statesmen and generation, the parents and grandparents of Yvonne Margarula, who made these decisions, and the cultural values are not just a moving feast to be played with by the Democrats and the Labor Party.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-11-26,"—I agree with Senator Allison that the government has failed to manage its World Heritage areas properly, to manage the heirlooms and icons of this nation—the creme de la creme of the natural and cultural areas that this nation, together with the rest of the world, has placed on the World Heritage list, not only for the celebration of the world communities in our time but for the celebration of all future generations. That is so often forgotten in a close-up knockabout debate about such 
 things as mining when it is undertaken in the way that the government has done.
What is really at the centre of this debate this afternoon is the reprehensible behaviour of the minister `for the environment'. That is his title, in this government. Never before in all the history of people occupying that office has any minister not only disregarded his responsibility but time and time again gone against that responsibility to argue against the interests of the environment that he is supposed to be serving. That is why I would agree with the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, when he said in public that this is the worst performing environment minister this country has ever seen. The litany is very long. It goes through greenhouse gases to the protection of World Heritage properties to the awesome destruction by the logging industry which he has been the purveyor of in his years as minister.
The current situation in New South Wales, where hundreds of thousands of high conservation value forests are going to be fed to the chainsaws by the Carr government, is compounded when you hear this minister for the environment stand in this chamber this afternoon and say, `That is not enough. I would feed more into the chainsaws.' I have here photographs of the trip the minister for the environment referred to, when he went to the Tasmanian World Heritage area vicinity after assuming the mantle of minister. Here he is, standing in a clear-felled area of World Heritage value forests—although they are not within the World Heritage area—looking at what is going on around him. Since he has been to those forests, he has personally sounded the death knell for the destruction of the very forests he was looking at, World Heritage value forests. Once again he has done this against the advice of his own department and against the advice of world authorities on those forests.
When it comes to Kakadu, the best he and Senator Tambling can do this afternoon is try to emphasise the difference of opinion that can be found within the indigenous community in this country, which is no less valid, I guess, than the difference of opinion that can be found within the wider community. Sena 
 tor Tambling began his contribution by referring to a motion which is naturally, by force of numbers, going to be passed in the Northern Territory assembly today. He said that this is where the real opinion should be. I submit that he is wrong. If he wants to bring it down to the fine point, the real arbiters of this decision ought to be the traditional owners, the Mirrar people, who are rock solid 100 per cent against this destructive mine being built in the Jabiluka valley under the auspices of this minister for the environment, who goes against the very name of his ministry.
Those people are now being represented at this all-important World Heritage committee meeting in Kyoto. I do not know what the outcome of that will be but I do know this: this minister will be leading a political onslaught against the top environmental and World Heritage advice in the world which says that this mine, quite clearly, is a danger to the cultural and natural values of that magnificent Jabiluka valley. What a disgrace this minister is. What a disgrace this government is. What a reprehensible way to be letting down the environmental values which his office ought to be upholding, which this government ought to be upholding, not only on behalf of the Mirrar people and this nation but on behalf of the whole planet and all future generations.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1998-11-26,"—I do not totally support the motion. I think this motion completely misrepresents the government's position on this matter and the general issue of World Heritage listing. The real central issue of this is whether the indigenous people of the area have really suffered any loss or have gained any benefit from uranium mining at Ranger and the proposed mine at Jabiluka. Let us have a look at that. First of all, uranium mining in the Kakadu region has provided substantial benefits to Aboriginal people in the area for more than 18 years.
—Ninety per cent of children in Jabiluka have scabies.
—I doubt very much whether that is anything to do with 
 uranium mining. It is more a public health issue. While you may seek to tie scabies and all sorts of other things into the possible undesirable side-effects of uranium mining, I do not think that would really stand up to any sort of serious examination.
The government has sought to maximise opportunities for traditional owners and other people in the Kakadu region in relation to mining in Jabiluka through a sound statutory network which provides mechanisms for representation, statutory royalty equivalents and negotiated benefits. Since the Ranger mine began back in 1981, a total of $48.2 million in benefits have flowed to the traditional owners. That is a lot of money and it has been of great benefit to that Aboriginal group.
The money that has gone through to the Aboriginal community has been made up of $1.3 million in up-front payments, $3.4 million from rental payments and $43.5 million in royalty equivalent payments. That, as I said, has amounted to $48.2 million. The proposed Jabiluka mine, which has not yet commenced operation, has already generated $3.7 million in benefits for Aboriginal people under the 1982 Pancontinental agreement.
These include $1 million in July 1982 distributed by the Northern Land Council. The Djabulukgu Association, which I think is the local Aboriginal group, received 80 per cent of that while the Gagudju Association received 10 per cent and the Kunwinjku Trading Association, which is now known as the Narbalek Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation, got 10 per cent. Eight hundred thousand dollars, comprising four annual payments of $200,000, went to the Northern Land Council for its administrative costs. Senator Allison, I think even you would agree that is a useful benefit to the entire Aboriginal community of the Northern Territory. A total of $1.2 million on commencement of construction is to be distributed by the Northern Land Council in the same proportions as in 1982. These funds are all held by the Northern Land Council.
Under the 1998 deed poll, there is $0.1 million on commencement of construction for NLC administrative costs; $0.25 million on 
 commencement of construction for a women's resource centre is to be distributed at the direction of the Bininj Working Committee; $0.315 million on commencement of construction will be used for social impact monitoring; and $0.7 million on commencement of construction will be used for the control of alcohol.
Alcohol, drugs and glue sniffing are the serious problems which the Aboriginal communities in the north of Australia face. If Aboriginal communities can receive royalties from mining and minerals, which are under the ground already and over which they have walked for millions of years without any adverse effect, then I am all in favour of this for the benefit that it brings. These figures do not include various ad hoc payments to Aboriginal interests. Over its life, the Jabiluka mine will provide a further $210 million to Aboriginal interests. It is expected that these funds will be used to complement government programs and provide additional benefits in the areas of housing, community based education, cultural heritage and land management programs, development of a regional Aboriginal languages interpreting service—(Time expired)

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-11-26,"—I would like to talk to documents 1 and 2, the report Parental child abduction, January 1998  and the report Child contact orders: Enforcement and penalties, June 1998 . These documents deal with one of those areas of law that encompass some of the most tragic incidents that occur in the community; that is, in the area of family relationships as between spouses, as between parents and children. It is an area where there have been very tragic incidents taking place over the years and where such incidents will take place in years 
 to come because it is an area that you can never get right. You have a breakup of an intimate relationship and you have children subject to awful pressure. These problems are society's problems and society has set up the Family Court to accommodate them.
I notice in today's Australian that Evan Whitton, who writes much about the law and raises great issues that ought be discussed more than they are—I think the issues of how the law confronts people in society and how society accommodates its relationships through the courts are matters of great moment and should be discussed more often than they are, particular in this place—says there is a need to change the law, and there is a need for that to happen. The Family Court is one area where change could occur, and the Chief Justice of that court and his fellow judges are very intent on that happening.
One way the court can change would be to have available to it means other than simply adjudication to settle problems that come before it. For example, mediation is an instrument that the court looks to as a means of resolving these great personal issues which come before the court. It is a pity therefore that the court does not get the support it should from government. There should be two things done. First of all, there should be encouragement for the court to take mediation within its jurisdiction, in preference to mediation being done outside the court. There is no doubt that there are some great people doing great work outside the court in the area of mediation but, fundamentally, the best work is going to be done within the court because that is where the authority is. People come and see the court as a place where there is authority to decide the disputes that lay between the them. Governments should finance and give resources to the courts in greater amounts than presently is the case.
Secondly, the government, particularly the Attorney, should encourage the court to undertake this process of mediation, it being one of a number of means that might otherwise be available. Counsel settles most of the cases; the court adjudicates on others. Mediation ought to be another way of doing it. If the court were able to pursue the course that 
 it wants, a lot of the problems that we have with families breaking up—and I notice document 1 talks a lot about parental child abduction—would be solved.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Family Law Council</title>,Documents,25,1,speech
"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1998-11-26,"—There is a fair degree of wisdom in some of the things that Senator Cooney has just said. He is in fact a very distinguished chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and is also a very experienced member of the bar. But I think sometimes we overlook part of the problem and that is we try to fix people's matrimonial difficulties after they become almost irretrievable. I think much more effort needs to be put into ensuring that people go into marriage understanding that it is a commitment. They also have to be supported through the marriage before they get to a situation where you have to call in a mediator in the court. Everybody is going to have arguments in their marriages, some more than others. We need to have a system in place that prevents the breakdown because, once the relationship has broken down, it is very difficult to retrieve the situation.
I think all honourable senators would know, from their own experience, the experience of having constituents come to them, that once you get to the point where people are in court, the attitude is not one of compromise, it is one of vindictiveness and bitterness and frequently, tragically, it is one in which the children of the marriage are used as negotiating pawns or victory tokens in the vindictive battle between husband and wife. Not always do the parents understand that they are using the children as negotiating pawns or victory tokens but, in fact, subconsciously that is what is happening.
Yes, we have to work very hard on repairing family breakdowns, because the cost of family breakdowns is great, but we also have to work very hard at ensuring that we prevent those family difficulties becoming irretrievable breakdowns because that substantially reduces the cost. Let me explain what I mean by that. First of all, if we prevent a marriage becoming irretrievably broken, we reduce all of the court costs to which these reports and Senator Cooney in his learned contribution 
 have referred. If people patch up their marital difficulties before they get to court, none of these expenses are incurred. That is a big saving of their money and the government's money.
Secondly, there is a huge social cost from not sorting out marital problems. Senator Cooney might correct me if I am wrong, but evidence was presented to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee several years ago that in 60 per cent of cases of divorce with children, the parent who has care of the children moves more than 600 kilometres from the matrimonial home within the first six months. Living in Cairns, I frequently see cases where people have moved to Cairns to get away from their partner because Cairns is as far as you can reasonably go along the bitumen. I know many people who will go from Perth to Cairns, because Cairns is the furthest city from Perth, to get away from their former spouse and to take the children with them.
What is the social cost if that continues to occur? First of all, there is a social cost because people's lives are scarred. I am not talking about the parents; I am talking about the children. These people's lives are scarred. To make it worse, it is a statistical fact that a child is more likely to be abused by a step-parent than by their own parent. It is a tragic thing and that is no aspersion on many good step-parents, but it is a statistical fact. Secondly, the incidence of crime amongst children from broken families is tragically higher. If this country is to eliminate those costs and those difficulties, we have to work at repairing marital difficulties before they become breakdowns, because in that way the long-term benefit to Australia is quite enormous.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Family Law Council</title>,Documents,25,1,speech

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1998-11-26,"—Earlier today the Senate was told 
 about the corrupt research practices of the Country Liberal Party and the defrauding of Northern Territory taxpayers. The Senate was told that the CLP deliberately misled the Northern Territory Public Service into funding political research under the guidance of the Prime Minister's pollster, Mark Textor, and the current Chief Minister, Shane Stone.
I have looked closely at the two reports of the corrupt research by Brian Sweeney and Associates, and I want to highlight the disturbing racial aspects of the methodology and findings. These documents reveal a willingness, even an eagerness, to pit black and white Territorians against each other for political gain—to appeal to the very worst aspects of human nature. The first and most damning fact, the focus group research carried out by Brian Sweeney and Associates and paid for by the Territory government, involved only white participants. A full one-third of the Territory's population was excluded from the survey, surely rendering its conclusions meaningless from the government's standpoint.
According to its title, the report was to be an `Insight into the Northern Territory'—but the findings are based on a survey sample which is chronically unrepresentative. Why then would Mark Textor see fit to exclude the Aboriginal population from the focus groups? The answer is simple: they did not fit the target market. Why would he want to include Aboriginals when they rarely vote CLP and their very presence may have inhibited the ability of his moderators to elicit the types of responses he wanted on the question of race?
Aboriginal issues and the attitudes of the selected `white Territorians' to them appear time and time again through the research report prepared by Ron Klein of Brian Sweeney and Associates. He offers the explanation that, while it was never his intention to focus so extensively on race matters:
Aboriginals emerged in the course of the conversation as a very big issue indeed.
It just sort of happened. How disingenuous is that? This is patent nonsense. For a start, focus groups are not therapy sessions, where participants are given the chance to pontificate on matters of their choice. Moderators 
 are trained to ensure that discussions stay within the ambit of the brief and they would never allow such a wide-ranging diversion.
We also know that Mr Klein's defence of the Aboriginal component of his research—`it was an accident'—can be proven to be false by a letter from Mark Textor to Andrew Coward three years after the research was completed. In this letter to Andrew Coward, Mark Textor advised him on approaches to future research, as follows:
If your interest is to have a Klein style `fresh', `new' view of the political landscape, I would remind you that Klein told us `nothing new' but, for example, put the Aboriginal Issue in its `Two sets of laws' context . . . that sort of finding is a natural outcome of the qualitative research method (where feeling and language is explored in depth).
This tells us three things. Firstly, the material on Aboriginal matters was the direct result of a deliberate line of questioning from the moderator, Klein. Secondly, this methodology was of the sort designed to elicit in-depth emotional responses on race—designed, as Mark Textor explains in the 1993 letter to Coward, to add `flavour' to a political strategy. Thirdly and most revealingly, this letter establishes the connection between the 1994 push polling question and the 1990 research. The notorious `two sets of laws' question resulted directly from this unethically obtained research. And Mark Textor is the common factor.
The report from Brian Sweeney and Associates places a political interpretation on the research findings, which speaks for itself. Consider these words, found on page 33 of the CLP version of the report:
The extent to which the Aboriginal issue is capable of evoking anger should not be underestimated.
If there is any doubt about the vile intent that lies behind those words, it is rammed home unequivocally when Klein later states:
The Aboriginal issue . . . shows the potential to be a major election issue. Handled correctly, we feel the Aboriginal issue could ensure the return of the CLP.
If in politics the price of success is the exploitation of prejudice, then surely that price is too high.
We know, beyond any doubt, that not only was the research in 1990 illegally obtained by the Country Liberal Party but also it was specifically designed to develop a negative race campaign.	We know that methodology was employed to elicit emotive responses on race to assist the CLP in maximising their capacity to exploit the issue. We know that, in the eyes of the operatives involved, resentment, intolerance and prejudice is campaign artillery to be ruthlessly exploited in the pursuit of power. We know that behind all of this, at every point in the process, is the man entrusted by the Liberal Party to conduct their research.
The campaign operatives—all still active in Liberal Party politics—engaged in this research with the intention of developing campaign messages to divide the community. In doing so, they excluded the Aboriginal population, preferring instead to limit their research to white swinging voters who would best respond to the race card. They interpreted antagonism toward the Aboriginal community as political manna from heaven and they saw it as the way to election victory.
Our Prime Minister is proud to proclaim his belief that the things that unite us are more enduring than the things that divide us, yet his pollsters and apparatchiks develop campaigns which seek to inflame and exploit division. It should be a matter of very real concern—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: we are quite happy for Senator Crossin to develop whatever argument she wants, and that is why we have listened to her in silence. But I think that at this point she is getting to the stage where she is going to contravene standing order 193 in that she is now trying to develop an argument which impugns an improper motive to the Prime Minister. What Senator Crossin is trying to do is quite outside the standing orders. I would suggest that you at this stage just warn her that she should not seek to impute improper motives to any member of this chamber or the other but especially to the Prime Minister.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I suggest you not warn Senator Crossin of anything 
 because her speech is totally within the standing orders. I think it is an excellent speech and I for one would like to hear it without interruption by spurious points of order by Senator O'Chee.
—I was in the chair when this debate came on this morning. I am aware of the strong feelings on both sides in this debate. I will listen very closely to what the senator has to say and take into account what Senator O'Chee has raised as a point of order. Senator Crossin, will you please continue?
—I will just repeat, for the sake of the record, the reference to the Prime Minister. You will probably find it is a belief of us all that our Prime Minister is proud to proclaim his belief that the things that unite us are more enduring than the things that divide us. It should though be a matter of very real concern to the Australian people and the Prime Minister that it is Mark Textor, the Prime Minister's own pollster and regular government contractor, who is its foremost practitioner.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Northern Territory</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech
