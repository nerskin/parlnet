Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2014 implements a part of the 2014-15 budget measure 'Smaller government—additional reductions in the number of Australian government bodies' by transferring the functions of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman from 1 July 2015. The consolidation of these functions will reduce duplication, improve coordination and increase efficiency in delivering the Ombudsman's services to the community.


It is important to note that there is expected to be no impact upon the services provided to policy holders. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will continue to provide education and service by way of advice to consumers as well as assist in resolving private health insurance complaints. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will also keep its consumer website which will continue to be managed by the PHIO staff transferring to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman.


The transfer of the PHIO to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman will result in direct savings to industry. As the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman operates on a cost recovered basis, all savings made will be directly reflected in reduced levies payable by the private health insurance industry.


As part of the transfer of functions, the opportunity has been taken to streamline some of the investigative procedures of the PHIO with those of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. This deregulation of the PHIO will lessen the administrative burden placed upon the Commonwealth Ombudsman by aligning complaints-handling and investigation processes between the agencies. These administrative efficiencies are expected to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of complaints handling, and ensure that consumer complaints are resolved expediently and satisfactorily, helping patients get the best value from their insurance.


Further, under the Private Health Insurance Act 2007, the only statutory process available to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to gather information was to make a formal written request for information or records to the subject of a complaint. However, consistent with information-gathering powers in the Ombudsman Act 1976, the PHIO will now be able to either request information and documents from a person, or formally require the production of information or records by written notice. This will allow for a more graduated information-gathering approach, which will in turn provide for increased consumer protection and an expedited complaints-resolution process.


Finally, this bill will make a minor amendment to the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to remove references to the 'base premium' which were intended to be removed by the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Act 2014 passed by the parliament earlier this year. Unfortunately, due to an unintended delay in the granting of royal assent these references were not removed.


The removal of remaining references to the concept of a base premium will not affect how the current premiums reduction scheme is applied for insurers and relevant policy holders and the simplified calculation of the Australian government rebate on private health insurance will remain in place.


This government has long acknowledged the important role that private health insurance plays throughout the Australian healthcare system, and is committed to supporting private health insurance now and into the future.


Debate adjourned.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (09:51):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Planning, procurement and funding for Australia's future infrastructure—report on the inquiry into infrastructure planning and procurement, together with the minutes of proceedings, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted. 




Mrs PRENTICE:
  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, I have the pleasure of presenting the committee's report on the inquiry into infrastructure planning and procurement.


The delivery of infrastructure to support a growing and demographically diverse population will drive productivity and improve living standards for all Australians. In assuring all stakeholders—the community, governments and business—that the nation's future infrastructure needs can be met, it is incumbent upon all governments to ensure appropriate planning and procurement processes are developed and instituted. These should be complemented by value for money funding and finance mechanisms.


The committee was tasked with reviewing the Australian government's response, in an infrastructure sense, to a variety of factors, including demographic change, increasing fuel costs and housing affordability. The committee has heard some compelling evidence to suggest changes in the way the government addresses infrastructure planning and funding.


The inquiry into planning and procurement received many submissions from a wide range of interested parties: from government departments to peak industry bodies and advocacy groups. Many of these appeared as witnesses at the 12 public hearings overseen by the committee, and on behalf of the committee I wish to thank them for their time and expertise.


The committee's report examined the planning of infrastructure, recommending that improved coordination and harmonisation of Commonwealth, state and territory-based processes be undertaken. The way our Federation is framed can lead to duplication of services and this leads to duplication of process, which is costly in both time and money.


The committee is mindful of the constitutional arrangements in our country, but also believes greater effort in reducing duplication is needed. The committee emphasised the importance of identifying a long term pipeline of infrastructure projects to provide certainty for stakeholders regarding future planning. In developing this pipeline, the committee notes a recently announced expansion of Infrastructure Australia's functions. The committee further recommended that, where required, relevant land corridors be identified and preserved to meet future infrastructure needs.


There are significant opportunities to encourage investment in infrastructure through various models. However, numerous submissions indicated there is limited technical capacity within Commonwealth departments, causing substantial increases in cost and risk to both taxpayers and investors.


The committee recommended that the Australian government develop innovative financing and funding models for the development of public infrastructure, providing flexibility and the ability to respond to associated costs and inherent risks. In particular, closer consideration should be given to options, including forward tax incentives, user charging, inverted bidding, infrastructure bonds and capital recycling.


The committee also made recommendations for procurement reform. It called upon the Australian government to consider innovative procurement practices, including promoting the use of Building Information Modelling, BIM, and co-funding the design or purchase of intellectual property rights, particularly where they form part of an innovative infrastructure tender proposal. The recommendation also called for the streamlining and centralising of elements of the tender process and the debundling of project elements to allow greater competition between industry participants.


The committee also made some recommendations aimed at Infrastructure Australia's involvement in the infrastructure procurement process, including improving their technical capability and the appointment of a chief engineer. Having the technical capacity to determine the most appropriate infrastructure design, construction and procurement model on a case-by-case basis was considered critical when dealing with large projects. It was recommended that a methodology be developed and applied to evaluate the wider economic benefits of infrastructure projects receiving Commonwealth funding of over $100 million. It was further recommended that the role of Infrastructure Australia as a specialist procurement agency be enhanced, allowing the provision of policy advice and support to government agencies undertaking infrastructure procurement.


The committee was mindful of the recently released Productivity Commission report entitled Public Infrastructure and was careful not to duplicate the commission's findings but rather identify ways those findings could be expanded upon or enhanced. An outline of the commission's findings appears on pages 2 and 3 of this report, and I recommend that they be read in conjunction with this report.


Finally, I would like to thank the individuals and organisations who made contributions to the inquiry both through submissions and through appearances at public hearings. The committee has made 10 recommendations we feel will progress the planning and procurement crucial for the infrastructure of Australia. As chairman, I wish to acknowledge members of the committee who brought their varied experience to bear during an inquiry that covered a number of complex matters. It is clear that there is a need for significant structural change to current processes in the planning, procurement and funding of infrastructure in Australia, and it is hoped that the recommendations of this committee contribute to further reform in this area. 


On behalf of the committee I also wish to thank the committee secretariat for their hard work in supporting the committee during this Inquiry.


On behalf of the committee I commend the report to the House.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (09:58):  by leave—I wish to add to the remarks of the chair, Ms Prentice, and in doing so acknowledge Ms Prentice for her great work in chairing this committee. The Labor members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications do agree with most of the recommendations contained in the report. However, we have sought to add two recommendations in a further report of the committee. Throughout the course of the inquiry, having heard from many of the stakeholders and experts, we did develop a firm appreciation of the progress that has been made and some of the challenges in delivering infrastructure in Australia. The challenge of delivering productivity enhancing infrastructure in Australia in an efficient manner is really subject to the foibles of Federation. Generally, having three levels of government responsible for planning, designing, financing and construction of infrastructure presents significant challenges. Many of the witnesses submitted their frustration at having to deal with the three levels of government, particularly around planning in respect of building infrastructure.


The report makes recommendations that largely build upon the good work of Labor when we were in government, through the former Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, and agreement was reached on most of the recommendations and the bulk of the report. However, Labor members thought that certain elements needed strengthening and that recommendations around a couple of issues needed to be more robust.


The main points in respect of Labor's dissenting report are that the government should continue to use its leadership position via COAG to drive better practices around infrastructure project identification, planning and selection to align particularly with recommendations 7.3 and 7.1 of the Productivity Commission's public infrastructure inquiry. 


Further, Labor members of the committee submit that the government must legislate to establish an authority that transcends the electoral cycle to work with the states, territories and local governments and particularly rail experts to preserve a corridor for east coast high-speed rail but, more generally, for other national road and rail projects.


This was a point that was made by many witnesses to the inquiry, including the member for Bennelong and the former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Tim Fischer, who, we all know, is a passionate advocate for rail and the greater use of rail in Australia and, indeed, high-speed rail. In his submission to the inquiry he had this to say:


Capital City HSR “corridor close out” continues to occur, notably with some near disgraceful planning approvals around outer Melbourne, especially the dogs muddle unfolding at Donnybrook. Significantly international interest remains high re HSR possibilities including investment in Australian HSR by overseas interests but the clock is ticking. Now is the time for some bold decisions, now or virtually never.


It is wonderful to see that the former Deputy Prime Minister has not lost his penchant for colourful language and, indeed, his passion for high-speed rail. I thought the remarks in his submission to the committee were quite notable. Former Prime Minister Tim Fischer talked about getting on with the job of actually preserving a corridor for high-speed rail and we recommend that the government take up his suggestions. When you talk about visionary infrastructure projects, you can see that this is one that will bring tangible benefits in terms of productivity enhancement to the east coast of Australia. It is a long-term project but we need to get on with the job of preserving the corridor now. The recommendation that Labor members make in this report is for the government to support the establishment of a Commonwealth authority to work with the states and experts to do that.


We also say that government education and training policy needs to anticipate increased demand for local infrastructure planning, procurement and delivery skills and should have a skills supply policy that anticipates demand.


Governments should note considerable and detailed Productivity Commission criticism of the structure of the Asset Recycling Initiative and its potential to incentivise privatisations of monopoly assets without adequate consumer and community protections. So Labor members have made a recommendation in respect of asset recycling. It relates to what the Productivity Commission had to say about the potential foibles of asset recycling.


Further, we say that the government should fund projects on a more neutral basis to avoid distortions and inefficient investment decisions. That includes funding urban passenger rail projects when identified as the best solution to congestion problems. Just funding road projects sends a signal to cash-strapped states that roads are preferred and are cheaper. That has been noted by Infrastructure Australia as distortionary and something that Labor members support.


Finally, Labor members submitted that the government should ensure that all projects with a capital value of over $100 million have a cost-benefit analysis, assessed by Infrastructure Australia using a standard method capable of comparison across projects, and that the evaluation should inform funding decisions and therefore should occur prior to any proposed allocation of funds.


I thank other committee members and, in particular, I pay tribute to the staff of the secretariat and thank them for their wonderful work.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (10:06):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014. Labor oppose this bill. However, we have sought to refer the bill to a Senate committee to examine whether the government's claims about its merits stand up to scrutiny. At this stage, we believe that the bill is not ideally constructed. It is ambiguous, imposes red tape on small businesses, may increase costs and create uncertainty. We do believe, however, that finding ways to increase productivity is of significant importance and so we will seek the view of stakeholders, through the committee, on the proposed changes. As the Chief Executive of the Australian Mines and Metals Association Steven Knott claims, Australian businesses are looking for reform 'to help sustain our nation's economic growth, living standards and employment'. Labor wants to ensure that any changes to the current system will increase productivity, growth and jobs. That is why we have taken the responsible decision to refer the bill to a Senate committee.


It is worth noting that this bill was introduced on Thursday and here we are, only one week later, debating the merits of a bill which could have very significant impacts on how employers, unions and employees conduct themselves during bargaining and how the Fair Work Commission operates. Given the Abbott government flagged the idea of these changes in their policy document, why has it taken so long? Why is the government now seeking to rush this through parliament?


The construction of the bill is clearly inconsistent with the government's election policy document. Labor is concerned that this will lead to adverse consequences—and who could blame us? Australians have been misled by the government with a proposed GP tax, fuel tax, cuts to the ABC and SBS, cuts to the indexation of the pension, cuts to health and cuts to higher education—the list goes on and on. And we do not want this bill adding to that already long list.


In short, Labor cannot support this bill as it currently stands because it may be ambiguous and may result in no change other than to create additional red tape, increase costs and generate uncertainty for employers, unions and employees; and, at worst, it is an assault on employees' democratic right to bargain effectively at the workplace. Labor contends that the bill is poorly constructed and is potentially bad policy. I will consider the bill sequentially and deal with the government's proposed 'productivity discussions' and then move to the protected industrial action proposals in the bill.


In addressing the government's proposal relating to productivity discussions as part of enterprise agreements we arrive at their first broken promise. Labor is concerned the government has gone further than their election policy and put the power directly into employers' hands. The coalition's policy document states:


Before an enterprise agreement is approved, the Fair Work Commission will have to be satisfied that the parties have at least discussed productivity as part of their negotiation process. The key is to make sure—


and this perhaps the most important part—


that workers and managers have at least considered how to improve productivity to help their workplace work effectively.


If the government was serious about addressing productivity in the case of both workers and managers they could have considered amendments to the good faith bargaining rules and made clear what was expected during that process. Instead they have opted for this new requirement which may not benefit the process of bargaining for and, eventually, completing an enterprise agreement. Due to the clumsy drafting of the provision two equally plausible situations arise. One scenario is the government's proposal does nothing but add red tape, increase costs and create industry uncertainty. Indeed, respected industrial relations academic Professor Andrew Stewart, from the University of Adelaide, has said the government's requirement for productivity discussions is 'completely token' and 'more red tape', which would not create much change.


Geoffrey Giudice, the highly regarded former President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and its successor Fair Work Australia, has said that requiring parties to formally take productivity into account in enterprise bargaining would create definitional and quantitative issues. On the implications, including productivity, Giudice has said:


In the case of parties who were already having difficulty reaching agreement, any additional requirement would not be helpful. Where parties are in agreement, there would be a temptation to find spurious productivity improvements where none existed in order to satisfy the statutory requirements.


Giudice goes on to say:


Building in further process would be unlikely to yield a net benefit.


It is for these reasons that Labor believes that further investigation needs to be done by a Senate committee to look at the implications of this bill.


The government claims it has a deregulation and red tape reduction agenda. Well, here is a perfect and simple example that the government may be doing exactly the opposite—in this case, inflicting unnecessary requirements on business. In practice the outcome of this bill, if it is passed, may only create a box-ticking exercise where the bargaining parties just place a tick to say they have discussed productivity—and that would be it. However, like everything with this government, we must dig a little deeper because we know the government's intention is not actually to deal with productivity. This Liberal Party's agenda has been to wage a continuing crusade against working people by imposing the requirements on unions while providing options for employers to avoid the requirements.


It is against this backdrop that we must consider an ulterior scenario that might arise from the successful passage of this bill. Just as there is the possibility that this provision is ineffective there is also a very real and equally conceivable risk that the construction of this provision could operate as a veto power for employers. The new requirement states that the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that improvements to productivity were discussed 'during' bargaining for the agreement. However, the relevant section of the Fair Work Act 2009 refers to the requirements that must be met before the Fair Work Commission can approve an enterprise agreement. Therefore, it is not beyond the bounds of reason that a situation might arise where an employer says, 'I don't want to talk about productivity until we've discussed the cutting of wages, holidays or other conditions.' Does that mean that, if this bill is enacted, an agreement can never be completed if employees refuse to accept those adverse changes first? This looks like it may tip the balance of bargaining further in favour of employers. So already we are seeing the potential effect that this bill could have—supporting Labor's sensible position that this bill be referred to a committee for further examination.


Labor knows how important productivity is. That is why, when we were in government, we ensured it was included in the objects of the act. ABS data shows that labour productivity has increased over the last 12 quarters. Labor's workplace relations policies are working to deliver productive and sustainable outcomes for Australian employers and their workforce. What we know is that productivity was three times higher under Labor's Fair Work Act than during the draconian Work Choices regime. This productivity increase took place after the repealing of WorkChoices and, most remarkably, while we were enduring the greatest global economic shock since the Great Depression.


And just as we know how important productivity is, we know how insincere the government's sloganeering about productivity is. If the government were genuinely serious about productivity they would not be cutting trade training centres, they would not be gutting $2 billion from training and skills, they would not be seeking to open up the temporary migration streams while thousands of Australian workers are unemployed and they would not be removing protections for Australian workers. Instead, the government would be building infrastructure properly, including rolling out Labor's NBN and investing in rail. They would be training our young people in the skills our economy needs for the future. They would be investing in entrepreneurship and innovation and assisting small business.


But we see none of that from this government. No thinly veiled attempt to canvass productivity as part of the approval requirements of enterprise bargaining can hide the fact that the Prime Minister is failing on jobs, training, infrastructure and ultimately productivity. A further concern that Labor has with this bill is the definition—more appropriately, the lack thereof—of productivity. The bill simply does not define productivity, so there is a multitude of ways that it might be interpreted. We know that economists have many different definitions of what productivity is. Indeed, some employers would have a different view of productivity to that of their employees. For example, it can be rightly argued that including an additional week's training—for, say, technical employees who are party to an agreement—is a measure that will boost productivity, increasing skills and leading to productivity outcomes. However, it could also be argued—perhaps with less veracity and probably by those members opposite—that it is not a productivity-boosting measure at all but, rather, an unproductive measure, because the employee would be incapable of working for that week.


So, again, on the definition of productivity and the perspectives that parties bring to that definition you can see can see how it can create division, uncertainty and debate and may not lead to the certainty required for negotiating agreements. The government's explanatory memorandum uses examples of productivity improvements such as 'elimination of restrictive or inefficient work practices' and initiatives to provide employers with 'greater responsibilities or additional skills directly translating to improved outcomes'. What on earth does this mean? I guarantee that the government does not know—and that might very well be deliberate. We may conclude, as Professor Stewart has said, that the government is deliberately trying to make it difficult and ambiguous and induce doubt among employees seeking to take protected industrial action. And I would like to return to that point a little later. But the problem is that the construction of the examples is so inept that it will potentially lead to employers needing to take legal advice in relation to protected action matters as well.


I will now address the concerns Labor has around the changes to protected action. We contend that the Abbott government's proposals reflect a deep misunderstanding of bargaining and negotiation. We are concerned that the proposed amendments to the sections of the Fair Work Act that govern protected industrial action may have been introduced to appease those who have lobbied the government from a particular sector of the economy—namely, big business. Our concern is that the government's ideological war against unions continues in this bill. There are two parts to the government's proposed amendments to protected industrial action ballots. The determination about what constitutes genuinely trying to reach an agreement has been a matter for the Fair Work Commission based on all the circumstances since the institution of protected industrial action was created under Paul Keating. Indeed, there was no attempt to change that definition in the Howard years. In this bill the government is proposing to essentially codify elements of a Fair Work decision they deem favourable. The proposal is that the test for whether an applicant—an employee organisation—for a protected action ballot has been, and is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement would include a non-exhaustive list of matters, which are:


(a) the steps taken by each applicant to try and reach agreement;


(b) the extent to which each applicant has communicated the claims;


(c) whether the applicant has provided a considered response to the proposals made by the employer;


(d) the extent to which bargaining for the agreement has progressed.


In pursuing this amendment, again, two scenarios arise. First, the government's insistence to codify the matters is completely unnecessary given that commissioners currently are entirely free to have regard to all relevant circumstances and do not disregard the matters to which I have just referred. Second, the government is introducing the additional requirements because they are applicable only to those making an application for protection action—namely, employees' organisations: unions. There are no corresponding additional elements placed on employers.


If this were the case, it would be yet again an election breach. Given the government's propensity to break its election commitments, this is the more likely scenario. To be clear, the election policy of the government stipulated:


Workers and business must be genuine in their attempts to bargain so that realistic improvements in employment conditions can occur for everyone.


Yet, as the ACTU correctly states, by amending section 443 in the way in which it has, the government has imposed a different and higher standard on unions to take protected industrial action over and above that to which employers are subject in cases of employer lockouts. There is another difficulty that presents itself in this scenario. If the 'extent to which bargaining for the agreement has progressed' is included as a compulsory consideration, this again may encourage employers to frustrate the process of bargaining. What will happen if employers stall bargaining? Again, we think that is best examined further by a Senate committee. Also, the government's explanatory memorandum refers, at paragraph 17, to an applicant for a protected action ballot having to take 'genuine and reasonable steps to engage with an employer'. Perhaps we could think about this in another way: how many times is it reasonable for an applicant to go back to an intransigent employer?


The other component of the government's proposed changes to protected action is the new provision that means that the Fair Work Commission must not make a protected action ballot order if it is satisfied that the applicant's claim or claims:


(a) are manifestly excessive, having regard to the conditions at the workplace and the industry in which the employer operates; or


(b) would have a significant adverse impact on productivity at the workplace.


The bill still leaves much discretion to the Fair Work Commission, but this may add additional uncertainty. On reading the text of the bill, it appears that the Fair Work Commission is not required to consider matters going to claims that are 'manifestly excessive' or had an 'adverse impact on productivity' unless the parties made a case for it.


What we see also is a provision relating to the claims that 'would have a significant adverse impact on productivity' which is, we think, badly designed. On one hand, the provision means absolutely nothing because, of course, a claim cannot possibly lead to productivity. A claim is just that: a claim. Claims can only have an impact if they are granted. Only the other, different, interpretation might rule out the possibility of ever taking industrial action.


Again, the ACTU has raised the point that this amendment is best seen as a merits test which will be applied to the claims made in bargaining both on an individual basis and an all-in basis. The former could effectively defeat the latter. The ACTU quite rightly contends that, if the commission is satisfied that a claim of the applicant is manifestly excessive, the ballot application will fail—notwithstanding the fact that every claim or concession made moderates the impact of the individual claim being considered. This is most definitely a question that warrants further investigation by the Senate committee.


Consider this example posed by Professor Stewart. If a commissioner need only consider a single element of a claim, without having regard to other elements of the claim, any single element of a claim that seeks to impose an additional cost or create an additional burden on the employer may have an adverse impact on productivity. Therefore, even if a commissioner is satisfied an individual claim, if granted, would have a significant negative impact on productivity, there is absolutely no way the commissioner could possibly know what else might be agreed to offset that. What this means is a commissioner might possibly never be satisfied.


Professor Stewart goes on to say it is therefore possible that if the test is applied as strictly and rigorously as it is proposed, this could remove the capacity to take industrial action entirely. That may not be the intention of the government—then again, it may well be—but that may well be the consequence, unintended or otherwise, of this bill if enacted. With the construction of this bill, Labor believes a commissioner may take the purpose of the amendment as meaning unions should only be able advance claims that do not significantly impact on productivity. This would be a surprising step, which, we argue, could destroy enterprise bargaining as we know it. The whole bargaining process is about bringing two parties together where they may not start in similar positions, particularly on matters such as wages, conditions, flexibility and, of course, productivity.


Another concern with this proposal is the determination of what is 'manifestly excessive'. The government's explanatory memorandum, in paragraph 21, states:


The phrase 'manifestly excessive' is intended to be directed at claims that are evidently or obviously out of range or above and beyond what is necessary, reasonable, proper or capable of being met by the employer, when compared to the conditions at the workplace and the industry in which the employer operates.


There is a risk that a claim with an element of ambit in it, say above CPI, may mean that a protected industrial order cannot be granted. This is yet another reason why the bill must be referred to the committee for investigation.


The final practical problem, which is supported in the government's explanatory memorandum, is that, if one union has one 'excessive' claim in their log, it would prevent all unions' applications from proceeding—that is, if they were jointly applying for protected action pursuant to the act. Yet again, this is a case of punish one, punish all. It very much looks like the government is seeking to stymie the rights of employees to effectively bargain by, in certain circumstances, denying protected industrial action. Professor Stewart goes on to say, 'It could happen in all circumstances, theoretically.' Remember, this is about denying the rights not just of construction workers, the workforce that the government likes to attack every day, but also of nurses, paramedics, teachers, administrative workers and workers throughout the land. This is, on the construction of the bill, potentially very unreasonable and indeed could be very damaging to the way in which enterprise bargaining has operated in this country.


A final matter that must be touched upon is how this bill will intersect with the government's plans to appoint an appellate jurisdiction to overturn decisions of the Fair Work Commission. The Liberal Party's election policy document states they will give 'active consideration to the creation of an independent appeal jurisdiction' of the Fair Work Commission. We know this plan is the government attempting to undermine the independence of the commissioners, giving the final say on matters to the government's hand-picked appointees. By creating and appointing its own appeals body with the power to overturn full bench decisions of the Fair Work Commission, the government would turn the independent umpire into a partisan body, which would make ultimate decisions on the matters I have addressed, including productivity and protected action. When you have a bill such as this, which is so ambiguous and leaves much to be interpreted by commissioners, this is a serious concern, and it could mean that partisan government appointees are effectively making judgements on the pay and conditions of average Australians.


As I have said, there is much to be concerned with in the provisions of this bill. It is for that reason that we seek to have the matter reviewed. We believe that it would appear to be badly constructed. It may well have unintended consequences. Some would argue that the consequences are indeed intended. We would say that the bill, being ambiguous as it is, seems to misunderstand key elements of our workplace relations system. And, for that reason, Labor quite responsibly refers the bill to a Senate committee to hear the views of stakeholders and potentially affected parties.

Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (10:28):  This bill is very essential to allow us to deliver what we said we would do in the last election. This bill encompasses amendments that go to the heart of fairness and productivity.


Before we go any further I would just like to bring to the House's attention what I, and most people, see as fairness. Fairness implies reasonableness: reasonable activity; being reasonable. It implies taking into account both sides of the argument—or the many sides to an argument—or the objectives and aims and the situation that the parties to negotiation find themselves in. It does not imply fairness to one party to the negotiations; it implies equal footings, equal validity and consideration of both sides of the argument.


In the Australian situation, one can almost justify anything by appealing to this higher Australian authority of something being fair or not, and our opponents on the other side have worked this principle of Australian society to the nth degree. The aim of this exercise is to put fairness back into the Fair Work Act because, to the humble observer, let alone large corporations or small businesses that are trying to get a new industrial arrangement in place, all the fairness seems to be on the side of the applicant. You have only got to see opposition to our budget. There is no economic angle in their arguments. There is just all this appeal to something being unfair. Fairness is a bit like beauty. Beauty, the old saying goes, is in the eye of the beholder. Fairness is also in the eye of the beholder, and what we have in the Fair Work Act is a one-sided situation where applicants for an agreement can come in, strike first and argue later. This amendment addresses that situation.


It is also addressing the issue of productivity, which is not enshrined in this amendment, but it is just putting it on the table to make sure it is considered by the commission and by the people in good-faith bargaining. Everyone in the industrial space wants the business to succeed. Everyone who is employed wants to have a job. But, when applications cross over to manifestly unreasonable or excessive, you have to have the ability in our negotiation system to make sure the unreasonableness or the economic reality of a situation come to bear. So productivity is at the essence of this bill.


In Australia, we are pricing ourselves out of so many of our traditional markets. We have, for many years, being very efficient miners. We have been very efficient farmers and producers of wonderful produce. But, if we have inefficient industrial relations without productivity gains, all our competitive advantage will go. You only have to look at the JJ Richards case from three or four years ago or the case in the north-west with the tugboat negotiations, where there were unbelievably generous ambit claims put in. That is what this regulatory change to the act is aiming to address. It compels the Fair Work Commission to consider productivity changes. It also addresses the process by which protected industrial action can be taken. 'Protected industrial action' means whoever goes on strike is not liable, in a civil sense, for any of the consequences of the strike.


These are two essential problems for the nation: the return of our productivity growth, which was the marker of income growth and national prosperity through the late eighties and nineties into the early 2000's. That is why our society was in a really sweet spot where people's household incomes were growing and there was growth in businesses which employ more Australians. But we seem to have lost that. We have been on vacation regarding productivity growth. If we do not become productive, things become more expensive. Our products that we try to sell are less competitive. So our trade suffers. To make the most of our free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China, we have to lift our productivity. The trade deals themselves will not get us the wealth and prosperity that we have within our grasp. It will happen if we become more productive.


One only has to look at the LNG revolution. There is a whole new technology being delivered in these floating LNG platforms because it was more efficient and more productive for the LNG processors to do it out at sea. We would much rather it happened on shore using Australian workers, but efficiency and productivity was woeful. So they have invented this whole new technology that bypasses a lot of Australian workers, and it is a pity. We do not want that to go on continuously. We want our workplace to be productive and effective.


Some of the amendments, in particular, insert new sections which put effect to those principles. Industrial action still can be taken with these amendments, but there has to be a genuine discussion about the productivity gains. Some of these productivity gains were mentioned by the previous speaker with some shock, horror and surprise. But getting rid of restrictive and inefficient work practices is to be commended. I think it is an excellent idea. Employees having more responsibilities, but then becoming more productive is another great principle. Improving design efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace is another great principle. But the previous speaker looked on in horror and surprise, thinking that this might be, essentially, a bad thing.


As I mentioned, it does not force productivity into the workplace. It is very gentle. It is just saying that you have got to discuss it. It has got to be part of the negotiation process, and before you have protected strike action you have to have a protected ballot to see if the workers do actually want to undertake strike action. These are hardly revolutionary ideas. But, if you do get manifestly excessive claims like a 38 per cent wage rise without any productivity gains, no business can survive that. These regulatory changes will introduce common sense. We said before the election that we would work with the Fair Work Commission—we are working with the Fair Work Commission and we are putting sensible regulatory changes in place, and good outcomes should result. 


Subsection 443(1) provides that the Fair Work Commission must make a protected action ballot order if it is satisfied that an application for a protected action ballot order has been made and that each applicant has been, and most importantly is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement. How often have we heard about the rush to a strike action happening without genuine negotiations. We are putting on the table that this has to occur in a genuine fashion. We are putting on the table that improvements to productivity have been discussed. It requires, at the minimum, that discussions about those radical ideas that I mentioned, such as improvements to productivity by removing restrictive work practices, have been considered. Under subsection 443(1), the protected action ballot from an applicant is enshrined. 


These reasonable initiatives are going to increase our productivity, they are going to make us more competitive, they are going to make businesses sustainable and they will get rid of manifestly excessive claims—and, if the claims do have an obvious adverse effect on the productivity of the workplace, they will be considered. What we want to have is a two-way street; we want to put the 'fair' back into the Fair Work Act so that the employer or the developer of a project gets the economics of the situation considered. It is then a two-way street; it is not a one-way street with random manifestly excessive claims and rapid moves to industrial action occur before true negotiations take place, and that the workers, if they are involved in it, have had a ballot to see if they really want to go down that route. So, let us put the Fair Work Act back into a fair space so both sides get to do genuine negotiations. I commend this bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (10:06):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014. Labor oppose this bill. However, we have sought to refer the bill to a Senate committee to examine whether the government's claims about its merits stand up to scrutiny. At this stage, we believe that the bill is not ideally constructed. It is ambiguous, imposes red tape on small businesses, may increase costs and create uncertainty. We do believe, however, that finding ways to increase productivity is of significant importance and so we will seek the view of stakeholders, through the committee, on the proposed changes. As the Chief Executive of the Australian Mines and Metals Association Steven Knott claims, Australian businesses are looking for reform 'to help sustain our nation's economic growth, living standards and employment'. Labor wants to ensure that any changes to the current system will increase productivity, growth and jobs. That is why we have taken the responsible decision to refer the bill to a Senate committee.


It is worth noting that this bill was introduced on Thursday and here we are, only one week later, debating the merits of a bill which could have very significant impacts on how employers, unions and employees conduct themselves during bargaining and how the Fair Work Commission operates. Given the Abbott government flagged the idea of these changes in their policy document, why has it taken so long? Why is the government now seeking to rush this through parliament?


The construction of the bill is clearly inconsistent with the government's election policy document. Labor is concerned that this will lead to adverse consequences—and who could blame us? Australians have been misled by the government with a proposed GP tax, fuel tax, cuts to the ABC and SBS, cuts to the indexation of the pension, cuts to health and cuts to higher education—the list goes on and on. And we do not want this bill adding to that already long list.


In short, Labor cannot support this bill as it currently stands because it may be ambiguous and may result in no change other than to create additional red tape, increase costs and generate uncertainty for employers, unions and employees; and, at worst, it is an assault on employees' democratic right to bargain effectively at the workplace. Labor contends that the bill is poorly constructed and is potentially bad policy. I will consider the bill sequentially and deal with the government's proposed 'productivity discussions' and then move to the protected industrial action proposals in the bill.


In addressing the government's proposal relating to productivity discussions as part of enterprise agreements we arrive at their first broken promise. Labor is concerned the government has gone further than their election policy and put the power directly into employers' hands. The coalition's policy document states:


Before an enterprise agreement is approved, the Fair Work Commission will have to be satisfied that the parties have at least discussed productivity as part of their negotiation process. The key is to make sure—


and this perhaps the most important part—


that workers and managers have at least considered how to improve productivity to help their workplace work effectively.


If the government was serious about addressing productivity in the case of both workers and managers they could have considered amendments to the good faith bargaining rules and made clear what was expected during that process. Instead they have opted for this new requirement which may not benefit the process of bargaining for and, eventually, completing an enterprise agreement. Due to the clumsy drafting of the provision two equally plausible situations arise. One scenario is the government's proposal does nothing but add red tape, increase costs and create industry uncertainty. Indeed, respected industrial relations academic Professor Andrew Stewart, from the University of Adelaide, has said the government's requirement for productivity discussions is 'completely token' and 'more red tape', which would not create much change.


Geoffrey Giudice, the highly regarded former President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and its successor Fair Work Australia, has said that requiring parties to formally take productivity into account in enterprise bargaining would create definitional and quantitative issues. On the implications, including productivity, Giudice has said:


In the case of parties who were already having difficulty reaching agreement, any additional requirement would not be helpful. Where parties are in agreement, there would be a temptation to find spurious productivity improvements where none existed in order to satisfy the statutory requirements.


Giudice goes on to say:


Building in further process would be unlikely to yield a net benefit.


It is for these reasons that Labor believes that further investigation needs to be done by a Senate committee to look at the implications of this bill.


The government claims it has a deregulation and red tape reduction agenda. Well, here is a perfect and simple example that the government may be doing exactly the opposite—in this case, inflicting unnecessary requirements on business. In practice the outcome of this bill, if it is passed, may only create a box-ticking exercise where the bargaining parties just place a tick to say they have discussed productivity—and that would be it. However, like everything with this government, we must dig a little deeper because we know the government's intention is not actually to deal with productivity. This Liberal Party's agenda has been to wage a continuing crusade against working people by imposing the requirements on unions while providing options for employers to avoid the requirements.


It is against this backdrop that we must consider an ulterior scenario that might arise from the successful passage of this bill. Just as there is the possibility that this provision is ineffective there is also a very real and equally conceivable risk that the construction of this provision could operate as a veto power for employers. The new requirement states that the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that improvements to productivity were discussed 'during' bargaining for the agreement. However, the relevant section of the Fair Work Act 2009 refers to the requirements that must be met before the Fair Work Commission can approve an enterprise agreement. Therefore, it is not beyond the bounds of reason that a situation might arise where an employer says, 'I don't want to talk about productivity until we've discussed the cutting of wages, holidays or other conditions.' Does that mean that, if this bill is enacted, an agreement can never be completed if employees refuse to accept those adverse changes first? This looks like it may tip the balance of bargaining further in favour of employers. So already we are seeing the potential effect that this bill could have—supporting Labor's sensible position that this bill be referred to a committee for further examination.


Labor knows how important productivity is. That is why, when we were in government, we ensured it was included in the objects of the act. ABS data shows that labour productivity has increased over the last 12 quarters. Labor's workplace relations policies are working to deliver productive and sustainable outcomes for Australian employers and their workforce. What we know is that productivity was three times higher under Labor's Fair Work Act than during the draconian Work Choices regime. This productivity increase took place after the repealing of WorkChoices and, most remarkably, while we were enduring the greatest global economic shock since the Great Depression.


And just as we know how important productivity is, we know how insincere the government's sloganeering about productivity is. If the government were genuinely serious about productivity they would not be cutting trade training centres, they would not be gutting $2 billion from training and skills, they would not be seeking to open up the temporary migration streams while thousands of Australian workers are unemployed and they would not be removing protections for Australian workers. Instead, the government would be building infrastructure properly, including rolling out Labor's NBN and investing in rail. They would be training our young people in the skills our economy needs for the future. They would be investing in entrepreneurship and innovation and assisting small business.


But we see none of that from this government. No thinly veiled attempt to canvass productivity as part of the approval requirements of enterprise bargaining can hide the fact that the Prime Minister is failing on jobs, training, infrastructure and ultimately productivity. A further concern that Labor has with this bill is the definition—more appropriately, the lack thereof—of productivity. The bill simply does not define productivity, so there is a multitude of ways that it might be interpreted. We know that economists have many different definitions of what productivity is. Indeed, some employers would have a different view of productivity to that of their employees. For example, it can be rightly argued that including an additional week's training—for, say, technical employees who are party to an agreement—is a measure that will boost productivity, increasing skills and leading to productivity outcomes. However, it could also be argued—perhaps with less veracity and probably by those members opposite—that it is not a productivity-boosting measure at all but, rather, an unproductive measure, because the employee would be incapable of working for that week.


So, again, on the definition of productivity and the perspectives that parties bring to that definition you can see can see how it can create division, uncertainty and debate and may not lead to the certainty required for negotiating agreements. The government's explanatory memorandum uses examples of productivity improvements such as 'elimination of restrictive or inefficient work practices' and initiatives to provide employers with 'greater responsibilities or additional skills directly translating to improved outcomes'. What on earth does this mean? I guarantee that the government does not know—and that might very well be deliberate. We may conclude, as Professor Stewart has said, that the government is deliberately trying to make it difficult and ambiguous and induce doubt among employees seeking to take protected industrial action. And I would like to return to that point a little later. But the problem is that the construction of the examples is so inept that it will potentially lead to employers needing to take legal advice in relation to protected action matters as well.


I will now address the concerns Labor has around the changes to protected action. We contend that the Abbott government's proposals reflect a deep misunderstanding of bargaining and negotiation. We are concerned that the proposed amendments to the sections of the Fair Work Act that govern protected industrial action may have been introduced to appease those who have lobbied the government from a particular sector of the economy—namely, big business. Our concern is that the government's ideological war against unions continues in this bill. There are two parts to the government's proposed amendments to protected industrial action ballots. The determination about what constitutes genuinely trying to reach an agreement has been a matter for the Fair Work Commission based on all the circumstances since the institution of protected industrial action was created under Paul Keating. Indeed, there was no attempt to change that definition in the Howard years. In this bill the government is proposing to essentially codify elements of a Fair Work decision they deem favourable. The proposal is that the test for whether an applicant—an employee organisation—for a protected action ballot has been, and is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement would include a non-exhaustive list of matters, which are:


(a) the steps taken by each applicant to try and reach agreement;


(b) the extent to which each applicant has communicated the claims;


(c) whether the applicant has provided a considered response to the proposals made by the employer;


(d) the extent to which bargaining for the agreement has progressed.


In pursuing this amendment, again, two scenarios arise. First, the government's insistence to codify the matters is completely unnecessary given that commissioners currently are entirely free to have regard to all relevant circumstances and do not disregard the matters to which I have just referred. Second, the government is introducing the additional requirements because they are applicable only to those making an application for protection action—namely, employees' organisations: unions. There are no corresponding additional elements placed on employers.


If this were the case, it would be yet again an election breach. Given the government's propensity to break its election commitments, this is the more likely scenario. To be clear, the election policy of the government stipulated:


Workers and business must be genuine in their attempts to bargain so that realistic improvements in employment conditions can occur for everyone.

There is another difficulty that presents itself in this scenario. If the 'extent to which bargaining for the agreement has progressed' is included as a compulsory consideration, this again may encourage employers to frustrate the process of bargaining. What will happen if employers stall bargaining? Again, we think that is best examined further by a Senate committee. Also, the government's explanatory memorandum refers, at paragraph 17, to an applicant for a protected action ballot having to take 'genuine and reasonable steps to engage with an employer'. Perhaps we could think about this in another way: how many times is it reasonable for an applicant to go back to an intransigent employer?

But, when applications cross over to manifestly unreasonable or excessive, you have to have the ability in our negotiation system to make sure the unreasonableness or the economic reality of a situation come to bear. So productivity is at the essence of this bill.


In Australia, we are pricing ourselves out of so many of our traditional markets. We have, for many years, being very efficient miners. We have been very efficient farmers and producers of wonderful produce. But, if we have inefficient industrial relations without productivity gains, all our competitive advantage will go. You only have to look at the JJ Richards case from three or four years ago or the case in the north-west with the tugboat negotiations, where there were unbelievably generous ambit claims put in. That is what this regulatory change to the act is aiming to address. It compels the Fair Work Commission to consider productivity changes. It also addresses the process by which protected industrial action can be taken. 'Protected industrial action' means whoever goes on strike is not liable, in a civil sense, for any of the consequences of the strike.


These are two essential problems for the nation: the return of our productivity growth, which was the marker of income growth and national prosperity through the late eighties and nineties into the early 2000's. That is why our society was in a really sweet spot where people's household incomes were growing and there was growth in businesses which employ more Australians. But we seem to have lost that. We have been on vacation regarding productivity growth. If we do not become productive, things become more expensive. Our products that we try to sell are less competitive. So our trade suffers. To make the most of our free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China, we have to lift our productivity. The trade deals themselves will not get us the wealth and prosperity that we have within our grasp. It will happen if we become more productive.


One only has to look at the LNG revolution. There is a whole new technology being delivered in these floating LNG platforms because it was more efficient and more productive for the LNG processors to do it out at sea. We would much rather it happened on shore using Australian workers, but efficiency and productivity was woeful. So they have invented this whole new technology that bypasses a lot of Australian workers, and it is a pity. We do not want that to go on continuously. We want our workplace to be productive and effective.


Some of the amendments, in particular, insert new sections which put effect to those principles. Industrial action still can be taken with these amendments, but there has to be a genuine discussion about the productivity gains. Some of these productivity gains were mentioned by the previous speaker with some shock, horror and surprise. But getting rid of restrictive and inefficient work practices is to be commended. I think it is an excellent idea. Employees having more responsibilities, but then becoming more productive is another great principle. Improving design efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace is another great principle. But the previous speaker looked on in horror and surprise, thinking that this might be, essentially, a bad thing.


As I mentioned, it does not force productivity into the workplace. It is very gentle. It is just saying that you have got to discuss it. It has got to be part of the negotiation process, and before you have protected strike action you have to have a protected ballot to see if the workers do actually want to undertake strike action. These are hardly revolutionary ideas. But, if you do get manifestly excessive claims like a 38 per cent wage rise without any productivity gains, no business can survive that. These regulatory changes will introduce common sense. We said before the election that we would work with the Fair Work Commission—we are working with the Fair Work Commission and we are putting sensible regulatory changes in place, and good outcomes should result. 


Subsection 443(1) provides that the Fair Work Commission must make a protected action ballot order if it is satisfied that an application for a protected action ballot order has been made and that each applicant has been, and most importantly is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement. How often have we heard about the rush to a strike action happening without genuine negotiations. We are putting on the table that this has to occur in a genuine fashion. We are putting on the table that improvements to productivity have been discussed. It requires, at the minimum, that discussions about those radical ideas that I mentioned, such as improvements to productivity by removing restrictive work practices, have been considered. Under subsection 443(1), the protected action ballot from an applicant is enshrined. 


These reasonable initiatives are going to increase our productivity, they are going to make us more competitive, they are going to make businesses sustainable and they will get rid of manifestly excessive claims—and, if the claims do have an obvious adverse effect on the productivity of the workplace, they will be considered. What we want to have is a two-way street; we want to put the 'fair' back into the Fair Work Act so that the employer or the developer of a project gets the economics of the situation considered. It is then a two-way street; it is not a one-way street with random manifestly excessive claims and rapid moves to industrial action occur before true negotiations take place, and that the workers, if they are involved in it, have had a ballot to see if they really want to go down that route. So, let us put the Fair Work Act back into a fair space so both sides get to do genuine negotiations. I commend this bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (10:41):  by leave—I rise to make a ministerial statement about our achievements in schools and cross-border education.




Introduction 



This government has honoured all its education election promises.


The difference between the coalition and Labor is that we are driving long term policies, to improve the quality of our education system, not short term politics to satisfy allied vested interests. 


Australian school student performance results as measured by international testing have declined over the last 12 years. While national testing indicates some positive changes, overall student performance in key areas of numeracy and reading have not shown marked improvement.


This cannot be allowed to continue.


Education policy must now be measured not by how much money has been allocated, not by the number of teachers, not by classroom sizes, but whether public funds are being spent on what works to improve student outcomes! 



Certainty and stability in school funding



We inherited a school funding mess from Labor with only three states fully signed up—hardly a national system.


We fixed the mess and honoured our election commitment of matching dollar for dollar the previous government's spending over the next four years. 


More than that, we reinstated the $1.2 billion cut by the previous government because they felt it reasonable to completely exclude funding to states and territories that had not signed up.


Australia now has a national needs based funding system which includes loadings for disadvantage.


We did what Labor could not achieve by providing certainty and stability to schools.




Students First Initiatives 



The Students First framework focuses on four priority areas:


Improving the quality of our teachers 


Increasing school autonomy 


Promoting parental engagement


Ensuring our curriculum is robust and relevant 




Teacher Quality



Improving teacher quality has been more talked about than acted upon for far too long. 


Teacher quality is known to be the greatest in-school contributor to student performance.


We want better teacher standards and training to produce great teachers with practical skills to teach effectively in the classroom.


Hence, I have appointed the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group to provide advice on reforming teacher education. 


I expect to receive the final report soon. 


To ensure our vision for teacher reform is achieved I appointed the internationally recognised Professor John Hattie as the new chair of the Australian Institute of Teaching and School Leadership.


We have also expanded the Teach for Australia program which fast tracks high-calibre non-teaching graduates into disadvantaged schools.



School autonomy



Giving parents, teachers and principals a greater say in how their schools are run is a key ingredient to improving student performance.


All states and territories are moving in this direction. 


To support the states and territories further we have invested $70 million over four years through our Independent Public School initiative.


I am pleased to report that most states and territories have now signed agreements to participate.


We are delivering what we promised.




Promoting parental engagement 



Research shows that when parents are engaged in their children's education, their children perform better.


We have committed $1 million per year over four years to the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY) to research parental engagement and inform future policy actions. The Independent Public Schools initiative will also promote greater parental involvement in their children's school.




A robust National Curriculum



A robust national curriculum is one of the foundations of a quality education. It must be up to date, relevant, balanced and understandable to all parents. We established, as promised, an independent review. It reported in October and has been widely praised because it focused on getting the national curriculum back to basics—to what really matters.


Implementation will be a priority during 2015 following consultation with state and territory education ministers at our 12 December education ministers' council.




NAPLAN faster turn
ar
ound



This government supports the National Assessment Program Literacy and Numeracy—NAPLAN—but results have been taking too long to be returned to teachers. We promised to reduce the NAPLAN turnaround time. I am pleased to report that preliminary results are now being provided four weeks earlier. We are delivering.




NAPLAN Online



We are moving to have online delivery for NAPLAN in 2017 for schools that are ready. We have progressed this project from in-principle agreement, to allocating $24.7 million so it can start in less than three years. This is a great step forward. It will allow teachers a faster and better understanding of their students' abilities so as to improve every students' performance. I thank the state and territory education ministers for their cooperation and collaboration in bringing this about.




Australian Education Act 2013



Nothing better contrasts the approach of the coalition to the conduct of the former government than our changes to the Australian Education Act 2013. Labor rushed the passage of the current act, resulting in numerous errors. Our amendments passed the parliament and have not only fixed these but have allowed us to provide an extra $6.8 million for non-government schools that have significant numbers of Indigenous boarding students from remote areas. This fixed an identified funding shortfall which the previous government failed to provide. 


But more needs to be done. Following recent consultations there was unanimous agreement from stakeholders that the command-and-control aspects of the act place unnecessary regulatory burdens on all schools. We will address this problem next year when we introduce further amendments to the act.




Flexible Literacy for Remote Primary Schools (Good to Great Schools)



In remote primary schools that have a high proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, NAPLAN results show basic English literacy is not being achieved. Evidence suggests that alphabetic teaching approaches are beneficial for children who are having difficulty learning to read. We appointed Good to Great Schools Australia to introduce alphabetic teaching approaches under our Flexible Literacy in Remote Primary Schools program. 


Nearly 40 schools across Western Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory will benefit in 2015. This will help to close the gap between students from remote areas and those based in metropolitan areas. 




Disability



The Australian government is committed to assisting students with disability, and this year introduced a loading which provided over $1 billion of Australian government funding. This is more funding for students with disability than ever before. In 2015 this will increase by $100 million. 



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  I thank the member for Wakefield for pointing out the large number of my colleagues who have come in to support this ministerial statement.




Mr Champion:
  They are flocking like gulls to a chip.



Ms Kate Ellis interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  You get back to doing your texting on the mobile phone. We know how interested you are in education policy, member for Adelaide!




Ms Kate Ellis:
  You are the texter. I cannot compete with you when it comes to texting.




Mr PYNE:
  You are probably playing games on your phone, are you? I like to work on my phone.


We continue to work with state and territory governments to further refine the funding loading for students with disability to better reflect their needs.




STEM



The government is restoring a focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics—STEM—subjects in schools, so essential to ensuring a competitive and innovative economy. Consequently, we have allocated: 


$7.4 million to develop and implement mathematics by inquiry;


$3.5 million towards introduction to computer coding across the curriculum ;


$0.5 million towards establishing a P-TECH styled education facility in Geelong—




Ms Henderson:
  Hear! Hear!




Mr PYNE:
  I continue:


$0.6 million to extend national science and mathematics summer schools to include more girls, disadvantaged and Indigenous school students, including those from regional and remote areas. 


I note the member for Corangamite has been extremely supportive of the P-TECH trial in her electorate.





Schools 
c
haplaincy 
p
rogram



Following the decision of the previous government to provide no ongoing funding for school chaplains, I am pleased to report all state and territory governments have now agreed to implement the government's new chaplaincy program. Funding is available for the 2015 school year and applications are currently being handled by the states and territories. 




Cross-border education



In the time remaining, I would like to update the House on recent developments in international education and how the government is developing a two-way street in this important area. International education is part of our plan to build a more diverse, world-class economy—a five-pillar economy—to unleash Australia's real economic potential. By developing a world-class, five-pillar economy we will deliver more jobs.


International education is Australia's largest services export. Under Labor the value of this industry plummeted. Recent figures released by the Department of Education suggest that, under the coalition, international education has grown by over a billion dollars in just one year. This is vital income for the Australian economy. 


But international education is about much more than economic prosperity for the nation. Relationships developed through international education underpin our engagement with the rest of the world. They are the foundation for future research collaboration. They assist to maintain trade, investment and goodwill. They make our innovative achievements and scholarly assets more visible to the world. They keep us competitive and ensure Australia does not get left behind.


This government is working hard to:


promote Australia as the best country in the world to pursue higher education study;


drive growth through greater collaboration with countries in the areas of education and research; and


deliver social mobility programmes such as the New Colombo Plan and the Endeavour Scholarships and Fellowships program.





New Colombo Plan



The New Colombo Plan offers Australian undergraduates prestigious scholarships and grants for study and internships/mentorships in the Indo-Pacific region. More than 3,100 students will benefit through the 2015 round.




Endeavour 
s
cholarships



We will support 682 Endeavour scholarship recipients to undertake researcher mobility, because international collaboration is well known to lead to more innovation than single-country research. I have also established a number of new education agreements with counties in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. 




China and Laos visit



I recently visited China and Laos to participate in education meetings under the auspices of the East Asia Summit. Education ministers committed to the development of a post-2015 plan of action. 


While in Beijing, I met with my Chinese counterpart, Minister for Education, Mr Yuan Guiren, to discuss the Australia-China education and research relationship and the importance of two-way student mobility through our New Colombo Plan. 




Indonesia MOU and Centre



During the East Asia Summit I renewed Australia's agreement in education and training with the Republic of Indonesia.


This reaffirms the importance Australia places on the education relationship with Indonesia.


It sets a strong foundation for continued engagement over the next five years by growing people-to-people links through greater two-way student and academic mobility.


The government is also supporting the Australia-Indonesia Centre, announced by the Prime Minister last year.


This centre aims to strengthen business, cultural, educational, research and community links and build mutual understanding.


Monash University leads the centre, in partnership with other universities and CSIRO. I met with the new Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, Margaret Gardner, only yesterday evening to talk about not only the centre but her support for our education reforms.


At the East Asia summit of education ministers, I also had the opportunity to sit down and talk to my counterparts from South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Singapore and Loas.



Australia-UK Education Dialogue



Earlier in the year I also visited the then Minister of State for Universities and Science, the Right Honourable David Willetts in the UK.


We agreed to establish an inaugural Australia-UK Education Dialogue. As my department recently noted in Senate committee hearings, it is the first time an initiative like this has ever been done before.



Next year we will continue our efforts and consult over a draft National Strategy for International Education.




Conclusion



Madam Speaker, this government is improving Australian education as promised.


I move:


That the House take note of the document.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Adelaide to speak for 13 minutes.


Leave granted.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide) (10:54):  Doesn't it just demonstrate what an utter farce these government's claims are, to have had a year of achievement, when they try to point to their schools achievement, of all things, to try to prove this. One thing we should at least be grateful of is that there are many within the sector who thought that this minister had forgotten he had responsibility for schools. He has been so side-tracked in his fruitless pursuit to strip our universities of one-fifth of their funding and trying to introduce $100,000 degrees for Australian undergraduate students that he has failed to even remember that he is meant to have responsibilities for schools, and people have been scratching their heads wondering where this minister, missing in action, has been.


We do recognise that the minister has rediverted his attention away from his hapless efforts in higher education to at least talk about schools. Unfortunately, though, it has not been a year of achievement in schools and education by this government. Instead, we are here to lament their year of utter failure in this regard. When it comes to schools policy, it has been a year of broken promises. It has been, sadly, a year of squandered opportunities, a year that has been spent by the minister and by the government on petty politics and destruction and on absolute destruction of the goodwill that had been built up in the sector and in the really significant and important reform and progress that had been made. It is a shameless and a brazen move by the minister to come into the chamber today, on the last day of the sitting year, and try to crow about the government's achievements in these areas. I guess we should not be surprised by shameless and brazen moves by a minister who just tried to criticise me about text messaging in a week when his own text messaging habits have been a subject of national debate.


It has been nothing but another thinly veiled attempt to deny reality and to try to rewrite history. It is a very tired trick in the playbook of what has very quickly become an utterly dysfunctional and chaotic government—a government which has proven themselves capable of three-word slogans but incapable of serious policy and incapable of the serious commitment we need to lift our schools' performance.


In contrast to the glossy statements and the brave act of denial that we have just seen from the minister, I will offer an honest stocktake of the government's achievements when it comes to schools policy and I will make this assessment against the criteria that this government set for themselves by what they told the Australian public before the last election they would do if elected. Before the election, the government promised:


Kevin Rudd and I are on an absolute unity ticket when it comes to school funding.


That is what the now Prime Minister said. We know that the minister said:


You can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school.


He went on to say:


We have agreed to the government's school funding model.


He also told the Australian people:


We are committed to the student resource standard, of course we are. We are committed to this new school funding model.


On election day, in South Australia, when voters turned up at their polling booths, we saw the large signs where this government was desperately trying to deceive the Australian people. The last thing people saw before they went in to vote were large signs saying: 'Liberals will match Labor's school funding dollar for dollar.'


Let's look at how the government's year of what they call achievement lines up against the promises that they made to the Australian public. The government has broken every promise. They have cut all additional funding for the fifth and sixth years of the Gonski reforms. They have cut $80 billion from schools and hospitals over the next decade—the biggest ever cut that this country has seen when it comes to schools policies, and they have the gall to come into this House and tried to crow about a year of achievement when it comes to schools. They have cut $100 million a year from the More Support for Students with Disabilities program and failed in their promise for more funding from 2015. They have let the state governments off the hook by promising not to enforce their funding obligations under the Gonski agreements and they have locked school funding to CPI from 2018.


Those opposite try to say that this is not a cut at all, but let us just consider that the current legislation makes it very clear that school funding will be indexed at 4.7 per cent moving forward. This government's budget papers make it very clear that school funding will be indexed at CPI, which is currently 2.5 per cent moving forward. They can try to say that black is white all that they like, but we and the Australian public know that that is a very clear cut, and it is a devastating cut for every school right across the country. The budget papers need to be crystal clear about this.



Mr Pyne interjecting—




Ms KATE ELLIS:
  The minister interjects and says, 'Lies'. He may try to say that 2.5 per cent is not less than 4.7 per cent. I would challenge the minister to try to put that case to the Australian public, because the government continually take the Australian public for fools. We know that this is a cut. It is spelt out in their budget papers how big a cut this is and it is ripping almost $30 billion from schools right across Australia, and then they come into this House and say that black is white and that it is not really happening. We know that they have not had the guts to change the act, but it is a cut in anyone's language.


Of course, we know that there are two hallmarks of this government's approach to education policy. Firstly, there is uncertainty and chaos, which we have seen in both schools and in higher education policy over the last year. Secondly, and arguably worse, there is the hypocrisy and the deception. We have seen that, again, in a statement that the minister just made to the House. I would like to refer to the actual words of the minister where he stated: 'Education policy must now be measured by where public funds are being spent on what works to improve student outcomes'. I would say that the minister is absolutely right in those words, but he is not right in what he is actually doing, which is something very different.


On too many occasions to count the Prime Minister and the minister have actually stressed that Commonwealth funding for schools is, 'No strings attached'. The minister then comes into this House and tries to argue: 'It's not the amount of money; it's what you are spending it on that is important'. At the same time he is saying to the state governments: 'Here you go. Here is a blank cheque. Here is some school funding, but you can spend it on whatever you like, because we are getting rid of these so-called control-and-command elements and we are offering'—their own words—'a no-strings-attached approach'. How you can reconcile those two sentences and not be seen to be entirely hypocritical is something which I would love to hear the minister explain?




Mr Pyne:
  Don't you trust the states?




Ms KATE ELLIS:
  The minister asks: Don't you trust the states?' What I actually believe is that the Commonwealth government should have accountability mechanisms to make sure that we are increasing school funding, not just for the sake of the dollar figure, but to make sure that that funding is going specifically towards programs to improve outcomes for students. I do not think that is a particularly radical approach. I think it makes sense that the Australian public would think that the government has some accountability mechanisms in place and is making sure that dollars are being directed towards the areas which are going to have a real impact and lift student results.


The Gonski agreements have made it crystal clear that enforcements should be made. This government have walked away from ensuring that that additional funding is directed towards the five key areas of reforms. They have washed their hands of the responsibility, and it is unimaginable that such an irresponsible approach could be taken to billions of dollars in Commonwealth schools funding. Of course, we already know that there are states that are making the most of this in that they are receiving money from the Commonwealth for their schools but they are cutting more money from their state budgets for schools and seeing school results actually go backwards.


Contrast this with Labor's vision with the work that was done, not just by the previous government, but by the entire sector who all took part in the biggest review that we have had of Australia's school system in over 40 years. We went through this process and we had students, teachers, parents, academics and principals come together and say: 'What do we need to do to lift our school outcomes?' We need to recognise that we do have a serious problem in Australia's schools. We do need to recognise that we have serious inequality when it comes to the results of our students. We need to recognise that the gap between well-off and disadvantaged students is wider than the OECD average, and it is growing. We also need to recognise that in this country, right now under our watch, regional students lag behind their city peers by almost a year and remote students are almost two years behind. We were willing to tackle this head on. We went through the process and came up with the solutions. The important thing is that this nation now knows the solutions that this minister refuses to implement. He should be absolutely ashamed of that.


Sadly, we are not just lamenting a year of failure when it comes to our schools. We are also looking forward to what is next on the agenda. I think it is important to note that we have seen a number of examples recently where the Prime Minister has made statements. For example, earlier this week he said:


It would be better if the states could deal with their responsibilities from own-source revenues rather than having to argue with the Commonwealth to fund their schools.


What we see in the year ahead is that this government have set themselves up to try to wash their hands of all responsibilities for public schools. We need to make very clear that this is not about reform. This is about more cuts on their behalf. We also make very clear—and I have no doubt whatsoever—that whilst those opposite might want to completely walk away from schools funding and from our public schools, it is the absolute role of the federal government to try to ensure this nation's international competitiveness. It is the role of the federal government to ensure that our nation has the skills that we need for the future, and it is the role of the federal government to make sure that we are as productive an economy as we can possibly be. You cannot do that if you walk away from our education system and from investing in having the best possible schools across the nation.


We know that the minister also bragged about his school chaplains announcement. How hypocritical is it for a government to talk about the need for schools to have more autonomy yet, at the same time, for the federal minister to say: 'You no longer have the choice about whether you have a welfare officer, a counsellor, or a religious chaplain. We as the federal government, I as the federal education minister, are dictating that you no longer have a choice'? The over-600 non-religious welfare officers have to go. No longer will the government fund them because, rather than giving schools autonomy, rather than leaving it to principals and school communities to work out who can best serve their community, this minister has made the decision for them. If they are not strictly linked to a religious organisation, they can no longer attract funding. How is that in line with increased autonomy for our schools?


The minister talked about higher education and tried to claim credit for the recovery in international education. Anyone who actually understand international education will know that reputation and quality is everything, and it was the hard work of the previous government— (Time expired)

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (11:08):  I present a copy of my ministerial statement to the House.

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Schools and Cross-border Education</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,5,1
"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (11:09):  The big idea behind the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 is that productivity should drive wage negotiations and wage outcomes, and that this will balance real wage increases against ensuring low levels of unemployment. The bill will amend the Fair Work Act to ensure that, when approving an enterprise agreement, the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that productivity improvements at the workplace were discussed during bargaining for the agreement. All of the existing enterprise agreement approval requirements under the Fair Work Act will be retained. 


The bill also amends the Fair Work Act to provide further guidance and greater transparency regarding the circumstances in which protected action ballot orders can be made. It ensures that the Fair Work Commission must not make a protected ballot order where it is satisfied that the claims of an applicant for a protected action ballot are manifestly excessive or, importantly, would have significantly adverse impacts on productivity at the workplace. The idea that productivity should be at the heart of wage negotiations and wage outcomes is not a new one. We saw it, perhaps, at its best during the period of the prices and incomes accords. This idea was a bedrock of the accords driven by the Labor government in the 1980s, which were a considerable contributor to helping Australia out of its economic malaise at the time.


Let us have a little bit of a look at the importance of productivity, or doing things smarter—which is what we really mean when we are talking about productivity in the workplace. In the medium term and in the long term and to some extent even in the short term we know that productivity is absolutely central to our standard of living improving.


Paul Krugman, the well-known Nobel laureate economist—who is, I should say, very much not on our side of politics—has said:


Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.


The point here is that we want to raise wages. We on this side of the House want to raise wages. We do not want to reduce them. But we know, as Krugman points out, that if we want wages to go up we have to raise labour productivity. We know from years and years of economic research that, if wages go up faster than productivity, unemployment rises. This is a very basic result in economics. But let us go beyond the theory. Let us have a look at what some of the researchers have said.


I will look at a paper written by none other than the member for Fraser and published in the Australian Economic Review in 2003. At the time he was at the Kennedy school of government at Harvard University—a great institution. He did a very interesting piece of work where he looked at six increases in wages in Western Australia between 1994 and 2001 to look at the impact of wages going up faster than productivity—minimum wages were the focus—on employment. On six occasions between 1994 and 2001 the minimum wage in WA was increased by between 3½ per cent and over nine per cent. After each of these increases the employment to population ratio—the employment rate—in WA fell relative to the rest of Australia. He then shows—he does the econometrics on this—that a one per cent increase in the minimum wage reduces employment by about 0.13. In fact, in a later correction to the paper, he said that that number was too low—in fact it should have been higher.


The really interesting part of this is that the employment impact is most substantial amongst younger employees, where the fall in employment is almost three times higher. If you raise wages faster than productivity, then you raise unemployment for younger people at three times the pace of the rest of the economy. The member for Fraser is a good economist and many other economists have confirmed that result. For the most part their results have been even stronger than his, but directionally they have confirmed exactly what he found—so we know that if you raise wages faster than productivity you drive up unemployment.


It is very important to note that productivity comes from far more than just squeezing employees. We know that productivity comes from working smarter, above all. That is innovation—working smarter; finding cleverer ways of doing the same things. Australian businesses, when encouraged to do so, have been extraordinarily good at doing exactly this. We also know that productivity comes from investment—building the capital stock—in public infrastructure: in roads, rail and telecommunications, and from private sector investment, which we saw starting to fall away dramatically in the latter period of the Labor government.


Australia has been at its very best when it has been delivering rising wages aligned with strong productivity. In our great economic history since European settlement we have consistently avoided oversupply of unskilled workers, and we should continue to do so. In doing so, we have been able to achieve rising real wages aligned with rising productivity. Central to that have been very high levels of capital investment putting upward pressure on wages, and we should celebrate that—that has been absolutely central to the economic miracle of 200 years that we have seen in this country.


I spoke about unemployment, and, of course, at the heart of any wage negotiation is this issue of unemployment. But nowhere has this become worse, particularly in the Labor years, than in the case of youth unemployment. There is no question that youth unemployment was a disaster during the period from 2007 to 2013.


Given the money that the Labor Party claims to have spent on jobs and skill creation and skill development, and the number of programs they claim to have put into place, we might have expected that the track record would in fact be superb. But let us have a look at the facts. Between the time they got into government in 2007 and the time they left in 2013, there was a significant increase in youth unemployment. Note here that, in the four years leading up to the new Labor government in 2007, we saw a 13 per cent growth under the Howard government in youth employment. But between 2008 and 2013, we saw an eight per cent reduction in youth employment. So we went from a 13 per cent increase in employment to an eight per cent reduction in youth employment across the economy.


At the same time, we can look at youth participation rates. They were running merrily along between 2004 and 2008, rising from 70 per cent participation up to 71 per cent—nice work by the Howard government. But, from early 2008 through to 2013, there was a reduction in participation for younger Australians from 71 per cent to 66 per cent—a disastrous drop; a five per cent reduction across the time of the Labor government.


They might say, 'That is all right; we were putting them all into training.' But we also find that the youth unemployment rate went from nine per cent in January 2008 to 12.4 per cent by the end of 2013. What a shameful record of youth employment and youth unemployment we saw from the last Labor government. We know there are terrible hot spots in western and north-western Tasmania. It got to 21 per cent unemployment under the Labor-Greens alliance, destroying jobs in Tasmania; in Cairns it was almost 21 per cent again; in North Adelaide it was around 20 per cent; and in south-eastern Tasmania it was 19.6 per cent—a social and economic disaster.


So the question is: what are we doing to address this? And alongside what is being proposed in this bill, we are working hard to strengthen the economy—and we know that a strong economy equals strong jobs growth. We are negotiating free trade agreements. We are investing record dollars in public infrastructure. We are removing excess taxation. We are reforming training and education—reforming our vocational education and training system. And we are establishing world-class employment services.


But this is not all. This legislation asks the Fair Work Commission to consider whether productivity was part of the negotiations in coming to an enterprise agreement. But we need the Fair Work Commission to come to terms with the scale of this problem and begin to address it. Indeed, the old industrial relations club used to understand the role of productivity, as I said earlier. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke understood that real wage hikes in the face of sluggish productivity are a disaster.


So what has the Fair Work Commission been doing? The short answer is that it has been making the situation worse, and is prioritising large wage hikes above jobs for young Australians, by not paying attention to productivity. This has been absolutely at its worst for the young in our population.


As I said, we all want rising wages; this is a bedrock of Australia's economic success. But you achieve rising wages by working smarter, investing more, building more infrastructure and improving our education system. You cannot simply raise wages in the absence of productivity gains.


I want to focus on two particular decisions made by the Fair Work Commission. The first was the modern awards review focused on apprentices, trainees and juniors of August 2013. A full bench of the Fair Work Commission handed down its decision on apprentice provisions in the two-year review of modern awards. It granted wage increases for first- and second-year apprentices, phased over a 12-month period. They effectively hiked the four-year wage structure for a junior apprentice who has completed year 12 from, in the first year, 42 per cent of full salary to 55 per cent, and, in the second year, from 55 per cent to 65 per cent. Effectively, what they were doing was significantly, sharply, increasing wages for first- and second-year apprentices, and, importantly, dissuading employers from wanting to take those apprentices on. The Fair Work Commission also decided that adult apprentices should receive 80 per cent of the fully qualified tradesperson's rate, which is a 10 per cent increase over what it previously was, and they passed on many costs of apprenticeships to employers, including such things as textbooks and travel costs.


This is an extraordinary conclusion, and it flies in the face of ensuring that wages track productivity. There is no question that this will be contributing to the unemployment of young people in Australia.


In a second decision, in March this year, a full bench of the Fair Work Commission granted an application by the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association to increase the rate of pay for 20-year-old retail employees from 90 per cent to 100 per cent of the adult rate—a 10 per cent wage increase. There is no argument to say that we have seen 10 per cent productivity gains during this time. So the impact of this decision, based on research we have seen from people such as the member for Fraser, must be to raise unemployment amongst young people.


This irresponsible bias, to ignore the basic economics of employment relationships, is a serious problem for young people, for employers and for Australia. The most disenfranchised in our population are the unemployed, and to increase the number of people who are out of employment through these sorts of decisions is a travesty.


It is time for the Fair Work Commission to recognise this, and to show some concern and compassion about the extraordinary increase in youth unemployment bestowed on us by the previous Labor government. Yes, we need to ensure that there is a strong economy with lots of job creation, strong support for job seekers and extensive support for training and education, but we are doing all of that. Now it is time for the Fair Work Commission to get real and confront youth unemployment.


This bill provides an opportunity to do exactly that by increasing the focus of the fair work legislation on productivity. I commend this bill to the House.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (11:23):  It is clear from the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 that the government has learnt nothing from the Work Choices debacle of the mid-2000s. Given this bill's very poor construction and the ambiguity within the bill, it seems that the bill really does appear to be nothing more than an attempt to undermine the right to bargain collectively, freely and autonomously and to undermine the right to strike.


Having said that, perhaps people more generous than I would want to give the government the benefit of the doubt on the bill, and for that reason I will be looking very carefully at the outcomes of the Senate inquiry into the bill to see whether or not there is some merit to the changes that are being proposed. But, given the circumstances of the bill being introduced, the timing, and the way the bill has been put together, it does really seem to be much more about perception that substance. It is another attempt to imply that the fair work legislation is somehow the cause of difficulties for labour productivity in this country, which is an issue to which I will return.


But before I do, I want to generally talk about the reasons why I said that the bill was an attempt to undermine the right to bargain collectively, freely and autonomously and an attempt to undermine the right to strike. Those issues go to the heart of one of the very clear differences between Liberal Party and the Labor Party. In the Labor Party, consistently with international law, we believe that there is a right to collectively bargain and that collective bargaining is to be preferred to individual bargaining in the workplace. To the contrary, the Liberal Party has always preferred individual bargaining, and we saw that under Work Choices.


In Work Choices, the Australian workplace agreements were statutory individual contracts that were able to, and did, undermine minimum working standards and conditions in this country. By way of example: 63 per cent of Australian workplace agreements made under Work Choices removed penalty rates, another pet hate of the coalition.


I am sure that members opposite do not necessarily want to be outed as still supporting individual contracts, but if you want evidence of that just have a look at the other fair work bill that is presently before this parliament, and has been for most of the year. The other fair work bill of course seeks to privilege and support their use of individual contracts by changing the individual flexibility agreement regime.


It is unfortunate and regrettable, but the Liberals seem to have learnt very little from their experience with Work Choices and are still pushing the bandwagon for statutory individual contracts, which of course are deeply problematic, and we saw that under Work Choices. We saw the conditions that were stripped away using AWAs at the time. But, on this side of the House, we understand and support collective bargaining. It is also, as a matter of international law, something that should be supported. You might recall that the ILO strongly criticised the Australian workplace relations laws known as Work Choices because of the way that they privileged individual negotiations ahead of collective bargaining.


To explain what I mean when I talk about our international obligations in respect of collective bargaining, I just want to mention a very helpful article, ' Protected industrial action and voluntary collective bargaining under the Fair Work Act 2009'by Shae McCrystal from the Faculty of Law, University of Sydney. To recite the discussion about our international obligations, Shae says: 


Australia is bound in international law to respect the right to strike under Article 8(1)(d) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as a component of the principles of freedom of association protected by the Constitution of the ILO … and as a component of the obligation to respect the right of workers to organise to protect their economic and social interests in Article 3 of the ILO’s Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention … obligation is not limited to protection of the right to strike for the purposes of collective bargaining, but extends to recognition of the right to strike for workers to protect and further their ‘economic and social interests’ … Further, Article 4 of the ILO’s Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 … requires ratifying States to encourage and promote the full development of voluntary collective bargaining between employers, their associations and workers’ associations. The essential element of this obligation is the promotion of collective bargaining which is of a voluntary nature. This has been found to imply recognition of the autonomy of the bargaining parties.


That is a very good and convenient summary of the international obligations that we have.


In contrast to the international obligations that we have, this is a bill that places fetters on bargaining parties' autonomy and rights to conduct negotiations freely. Again, it harks back to Work Choices—continually trying to regulate what parties have to do when they are bargaining in the workplace. If you want to talk about over-regulation and red tape, think about the prohibited content provisions of the Work Choices legislation at the time. There was a lengthy list of things that parties were not at liberty to include in their enterprise agreements—a lengthy list of restrictions and limitations on parties' autonomy and right to collectively bargain freely. And what are we now seeing with this bill? We are seeing a new obligation, a new box to be ticked when an application is made to the Fair Work Commission to approve an agreement.


Of course parties talk about productivity in their bargaining. But this legislation is not about encouraging productivity measures; it is about finding another piece of red tape for parties to have to go through when they go to the commission and ask for approval of their workplace agreement.


One difficulty with adding in another consideration for the commission to take into account in the bargaining approval process, as my colleague the shadow minister pointed out, is that it can hand a party that does not want a bargain to be struck a veto power. So by refusing to talk about productivity and discuss productivity in the course of bargaining until other issues, such as wage rises, have been dealt with or at all, the employer is effectively adding another roadblock. Obviously, it would be an employer because it is generally unions and workers that are motivated in seeking new enterprise agreements, continuing to build on the conditions and wage rates in existing previous agreements. You are giving a tool to a party who does not want to bargain, to say, 'I'm not going to allow for this box to be ticked,' and it will take away the ability of the commission to approve the agreement. Of course, the real consequence of taking away the commission's ability to approve an agreement is that conditions do not change, pay does not go up and the productivity discussion in and of itself has been used as a tool to prevent those things from happening. It is a fetter on the commission's ability to approve the agreement and that fetter, again, interferes with the rights of the parties to conduct the negotiations as they see fit. Why should they not be able to conduct the negotiations as they see fit?


Another issue with the bill in terms of collective bargaining and the right to strike is the change to the protected action ballot provisions. A protected action ballot is important to the right to strike in this country. We have had protected industrial action in this country since the early 1990s. One thing that happened under Work Choices was the introduction of protected action ballots. Protected action ballots were possible prior to Work Choices, but they became mandated under Work Choices. The provisions said that if you want to exercise your right to strike in this country, with the immunity that you get for protected action—immunity from being sued or fined—then you have to first have a ballot. But you cannot just have the ballot; you have to go to the commission and ask them to give you an order allowing you to have the ballot. That is what a protection action ballot is. I know, having appeared in applications for protection action ballots myself, that it is a process that can be derailed by a party who does not want to bargain or does not want another party to be able to take protected industrial action. And which employer does want their workers to take protected action? Very few of them, I wager.


But, having said that, I think the fact that, as a lawyer, I appeared in protected action ballots demonstrates that they already attract legal involvement and that is a cost to bargaining, a cost to the parties, and a cost to the employer and the workers.


If this bill goes through—and we will see what the Senate says about it; perhaps there is merit to it—on my first reading of it, it seems to me that this will be another opportunity for parties to lawyer up, go down to the commission and pick fights about the nature of the claims and their effect in the event that they are granted. It is a bit nonsensical, of course, because a claim is only a claim. Unless it is actually granted or agreed to, it can have no effect on productivity. But the broader point is that you can readily envisage lengthy affidavit material, trawling through any of the claims that have been made in the course of negotiations for the collective agreement, picking fights over each of them and having lengthy legal proceedings not so that people can take the protected action itself but so they can actually get the ballot and then decide whether as a collective to take the protected action.


In terms of the access to justice issues and the ability for parties to progress through bargaining, it is an opportunity for lawyers to make some money. But it is not an opportunity that will be given to people to continue to move through the bargaining process in an orderly way and in a way that is free from unnecessary red tape.


We hear a lot about unnecessary red tape from the coalition, but making it more difficult to bargain at the workplace, taking away people's international obligations surely is, if nothing else, red tape.


As I said earlier, this is a curious bill. Obviously, the government have had many months to bring in this bill. They have brought it in at the end of the year. The other Fair Work Bill has been before the parliament for months. It is a bit clumsy in the way it has been drafted. But, to me, it also seems to be another example of attempts by some to imply that the Fair Work Act is somehow damaging for productivity. As anyone who paid any attention to the speech of Glenn Stevens, Reserve Bank of Australia governor, in Hobart, this year, would have noted , labour productivity is growing at a faster rate under the Fair Work Act than it grew under the Work Choices legislation. The governor gave labour productivity as an example of something that was pleasing and that sectors were working to improve productivity. The governor told us, in the graph that accompanied that speech, that it is growing at around two per cent per annum. So we know that labour productivity is on the increase. My friend and colleague Josh Bornstein has written an article suggesting that attempts to link the Fair Work Act to some sort of productivity crisis is hyperbole and, with respect, I completely agree with him. What he said was:


The productivity crisis campaign (PCC), which started in 2010, involved an all too familiar pattern: a loud and influential chorus of voices spanning big business, right wing print media and conservative politicians repeatedly trumpeting that IR laws were suffocating productivity and required urgent amendment to introduce greater flexibility.


He asked, rhetorically:


Where was the evidence for all of this? I undertook research to try and understand these concerns. No dice.


Where is the evidence that the Fair Work Act requires some sort of silly tweaking to affect labour productivity? Where is that evidence, given that, as I say, labour productivity has been increasing faster since the implementation of the Fair Work Act then it ever did during the Work Choices era?


The Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, made a speech recently to the Australian Business Economists conference in which he talked about what Australia needed to do in order to become a highly productive and great economy. Do you think the Deputy Governor said that the most pressing priority is to tweak the Fair Work Act to change the approval process and to change the protected action ballot provisions? He did not say that, you will be shocked to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker. He said that we needed to invest in human capital. He talked about skills, he talked about knowledge, he talked about our relationship with Asia. He did not say we should fidget with the Fair Work Act. For that reason, I think we should all be very sceptical about this bill.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (11:38):  When I went to bed last night I had a big smile on my face. I had been to the coalition Christmas party, where we thanked all our staff. It was a terrific night. Everyone was in great spirits. The Prime Minister spoke. He thanked our staff for the hard work they do. There was a great feeling of camaraderie there. After the party, I did a little bit of work in my office and then headed home. As is my wont, I got my iPod out. I thought: 'I'll just watch 7.30 because Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, is going to be on it. This will be worth watching.' Leigh Sales said: 'Leader of the Opposition, you've left the government with an enormous budget hole. MYEFO is about to once again show that the income the government receives is going to go down. Spending is not stopping because all the spending cuts promised are being blocked in the Senate. What is your solution?' The Leader of the Opposition said: 'What we need to do is improve productivity. ""Productivity"" is a word the government has stopped using.' I thought: 'Isn't this wonderful news! This is a real change that we are seeing here. The Leader of the Opposition has recognised that we must improve the nation's productivity. This is wonderful news.' So I went to bed with a big smile on my face thinking this is going to be fantastic.


So I came in here today and thought: 'Let's see whether the Leader of the Opposition is going to back his words with some action. We've got a bill here which is all about increasing the nation's productivity. This is going to be great. All of a sudden the opposition is going to say, ""Yes government, we're prepared to help you.""' And then, sadly, I had to sit through 15 minutes of the member for Griffith. And what did she have to offer in terms of our efforts to increase productivity? I am not saying that this is a ground-breaking bill that is going to change the nation's productivity overnight; but it is going to do a bit, it is going help. But what did we get from the opposition? Sadly, we got nothing but negativity—and, not only that, we got the outlandish statement that this is putting additional red tape into the process and that we should be taking red tape out of the workplace relations system. If the member for Griffith truly believes that, then I look forward to seeing what the opposition proposes to do. If she wants to deregulate the workplace, if she wants to take all the red tape out, we on this side are all ears, we are ready to listen to what the opposition has to say. We are extremely keen to take out of the system the red tape that was added in the last six years to the extent that we are sadly now seeing once again youth unemployment and long-term unemployment rise in this country to levels which all of us here collectively should be alarmed at and saying we need to collectively do something about. The member for Griffith said, 'Where is the evidence?' That is the evidence of how the six previous years of Labor government failed. There is the evidence of what their changes in the Fair Work Act did. Have a look at what is happening to youth unemployment and long-term unemployment in this nation. You could not have evidence more stark. Everyone said when the Fair Work laws came in that youth unemployment and long-term unemployment would be the litmus test of those laws. Sadly, they have failed—and that is the evidence.


So what are we trying to do here in terms of changing the productivity debate in the nation? The explanatory memorandum sets it out—and this is not major:


Examples of improvement to productivity may include but are not limited to elimination of restrictive or inefficient work practices; initiatives to provide employees with greater responsibilities or additional skills directly translating to improved outcomes; and improvements to the design, efficiency and effectiveness of workplace procedures and practices.


That is what we are asking for here. Yet those opposite cannot bring themselves to say they understand that, given the current circumstances the nation finds itself in, we need to do something to lift labour productivity. If we are to address the current budgetary circumstances, improving and increasing labour productivity has to be a key aspect of it.


And that is what this bill seeks to do. It is part of a suite of bills that honour the commitments that we took to the last election. There has been much outrage from those opposite when, on occasion, we have had to readjust some of our policies because of the budgetary circumstances we find ourselves in. We have been accused of all sorts of things, including breaking election promises. Yet here we are, with three workplace relations bills that implement the policies we took to the last election, and when we try to implement them, what do those opposite do? They say to us, 'Sorry, no; you cannot implement the commitment you took to the last election.' The hypocrisy knows no bounds.


So, what is this bill, in greater detail, seeking to do? The Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 implements the final tranche of the government's amendments to the Fair Work Act that were clearly outlined in the coalition's election policy to improve the Fair Work laws. The bill makes three important improvements to the processes of bargaining whilst retaining important employee protections and employee rights. The improvements are: putting productivity back on the agenda, as I have outlined, by requiring parties to at least discuss improvements to productivity during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement, and ensuring that unions and employees do not use industrial action as a tool of first resort by ensuring that they have at least first attempted to engage in a meaningful discussion with the employer before resorting to industrial action. To ensure that the claims in support of which industrial action is being taken are not unrealistic or implausible, industrial action is an important employee right. It is a right that must be exercised responsibly rather than capriciously.


This is not radical legislation. This is legislation that implements policy that we took to the Australian people, and the Australian people gave us a tick to say yes, we approve of your policy agenda—then opposition, now government—and we vote you into office and would like to see it implemented. We must ask the question of why, sadly, those opposite will not allow us to implement our workplace relations agenda. And we need to take a step back, because we also need to look at why the changes to the Fair Work Act were put through by those opposite. They did it because they operate at the behest of the union movement, and they cannot objectively stand back and say: 'Okay, yes: unions, you are an interest group, and we understand what you are arguing for, but, as a government, we have to correctly listen to what you have to say, but we also have to take into account what employers are saying. And we also need to take account of those employees outside of the union movement, because, as we know, union movement membership is declining.'


If you are implementing legislation by listening to only one part of the debate, you get a skewed debate. And, as I highlighted earlier, that has consequences. And the sad thing at the moment is that the consequences are hitting our young and they are hitting the long-term unemployed. I ask the House collectively again to look at the statistics in those two key areas, because that is where the impact is being felt of the stubbornness of those opposite to not allow the government to implement the policies it took to the last election. And I would ask those opposite: what is wrong with us trying to put a productivity component into bargaining? What can be wrong with that? These are not unreasonable requests. Why won't you allow us to do it? Why won't you support this? This is asking that productivity be a component of bargaining.


Say you went out into the community and said, 'Well, we're actually opposing this.' And the explanatory memorandum sets out what they are opposing: 'elimination of restrictive or inefficient work practices; initiatives to provide employees with greater responsibilities or additional skills directly translating to improved outcomes; and improvements to the design, efficiency and effectiveness of workplace procedures and practices'. They are opposing that, at a time when we have to do everything we can—as the Leader of the Opposition said on 7.30 last night—to enhance the productivity of the nation. That is what he said last night. And I had a big smile on my face and thought, 'We're going to see a change from those opposite; we're going to see those opposite actually looking to do what is in the best interest of the nation rather than continuing to play political games.' Yet what do we have today? Back in the cold, hard reality of the chamber, the political games continue.


This government is about laying the foundations of long-term, sustainable growth for this nation. We know we have to do this to fix the budget. We know we have to do this to make sure that young Australians in particular have a future where they will have real incomes that are greater than ours. We want to set the next generation up so that they will have an improved standard of living compared with the one we enjoy here. But we need to wake up, because what is happening at the moment in this place is that every measure we take to try to do that is being opposed. And who will suffer the consequences? It will be our children and our grandchildren. And I would hope over Christmas that we can have a long hard think about that—about not what is in our short-term political interest but what is in the interests of the nation.


Christmas time is a time to reflect, and I say to my wonderful communities in Wannon: have a very merry Christmas. Enjoy the festive break and take some time to contemplate. And I say to those opposite: please do the same. Please reflect on where we are at, as a nation, at the moment. Because, if you will not willingly participate in us taking the action that we need to get the nation back on track, to make sure that we can provide the standard of living that we enjoy for our children and grandchildren, we as a nation are going to be all the poorer for it. So I ask you and beg you to think about that over Christmas.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (11:53):  At the beginning of my remarks I just want to reflect on a couple of things that the previous speaker mentioned. At the beginning of his remarks, the member for Wannon called on the member for Griffith to smile. Last night there were lots of parties around the place. There were lots of festivities.


A group of people who were not smiling when they came in to work today were our hardworking cleaners. With all the parties that come about come lots of bottles and lots of mess, but yet these cleaners do not get extra time to clean up our mess. They do not get extra time to make sure that this place is ready for work. They had to get on and work harder than they ever had before to make sure that this place was clean and ready for business today, cleaning up the mess left behind by people in this chamber and in this House today. Their productivity rates today were through the roof. They had to work overtime, really hard, to make sure this place was clean and ready.


This bill actually has nothing to do with productivity. It may say the word 'productivity', but it actually will not increase productivity in the workplace. This bill uses the word 'productivity' to actually attack workers, attack unions and attack their ability to bargain for a decent wage.


Our cleaners, as I mentioned, this morning worked really hard. They also today met to endorse their log of claims. The story of our cleaners here in Parliament House is a frustrating one, not just for themselves but for all the cleaners that we have in the country, particularly those working in government buildings. They have had a pay freeze. They have not had a wage increase for some time. Our cleaners here endorsed their log of claims asking their cleaning company, who is contracted by this government, for an extra 85c an hour. That would basically help them keep up with the cost of living. They are on minimum wage and they are hoping for, in their process of bargaining, an extra 85c an hour to help meet the cost of living.


Yet this bill says that they need to talk about productivity first, as part of the bargaining process. I hope their employer in the government is ready to talk about productivity and talk about increasing their time when it comes to the end of session to make it a fairer productivity. The cleaners here already work superhard, and I do not think anybody in this building would deny that they work superhard. Yet the requirements in this bill say that the employer has the ability to say, 'Before we even talk about you getting a decent pay rise because your pay has been frozen, we need to talk about productivity.'


The cleaners here have a very good story to talk about when it comes to productivity. There are working harder than any other person in this building to make sure this building is ready. I dare any member of parliament to stand up and say that they are not productive workers and that they are not meeting a high standard of productivity. The reason why the cleaners have to now bargain for a fair pay rise is because this government has scrapped the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines—another attack by this government on some of the lowest-paid workers in this building.


This bill, as I have said, is not about productivity. This bill is poorly constructed and bad policy. Its wording, I believe, is actually quite tricky. It actually seeks to undermine the genuine good faith bargaining process. A few words, a few changes and a few phrases swing the entire process of collective bargaining in the employers' favour. I am probably being a bit stronger on this than some of my other colleagues, but I just wanted to demonstrate a couple of examples of how this bill will swing in favour of militant employers as opposed to the militant unions the government likes to bash and beat the drum about.


Within this debate the government does not recognise that not every employer genuinely wants to bargain in good faith. There is a risk that this bill will give veto power to employers. A new requirement, which states that the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that improvements in productivity were discussed during the bargaining phase of the agreement, has now been inserted into this bill. What do you do if you are that low-paid cleaner, if you are already working superhard and you have backbreaking workloads? How do you become more productive if you are already working excessive workloads?


This bill gets away from the core principle of collective bargaining, where employers and employees sit down and genuinely engage in good faith bargaining. Introducing all of these new requirements that must be satisfied before the commission can approve an agreement puts more and more restriction on what can be bargained. It is not inconceivable to think of a situation where an employer says: 'I don't want to talk about productivity until we've discussed cutting wages, holidays and other conditions. I don't want to even talk about what we need to do to satisfy a silly rule that's been put in for the Fair Work Commissioner until we talk about cutting wages, holidays and other conditions.' There is example after example of where employers have done that. You just have to look at Victoria and what the former Liberal government did to the hard-working ambos. They refused to sit down and genuinely bargain in good faith around a log of claims before those hard-working ambos agreed to a number of conditions that the government had put on the table.


Does it mean that agreement can never be completed if a union refuses to budge on some matters? These changes will create constant deadlocks. What we need in our fair work system is not a system that creates deadlocks between bargaining groups. We need a system that allows groups to navigate their way through to an agreement. This amendment is another example of how this government, through this bill, seeks to deny workers the opportunity to genuinely bargain in good faith. It gives employers greater bargaining rights.


One of the areas which I think demonstrates this is their changes to protective action. The government have introduced a new provision which means that the Fair Work Commission must not make a protected action ballot if it is satisfied the applicant's claims are manifestly excessive, having regard to the conditions at the workplace and the industry in which the employer operates, or would significantly adversely impact the productivity of workplaces. That pretty much knocks out any form of industrial action. So when the members of the government stand up and say, 'We acknowledge that it is the right of a group of workers to take industrial action,' it is just total lip-service. The whole point of an employee being able to take industrial action is to remove their labour. So that is going to have an impact on the productivity of workplaces. This one particular change to the Fair Work Commission basically knocks out any employee's ability to take industrial action. They are using the word 'productivity' to disguise the fact that they are trying to knock out people's ability to be able to take industrial action, which has been a longstanding tradition in this country.


I have just a couple of examples when it comes to the militant employers that I have talked about. The government seeks to amend section 44(3) in the way in which the government proposes different and higher standards on unions wanting to take protected industrial action over those of employers. Let's talk about employer lockouts. The government likes to talk about militant unions, but what it is not talking about is employer lockouts.


An example is Schweppes. A few years ago around Christmas, multinational owned giant Schweppes locked out 150 workers at the Tullamarine factory. They were locked out after wanting to take protected industrial action to protect the rosters that they had. The employer locked them out because they were trying to impose on the workers a roster which would have seen them move from an eight-hour-a-day shift to a 12-hour-a-day shift, thus completely changing their workplace situation and removing something that we have held up in this country for such a long time: the eight-hour day. The employer locked them out, and these workers were without pay over the Christmas period. I will never forget that Christmas Day, being there with those workers locked out, out the front of their workplace. It was a very hot Christmas that Christmas, and they were there. They were there not because they wanted to see a massive increase in their pay. They were there because their employer wanted to radically change their roster, thus not only reducing their pay but significantly changing their workplace-life balance.


This bill is only going to aid the employers that do not want to genuinely bargain, that are actually going after fundamental basics and principles that Australians expect to have in their workplace. Another example in relation to this area has to be our cleaners and our shopping centre cleaners who, in bargaining at the Melbourne airport, also took industrial action. Pay talks broke down, again around Christmas, when 100 cleaners said that they would not accept a deal which was $4,000 a year less than other cleaners working at the airport. Again, our cleaners at the airports are low paid workers, and what the boss had put on the table through bargaining would have taken away several allowances and meal breaks which would have seen them paid $4,000 a year less. Now, if these particular amendments were already in place, the cleaners' ability to stand up and say, 'That's not fair. We won't accept that deal,' could have been knocked out by the commission because of the impact on productivity in the workplace. Yes, if a cleaner stops work, it impacts on the productivity of a workplace. It absolutely does because it means the toilets do not get cleaned. That is what it means.


This bill is not, as the government has said, about ensuring that workers continue to have that right to take industrial action. This bill is not, as this government says, about productivity. This bill is entirely about weakening workers' ability to collectively and genuinely bargain. This bill is about enhancing the employers who do not want to do the right thing and about giving them greater powers. There are examples that we have going on currently and in the last five to 10 years where companies have used bargaining to lock out workers, where companies have used bargaining to radically cut wages and conditions. Yet there is no attempt in this bill to see a levelling up of that playing field. This bill goes after workers and puts the veto opportunity in the employers' hands. This bill seeks to undermine the entire principle of collective bargaining, and it should be opposed.


What disappoints me the most about this bill is that the government have just not been honest. They are hiding behind the words of productivity. They are hiding behind the words of good-faith bargaining. But it could not be further from the truth. It denies Australian workers the right to collectively bargain in good faith with the employers. Collective bargaining has been a key feature of a fair and modern democratic society. Worse still, it creates deadlock in Fair Work Australia. There are going to be disputes where the employer or the employees may go too far. There are going to be disputes which need to be resolved by an independent umpire—Fair Work Australia. Yet all this bill does is make their job harder. It will create more deadlocks, more lockouts and more noisy actions, because it does not create an environment for genuine good-faith bargaining. 


In conclusion, I hope that our cleaners here at Parliament House do not ever have to file for a protected industrial action ballot. I hope, when their employer reaches an agreement with a fair pay rise and goes to the government and say this is what we need increased in our contract price to pay your cleaners a fair deal, that the government listens and does the right thing by the hard-working cleaners, because under this bill they may not have the ability to take industrial action to get a fair outcome. I ask the House to oppose the bill. 


Debate adjourned.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (11:09):  The big idea behind the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 is that productivity should drive wage negotiations and wage outcomes, and that this will balance real wage increases against ensuring low levels of unemployment. The bill will amend the Fair Work Act to ensure that, when approving an enterprise agreement, the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that productivity improvements at the workplace were discussed during bargaining for the agreement. All of the existing enterprise agreement approval requirements under the Fair Work Act will be retained. 


The bill also amends the Fair Work Act to provide further guidance and greater transparency regarding the circumstances in which protected action ballot orders can be made. It ensures that the Fair Work Commission must not make a protected ballot order where it is satisfied that the claims of an applicant for a protected action ballot are manifestly excessive or, importantly, would have significantly adverse impacts on productivity at the workplace. The idea that productivity should be at the heart of wage negotiations and wage outcomes is not a new one. We saw it, perhaps, at its best during the period of the prices and incomes accords. This idea was a bedrock of the accords driven by the Labor government in the 1980s, which were a considerable contributor to helping Australia out of its economic malaise at the time.


Let us have a little bit of a look at the importance of productivity, or doing things smarter—which is what we really mean when we are talking about productivity in the workplace. In the medium term and in the long term and to some extent even in the short term we know that productivity is absolutely central to our standard of living improving.


Paul Krugman, the well-known Nobel laureate economist—who is, I should say, very much not on our side of politics—has said:


Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.


The point here is that we want to raise wages. We on this side of the House want to raise wages. We do not want to reduce them. But we know, as Krugman points out, that if we want wages to go up we have to raise labour productivity. We know from years and years of economic research that, if wages go up faster than productivity, unemployment rises. This is a very basic result in economics. But let us go beyond the theory. Let us have a look at what some of the researchers have said.


I will look at a paper written by none other than the member for Fraser and published in the Australian Economic Review in 2003. At the time he was at the Kennedy school of government at Harvard University—a great institution. He did a very interesting piece of work where he looked at six increases in wages in Western Australia between 1994 and 2001 to look at the impact of wages going up faster than productivity—minimum wages were the focus—on employment. On six occasions between 1994 and 2001 the minimum wage in WA was increased by between 3½ per cent and over nine per cent. After each of these increases the employment to population ratio—the employment rate—in WA fell relative to the rest of Australia. He then shows—he does the econometrics on this—that a one per cent increase in the minimum wage reduces employment by about 0.13. In fact, in a later correction to the paper, he said that that number was too low—in fact it should have been higher.


The really interesting part of this is that the employment impact is most substantial amongst younger employees, where the fall in employment is almost three times higher. If you raise wages faster than productivity, then you raise unemployment for younger people at three times the pace of the rest of the economy. The member for Fraser is a good economist and many other economists have confirmed that result. For the most part their results have been even stronger than his, but directionally they have confirmed exactly what he found—so we know that if you raise wages faster than productivity you drive up unemployment.


It is very important to note that productivity comes from far more than just squeezing employees. We know that productivity comes from working smarter, above all. That is innovation—working smarter; finding cleverer ways of doing the same things. Australian businesses, when encouraged to do so, have been extraordinarily good at doing exactly this. We also know that productivity comes from investment—building the capital stock—in public infrastructure: in roads, rail and telecommunications, and from private sector investment, which we saw starting to fall away dramatically in the latter period of the Labor government.


Australia has been at its very best when it has been delivering rising wages aligned with strong productivity. In our great economic history since European settlement we have consistently avoided oversupply of unskilled workers, and we should continue to do so. In doing so, we have been able to achieve rising real wages aligned with rising productivity. Central to that have been very high levels of capital investment putting upward pressure on wages, and we should celebrate that—that has been absolutely central to the economic miracle of 200 years that we have seen in this country.


I spoke about unemployment, and, of course, at the heart of any wage negotiation is this issue of unemployment. But nowhere has this become worse, particularly in the Labor years, than in the case of youth unemployment. There is no question that youth unemployment was a disaster during the period from 2007 to 2013.


Given the money that the Labor Party claims to have spent on jobs and skill creation and skill development, and the number of programs they claim to have put into place, we might have expected that the track record would in fact be superb. But let us have a look at the facts. Between the time they got into government in 2007 and the time they left in 2013, there was a significant increase in youth unemployment. Note here that, in the four years leading up to the new Labor government in 2007, we saw a 13 per cent growth under the Howard government in youth employment. But between 2008 and 2013, we saw an eight per cent reduction in youth employment. So we went from a 13 per cent increase in employment to an eight per cent reduction in youth employment across the economy.


At the same time, we can look at youth participation rates. They were running merrily along between 2004 and 2008, rising from 70 per cent participation up to 71 per cent—nice work by the Howard government. But, from early 2008 through to 2013, there was a reduction in participation for younger Australians from 71 per cent to 66 per cent—a disastrous drop; a five per cent reduction across the time of the Labor government.


They might say, 'That is all right; we were putting them all into training.' But we also find that the youth unemployment rate went from nine per cent in January 2008 to 12.4 per cent by the end of 2013. What a shameful record of youth employment and youth unemployment we saw from the last Labor government. We know there are terrible hot spots in western and north-western Tasmania. It got to 21 per cent unemployment under the Labor-Greens alliance, destroying jobs in Tasmania; in Cairns it was almost 21 per cent again; in North Adelaide it was around 20 per cent; and in south-eastern Tasmania it was 19.6 per cent—a social and economic disaster.


So the question is: what are we doing to address this? And alongside what is being proposed in this bill, we are working hard to strengthen the economy—and we know that a strong economy equals strong jobs growth. We are negotiating free trade agreements. We are investing record dollars in public infrastructure. We are removing excess taxation. We are reforming training and education—reforming our vocational education and training system. And we are establishing world-class employment services.


But this is not all. This legislation asks the Fair Work Commission to consider whether productivity was part of the negotiations in coming to an enterprise agreement. But we need the Fair Work Commission to come to terms with the scale of this problem and begin to address it. Indeed, the old industrial relations club used to understand the role of productivity, as I said earlier. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke understood that real wage hikes in the face of sluggish productivity are a disaster.


So what has the Fair Work Commission been doing? The short answer is that it has been making the situation worse, and is prioritising large wage hikes above jobs for young Australians, by not paying attention to productivity. This has been absolutely at its worst for the young in our population.


As I said, we all want rising wages; this is a bedrock of Australia's economic success. But you achieve rising wages by working smarter, investing more, building more infrastructure and improving our education system. You cannot simply raise wages in the absence of productivity gains.


I want to focus on two particular decisions made by the Fair Work Commission. The first was the modern awards review focused on apprentices, trainees and juniors of August 2013. A full bench of the Fair Work Commission handed down its decision on apprentice provisions in the two-year review of modern awards. It granted wage increases for first- and second-year apprentices, phased over a 12-month period. They effectively hiked the four-year wage structure for a junior apprentice who has completed year 12 from, in the first year, 42 per cent of full salary to 55 per cent, and, in the second year, from 55 per cent to 65 per cent. Effectively, what they were doing was significantly, sharply, increasing wages for first- and second-year apprentices, and, importantly, dissuading employers from wanting to take those apprentices on. The Fair Work Commission also decided that adult apprentices should receive 80 per cent of the fully qualified tradesperson's rate, which is a 10 per cent increase over what it previously was, and they passed on many costs of apprenticeships to employers, including such things as textbooks and travel costs.


This is an extraordinary conclusion, and it flies in the face of ensuring that wages track productivity. There is no question that this will be contributing to the unemployment of young people in Australia.


In a second decision, in March this year, a full bench of the Fair Work Commission granted an application by the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association to increase the rate of pay for 20-year-old retail employees from 90 per cent to 100 per cent of the adult rate—a 10 per cent wage increase. There is no argument to say that we have seen 10 per cent productivity gains during this time. So the impact of this decision, based on research we have seen from people such as the member for Fraser, must be to raise unemployment amongst young people.


This irresponsible bias, to ignore the basic economics of employment relationships, is a serious problem for young people, for employers and for Australia. The most disenfranchised in our population are the unemployed, and to increase the number of people who are out of employment through these sorts of decisions is a travesty.


It is time for the Fair Work Commission to recognise this, and to show some concern and compassion about the extraordinary increase in youth unemployment bestowed on us by the previous Labor government. Yes, we need to ensure that there is a strong economy with lots of job creation, strong support for job seekers and extensive support for training and education, but we are doing all of that. Now it is time for the Fair Work Commission to get real and confront youth unemployment.


This bill provides an opportunity to do exactly that by increasing the focus of the fair work legislation on productivity. I commend this bill to the House.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (11:23):  It is clear from the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 that the government has learnt nothing from the Work Choices debacle of the mid-2000s. Given this bill's very poor construction and the ambiguity within the bill, it seems that the bill really does appear to be nothing more than an attempt to undermine the right to bargain collectively, freely and autonomously and to undermine the right to strike.


Having said that, perhaps people more generous than I would want to give the government the benefit of the doubt on the bill, and for that reason I will be looking very carefully at the outcomes of the Senate inquiry into the bill to see whether or not there is some merit to the changes that are being proposed. But, given the circumstances of the bill being introduced, the timing, and the way the bill has been put together, it does really seem to be much more about perception that substance. It is another attempt to imply that the fair work legislation is somehow the cause of difficulties for labour productivity in this country, which is an issue to which I will return.


But before I do, I want to generally talk about the reasons why I said that the bill was an attempt to undermine the right to bargain collectively, freely and autonomously and an attempt to undermine the right to strike. Those issues go to the heart of one of the very clear differences between Liberal Party and the Labor Party. In the Labor Party, consistently with international law, we believe that there is a right to collectively bargain and that collective bargaining is to be preferred to individual bargaining in the workplace. To the contrary, the Liberal Party has always preferred individual bargaining, and we saw that under Work Choices.


In Work Choices, the Australian workplace agreements were statutory individual contracts that were able to, and did, undermine minimum working standards and conditions in this country. By way of example: 63 per cent of Australian workplace agreements made under Work Choices removed penalty rates, another pet hate of the coalition.


I am sure that members opposite do not necessarily want to be outed as still supporting individual contracts, but if you want evidence of that just have a look at the other fair work bill that is presently before this parliament, and has been for most of the year. The other fair work bill of course seeks to privilege and support their use of individual contracts by changing the individual flexibility agreement regime.


It is unfortunate and regrettable, but the Liberals seem to have learnt very little from their experience with Work Choices and are still pushing the bandwagon for statutory individual contracts, which of course are deeply problematic, and we saw that under Work Choices. We saw the conditions that were stripped away using AWAs at the time. But, on this side of the House, we understand and support collective bargaining. It is also, as a matter of international law, something that should be supported. You might recall that the ILO strongly criticised the Australian workplace relations laws known as Work Choices because of the way that they privileged individual negotiations ahead of collective bargaining.


To explain what I mean when I talk about our international obligations in respect of collective bargaining, I just want to mention a very helpful article, ' Protected industrial action and voluntary collective bargaining under the Fair Work Act 2009'by Shae McCrystal from the Faculty of Law, University of Sydney. To recite the discussion about our international obligations, Shae says: 


Australia is bound in international law to respect the right to strike under Article 8(1)(d) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as a component of the principles of freedom of association protected by the Constitution of the ILO … and as a component of the obligation to respect the right of workers to organise to protect their economic and social interests in Article 3 of the ILO’s Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention … obligation is not limited to protection of the right to strike for the purposes of collective bargaining, but extends to recognition of the right to strike for workers to protect and further their ‘economic and social interests’ … Further, Article 4 of the ILO’s Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 … requires ratifying States to encourage and promote the full development of voluntary collective bargaining between employers, their associations and workers’ associations. The essential element of this obligation is the promotion of collective bargaining which is of a voluntary nature. This has been found to imply recognition of the autonomy of the bargaining parties.


That is a very good and convenient summary of the international obligations that we have.


In contrast to the international obligations that we have, this is a bill that places fetters on bargaining parties' autonomy and rights to conduct negotiations freely. Again, it harks back to Work Choices—continually trying to regulate what parties have to do when they are bargaining in the workplace. If you want to talk about over-regulation and red tape, think about the prohibited content provisions of the Work Choices legislation at the time. There was a lengthy list of things that parties were not at liberty to include in their enterprise agreements—a lengthy list of restrictions and limitations on parties' autonomy and right to collectively bargain freely. And what are we now seeing with this bill? We are seeing a new obligation, a new box to be ticked when an application is made to the Fair Work Commission to approve an agreement.


Of course parties talk about productivity in their bargaining. But this legislation is not about encouraging productivity measures; it is about finding another piece of red tape for parties to have to go through when they go to the commission and ask for approval of their workplace agreement.


One difficulty with adding in another consideration for the commission to take into account in the bargaining approval process, as my colleague the shadow minister pointed out, is that it can hand a party that does not want a bargain to be struck a veto power. So by refusing to talk about productivity and discuss productivity in the course of bargaining until other issues, such as wage rises, have been dealt with or at all, the employer is effectively adding another roadblock. Obviously, it would be an employer because it is generally unions and workers that are motivated in seeking new enterprise agreements, continuing to build on the conditions and wage rates in existing previous agreements. You are giving a tool to a party who does not want to bargain, to say, 'I'm not going to allow for this box to be ticked,' and it will take away the ability of the commission to approve the agreement. Of course, the real consequence of taking away the commission's ability to approve an agreement is that conditions do not change, pay does not go up and the productivity discussion in and of itself has been used as a tool to prevent those things from happening. It is a fetter on the commission's ability to approve the agreement and that fetter, again, interferes with the rights of the parties to conduct the negotiations as they see fit. Why should they not be able to conduct the negotiations as they see fit?


Another issue with the bill in terms of collective bargaining and the right to strike is the change to the protected action ballot provisions. A protected action ballot is important to the right to strike in this country. We have had protected industrial action in this country since the early 1990s. One thing that happened under Work Choices was the introduction of protected action ballots. Protected action ballots were possible prior to Work Choices, but they became mandated under Work Choices. The provisions said that if you want to exercise your right to strike in this country, with the immunity that you get for protected action—immunity from being sued or fined—then you have to first have a ballot. But you cannot just have the ballot; you have to go to the commission and ask them to give you an order allowing you to have the ballot. That is what a protection action ballot is. I know, having appeared in applications for protection action ballots myself, that it is a process that can be derailed by a party who does not want to bargain or does not want another party to be able to take protected industrial action. And which employer does want their workers to take protected action? Very few of them, I wager.


But, having said that, I think the fact that, as a lawyer, I appeared in protected action ballots demonstrates that they already attract legal involvement and that is a cost to bargaining, a cost to the parties, and a cost to the employer and the workers.


If this bill goes through—and we will see what the Senate says about it; perhaps there is merit to it—on my first reading of it, it seems to me that this will be another opportunity for parties to lawyer up, go down to the commission and pick fights about the nature of the claims and their effect in the event that they are granted. It is a bit nonsensical, of course, because a claim is only a claim. Unless it is actually granted or agreed to, it can have no effect on productivity. But the broader point is that you can readily envisage lengthy affidavit material, trawling through any of the claims that have been made in the course of negotiations for the collective agreement, picking fights over each of them and having lengthy legal proceedings not so that people can take the protected action itself but so they can actually get the ballot and then decide whether as a collective to take the protected action.


In terms of the access to justice issues and the ability for parties to progress through bargaining, it is an opportunity for lawyers to make some money. But it is not an opportunity that will be given to people to continue to move through the bargaining process in an orderly way and in a way that is free from unnecessary red tape.


We hear a lot about unnecessary red tape from the coalition, but making it more difficult to bargain at the workplace, taking away people's international obligations surely is, if nothing else, red tape.


As I said earlier, this is a curious bill. Obviously, the government have had many months to bring in this bill. They have brought it in at the end of the year. The other Fair Work Bill has been before the parliament for months. It is a bit clumsy in the way it has been drafted. But, to me, it also seems to be another example of attempts by some to imply that the Fair Work Act is somehow damaging for productivity. As anyone who paid any attention to the speech of Glenn Stevens, Reserve Bank of Australia governor, in Hobart, this year, would have noted , labour productivity is growing at a faster rate under the Fair Work Act than it grew under the Work Choices legislation. The governor gave labour productivity as an example of something that was pleasing and that sectors were working to improve productivity. The governor told us, in the graph that accompanied that speech, that it is growing at around two per cent per annum. So we know that labour productivity is on the increase. My friend and colleague Josh Bornstein has written an article suggesting that attempts to link the Fair Work Act to some sort of productivity crisis is hyperbole and, with respect, I completely agree with him. What he said was:


The productivity crisis campaign (PCC), which started in 2010, involved an all too familiar pattern: a loud and influential chorus of voices spanning big business, right wing print media and conservative politicians repeatedly trumpeting that IR laws were suffocating productivity and required urgent amendment to introduce greater flexibility.


He asked, rhetorically:


Where was the evidence for all of this? I undertook research to try and understand these concerns. No dice.


Where is the evidence that the Fair Work Act requires some sort of silly tweaking to affect labour productivity? Where is that evidence, given that, as I say, labour productivity has been increasing faster since the implementation of the Fair Work Act then it ever did during the Work Choices era?


The Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, made a speech recently to the Australian Business Economists conference in which he talked about what Australia needed to do in order to become a highly productive and great economy. Do you think the Deputy Governor said that the most pressing priority is to tweak the Fair Work Act to change the approval process and to change the protected action ballot provisions? He did not say that, you will be shocked to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker. He said that we needed to invest in human capital. He talked about skills, he talked about knowledge, he talked about our relationship with Asia. He did not say we should fidget with the Fair Work Act. For that reason, I think we should all be very sceptical about this bill.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (11:38):  When I went to bed last night I had a big smile on my face. I had been to the coalition Christmas party, where we thanked all our staff. It was a terrific night. Everyone was in great spirits. The Prime Minister spoke. He thanked our staff for the hard work they do. There was a great feeling of camaraderie there. After the party, I did a little bit of work in my office and then headed home. As is my wont, I got my iPod out. I thought: 'I'll just watch 7.30 because Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, is going to be on it. This will be worth watching.' Leigh Sales said: 'Leader of the Opposition, you've left the government with an enormous budget hole. MYEFO is about to once again show that the income the government receives is going to go down. Spending is not stopping because all the spending cuts promised are being blocked in the Senate. What is your solution?' The Leader of the Opposition said: 'What we need to do is improve productivity. ""Productivity"" is a word the government has stopped using.' I thought: 'Isn't this wonderful news! This is a real change that we are seeing here. The Leader of the Opposition has recognised that we must improve the nation's productivity. This is wonderful news.' So I went to bed with a big smile on my face thinking this is going to be fantastic.


So I came in here today and thought: 'Let's see whether the Leader of the Opposition is going to back his words with some action. We've got a bill here which is all about increasing the nation's productivity. This is going to be great. All of a sudden the opposition is going to say, ""Yes government, we're prepared to help you.""' And then, sadly, I had to sit through 15 minutes of the member for Griffith. And what did she have to offer in terms of our efforts to increase productivity? I am not saying that this is a ground-breaking bill that is going to change the nation's productivity overnight; but it is going to do a bit, it is going help. But what did we get from the opposition? Sadly, we got nothing but negativity—and, not only that, we got the outlandish statement that this is putting additional red tape into the process and that we should be taking red tape out of the workplace relations system. If the member for Griffith truly believes that, then I look forward to seeing what the opposition proposes to do. If she wants to deregulate the workplace, if she wants to take all the red tape out, we on this side are all ears, we are ready to listen to what the opposition has to say. We are extremely keen to take out of the system the red tape that was added in the last six years to the extent that we are sadly now seeing once again youth unemployment and long-term unemployment rise in this country to levels which all of us here collectively should be alarmed at and saying we need to collectively do something about. The member for Griffith said, 'Where is the evidence?' That is the evidence of how the six previous years of Labor government failed. There is the evidence of what their changes in the Fair Work Act did. Have a look at what is happening to youth unemployment and long-term unemployment in this nation. You could not have evidence more stark. Everyone said when the Fair Work laws came in that youth unemployment and long-term unemployment would be the litmus test of those laws. Sadly, they have failed—and that is the evidence.


So what are we trying to do here in terms of changing the productivity debate in the nation? The explanatory memorandum sets it out—and this is not major:


Examples of improvement to productivity may include but are not limited to elimination of restrictive or inefficient work practices; initiatives to provide employees with greater responsibilities or additional skills directly translating to improved outcomes; and improvements to the design, efficiency and effectiveness of workplace procedures and practices.


That is what we are asking for here. Yet those opposite cannot bring themselves to say they understand that, given the current circumstances the nation finds itself in, we need to do something to lift labour productivity. If we are to address the current budgetary circumstances, improving and increasing labour productivity has to be a key aspect of it.


And that is what this bill seeks to do. It is part of a suite of bills that honour the commitments that we took to the last election. There has been much outrage from those opposite when, on occasion, we have had to readjust some of our policies because of the budgetary circumstances we find ourselves in. We have been accused of all sorts of things, including breaking election promises. Yet here we are, with three workplace relations bills that implement the policies we took to the last election, and when we try to implement them, what do those opposite do? They say to us, 'Sorry, no; you cannot implement the commitment you took to the last election.' The hypocrisy knows no bounds.


So, what is this bill, in greater detail, seeking to do? The Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 implements the final tranche of the government's amendments to the Fair Work Act that were clearly outlined in the coalition's election policy to improve the Fair Work laws. The bill makes three important improvements to the processes of bargaining whilst retaining important employee protections and employee rights. The improvements are: putting productivity back on the agenda, as I have outlined, by requiring parties to at least discuss improvements to productivity during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement, and ensuring that unions and employees do not use industrial action as a tool of first resort by ensuring that they have at least first attempted to engage in a meaningful discussion with the employer before resorting to industrial action. To ensure that the claims in support of which industrial action is being taken are not unrealistic or implausible, industrial action is an important employee right. It is a right that must be exercised responsibly rather than capriciously.


This is not radical legislation. This is legislation that implements policy that we took to the Australian people, and the Australian people gave us a tick to say yes, we approve of your policy agenda—then opposition, now government—and we vote you into office and would like to see it implemented. We must ask the question of why, sadly, those opposite will not allow us to implement our workplace relations agenda. And we need to take a step back, because we also need to look at why the changes to the Fair Work Act were put through by those opposite. They did it because they operate at the behest of the union movement, and they cannot objectively stand back and say: 'Okay, yes: unions, you are an interest group, and we understand what you are arguing for, but, as a government, we have to correctly listen to what you have to say, but we also have to take into account what employers are saying. And we also need to take account of those employees outside of the union movement, because, as we know, union movement membership is declining.'


If you are implementing legislation by listening to only one part of the debate, you get a skewed debate. And, as I highlighted earlier, that has consequences. And the sad thing at the moment is that the consequences are hitting our young and they are hitting the long-term unemployed. I ask the House collectively again to look at the statistics in those two key areas, because that is where the impact is being felt of the stubbornness of those opposite to not allow the government to implement the policies it took to the last election. And I would ask those opposite: what is wrong with us trying to put a productivity component into bargaining? What can be wrong with that? These are not unreasonable requests. Why won't you allow us to do it? Why won't you support this? This is asking that productivity be a component of bargaining.


Say you went out into the community and said, 'Well, we're actually opposing this.' And the explanatory memorandum sets out what they are opposing: 'elimination of restrictive or inefficient work practices; initiatives to provide employees with greater responsibilities or additional skills directly translating to improved outcomes; and improvements to the design, efficiency and effectiveness of workplace procedures and practices'. They are opposing that, at a time when we have to do everything we can—as the Leader of the Opposition said on 7.30 last night—to enhance the productivity of the nation. That is what he said last night. And I had a big smile on my face and thought, 'We're going to see a change from those opposite; we're going to see those opposite actually looking to do what is in the best interest of the nation rather than continuing to play political games.' Yet what do we have today? Back in the cold, hard reality of the chamber, the political games continue.


This government is about laying the foundations of long-term, sustainable growth for this nation. We know we have to do this to fix the budget. We know we have to do this to make sure that young Australians in particular have a future where they will have real incomes that are greater than ours. We want to set the next generation up so that they will have an improved standard of living compared with the one we enjoy here. But we need to wake up, because what is happening at the moment in this place is that every measure we take to try to do that is being opposed. And who will suffer the consequences? It will be our children and our grandchildren. And I would hope over Christmas that we can have a long hard think about that—about not what is in our short-term political interest but what is in the interests of the nation.


Christmas time is a time to reflect, and I say to my wonderful communities in Wannon: have a very merry Christmas. Enjoy the festive break and take some time to contemplate. And I say to those opposite: please do the same. Please reflect on where we are at, as a nation, at the moment. Because, if you will not willingly participate in us taking the action that we need to get the nation back on track, to make sure that we can provide the standard of living that we enjoy for our children and grandchildren, we as a nation are going to be all the poorer for it. So I ask you and beg you to think about that over Christmas.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (11:53):  At the beginning of my remarks I just want to reflect on a couple of things that the previous speaker mentioned. At the beginning of his remarks, the member for Wannon called on the member for Griffith to smile. Last night there were lots of parties around the place. There were lots of festivities.


A group of people who were not smiling when they came in to work today were our hardworking cleaners. With all the parties that come about come lots of bottles and lots of mess, but yet these cleaners do not get extra time to clean up our mess. They do not get extra time to make sure that this place is ready for work. They had to get on and work harder than they ever had before to make sure that this place was clean and ready for business today, cleaning up the mess left behind by people in this chamber and in this House today. Their productivity rates today were through the roof. They had to work overtime, really hard, to make sure this place was clean and ready.


This bill actually has nothing to do with productivity. It may say the word 'productivity', but it actually will not increase productivity in the workplace. This bill uses the word 'productivity' to actually attack workers, attack unions and attack their ability to bargain for a decent wage.


Our cleaners, as I mentioned, this morning worked really hard. They also today met to endorse their log of claims. The story of our cleaners here in Parliament House is a frustrating one, not just for themselves but for all the cleaners that we have in the country, particularly those working in government buildings. They have had a pay freeze. They have not had a wage increase for some time. Our cleaners here endorsed their log of claims asking their cleaning company, who is contracted by this government, for an extra 85c an hour. That would basically help them keep up with the cost of living. They are on minimum wage and they are hoping for, in their process of bargaining, an extra 85c an hour to help meet the cost of living.


Yet this bill says that they need to talk about productivity first, as part of the bargaining process. I hope their employer in the government is ready to talk about productivity and talk about increasing their time when it comes to the end of session to make it a fairer productivity. The cleaners here already work superhard, and I do not think anybody in this building would deny that they work superhard. Yet the requirements in this bill say that the employer has the ability to say, 'Before we even talk about you getting a decent pay rise because your pay has been frozen, we need to talk about productivity.'


The cleaners here have a very good story to talk about when it comes to productivity. There are working harder than any other person in this building to make sure this building is ready. I dare any member of parliament to stand up and say that they are not productive workers and that they are not meeting a high standard of productivity. The reason why the cleaners have to now bargain for a fair pay rise is because this government has scrapped the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines—another attack by this government on some of the lowest-paid workers in this building.


This bill, as I have said, is not about productivity. This bill is poorly constructed and bad policy. Its wording, I believe, is actually quite tricky. It actually seeks to undermine the genuine good faith bargaining process. A few words, a few changes and a few phrases swing the entire process of collective bargaining in the employers' favour. I am probably being a bit stronger on this than some of my other colleagues, but I just wanted to demonstrate a couple of examples of how this bill will swing in favour of militant employers as opposed to the militant unions the government likes to bash and beat the drum about.


Within this debate the government does not recognise that not every employer genuinely wants to bargain in good faith. There is a risk that this bill will give veto power to employers. A new requirement, which states that the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that improvements in productivity were discussed during the bargaining phase of the agreement, has now been inserted into this bill. What do you do if you are that low-paid cleaner, if you are already working superhard and you have backbreaking workloads? How do you become more productive if you are already working excessive workloads?


This bill gets away from the core principle of collective bargaining, where employers and employees sit down and genuinely engage in good faith bargaining. Introducing all of these new requirements that must be satisfied before the commission can approve an agreement puts more and more restriction on what can be bargained. It is not inconceivable to think of a situation where an employer says: 'I don't want to talk about productivity until we've discussed cutting wages, holidays and other conditions. I don't want to even talk about what we need to do to satisfy a silly rule that's been put in for the Fair Work Commissioner until we talk about cutting wages, holidays and other conditions.' There is example after example of where employers have done that. You just have to look at Victoria and what the former Liberal government did to the hard-working ambos. They refused to sit down and genuinely bargain in good faith around a log of claims before those hard-working ambos agreed to a number of conditions that the government had put on the table.


Does it mean that agreement can never be completed if a union refuses to budge on some matters? These changes will create constant deadlocks. What we need in our fair work system is not a system that creates deadlocks between bargaining groups. We need a system that allows groups to navigate their way through to an agreement. This amendment is another example of how this government, through this bill, seeks to deny workers the opportunity to genuinely bargain in good faith. It gives employers greater bargaining rights.


One of the areas which I think demonstrates this is their changes to protective action. The government have introduced a new provision which means that the Fair Work Commission must not make a protected action ballot if it is satisfied the applicant's claims are manifestly excessive, having regard to the conditions at the workplace and the industry in which the employer operates, or would significantly adversely impact the productivity of workplaces. That pretty much knocks out any form of industrial action. So when the members of the government stand up and say, 'We acknowledge that it is the right of a group of workers to take industrial action,' it is just total lip-service. The whole point of an employee being able to take industrial action is to remove their labour. So that is going to have an impact on the productivity of workplaces. This one particular change to the Fair Work Commission basically knocks out any employee's ability to take industrial action. They are using the word 'productivity' to disguise the fact that they are trying to knock out people's ability to be able to take industrial action, which has been a longstanding tradition in this country.


I have just a couple of examples when it comes to the militant employers that I have talked about. The government seeks to amend section 44(3) in the way in which the government proposes different and higher standards on unions wanting to take protected industrial action over those of employers. Let's talk about employer lockouts. The government likes to talk about militant unions, but what it is not talking about is employer lockouts.


An example is Schweppes. A few years ago around Christmas, multinational owned giant Schweppes locked out 150 workers at the Tullamarine factory. They were locked out after wanting to take protected industrial action to protect the rosters that they had. The employer locked them out because they were trying to impose on the workers a roster which would have seen them move from an eight-hour-a-day shift to a 12-hour-a-day shift, thus completely changing their workplace situation and removing something that we have held up in this country for such a long time: the eight-hour day. The employer locked them out, and these workers were without pay over the Christmas period. I will never forget that Christmas Day, being there with those workers locked out, out the front of their workplace. It was a very hot Christmas that Christmas, and they were there. They were there not because they wanted to see a massive increase in their pay. They were there because their employer wanted to radically change their roster, thus not only reducing their pay but significantly changing their workplace-life balance.


This bill is only going to aid the employers that do not want to genuinely bargain, that are actually going after fundamental basics and principles that Australians expect to have in their workplace. Another example in relation to this area has to be our cleaners and our shopping centre cleaners who, in bargaining at the Melbourne airport, also took industrial action. Pay talks broke down, again around Christmas, when 100 cleaners said that they would not accept a deal which was $4,000 a year less than other cleaners working at the airport. Again, our cleaners at the airports are low paid workers, and what the boss had put on the table through bargaining would have taken away several allowances and meal breaks which would have seen them paid $4,000 a year less. Now, if these particular amendments were already in place, the cleaners' ability to stand up and say, 'That's not fair. We won't accept that deal,' could have been knocked out by the commission because of the impact on productivity in the workplace. Yes, if a cleaner stops work, it impacts on the productivity of a workplace. It absolutely does because it means the toilets do not get cleaned. That is what it means.


This bill is not, as the government has said, about ensuring that workers continue to have that right to take industrial action. This bill is not, as this government says, about productivity. This bill is entirely about weakening workers' ability to collectively and genuinely bargain. This bill is about enhancing the employers who do not want to do the right thing and about giving them greater powers. There are examples that we have going on currently and in the last five to 10 years where companies have used bargaining to lock out workers, where companies have used bargaining to radically cut wages and conditions. Yet there is no attempt in this bill to see a levelling up of that playing field. This bill goes after workers and puts the veto opportunity in the employers' hands. This bill seeks to undermine the entire principle of collective bargaining, and it should be opposed.


What disappoints me the most about this bill is that the government have just not been honest. They are hiding behind the words of productivity. They are hiding behind the words of good-faith bargaining. But it could not be further from the truth. It denies Australian workers the right to collectively bargain in good faith with the employers. Collective bargaining has been a key feature of a fair and modern democratic society. Worse still, it creates deadlock in Fair Work Australia. There are going to be disputes where the employer or the employees may go too far. There are going to be disputes which need to be resolved by an independent umpire—Fair Work Australia. Yet all this bill does is make their job harder. It will create more deadlocks, more lockouts and more noisy actions, because it does not create an environment for genuine good-faith bargaining. 


In conclusion, I hope that our cleaners here at Parliament House do not ever have to file for a protected industrial action ballot. I hope, when their employer reaches an agreement with a fair pay rise and goes to the government and say this is what we need increased in our contract price to pay your cleaners a fair deal, that the government listens and does the right thing by the hard-working cleaners, because under this bill they may not have the ability to take industrial action to get a fair outcome. I ask the House to oppose the bill. 


Debate adjourned.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (12:51):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014. Some months before the 2013 election, the coalition released our policy to improve the Fair Work laws. This policy is all about lifting real wages, increasing productivity, making Australian businesses more competitive and, most importantly of all, generating more jobs. Our government is doing everything to encourage businesses to grow so they can employ more people—something which is of particular importance in my electorate of Corangamite.


Just in the last few months, we have seen some outstanding results in job creation generated by our government in partnership with the previous Napthine government under the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund, a fund in conjunction with Alcoa and Ford, which is driving already in excess of 750 new jobs. This is a great result for our region, particularly in the growth sectors in advanced manufacturing, in food processing and also in agriculture. A couple of weeks ago, there was a wonderful announcement that the Australian Bureau of Statistics is moving, in part, to Geelong, establishing a centre of excellence. This was one of the recommendations made by the Victorian economic review panel, which was looking into the Victorian economy in the wake of the closure of car manufacturing. One part of the ABS moving to Geelong is a really wonderful initiative, as it decentralises and invests in our wonderful city. The other thing that I keep talking about in terms of job creation—it is all about jobs and infrastructure—is that, just this week, there was fantastic news for the people of Corangamite with the news that the NBN is being rolled out to 34,000 premises across Corangamite in areas most in need of quicker broadband, across the Surf Coast and across the Bellarine. These are just a couple of examples of our very strong focus on jobs and infrastructure.


Our government's aspiration is to bring industrial relations back to the sensible centre, where the rights of employees are balanced with the rights of employers for the sake of jobs and productivity. I wish at this point to remind members what happens when our industrial relations system is out of balance. We have seen some fairly unfortunate examples in my region, the Geelong and Corangamite region, where improper and unlawful union conduct stifles jobs, productivity and business confidence. Perhaps the best example of that is what happened on the Regional Rail Link worksite, when the conduct of the CFMEU—which can only be described as terribly unlawful to the point where there was very strong action taken by the courts—shut down that site. It caused so much distress, particularly for Boral. The Supreme Court made orders against the unlawful protesting by the CFMEU and the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. Boral was effectively shut out. The CEO of Boral gave some evidence in the royal commission and basically said that this amounted to blackmail. It cost the company $10 million, and he described it as a criminal conspiracy, which really amounted to a situation where Boral was shut out of getting other important work. It is a terrible reflection on the CFMEU and on what happens when extremist, unlawful union conduct invades the workplace. This is the same CFMEU that so heavily backed Labor in the Victorian state election and that is helping to drive up construction costs in Victoria by an average of 30 per cent more than any other state. Throughout all this time, through a prism of the CFMEU donating millions of dollars to Labor, we have had deathly silence from the Labor Party on the unlawful, extreme, thuggish conduct of the CFMEU. Here was Boral, a supplier to Grocon, an innocent party, being shut out of work, and the costs and impacts were profound. As the member for Wannon has raised in his contribution, in this debate today there are two very different positions. There is the one taken by the Leader of the Opposition on the 7.30 report last night, where he talks about the importance of productivity, and the one here in the House today, where Labor is in denial over the importance of productivity.


As we have heard, the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill before the House implements the final tranche of the government's amendments to the Fair Work Act that were clearly outlined in our policy, and it makes a number of important improvements to the process of bargaining but, importantly, retains employee protections and also employee rights. These changes do not reduce rights; they simply ensure transparency around existing rights. I want to briefly go through each of the main changes. The first one is all about putting productivity back on the agenda by requiring parties to at least discuss improvements to productivity during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement. There is no requirement that productivity be an outcome in terms of any changes to an EBA. There is no requirement that the parties reach agreement on productivity. The only requirement is that it be discussed. Here we have members opposite objecting to this. Incredibly, the member for Bendigo, in her contribution, even said, 'This is not about productivity. This bill is not about productivity.' The kindest thing I can say about her contribution is that she clearly has not read the bill. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition on television last night talking about the importance of productivity for jobs and for growth for this nation, when our government is so focused on building productivity and growing jobs, and we have members opposite blocking such an important part of our industrial relations regime. All we are saying and all we are requiring in the bargaining process is that productivity be discussed. The Leader of the Opposition last night had no problem with that, and, now, in an act of what I can only describe as hypocrisy, we are seeing a very different position.


A second element of our bill is that unions and employees do not use industrial action as a tool of first resort. They must ensure that they have at least attempted to engage in meaningful discussions with the employer before resorting to industrial action. I remind the House that the Fair Work Commission will continue to be at the centre of the industrial action processes. Employees will still have a right to take protected action as part of their bargaining for enterprise agreements. Authorising the ballots to take industrial action will remain the responsibility of the independent Fair Work Commission. So what we are seeing is more transparency for an existing right. 


This bill will require a union applying for industrial action to provide the commission with information on the steps the union has taken in negotiating the new agreement, whether the union has told the employer specifically what the employees are seeking in the negotiations—it is common courtesy, frankly—whether the union has responded to employer offers or counter proposals; and generally how far negotiations have progressed. These items are based on a leading decision of the Fair Work Commission on what are relevant considerations the commission should look to before authorising an industrial action ballot. Really, by including these items in a list in the legislation we are seeking to ensure that there is a consistent decision-making approach by the commission and its various members.


The other element of this bill is to ensure that claims, in support of which industrial action is being taken, are not unrealistic or implausible. We recognise, of course, that industrial action is an important employee right. It is a right, however, that must be exercised responsibly rather than capriciously. So the bill gives the independent commission the express power to refuse to authorise an industrial action ballot if the commission is satisfied that the claims over which the unions wishes to take industrial action are manifestly excessive or would have a significant adverse impact on productivity.


Currently one of the big issues with the Fair Work Act is that it allows for industrial action to be taken in pursuit of almost any bargaining claim, no matter how extreme, no matter how unrealistic and no matter how unreasonable. I just want to draw on one recent example of reports of protected action ballot orders made in relation to claims by marine engineers in Port Hedland, where they were seeking a pay increase of 38 per cent over four years. The reports indicated that the claim, which includes an additional month of annual leave, is on top of existing salary packages of between $280,000 and $390,000, where employees only work for six months of the year, on a week-on, week-off roster. Clearly the claim that was being made was completely excessive—manifestly excessive. 


What we are seeking to do in this very important amendment is, again, strike a reasonable balance. We have no issue with industrial action but we have an issue with manifestly excessive claims—extreme claims and claims which are calculated to generate industrial mayhem rather than a sense of industrial equity as part of the bargaining process.


I want to very briefly reflect on the contribution of the member for Griffith, who claimed that the bill undermines the right to strike and undermines the right to bargain collectively. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have made that very, very clear. Nothing could be further from the truth but—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Ms HENDERSON:
  The member for Chifley interjects. I am very disappointed that the member for Chifley has not spoken about the unlawful, thuggish behaviour of the CFMEU and how that has driven down jobs and productivity in my electorate. That has been incredibly disappointing in terms of a very important project, the Regional Rail Link, to which the federal government is contributing $2.9 billion, which is going to be so important for the people of my electorate—the people who live in Geelong and south-west Victoria—connecting with Melbourne.


We have seen that Boral has been shut out in the most terrible of circumstances. And members opposite have said nothing.



Mr Husic interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley!




Ms HENDERSON:
  They have said absolutely nothing about this, and it is, quite frankly, a disgrace. It is really surprising when you have the Leader of the Opposition claiming how important it is for productivity that we see these changes in the work place yet members opposite oppose this bill.


This is all about striking the sensible centre. This is all about respecting the rights of workers, but it is also about reinforcing how important productivity is to the future of our country. As I mentioned, this bill will meet some important election commitments in addition to some election commitments that we have delivered. We have repealed the carbon and mining taxes. We have stopped the boats. We are building the roads of the 21st century, including the upgrading of the Great Ocean Road—a great project, which Labor opposed. We are duplicating the Princes Highway between Geelong and Colac. And, of course, a number of members are working very hard to campaign for Daniel Andrews to change his mind and reverse his economically reckless commitment to rip up the contracts on the East West Link—perhaps one of the most economically reckless commitments that we have ever seen in the state of Victoria.


Our government is focused on job creation. Jobs and infrastructure in my electorate of Corangamite are so important. This bill is an important part of those reforms and I commend the bill to the House.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (13:05):  I am pleased to rise to speak in opposition to this bill. There are a few things in the contribution of the member for Corangamite that need to be responded to. I will start where she finished. She said that this government is all about jobs. The joblessness rate in Victoria is a shame. It is a tragedy and it was a major factor in the change of government in Victoria. If the government wishes to be judged on its record on jobs, let them be judged on that frame.


There were a couple of other things that she said. The member for Corangamite talked at some length at the start and at the end of her contribution about the 'sensible centre' in industrial relations. That is a favourite phrase of the Prime Minister that bears no resemblance whatever to this government's agenda for industrial relations. I note that the policy that related to the bargaining changes that are the subject of this bill did refer to striking a balance. As the member for Corangamite said, that was a balance between the obligations on workers and unions and the obligations on managers. However, as has so often been the case under this government, between the policy that was announced before the election and the policy that is before us and contained in this legislation, there has been a substantial change. The balance has been removed. This is all about focusing on workers and unions, not about managers and their obligations in relation to productivity.


It was very interesting that the member for Corangamite criticised the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Bendigo in terms of their contributions to the productivity aspect of this debate—productivity, of course, being the purported justification for this legislation—but she could not say one word about how the provisions contained in this bill would boost productivity. It simply relies on the innate ideological view of members opposite that our pathway to productivity is by driving wages down, weakening unions and taking away employees' rights. The evidence, frankly, goes the other way. Members opposite should be reminded that labour productivity growth has been consistent over the last 12 quarters—that is, three years. Labour productivity is not at the heart of Australia's productivity challenge and, even if it were, the provisions contained in this bill would do very little to boost labour productivity.


I also note that the member for Corangamite asserted that this legislation maintains employees' rights. If she had been listening to the contribution of the member for Griffith, who is a person who knows quite a bit about this—I would venture, quite a bit more than the member for Corangamite—she would understand that that is simply not the case. What we have in this bill is fundamentally an attack on collectivism and on rights—important rights that go to the heart of pretty fundamental questions that go to power relationships between people who earn their living through a wage and those who employ them.


This bill is also, as I said in my opening comments, a broken promise, which perhaps makes it a fitting end to the year. It is flawed in concept and it is also flawed in execution. Above all else, this is very poorly constructed legislation that may not even serve its own purposes. This bill is a disingenuous, pointless and deeply ideological piece of legislation. It reminds us that this government's commitment to red-tape reduction does not extend to the realm of work. This is a matter, again, of form and substance. At one level, this legislation is all about red tape for the sake of it, in terms of the provisions that go to bargaining and productivity tick-boxes. I will say more on that issue. It is also worth noting in this debate how many times this government has already returned to the legislative whirl in relation to industrial relations, despite having, in effect, committed to not doing so prior to the election.


To those opposite who love to speak of unnecessary legislation, I ask this question: what is the problem that this bill is trying to solve? The explanatory memorandum that comes with it is pretty unhelpful and even obtuse on this point. This is pretty fundamental. What is the evidence, for example, of a wage explosion? I said earlier—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr GILES:
  There is none, member for Chifley. You would think that would be a relevant consideration.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr GILES:
  Yes, indeed—balance should recognise that. The evidence is that labour productivity growth has been consistent over 12 quarters. It has increased over the last three years. I will speak further on the thinness of the productivity justification as I turn to the provisions of the legislation in detail.


I also think some context is required in this debate. Today, as we speak, work is less and less secure. Some of the attitudes towards the position of wage earners is, frankly, staggering. I saw on the front page of the Australian Financial Review yesterday, in response to some commitments made by the new Victorian government, the suggestion that public servants in Victoria would get free money. The suggestion that underpins this, the ideological position going to the wage share that is fair and proper, is staggering. All of us in this place understand—or we have been told and should have listened—the standard-of-living pressures, the cost-of-living pressures, that our constituents face.


Labor members are up for real engagement on these matters, but to simply suggest that pushing downward pressure on wages by denying workers and their representatives the capacity to bargain fairly is just ludicrous. We are up for broad conversation about productivity and the things that might boost Australia's productivity, about investment in infrastructure and about having a national urban policy that might deal with some of the issues around the depth of our labour markets, for example. We are up for investment in skills and training—the sorts of things that this government is walking away from. We are up for a debate about innovation.


I spoke earlier about this bill being disingenuous, but I wonder if that might have been a generous description. The words of the minister in his second reading speech do not quite reach the heights of his 7.30 Report channelling of Comical Ali earlier this week following the defeat of his higher education reforms in the Senate, but they do sit pretty uncomfortably with provisions that are set out in the bill. He claims implementation of election policy. This is farcical. He is delivering on one side of the debate while denying any meaningful engagement and responsibility of the managerial side. For him to assert, as he does, that this bill will ensure that negotiations for enterprise agreements are harmonious and productive is simply nonsense. At one level—the pointless side of this piece of legislation—the issue is that the requirements are simply token, as Professor Andrew Stewart has advised.


This also goes a broken promise. Before the election, the coalition spoke about the joint responsibilities. In this bill it is all about workers. As the shadow minister said, if they were serious about addressing productivity and bargaining, they could have looked at, for example, amendments to the good-faith bargaining rules that would encourage parties to come together. The unevenness of these provisions is deeply problematic. Once again, this is a government that has given scant regard to the concerns of workers. We see obligations imposed on unions, on one hand, with the prospect of an effective veto, at the very least, and, on the other hand, a strongly enhanced bargaining position for employers.


I am also more than a little troubled by the minister's indication of what he describes as the common sense test. What does this mean? What is common sense? It should be clear to anyone in this place that these debates around industrial relations are deeply contested issues, and they are vital. They go to how most of us earn our living, how most of us see ourselves and how most of us provide for our families. The 'I reckon test' is simply not good enough. It is consistent with the shoddiness of the legislation at large. I think that is why the shadow minister has proposed—and this would be sensible—to seek the views of stakeholders on these issues through a Senate committee process. If the minister feels differently about this, he might advise me and my colleagues via SMS as to his real justification.


There are three substantive components to this bill. Firstly, there is the issue of productivity discussion during bargaining—amendments to section 187(1) of the Fair Work Act—which requires the Fair Work Commission to be satisfied, before approving an enterprise agreement, that improvements to productivity at the workplace are discussed during the bargaining process. According to the explanatory memorandum, this does not require the parties to agree to terms, nor to include terms in an agreement about improving productivity. Well, what is the point, particularly when productivity is not defined in the proposed amendments, nor is it presently defined in the substantive act? So, I ask myself: what is the point of discussing productivity when it does not go to the enterprise agreement and is not adequately defined by the amendments or the fair work agreement? Again, I harken back to the contribution of the member for Corangamite who talked about productivity but did not go to any of the challenges of boosting productivity, or to consider, other than merely assert, that these changes would somehow magically make things better. In practice what we have is another box to be ticked that adds nothing substantive to the bargaining process. It is more red tape.


You would think the parliamentary secretary, the member for Kooyong, would be horrified, or perhaps excited, that he can wrap up this into his bonfire of unnecessary regulation next year. This is an unnecessary process with a slightly sinister undertone that it is clearly introduced to restrict workplace rights. On this point there is also the risk that this provision could be used to manipulate bargaining. An employer could say that it does not want to discuss productivity until it has discussed wages or other conditions. This is a possibility because the amendments, as they are drafted, state that productivity must be discussed during bargaining for the agreement, and that they must be met before the commission can approve an agreement. This may be a risk or this may reflect a failure to understand the process.


I turn also, now, to the question of the protected action changes which are deeply concerning. I refer members to the contribution of the member for Griffith, not just because of the manner in which she clearly set out the concerns she and Labor members have, but because of the depth of her experience in this area. She is someone who should be listened to by people like the member for Corangamite. I think it is deeply concerning to see this claimed implication of productivity as an excuse to hinder the capacity of workers to secure their rights through a protected ballot. This is a very significant right. It is upheld in international instruments to which we are a signatory, and we should, as I have said often in this place in respect of similar matters, mean what we say in relation to these obligations that we assume.


The amendments to section 443(2) state that the Fair Work Commission must not grant a protected action ballot in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement if it is satisfied the claims of the applicant are manifestly excessive or would have a significant adverse impact on productivity. Clearly these changes would make it harder for a protected action ballot to be granted. The explanatory memorandum says that the requirement may limit access to protected industrial action. Clearly the previous speaker had not familiarised herself with that when she spoke about upholding employee rights. This is a pretty fundamental right for workers. The government, through the explanatory memorandum, has admitted that this places the threshold for protected action higher. This amendment does not only introduce red tape, it ties the hands of workers with it, reshaping, again, the power relationships.


If these amendments were to be read strictly, any industrial action could be construed as impacting productivity. I ask myself the question: where would this leave enterprise bargaining? These amendments, above all else, are poorly drafted and clearly would create significant uncertainty in a vital area of the law. Again, the explanatory memorandum refers to workplace productivity as being a feature of the framework, but all I can see from these amendments is more red tape and, concerningly, fewer rights for workers. I do not see how it can be contested that these things do not equate to workforce productivity, but rather are another assault on hard-working Australians. I would be assisted if government members could explain, or even better, reconsider what they think workplace productivity is.


The third substantive element if this bill, briefly, is contained in amendments to section 443(1A) which represent an attempt by the government to codify the decision of Total Marine Services, but go further than this. The definitional elements of what constitutes 'genuinely trying to reach an agreement' have been around since the early 1990s under the Keating government. This codification fundamentally is unnecessary given that the commission does not disregard the factors referred to in the new section. Here we have, again, the government seeking to introduce additional requirements not just to codify the case law as these requirements, unsurprisingly, place additional burdens on unions. No such burden is placed on employers;—far from the balance asserted by the previous speaker—it is placed only on workers through their unions. So, these amendments are a clear broken election commitment.


This government seems to be, through this legislation, doing its best to make workplace laws, at best, ambiguous and uncertain but also attacking workers and their rights. So, I am pleased to stand with the shadow minister and other Labor members in opposing this bill and in welcoming, contrary to what the member for Corangamite said, a real conversation, a real debate, about this bill, a real debate about workplace productivity and about productivity more generally. A Senate committee would provide an opportunity for that debate. These issues are vital. They are vital for the economy and they are also vital for our society. Important, indeed, fundamental rights and vital interests are at stake here.


This is a piece of legislation that was flawed in concept and is flawed in execution. The House should not pass this bill.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (13:20):  The Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 is in line with the coalition's policy to improve the fair work laws. This government is continuing to deliver on its promise to improve the fair work legislation that we currently have in this country. Specifically, this bill seeks to ensure that due process is followed when negotiations for pay increases take place. We want to see an end to Labor's strike-first-talk-later policy. We want to legislatively determine the steps that need to be taken prior to the Fair Work Commission deciding whether an applicant for a protected action ballot order is genuinely trying to reach an agreement. We also want to see an end to the games—where the he-said-she-said stuff is stopped—and make sure that records of the required steps are kept. We also want to require that anyone requesting a pay rise displays evidence of increased productivity.


This amendment bill protects the employee by ensuring that due steps are being followed during the negotiation process. It also protects the employer from being held to ransom by industrial terrorism and avoids the strike-first-bargain-later approach so often used by the unions. Ensuring that due process is followed is fairer on the mum-and-dad employees and the mum-and-dad business owners of Australia, particularly in the electorate of Canning that I represent. The amendment bill specifically outlines what is required by both parties and removes any ambiguity of process. This bill also directly complements the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014 which ensures protected industrial action cannot take place until bargaining has commenced. Currently, legislation allows industrial action to be taken during the early stages of negotiation, often resulting in a stand-off and stymieing any communications aimed at achieving a resolution. The coalition believes that this is not right. In fact, it is wrong. We are making it easier; we are making it simpler—and we are taking a common-sense approach to this legislation.


On the issue of productivity, I refer to my colleague the member for Hume's contribution to this House. In the Australian Financial Review on 1 December, he wrote an editorial piece called 'Productivity is a worker's best friend'. I am pleased to see the member for Fraser at the desk, because in his contribution today—whether the member for Fraser knows it or not—the member for Hume cited the member for Fraser's academic research in giving his reasons why this bill should be supported. I note that the member for Fraser is not on the speakers list. I wonder if that is because the research he had done previously would conflict with the Labor Party's position today? I note with interest that he is not speaking on this bill, because he might have to argue against the research he did as an academic—which supports the main tenets of this bill. We know that the member for Fraser is a highly intellectual person—



Dr Leigh interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! 




Mr RANDALL:
  and we know of his academic record. We also know that the member for Hume is a Rhodes scholar. So let us not have an argument about who has got the kilo brain here. Both of them are well placed to have a say. At the end of the day, the member for Hume, both in his article that I referred to and in his contribution today, made it very clear that productivity is the worker's best friend. He pointed to where the member for Fraser had done research on wage cases in Western Australia, my home state, which justified his argument that productivity adds to wage increases and lowers youth unemployment.


The 'Peel Away the Mask' article, which was first produced in 2001—and has since been revised—and which reflects the unemployment situation in the Peel area of my electorate in Canning, has a lot to say about youth unemployment in the Peel region. Youth unemployment in the Peel region is quite serious because it is always above the national and state average. A lot of this is to do with the exact thing that we are talking about today: young people getting a job where they can actually grow their wages and conditions. 


Every member opposite—and we know why they are in here—has to belong to a union. You cannot be a member of the Labor Party unless you are a member of a union. As soon as you talk about productivity or flexibility, the first thing those opposite do is to start going on about Work Choices or taking away workers' entitlements or making sure that they get less.



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—



Dr Leigh interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Mr RANDALL:
  I do note that the member for Perth is not even on the speakers list. If she could get herself on the list and have a go, it would be far more effective than just yelling interjections. If the member for Fraser put himself on the list as well, we could see him try and counter the argument that the member for Hume put—based on the member for Fraser's own research. 


Youth unemployment is something that is of concern to everybody in this country, but you cannot increase youth participation unless you improve productivity. As soon as you say 'productivity', those opposite will say that it is an excuse for lowering workers' terms and conditions. It is not, because the whole basis of productivity is doing something smarter and more efficiently. Let us use a very simple example so people can absorb it. If you are an old-fashioned farmer and you have a horse and a plough, you are not going to be very productive. If you are old-fashioned farmer and you have two horses and a plough with some wheels on it, you will be more productive. If you are an old farmer and you have an old Fordson tractor, you are going to cover a lot more ground.


It is all about using innovation and technology to be more productive, and this is what this bill today is about. It is to encourage workers, before seeking a pay rise, to talk about what is on offer. We are not talking about quite reasonable pay rises in terms of CPI. Just because somebody has put up an ambit claim, you cannot expect an employer, a mum-and-dad employer who is trying to run a business with half a dozen people, to say, 'Oh, yeah, you can have everything you have asked for.' It just does not work like that. You would send those businesses broke. In fact, you would put young people in particular out of work, because you would price them out of a job. At the end of the day, productivity is the keynote to growth in this country and it is the hallmark of anything that we want to do to address Australia's debt.


The reason that those opposite oppose this is that they are told to oppose it by their union bosses. I will give you an example. The train drivers in the Pilbara, who essentially only work six months of the year, are on something likes $300,000—for working six months of the year. Have a guess what is happening—companies like Rio and BHP are now putting in driverless trains because those drivers have priced themselves out of the market. I say to those opposite: if you are going to be sensible about this, think about what you can bring to the business. 


Earlier I heard one of the members over there—the member for Bendigo, I think—saying: 'All they want to do is make people work harder.' They do not want to make people work harder; they want to make them work smarter. If you work smarter, you can do more in the same period of time. That is Australia's unbelievable advantage in the region.


I will quote from the member for Hume's article of 1 December:


… targeted innovation will add to productivity across labour and capital, particularly in government services. Whether it is applying new IT technologies, establishing new management practices or simple measures to increase workplace flexibility … innovation is the cheapest lunch of all.


So I say: this whole bill is based on the fact that, yes, bargaining and all the things we have talked about are very important, as long as they get those steps right, but the real key to this legislation is: yes, wages can be increased, as long as you can be productive.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,9,1
"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (12:51):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014. Some months before the 2013 election, the coalition released our policy to improve the Fair Work laws. This policy is all about lifting real wages, increasing productivity, making Australian businesses more competitive and, most importantly of all, generating more jobs. Our government is doing everything to encourage businesses to grow so they can employ more people—something which is of particular importance in my electorate of Corangamite.


Just in the last few months, we have seen some outstanding results in job creation generated by our government in partnership with the previous Napthine government under the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund, a fund in conjunction with Alcoa and Ford, which is driving already in excess of 750 new jobs. This is a great result for our region, particularly in the growth sectors in advanced manufacturing, in food processing and also in agriculture. A couple of weeks ago, there was a wonderful announcement that the Australian Bureau of Statistics is moving, in part, to Geelong, establishing a centre of excellence. This was one of the recommendations made by the Victorian economic review panel, which was looking into the Victorian economy in the wake of the closure of car manufacturing. One part of the ABS moving to Geelong is a really wonderful initiative, as it decentralises and invests in our wonderful city. The other thing that I keep talking about in terms of job creation—it is all about jobs and infrastructure—is that, just this week, there was fantastic news for the people of Corangamite with the news that the NBN is being rolled out to 34,000 premises across Corangamite in areas most in need of quicker broadband, across the Surf Coast and across the Bellarine. These are just a couple of examples of our very strong focus on jobs and infrastructure.


Our government's aspiration is to bring industrial relations back to the sensible centre, where the rights of employees are balanced with the rights of employers for the sake of jobs and productivity. I wish at this point to remind members what happens when our industrial relations system is out of balance. We have seen some fairly unfortunate examples in my region, the Geelong and Corangamite region, where improper and unlawful union conduct stifles jobs, productivity and business confidence. Perhaps the best example of that is what happened on the Regional Rail Link worksite, when the conduct of the CFMEU—which can only be described as terribly unlawful to the point where there was very strong action taken by the courts—shut down that site. It caused so much distress, particularly for Boral. The Supreme Court made orders against the unlawful protesting by the CFMEU and the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. Boral was effectively shut out. The CEO of Boral gave some evidence in the royal commission and basically said that this amounted to blackmail. It cost the company $10 million, and he described it as a criminal conspiracy, which really amounted to a situation where Boral was shut out of getting other important work. It is a terrible reflection on the CFMEU and on what happens when extremist, unlawful union conduct invades the workplace. This is the same CFMEU that so heavily backed Labor in the Victorian state election and that is helping to drive up construction costs in Victoria by an average of 30 per cent more than any other state. Throughout all this time, through a prism of the CFMEU donating millions of dollars to Labor, we have had deathly silence from the Labor Party on the unlawful, extreme, thuggish conduct of the CFMEU. Here was Boral, a supplier to Grocon, an innocent party, being shut out of work, and the costs and impacts were profound. As the member for Wannon has raised in his contribution, in this debate today there are two very different positions. There is the one taken by the Leader of the Opposition on the 7.30 report last night, where he talks about the importance of productivity, and the one here in the House today, where Labor is in denial over the importance of productivity.


As we have heard, the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill before the House implements the final tranche of the government's amendments to the Fair Work Act that were clearly outlined in our policy, and it makes a number of important improvements to the process of bargaining but, importantly, retains employee protections and also employee rights. These changes do not reduce rights; they simply ensure transparency around existing rights. I want to briefly go through each of the main changes. The first one is all about putting productivity back on the agenda by requiring parties to at least discuss improvements to productivity during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement. There is no requirement that productivity be an outcome in terms of any changes to an EBA. There is no requirement that the parties reach agreement on productivity. The only requirement is that it be discussed. Here we have members opposite objecting to this. Incredibly, the member for Bendigo, in her contribution, even said, 'This is not about productivity. This bill is not about productivity.' The kindest thing I can say about her contribution is that she clearly has not read the bill. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition on television last night talking about the importance of productivity for jobs and for growth for this nation, when our government is so focused on building productivity and growing jobs, and we have members opposite blocking such an important part of our industrial relations regime. All we are saying and all we are requiring in the bargaining process is that productivity be discussed. The Leader of the Opposition last night had no problem with that, and, now, in an act of what I can only describe as hypocrisy, we are seeing a very different position.


A second element of our bill is that unions and employees do not use industrial action as a tool of first resort. They must ensure that they have at least attempted to engage in meaningful discussions with the employer before resorting to industrial action. I remind the House that the Fair Work Commission will continue to be at the centre of the industrial action processes. Employees will still have a right to take protected action as part of their bargaining for enterprise agreements. Authorising the ballots to take industrial action will remain the responsibility of the independent Fair Work Commission. So what we are seeing is more transparency for an existing right. 


This bill will require a union applying for industrial action to provide the commission with information on the steps the union has taken in negotiating the new agreement, whether the union has told the employer specifically what the employees are seeking in the negotiations—it is common courtesy, frankly—whether the union has responded to employer offers or counter proposals; and generally how far negotiations have progressed. These items are based on a leading decision of the Fair Work Commission on what are relevant considerations the commission should look to before authorising an industrial action ballot. Really, by including these items in a list in the legislation we are seeking to ensure that there is a consistent decision-making approach by the commission and its various members.


The other element of this bill is to ensure that claims, in support of which industrial action is being taken, are not unrealistic or implausible. We recognise, of course, that industrial action is an important employee right. It is a right, however, that must be exercised responsibly rather than capriciously. So the bill gives the independent commission the express power to refuse to authorise an industrial action ballot if the commission is satisfied that the claims over which the unions wishes to take industrial action are manifestly excessive or would have a significant adverse impact on productivity.


Currently one of the big issues with the Fair Work Act is that it allows for industrial action to be taken in pursuit of almost any bargaining claim, no matter how extreme, no matter how unrealistic and no matter how unreasonable. I just want to draw on one recent example of reports of protected action ballot orders made in relation to claims by marine engineers in Port Hedland, where they were seeking a pay increase of 38 per cent over four years. The reports indicated that the claim, which includes an additional month of annual leave, is on top of existing salary packages of between $280,000 and $390,000, where employees only work for six months of the year, on a week-on, week-off roster. Clearly the claim that was being made was completely excessive—manifestly excessive. 


What we are seeking to do in this very important amendment is, again, strike a reasonable balance. We have no issue with industrial action but we have an issue with manifestly excessive claims—extreme claims and claims which are calculated to generate industrial mayhem rather than a sense of industrial equity as part of the bargaining process.


I want to very briefly reflect on the contribution of the member for Griffith, who claimed that the bill undermines the right to strike and undermines the right to bargain collectively. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have made that very, very clear. Nothing could be further from the truth but—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Ms HENDERSON:
  The member for Chifley interjects. I am very disappointed that the member for Chifley has not spoken about the unlawful, thuggish behaviour of the CFMEU and how that has driven down jobs and productivity in my electorate. That has been incredibly disappointing in terms of a very important project, the Regional Rail Link, to which the federal government is contributing $2.9 billion, which is going to be so important for the people of my electorate—the people who live in Geelong and south-west Victoria—connecting with Melbourne.


We have seen that Boral has been shut out in the most terrible of circumstances. And members opposite have said nothing.



Mr Husic interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley!




Ms HENDERSON:
  They have said absolutely nothing about this, and it is, quite frankly, a disgrace. It is really surprising when you have the Leader of the Opposition claiming how important it is for productivity that we see these changes in the work place yet members opposite oppose this bill.


This is all about striking the sensible centre. This is all about respecting the rights of workers, but it is also about reinforcing how important productivity is to the future of our country. As I mentioned, this bill will meet some important election commitments in addition to some election commitments that we have delivered. We have repealed the carbon and mining taxes. We have stopped the boats. We are building the roads of the 21st century, including the upgrading of the Great Ocean Road—a great project, which Labor opposed. We are duplicating the Princes Highway between Geelong and Colac. And, of course, a number of members are working very hard to campaign for Daniel Andrews to change his mind and reverse his economically reckless commitment to rip up the contracts on the East West Link—perhaps one of the most economically reckless commitments that we have ever seen in the state of Victoria.


Our government is focused on job creation. Jobs and infrastructure in my electorate of Corangamite are so important. This bill is an important part of those reforms and I commend the bill to the House. 

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,9,2
"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (13:05):  I am pleased to rise to speak in opposition to this bill. There are a few things in the contribution of the member for Corangamite that need to be responded to. I will start where she finished. She said that this government is all about jobs. The joblessness rate in Victoria is a shame. It is a tragedy and it was a major factor in the change of government in Victoria. If the government wishes to be judged on its record on jobs, let them be judged on that frame.


There were a couple of other things that she said. The member for Corangamite talked at some length at the start and at the end of her contribution about the 'sensible centre' in industrial relations. That is a favourite phrase of the Prime Minister that bears no resemblance whatever to this government's agenda for industrial relations. I note that the policy that related to the bargaining changes that are the subject of this bill did refer to striking a balance. As the member for Corangamite said, that was a balance between the obligations on workers and unions and the obligations on managers. However, as has so often been the case under this government, between the policy that was announced before the election and the policy that is before us and contained in this legislation, there has been a substantial change. The balance has been removed. This is all about focusing on workers and unions, not about managers and their obligations in relation to productivity.


It was very interesting that the member for Corangamite criticised the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Bendigo in terms of their contributions to the productivity aspect of this debate—productivity, of course, being the purported justification for this legislation—but she could not say one word about how the provisions contained in this bill would boost productivity. It simply relies on the innate ideological view of members opposite that our pathway to productivity is by driving wages down, weakening unions and taking away employees' rights. The evidence, frankly, goes the other way. Members opposite should be reminded that labour productivity growth has been consistent over the last 12 quarters—that is, three years. Labour productivity is not at the heart of Australia's productivity challenge and, even if it were, the provisions contained in this bill would do very little to boost labour productivity.


I also note that the member for Corangamite asserted that this legislation maintains employees' rights. If she had been listening to the contribution of the member for Griffith, who is a person who knows quite a bit about this—I would venture, quite a bit more than the member for Corangamite—she would understand that that is simply not the case. What we have in this bill is fundamentally an attack on collectivism and on rights—important rights that go to the heart of pretty fundamental questions that go to power relationships between people who earn their living through a wage and those who employ them.


This bill is also, as I said in my opening comments, a broken promise, which perhaps makes it a fitting end to the year. It is flawed in concept and it is also flawed in execution. Above all else, this is very poorly constructed legislation that may not even serve its own purposes. This bill is a disingenuous, pointless and deeply ideological piece of legislation. It reminds us that this government's commitment to red-tape reduction does not extend to the realm of work. This is a matter, again, of form and substance. At one level, this legislation is all about red tape for the sake of it, in terms of the provisions that go to bargaining and productivity tick-boxes. I will say more on that issue. It is also worth noting in this debate how many times this government has already returned to the legislative whirl in relation to industrial relations, despite having, in effect, committed to not doing so prior to the election.


To those opposite who love to speak of unnecessary legislation, I ask this question: what is the problem that this bill is trying to solve? The explanatory memorandum that comes with it is pretty unhelpful and even obtuse on this point. This is pretty fundamental. What is the evidence, for example, of a wage explosion? I said earlier—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr GILES:
  There is none, member for Chifley. You would think that would be a relevant consideration.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr GILES:
  Yes, indeed—balance should recognise that. The evidence is that labour productivity growth has been consistent over 12 quarters. It has increased over the last three years. I will speak further on the thinness of the productivity justification as I turn to the provisions of the legislation in detail.


I also think some context is required in this debate. Today, as we speak, work is less and less secure. Some of the attitudes towards the position of wage earners is, frankly, staggering. I saw on the front page of the Australian Financial Review yesterday, in response to some commitments made by the new Victorian government, the suggestion that public servants in Victoria would get free money. The suggestion that underpins this, the ideological position going to the wage share that is fair and proper, is staggering. All of us in this place understand—or we have been told and should have listened—the standard-of-living pressures, the cost-of-living pressures, that our constituents face.


Labor members are up for real engagement on these matters, but to simply suggest that pushing downward pressure on wages by denying workers and their representatives the capacity to bargain fairly is just ludicrous. We are up for broad conversation about productivity and the things that might boost Australia's productivity, about investment in infrastructure and about having a national urban policy that might deal with some of the issues around the depth of our labour markets, for example. We are up for investment in skills and training—the sorts of things that this government is walking away from. We are up for a debate about innovation.


I spoke earlier about this bill being disingenuous, but I wonder if that might have been a generous description. The words of the minister in his second reading speech do not quite reach the heights of his 7.30 Report channelling of Comical Ali earlier this week following the defeat of his higher education reforms in the Senate, but they do sit pretty uncomfortably with provisions that are set out in the bill. He claims implementation of election policy. This is farcical. He is delivering on one side of the debate while denying any meaningful engagement and responsibility of the managerial side. For him to assert, as he does, that this bill will ensure that negotiations for enterprise agreements are harmonious and productive is simply nonsense. At one level—the pointless side of this piece of legislation—the issue is that the requirements are simply token, as Professor Andrew Stewart has advised.


This also goes a broken promise. Before the election, the coalition spoke about the joint responsibilities. In this bill it is all about workers. As the shadow minister said, if they were serious about addressing productivity and bargaining, they could have looked at, for example, amendments to the good-faith bargaining rules that would encourage parties to come together. The unevenness of these provisions is deeply problematic. Once again, this is a government that has given scant regard to the concerns of workers. We see obligations imposed on unions, on one hand, with the prospect of an effective veto, at the very least, and, on the other hand, a strongly enhanced bargaining position for employers.


I am also more than a little troubled by the minister's indication of what he describes as the common sense test. What does this mean? What is common sense? It should be clear to anyone in this place that these debates around industrial relations are deeply contested issues, and they are vital. They go to how most of us earn our living, how most of us see ourselves and how most of us provide for our families. The 'I reckon test' is simply not good enough. It is consistent with the shoddiness of the legislation at large. I think that is why the shadow minister has proposed—and this would be sensible—to seek the views of stakeholders on these issues through a Senate committee process. If the minister feels differently about this, he might advise me and my colleagues via SMS as to his real justification.


There are three substantive components to this bill. Firstly, there is the issue of productivity discussion during bargaining—amendments to section 187(1) of the Fair Work Act—which requires the Fair Work Commission to be satisfied, before approving an enterprise agreement, that improvements to productivity at the workplace are discussed during the bargaining process. According to the explanatory memorandum, this does not require the parties to agree to terms, nor to include terms in an agreement about improving productivity. Well, what is the point, particularly when productivity is not defined in the proposed amendments, nor is it presently defined in the substantive act? So, I ask myself: what is the point of discussing productivity when it does not go to the enterprise agreement and is not adequately defined by the amendments or the fair work agreement? Again, I harken back to the contribution of the member for Corangamite who talked about productivity but did not go to any of the challenges of boosting productivity, or to consider, other than merely assert, that these changes would somehow magically make things better. In practice what we have is another box to be ticked that adds nothing substantive to the bargaining process. It is more red tape.


You would think the parliamentary secretary, the member for Kooyong, would be horrified, or perhaps excited, that he can wrap up this into his bonfire of unnecessary regulation next year. This is an unnecessary process with a slightly sinister undertone that it is clearly introduced to restrict workplace rights. On this point there is also the risk that this provision could be used to manipulate bargaining. An employer could say that it does not want to discuss productivity until it has discussed wages or other conditions. This is a possibility because the amendments, as they are drafted, state that productivity must be discussed during bargaining for the agreement, and that they must be met before the commission can approve an agreement. This may be a risk or this may reflect a failure to understand the process.


I turn also, now, to the question of the protected action changes which are deeply concerning. I refer members to the contribution of the member for Griffith, not just because of the manner in which she clearly set out the concerns she and Labor members have, but because of the depth of her experience in this area. She is someone who should be listened to by people like the member for Corangamite. I think it is deeply concerning to see this claimed implication of productivity as an excuse to hinder the capacity of workers to secure their rights through a protected ballot. This is a very significant right. It is upheld in international instruments to which we are a signatory, and we should, as I have said often in this place in respect of similar matters, mean what we say in relation to these obligations that we assume.


The amendments to section 443(2) state that the Fair Work Commission must not grant a protected action ballot in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement if it is satisfied the claims of the applicant are manifestly excessive or would have a significant adverse impact on productivity. Clearly these changes would make it harder for a protected action ballot to be granted. The explanatory memorandum says that the requirement may limit access to protected industrial action. Clearly the previous speaker had not familiarised herself with that when she spoke about upholding employee rights. This is a pretty fundamental right for workers. The government, through the explanatory memorandum, has admitted that this places the threshold for protected action higher. This amendment does not only introduce red tape, it ties the hands of workers with it, reshaping, again, the power relationships.


If these amendments were to be read strictly, any industrial action could be construed as impacting productivity. I ask myself the question: where would this leave enterprise bargaining? These amendments, above all else, are poorly drafted and clearly would create significant uncertainty in a vital area of the law. Again, the explanatory memorandum refers to workplace productivity as being a feature of the framework, but all I can see from these amendments is more red tape and, concerningly, fewer rights for workers. I do not see how it can be contested that these things do not equate to workforce productivity, but rather are another assault on hard-working Australians. I would be assisted if government members could explain, or even better, reconsider what they think workplace productivity is.


The third substantive element if this bill, briefly, is contained in amendments to section 443(1A) which represent an attempt by the government to codify the decision of Total Marine Services, but go further than this. The definitional elements of what constitutes 'genuinely trying to reach an agreement' have been around since the early 1990s under the Keating government. This codification fundamentally is unnecessary given that the commission does not disregard the factors referred to in the new section. Here we have, again, the government seeking to introduce additional requirements not just to codify the case law as these requirements, unsurprisingly, place additional burdens on unions. No such burden is placed on employers;—far from the balance asserted by the previous speaker—it is placed only on workers through their unions. So, these amendments are a clear broken election commitment.


This government seems to be, through this legislation, doing its best to make workplace laws, at best, ambiguous and uncertain but also attacking workers and their rights. So, I am pleased to stand with the shadow minister and other Labor members in opposing this bill and in welcoming, contrary to what the member for Corangamite said, a real conversation, a real debate, about this bill, a real debate about workplace productivity and about productivity more generally. A Senate committee would provide an opportunity for that debate. These issues are vital. They are vital for the economy and they are also vital for our society. Important, indeed, fundamental rights and vital interests are at stake here.


This is a piece of legislation that was flawed in concept and is flawed in execution. The House should not pass this bill.

Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (13:20):  The Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 is in line with the coalition's policy to improve the fair work laws. This government is continuing to deliver on its promise to improve the fair work legislation that we currently have in this country. Specifically, this bill seeks to ensure that due process is followed when negotiations for pay increases take place. We want to see an end to Labor's strike-first-talk-later policy. We want to legislatively determine the steps that need to be taken prior to the Fair Work Commission deciding whether an applicant for a protected action ballot order is genuinely trying to reach an agreement. We also want to see an end to the games—where the he-said-she-said stuff is stopped—and make sure that records of the required steps are kept. We also want to require that anyone requesting a pay rise displays evidence of increased productivity.


This amendment bill protects the employee by ensuring that due steps are being followed during the negotiation process. It also protects the employer from being held to ransom by industrial terrorism and avoids the strike-first-bargain-later approach so often used by the unions. Ensuring that due process is followed is fairer on the mum-and-dad employees and the mum-and-dad business owners of Australia, particularly in the electorate of Canning that I represent. The amendment bill specifically outlines what is required by both parties and removes any ambiguity of process. This bill also directly complements the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014 which ensures protected industrial action cannot take place until bargaining has commenced. Currently, legislation allows industrial action to be taken during the early stages of negotiation, often resulting in a stand-off and stymieing any communications aimed at achieving a resolution. The coalition believes that this is not right. In fact, it is wrong. We are making it easier; we are making it simpler—and we are taking a common-sense approach to this legislation.


On the issue of productivity, I refer to my colleague the member for Hume's contribution to this House. In the Australian Financial Review on 1 December, he wrote an editorial piece called 'Productivity is a worker's best friend'. I am pleased to see the member for Fraser at the desk, because in his contribution today—whether the member for Fraser knows it or not—the member for Hume cited the member for Fraser's academic research in giving his reasons why this bill should be supported. I note that the member for Fraser is not on the speakers list. I wonder if that is because the research he had done previously would conflict with the Labor Party's position today? I note with interest that he is not speaking on this bill, because he might have to argue against the research he did as an academic—which supports the main tenets of this bill. We know that the member for Fraser is a highly intellectual person—



Dr Leigh interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! 




Mr RANDALL:
  and we know of his academic record. We also know that the member for Hume is a Rhodes scholar. So let us not have an argument about who has got the kilo brain here. Both of them are well placed to have a say. At the end of the day, the member for Hume, both in his article that I referred to and in his contribution today, made it very clear that productivity is the worker's best friend. He pointed to where the member for Fraser had done research on wage cases in Western Australia, my home state, which justified his argument that productivity adds to wage increases and lowers youth unemployment.


The 'Peel Away the Mask' article, which was first produced in 2001—and has since been revised—and which reflects the unemployment situation in the Peel area of my electorate in Canning, has a lot to say about youth unemployment in the Peel region. Youth unemployment in the Peel region is quite serious because it is always above the national and state average. A lot of this is to do with the exact thing that we are talking about today: young people getting a job where they can actually grow their wages and conditions. 


Every member opposite—and we know why they are in here—has to belong to a union. You cannot be a member of the Labor Party unless you are a member of a union. As soon as you talk about productivity or flexibility, the first thing those opposite do is to start going on about Work Choices or taking away workers' entitlements or making sure that they get less.



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—



Dr Leigh interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Mr RANDALL:
  I do note that the member for Perth is not even on the speakers list. If she could get herself on the list and have a go, it would be far more effective than just yelling interjections. If the member for Fraser put himself on the list as well, we could see him try and counter the argument that the member for Hume put—based on the member for Fraser's own research. 


Youth unemployment is something that is of concern to everybody in this country, but you cannot increase youth participation unless you improve productivity. As soon as you say 'productivity', those opposite will say that it is an excuse for lowering workers' terms and conditions. It is not, because the whole basis of productivity is doing something smarter and more efficiently. Let us use a very simple example so people can absorb it. If you are an old-fashioned farmer and you have a horse and a plough, you are not going to be very productive. If you are old-fashioned farmer and you have two horses and a plough with some wheels on it, you will be more productive. If you are an old farmer and you have an old Fordson tractor, you are going to cover a lot more ground.


It is all about using innovation and technology to be more productive, and this is what this bill today is about. It is to encourage workers, before seeking a pay rise, to talk about what is on offer. We are not talking about quite reasonable pay rises in terms of CPI. Just because somebody has put up an ambit claim, you cannot expect an employer, a mum-and-dad employer who is trying to run a business with half a dozen people, to say, 'Oh, yeah, you can have everything you have asked for.' It just does not work like that. You would send those businesses broke. In fact, you would put young people in particular out of work, because you would price them out of a job. At the end of the day, productivity is the keynote to growth in this country and it is the hallmark of anything that we want to do to address Australia's debt.


The reason that those opposite oppose this is that they are told to oppose it by their union bosses. I will give you an example. The train drivers in the Pilbara, who essentially only work six months of the year, are on something likes $300,000—for working six months of the year. Have a guess what is happening—companies like Rio and BHP are now putting in driverless trains because those drivers have priced themselves out of the market. I say to those opposite: if you are going to be sensible about this, think about what you can bring to the business. 


Earlier I heard one of the members over there—the member for Bendigo, I think—saying: 'All they want to do is make people work harder.' They do not want to make people work harder; they want to make them work smarter. If you work smarter, you can do more in the same period of time. That is Australia's unbelievable advantage in the region.


I will quote from the member for Hume's article of 1 December:


… targeted innovation will add to productivity across labour and capital, particularly in government services. Whether it is applying new IT technologies, establishing new management practices or simple measures to increase workplace flexibility … innovation is the cheapest lunch of all.


So I say: this whole bill is based on the fact that, yes, bargaining and all the things we have talked about are very important, as long as they get those steps right, but the real key to this legislation is: yes, wages can be increased, as long as you can be productive.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, and the member will have leave to continue his remarks when the debate is resumed.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (13:30):  Prime Minister Tony Abbott once told this parliament:


The Australian people want a government that is competent and trustworthy. The test of a trustworthy government is: does it keep its commitments?


Far from keeping its commitments, this government has told more tall tales than Herodotus—but, unlike that great Greek liar, it only took a few months, not centuries, for this government's dishonesty to become powerfully obvious.


The government promised it would shed 12,000 jobs from the Australian Public Service. That would have been bad enough, but it turns out to have been a ruse. They are cutting 16,500 jobs—4,500 more jobs lost—and not a peep from Senator Seselja, I might add.


And then there was the promise that none of those job cuts would come through forced redundancies. The Prime Minister looked public servants in the eye and told them, 'I really want to stress that we are not talking about forced redundancies. We are talking about not replacing everyone who leaves, that's all.' That promise has been broken several times over, starting with over 44 sackings at Treasury and 75 staff from the Australian Valuation Office, and I do not doubt there will be more to come.


This government has broken its promise of a surplus in every year by doubling the deficit. It has broken its promise of 'no cuts to health or education', with $80 billion of cuts to health and education. It has broken its promise on a 25 megabits per second NBN by 2016, and broken its promise not to cut the ABC and SBS—maybe because ABC Fact Check has just added four new broken promises to their broken promise tracker. He denies his broken promises, which reminds you of Tennessee Williams: 'The only thing worse than a liar is a liar who is also a hypocrite.'

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:18):  The year 2014 is the year that Tony Abbott wants us to forget. Unfortunately, this is the year which Australians will remember for the rest of their lives. The proposition which I advance today as a matter of public importance is that this is not what the Prime Minister says is a year of achievement, laughable as that is; this has been a year of underachievement from a government which has let down the Australian people. Every government gets elected with the goodwill of the Australian people, but no government has burnt its bridges so quickly. When we think back to 12 months ago, the Treasurer had goaded Holden into going, losing thousands of jobs, and now we find out it was so he could clear the decks for a free trade agreement. But the list of job losses in this country is far longer than just Holden: Rio at Gove; Toyota; Alcoa; Forge in Western Australia; thousands of more jobs in small businesses and manufacturing; and defence construction. The renewable energy industry is at risk. When the Australian people were beginning to worry at the start of this year about the issue of jobs, sadly confirmed in the last few days by the national accounts figures and unemployment numbers, we discovered that in March this year the Prime Minister's plan for jobs was to come up with the idea of knights and dames. It has been a most extraordinary year.



A government member interjecting—  




Mr SHORTEN:
  It was funny! Just for the record, the Labor Party will have no problems debating this policy curly question at our national conference. We have opposed the imperial honours system since 1916. Today is the end of a shocking week, in a dreadful year, of a terrible government. This bunch opposite behave in a dishonest fashion. They have no fidelity between their election promises and what they do in government. They are out of touch—a point I will come back to—and clearly they are incompetent.


Let us think about some of the earlier months of 2014, because the problem with this government is an embarrassment of riches to oppose and every week there are problems—I don't know; maybe it is a cunning strategy by the government—they make bigger blunders the following week so you forget about their blunders the previous week. But remember the Commission of Audit.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  A good document, the good member for Kooyong said. Indeed, it was their plan B. They put it out before they put out plan A. However, I do not expect a single Victorian Liberal member to be saying that it is a good document because, at least, when it came to defending their Senate position in Western Australia, defending the Liberal Party in South Australia and indeed in Tasmania, the Commission of Audit sat on it and sat on it, so as not to compromise their electoral chances. They did not show that same courtesy to the former jewel in the Liberal crown, in Victoria. They could not wait. In the first week, they said, 'Dear Denis, just before I come down and hug you, I want to impose a petrol tax.'


When you look at the issue of underachievement, no discussion on the underachievement of this government could possibly go unnoticed without looking at who gets the trophy in the member of this gang for the biggest underachiever? Possibly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs gets the top banana—easily the best-performing woman in the Abbott cabinet. She is going so well that the PMO has decided to make her take excess baggage to Lima—the Minister for Trade!


Joe Hockey—what a year he has had! Two great publications—he launched a budget and he launched his book. It is hard to know which one his colleagues liked more. And then of course we had his John Farnham style tour—trying one more time to sell his rotten budget. And we will never forget the gig he had with Jacqui Lambie—that did not end so well! And of course Joe Hockey has memorably given us the arguments that the strong economic reformers need. 'A GP tax, that's just a couple of beers'—that line worked! 'Pensioners have never had it so good'—I would not go there again, Joe! And don't worry about the petrol tax—because 'poor people don't drive cars'!


And in the other House there are some contributors. Senator Brandis made two noteworthy contributions. The first was 'the right to be a bigot'—memorable! And then there was that interview on metadata, which was possibly the most awkward bit of television since the 70-second staring competition the Prime Minister had with Mark Riley! And then of course we had 'old charm offensive' himself, Senator Abetz—more offence than charm—bobbing up on The Project. That must have been a set up—I have heard the expression 'first-time guest', but he was a first-time viewer! And he gave us some 1950s medical science. And then there was the Minister for the Environment—whose title is sheer irony. He has defended the Antarctic walrus, the Tasmanian tiger and any other animal he finds on Wikipedia! We had of course the Minister for Immigration, working relentlessly on 'Operation Self-promotion'! And then there was the Minister for Communications. He is cutting the ABC and the SBS. I think it might be time to hang up that leather jacket, Malcolm! And speaking of communicators there is Christopher Pyne. He has been texting in his CV to be the Minister for Communications—or perhaps the 'minister for unsolicited communications'! And this is the mob who want to 'put the adults back in charge'!


Of course, 2015 promises to be a potential follow-on from this year of underachievement. Will Senator Johnston be the Minister for Defence? Will he keep his 'rhetorically flourishing canoe' up his 'unparliamentary creek'? We know what Stuart Robert is cheering for! Will Barnaby Joyce visit Shepparton—or has he wiped it off his mental map like Whyalla? And then of course there is the longest 'position vacant' stint—will we have an Assistant Treasurer again in Australia? And so we look promisingly to the contenders—the colt from Kooyong, the member for Moncrieff or that fast-finishing country thoroughbred the member for Wannon?


All of this would be even funnier if the following were not true: Australia cannot afford a year like the one that has just passed. We cannot afford to have unemployment at 6.2 per cent when Labor left it at 5.7 per cent. We cannot afford to have a 13-year high in youth unemployment, which is now at 14 per cent. There are 42,000 more unemployed people around the country following the government's damaging budget. We certainly cannot afford to have another year of the Prime Minister's broken promises. Australians are better than this government. Australians deserve better than this government. We need a government with vision and a plan for the future, not a government that is adrift both domestically and internationally.


Labor in 2014 is standing strong for fairness. We have been standing very strong. We have been defending Medicare. We have been fighting for families who are under pressure from the increased costs of living. We are fighting for a fair pension—and we will keep fighting till we make sure that your cuts do not go through. Dignity in retirement, we believe, is a birthright of all Australians. And yes, despite faux mini-me Churchill on the other side, we will keep fighting the government's unfair changes to universities. Throughout 2015 we will outline our plan for the future—a plan for inclusive growth and a smart, skilful and fair Australia. We do not believe that growth and fairness are mutually irreconcilable; in fact, each drives the other.


We certainly cannot afford to have the destruction of confidence that we have seen. The national account figures yesterday are a most concerning development. This government has slammed us into an income recession. We are dangerously reliant on iron ore and our minerals, with very little else in our economy to help us. We are seeing wages and profits contract in this country under this government. How long will this government keep blaming everything and everyone else for their inability to do their day job? We have seen higher taxes under this government. Even some of the blue-blood supporters of the Liberal Party, surely, are not excited by the fact that they now pay over 50c in the dollar in tax because of this government. Above all, no-one believes in their multi-millionaire paid parental leave schemes—I know that, in their beating hearts, the government desperately want us to succeed in convincing the Prime Minister to drop that unloved scheme of his.


Let's look at the real challenges of next year. Under this government the deficit has doubled and all the projections are looking grim. The government have colluded with the Greens to extend the credit card.



Government members interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  They laugh! They probably do not even know what their leader is doing. They are cutting public investment. The reason we regard it as a matter of public importance to debate the year of underachievement is that I do not believe there is a single Australian who is not disappointed by the Abbott government—from their conservative boosters, right through the spectrum of Australian opinion. We on this side understands that growth comes from extending opportunity—from making sure that kids can go to university, right through to making sure that pensioners get a fair deal—and we will promote this next year.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (15:28):  I can understand the frustration of the Leader of the Opposition because this is the first year in three years where he has not been able to stab the back of a Prime Minister! I just want to say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he were as good at policy as he is at scripted one-liners then maybe his party would not have had its worst result in 100 years. I just want to remind the Leader of the Opposition that the worst day in government is better than the best day in opposition.


We in government are making a difference. This is the 70th year of the Liberal Party and it is 75 years since our founder, Robert Menzies, first became Prime Minister. And when he established our party he did so believing in a progressive party, one that believed in the power of the individual, in free enterprise, in helping those who cannot help themselves, in ensuring smaller and more efficient government. And when you look at our record over just the last year, we meet all those criteria, and we excel in them.


If you want to talk about the performance of individual ministers, let me go through some of their achievements, starting with the Treasurer, the Minister for Small Business, and the Minister for Finance, who have led our economic team. They have reduced the overall tax burden for Australians by removing that terrible carbon tax, a $9 billion hit on the Australian economy and a $550 hit on all Australian families. And what about the mining tax? That is removing $50 billion for the budget bottom line. It was supposed to produce all this revenue, which never eventuated, but what it did do is introduce the dark spectre of sovereign risk into our country.


And what about the 96 unenacted but announced tax and superannuation measures that those opposite introduced when they were in government, only to bring uncertainty to the budgetary situation of so many of our economies? And what about the 76 bodies we have abolished to ensure that government is now streamlined and more efficient? And what about the successful sale of government enterprises to ensure that government is not both the regulator and the operator? There is no better example than the sale of Medibank Private for $5.7 billion—$1 billion more than was expected. And now we have scoping studies into Australian Hearing, into the ASIC registry, and into Defence Housing, because we believe that government should not be in businesses where the private sector can be.


And of course there is the most important job of budget repair: $300 billion of fiscal consolidation over the next decade. Politics, according to Bismarck, is the art of the possible. So we have to negotiate with a difficult Senate from a minority position. But we are doing it successfully, thanks to the good work of our economic team. And what about for small business? As the minister told us during question time, more than 500,000 jobs in small business were lost over the term of the Rudd, Gillard and Rudd governments. We have introduced a whole suite of measures, including more than 400,000 small businesses that will not have to go through the PAYG system. This has ensured that we have had tens of thousands of new small business registrations. 


In my own area of deregulation we set ourselves an ambitious target of $1 billion a year for cutting red tape. And what have we done? We have actually surpassed that. We have more than doubled it, with $2.1 billion worth of announced measures to cut red and green tape. And some of them are so important, including for small business, for agriculture and our farmers, and right across the economy. So, it has been a very good year when it comes to our economic measures.


What about the environment? The Minister for the Environment has got his $2.5 billion Direct Action Plan through the Senate. He has got his Green Army proposal through the Senate. We have a good position on the Renewable Energy Target, which we believe should be a 20 per cent target. And of course he has abolished the carbon tax. That is a proud record when it comes to the environment.


And what about health? Those opposite talk about the cuts to health. I will talk about the boost to health: a more than 40 per cent increase in funding over the forward estimates, $5.3 billion extra money for hospitals and health over the forward years. And what about the changes we are adopting to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, through our announcement that processes, systems and products that have been approved overseas can come into Australia if they have been done by a trusted international jurisdiction. That is good news, because it means that medical devices and medicines can now get to market quicker, and we can have more choice for consumers at lower cost. And of course our medical research future fund, which is a great development, plays to our strength, because if we can get medical research right then we can find the cures for the future.


And what about education? There is a 37 per cent increase—a $4.9 billion funding increase over the forward years, when those opposite never would have fully funded Gonski, and we have increased our education funding. And of course there are the important higher education changes, which have been strongly supported right across the tertiary sector.


And what about in infrastructure, where there has been a $50 billion spend?—the Pacific Highway, the Bruce Highway, the WestConnex and, we hope, the East West Link in Victoria. And after 50 years of indecision we now have a second airport on the cards for New South Wales—again, a very important decision. Again, we are making a difference when it comes to infrastructure, not just with the big projects but also the $500 million for black spots and the $2.5 billion for Roads to Recovery.


When it comes to the NBN, over the last year, we have more than doubled the number of businesses and homes who actually have access to the NBN. It was over budget and it was slow in the rollout under those opposite. But we have taken that performance and reshaped it with a much better scheme under the leadership of our Minister for Communications.


And what about trade? What about those three free trade agreements which are the hallmark of this government's achievements in just its first year? It took six years for those opposite to diddle and daddle and produce no results. We have an agreement with Korea that will lead to 98 or 99 per cent of our products going into Korea tariff-free over the future years. What about Japan? And of course, what about China? There have been big gains in agriculture, with the abolition of tariffs for beef, dairy and horticulture. And what about in resources, where we are seeing coking coal and thermal coal tariffs come off, and aluminium oxide tariffs come off? And what about in services?—70 per cent of the Australian economy but just 17 per cent of our exports. And of course now education, health, insurance and financial services can actually get in to the Chinese economy, where they could not previously. This is a groundbreaking agreement, one we are proud of and one that will create jobs into the future.


And what about on foreign policy? The minister for foreign affairs has done a brilliant job with the new Colombo Plan. Under her initiative, 1,300 undergraduates from Australia are going to experience what life is like in the region. They will be ambassadors for Australia, just like the Colombo Plan more than 50 years ago under Percy Spender was for 40,000 people.


And what about the way we have handled the tough issues of defence and national security? There has been new counter-terrorism legislation, thanks to the good work of the Attorney-General, boosting funding and support for the Defence Forces, given that those opposite reduced Defence spending to the lowest level since 1938 at just 1.49 per cent of GDP—and what a disgrace that was.


Of course, we are there when it counts, trying to defeat ISIL—or ISIS, Daesh, or whatever you are going to call the group—in Iraq and in Syria, with our deployment over there of our air force and our special forces, because Australia will not shirk those challenges when they are critical to security here at home. We have seen the good work of our Federal Police, ASIO and our other intelligence services in trying to foil attempts to hurt Australian citizens here at home.


And who can forget our success when it comes to border protection? Those opposite ridiculed us by saying we could not stop the boats, that you could not turn back the boats and that you could not do so without damaging the relationship with Indonesia. Who remembers the then leader of the government, Kevin Rudd, talking about 'Konfrontasi' with Indonesia if we would actually go down the path of the 'turn back the boats' policy. But we have been successful, thanks to the fantastic work of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and his officials. We have succeeded where those have not.


I want to finish with the G20, because that was Australia's moment in the sun, in Brisbane. Eighty-five per cent of the world's GDP here, 75 per cent of the world's trade and two-thirds of the world's population. They saw Australia at its finest. They saw Australia and they produced outcomes—whether it was in infrastructure, growth, tax, shadow banking and a whole series of areas. We have made a difference with the G20, thanks to the leadership of the Prime Minister.


I am proud of what we have achieved over the last year. We have succeeded where those opposite have failed, and they will see the result at the election in 2016.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:38):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I want to take the opportunity on this last day of sittings to wish you and your family a happy Christmas and New Year. 


Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you were in the chair the other day when I told the story of my little Louis, who helps himself to the mini Magnums. I do not normally share stories of my family, but today's topic brought to mind another one, and it is about my middle child, Joe. I was going into his room and I was finding that it was getting stinkier and stinkier. I thought, 'Here comes adolescence; his body is changing.' No, it was not that. It was in fact a sandwich—I think it was a sandwich. It was something in his schoolbag that had been there for so many weeks that it was actually unidentifiable. It was mush wrapped in gladwrap, which was leaking liquid—and it was hot to the touch.


The only thing that stays in the schoolbag longer than an uneaten sandwich is a school report—that is, a bad school report. At this time of year you know that, the longer it takes for the school report to get from the schoolbag to the kitchen table, the worse it is going to be. And, really, that did make me think that this week we are doing all of this analysis of what has been happening this year and how we have been doing. I think it is fair to say that, if we did an analysis—a report card—of how this government has done in the last year, it would not be a very good report card.


The Prime Minister promised before the election—he made a number of promises, but let us just take one, for example—that 'Kevin Rudd and I are on an absolute unity ticket when it comes to school funding.' He said that on 4 August. Christopher Pyne, the Manager of Government Business, said, 'You can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school.' How did they live up to that one? Well, Labor committed $14.65 billion to Gonski school education funding. The Prime Minister has guaranteed—guess what—$2.8 billion. The difference between almost $15 billion and less than $3 billion—not a very good grasp of mathematical concepts there.


What is the consequence of the Prime Minister's poor grasp of maths? Let us hear from David Gonski: 


There needs to be a commitment to a properly funded, needs-based funding system and a failure to do so will be to our detriment. 


Yes, it will be. It will be not just to the detriment of the individual children who will miss out—and there will be individual children who miss out—but to the detriment of this nation if we do not invest in early education, primary school, infant school and indeed high school.


Let us turn to science. How is the Prime Minister doing when it comes to science? What is the biggest scientific debate in Australia, and indeed globally, today? A colourless, weightless gas—it is this little thing called climate change! Here is something from Lord Deben, the former environment minister in the government of Thatcher, the hero of the Prime Minister:


""I haven’t met an Australian who is not deeply ashamed of this government, most of whom voted for Abbott,"" he said. ""How can you say 'we don’t mind what 97% of scientists tell us, we are going to stick two fingers up and do it anyway'?""


That is really what we saw at the G20. We saw a government determined not to discuss climate science. And you add to that cuts to the CSIRO: $115 million from CSIRO funding; losing 400 researchers, including some of the best known internationally; and 300 positions cut as part of an internal restructure. Nobel laureate Professor Peter Doherty said:


Cutting resources for science, technology, innovation and education is a sure way of accelerating our transition to a Third-World economy.


So he has not been rated very well on maths, our Prime Minister. He has not been rated very well on science. Economics—that is a whole other area. He said he would 'end the debt and deficit'. He has doubled the deficit. He has given debt unlimited, in a dirty deal with the Greens. He has $20 billion for a Paid Parental Leave scheme that no-one wants. He gave $9 billion to the Reserve Bank—unasked for and unneeded. A billion dollars foregone in profit-shifting tax evasion from multinational companies. He has given up the revenue from carbon pricing, but he has kept the compensation. What a disaster it has been.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (15:43):  It is a great delight for me to be able to stand in this chamber and speak on this motion. I do find it slightly ironic that those opposite have proposed a motion about our underachievement. It is ironic to me, because it is something, I think, that they know a little bit about. Really, from those opposite, it comes as some high praise. But I think that, in order to properly consider this motion about underachievement, one needs to measure it against a particular standard. I can think of no better standard than that of the member for Lilley.


The member for Lilley promised in this place—and outside of this place—a surplus on more than 400 occasions. In fact, he inherited a $20 billion surplus, and yet delivered in his time as Treasurer over $190 billion worth of deficits and bequeathed to this government another $123 billion worth of deficits going forward. What does this mean? It means increased debt, and on that debt you pay interest. That interest payment is coming in currently at $1 billion a month, which, of course, means about $12 billion a year, and it is going to go up, if we do not reduce the debt, to around $3 billion a month. But we are focused on reducing the debt, and I will have more to say about some of our achievements later.


Given that I have had some recent experience looking at foreign investment as chair of the House Standing Committee on Economics, I think it is important to draw the House's attention to underachievement in this particular area. Across the evidence that we received in our committee, it came to my attention that, in 2008, the Assistant Treasurer, Chris Bowen, delivered a quiet press release just before Christmas that took away the ability of the Foreign Investment Review Board to screen temporary residents from needing to go to the Foreign Investment Review Board for that screening. It meant that it was very difficult for the Foreign Investment Review Board to conduct proper audit and compliance on temporary residents. They did this very quietly. They did not announce it. They did it quietly, and this led to a very significant change in our foreign investment framework.


Realising that they had made a tremendously significant mistake and hearing this from the local community, they promised before the 2010 election that they would do something about it. Senator Nick Sherry made grand proclamations, as Assistant Treasurer, in a press release, that they were going to restore the screening arrangements for temporary residents to have to go to FIRB for the purchase of existing homes. He also promised a number of other things. Not only did he promise that all temporary residents seeking to purchase an existing property would be brought within FIRB notification—which, of course, they had got rid of—he also promised that they would have a better compliance regime, better enforcement measures and new civil penalties, and that real estate agents would be proactively monitored. He said:


I want to make sure that all arms of the Australian government are working optimally together to secure prosecutions where breaches occur.


So, what happened? There has been not one court prosecution since 2006 and not one illegally purchased property divested since under order 2007. When the next Assistant Treasurer came along after the election he took on responsibility for putting in place this plan. And who was that person? That person was Bill Shorten, and under Bill Shorten not much happened. The civil penalty regime did not happen. The capital gains penalty did not happen. The checks on real estate agents did not happen. Closer enforcement links with the Director of Public Prosecutions did not happen, and data matching with the states did not progress beyond initial trials. About the only thing that did happen was they introduced a hotline. So if you want to talk about underachievement in this place you need to look further than the Leader of the Opposition who brought forward this motion. He is the biggest underachiever of them all.


We have had significant achievements in government. In the short time that we have been in government, and inheriting the legacy that we did, we have been able to get rid of the carbon tax, which reduces the costs on famlies; we have stopped the boats; we have got rid of the mining tax; we have been building for the future with our record infrastructure investment of more than $50 billion; and we have concluded three free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China. We are trying to get on with the job of long-term structural reform, but we are being blocked by those opposite.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:49):  No government in recent times has so badly let down the Australian people, broken more promises and betrayed the trust of all Australians, been so arrogant and out of touch with the Australian people, been more shambolic and so quickly lost the support of the Australian people than has the Abbott government. Public opinion reflects that, as did the Victorian state election only a week ago. Despite the denials of members opposite and other government and coalition members across Australia, the fact is that the Australian people rejected this government's, the Abbott government's, policies. The Victorians did not even want the Prime Minister to visit Victoria in the course of that election. So toxic was the Prime Minister and his government that they were barred from going to Victoria.


The Abbott government are a government that still acts as though they in opposition. They do not know how to govern, having no national strategy of their own but simply dancing to the tune of the right-wing extremists both within and outside of their ranks, clinging to simplistic three-word slogans and policies that they used in opposition and blaming all of their woes on everyone else but themselves Those woes include—and hopefully time will allow me to go through all these because five minutes is not a long time—failure to manage the nation's finances by more than doubling the deficit over the forward estimates, failure to bring in their harsh $7 GP tax, failure to get in their unfair $5 billion plus cuts to higher education and bring in $100,000 university fees, failure to get support for their unfair $50,000 Paid Parental Leave scheme, failure to get their cruel pension cuts through parliament.


They also failed to amend section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and had to humiliatingly back away from it. They failed to have their own fuel tax get through parliament in its proper form and had to use the back door in order to get it through. They failed to deliver Indigenous Australians the promises they made to them, instead cutting $534 million of funding to them. They failed to deliver the Gonski education funding and instead cut $30 billion of funding to education. They failed to bring down the cost of living. They failed to reduce unemployment, with unemployment being 5.7 per cent when they came to office and now being 6.2 per cent. They failed to support Australia's young people, with youth unemployment being the highest it has been in 13 years. They failed to create the one million jobs that they promised they would create. They failed to build the 12 new submarines in Adelaide, deliberately breaking another pre-election promise. They failed to honour the Renewable Energy Target and failed to even get crossbench support when they tried to wreck it. This was a double failure on the same issue. They failed to protect the environment by weakening environmental laws, including cutting $484 million from the Landcare programs 


They failed to implement a real climate change policy. They failed to even mention the words 'climate change' for almost a year in this chamber, and the environment minister has been missing when it comes to the environment and his real responsibilities. They failed to support Australia's science community by cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding, and not even appointing a science minister. They failed to protect the jobs of Australia's autoworkers—one of the most shameful acts of this government was daring the auto companies to leave Australia. They failed to support Australian industries, as the Treasurer himself admitted only on Tuesday, and they sacrificed Australian industry in order to push through free trade agreements. 


Perhaps the most notable failure from the government was its woeful performance at the G20 meeting in Brisbane where they failed to capitalise on the opportunity to show real statesmanship on matters of international significance. Instead the Prime Minister was being ridiculed for his shirtfront comments, and he complained to the international community about not being able to get his own policies through his own parliament. It is time the Abbott government took responsibility for its own incompetence and its own failures to understand that the Australian people will not be treated as fools. A government cannot lie its way into office and then expect people to swallow its spin, its excuses and more of its lies. This government—the Abbott government—has failed to honour its election promises, it has lost the trust and confidence of the Australian people, and even the confidence of its own backbench. Its election eve promises of no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no changes to the GST and no cuts to the ABC and SBS will haunt it through to the next election. Indeed, Australians do want a government that says what its means and means what it says—this government simply does not live up to their expectations. (Time expired)

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (15:54):  I was absolutely delighted to hear the member for Sydney refer to that great woman, Margaret Thatcher. I thought I might begin with a quote from Margaret Thatcher herself, given that she was a woman who truly understood achievement—which, of course, is the topic of the MPI here today. She said:


Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's a day you've had everything to do and you've done it.


Throughout history, the finest minds have attempted to define achievement—is it more about persistence than force, is failure a necessary precursor? Of course, the postmodern relativists on the other side of the House can define it however they want. But in the real world where I worked and lived before coming into this place, there is a clearly defined space between achievement and underachievement. The last government defined its achievements by the number of bills it passed, the inches of regulation it imposed, the volumes of reports it produced and the number of new agencies it established. As I go around my electorate I can honestly say no-one gives a hang about any of those measures. The only exception I see is the small number of noisy rent seekers whose wallets were lined by the ALP's incessant waste on pork barrelling rorts, like the RDA fund overseen by the member for Ballarat. As someone who comes from the private sector, where outcomes are all that matter, I am more interested in measures that actually have positive impacts on people's lives. Let us look at the scoreboard: 40,000 boat arrivals and over 1,100 deaths became almost zero and years of inaction on trade agreements driven by the incessant lobbying by ALP-focused rent seekers turned to three massive trade agreements that will drive profound, positive and lasting change to our economy. Dysfunctional taxes were abolished with sharp reductions in costs for businesses and households. Cranes started appearing on the skyline in major cities. We refocussed the NBN, finding massive opportunities for efficiencies and acceleration. A structural deficit which was driven, we are told by Deloittes, by $80 billion of windfall revenues is on its way to zero.


I want to focus on one overarching achievement, which I believe trumps all others—we are beginning to reverse the downward pressure on incomes that was set in motion by Labor's deeply flawed economic policies. Rising real incomes across middle Australia have been a bedrock of this country since European settlement. They have defined our egalitarian culture by sharing prosperity across the nation and down generations, provided opportunities for all of us no matter what our background or heritage, delivered widespread prosperity to recent immigrants as well as fifth-generation Australians alike and delivered rising real wages without driving people out of work. But Labor put this at risk. We saw productivity collapse. We lost focus on doing things smarter across everything we do because Labor told their friends they could do and they could have whatever they wanted, and they gave their mates want they wanted. Nowhere was this worse than in the public sector where Labor for many years stifled innovation in the interests of its increasingly powerful public sector union officials. 


Most economists will tell you that the greatest opportunity for doing things smarter in Australia is in the public sector, but Labor's new left-wing powerbase was never going to take any notice of that. Unprecedented commodity prices and currency levels, which as I said Deloittes tells us delivered an $80 billion windfall, were wasted on frivolous and sometimes deadly government programs. In contrast, the coalition is laying the foundation for a new era of rising incomes and prosperity. We are doing this by asking ourselves how to do things better, by pushing every dollar of government spending harder in health, in education, in welfare and in infrastructure, whilst still continuing to prudently increase our spending in these areas. By not conceding to the siren call of the rent seekers that the ALP listen to, delivering greater prosperity, opportunity and choice for generation after generation of Australians is a noble calling and one the coalition is up to.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (15:59):  This has been for the Prime Minister a year of underachievement. Every government does have the best intentions when they come to power; they have an agenda that they want to see achieved. I am relieved that this Prime Minister has been an underachiever. I am relieved that his Liberal agenda has not successfully passed the Senate and that we have not seen a number of their nasty measures introduced. 


I am relieved that he has been an underachiever, and that the Liberal agenda on his plans for education have so far not been achieved. His plan for education would have seen $100,000 degrees introduced into our universities—therefore cutting a generation of younger people or mature-age students from attending university.


And the Prime Minister, as well as his party, is completely delusional if they do not believe that their plan for higher education would not see fewer people enrolling in university. The simple fact that they have put deregulation on the table and are trying so hard to get this legislation through has already seen universities reporting that enrolments are down. People do not want to be saddled with debt for life, and that is what we will see if this government ever achieves its dream for higher education. 


I am relieved that the government has also been an underachiever in achieving its plan—its Liberal agenda—for health. Billions of dollars have been cut from our hospitals. This government has also not achieved the watering-down or weakening—basically breaking the back of—universal healthcare by introducing the GP tax. This tax is designed to do one thing. Do not be fooled by the trickery of this government saying that this money will go towards health research. This government is trying to break Medicare by reducing the incentive for GPs to bulk bill. I know, from talking to doctors in my electorate, that it would mean the closure of a number of urgent care centres in regional hospitals in Victoria. Those hospitals are currently bulk billed by doctors—doctors on call, doing a good thing for their community.


So I am relieved that this government has been an underachiever when it comes to the GP tax and they have failed to have that introduced. I am relieved that this government has been an underachiever when it comes to the area of pensions, and that the Senate and the people on this side of the House have continued to block their cruel measures to cut the real wages of pensioners—people who have worked very hard in this country to make sure that we have the prosperity we have today. Yet all we have seen from this government is attacks on their retirement income.


I am relieved that this government has failed to achieve its dream of attacks on young job seekers, forcing them to live on nothing for six months. I am relieved that this government has been an under achiever in forcing young people to live on nothing, yet still expecting them to look for work. I am relieved that this government has again failed in this House to perpetuate a number of the taxes in their shocking budget. What they have achieved—and this does disappoint me—is cuts in jobs. They have cut jobs in the Public Service, making it almost impossible for a number of areas of the Public Service to function. The fact is that if you want a functioning Public Service you need a certain number of public servants in proportion to the people we have in this country, yet we have seen, through their cuts, that parts of our Public Service have started to become dysfunctional. 


It is disappointing that they have achieved that. It is disappointing that we have lost so many good, well-paying jobs in this country because of this government's inability to support innovation in industry. We have seen it in Holden and Toyota, to name just two—and SPC. What the government has achieved, through its failure to support SPC, is another independent being elected at the state level in the area of Shepparton. I congratulate the people of Shepparton for calling the coalition out on their inability to support that community. 


This government has also achieved the reunification of the Labor movement. Through their constant attacks on working people, and the unions that represent them, they have achieved the reunification of the Labor movement fighting as one. Dan Andrews, who is the new Victorian Labor Premier said, on election night, 'This election was about working people and it was about unions. And the next election will be about working people and it will be about unions and a Labor vision.'

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (16:04):  I must say that I was a bit perplexed when I read the title for this MPI—the Prime Minister's year of underachievement. It had me scratching my head. Then I thought, 'Let's look at this from a Labor perspective. Maybe from a Labor perspective we can understand why they have come up with this MPI title.' If you were the Leader of the Opposition you would be thinking to yourself: has anyone been knifed this year? No-one has been knifed so that is an underachievement. Have we had a leadership challenge? No. Another underachievement.


Have we had a game of musical chairs with ministerial portfolios and parliamentary secretaries? No, we have not. So I suppose that is another under achievement. Look at it from the perspective of the Leader of the Opposition. When he was in government, what did he expect, coming up to Christmas. He started off as Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation in 2010. His 2011 Christmas present was the employment and workplace relations portfolio. But 2012 was a bit of a sad Christmas for him because there was no change. But what a year 2013 was! First he became Minister for Education in just enough time to cut $1.2 billion out of education funding. Then he got the top job; it was a good year. The knife went in and it was successful. He became the top person in the Labor ranks. 


So if achievement is knifing, we have underachieved. In the area of portfolio changes we have underachieved. What about debt? I suppose you could look at it from a Labor perspective. Labor presided over the fastest deterioration of our debt position in modern history. What have we done? We have tried to repair that. We have tried to restore it. Let's go on. Let's look at free trade agreements. What did Labor do? What was Labor's record of achievement there?



A government member:  Lots of trips.




Mr TEHAN:
  There were lots of trips. I just cannot remember, though, an FTA with Japan. I cannot remember one with South Korea. I cannot remember one with China. I suppose we have underachieved because we have actually got free trade agreements.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  I think they probably tried with Norfolk Island but they probably failed there too. 


When it comes to immigration, what happened there? Thankfully, there have been no deaths at sea. Thankfully, the boats have stopped. So, when you start to look at it through the Labor prism, you can see why they would say that this has been a year of underachievement.




Mr Zappia:
  It's been boring.




Mr TEHAN:
  Yes, it has been boring. We have actually been doing things. We have been successfully getting the nation's future established. We are getting the nation's future established.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  Those opposite can interject all they like, but you do not like the truth. You know that for six years you underachieved. That was all you did. What you see as achievements we do not see as achievements. What we see as achievements over this side is fixing the budget mess you left us. It is getting rid of taxes which hurt this economy—getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax. It was the government that was defining what was occurring with our immigration policy, not people smugglers. We made sure that we were setting up our nation's future by implementing and signing three of the most significant free trade agreements that this country has ever seen. That will redefine our exports into the future. Now, in the next year, we will have white papers into fixing the Federation and fixing the tax system. I give you this warning over there: we have not stopped. We will continue to make sure that we not only ensure that our current living standards remain but that those of our children and our grandchildren remain and progress. (Time expired)

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (16:09):  I am really happy to follow my friend, the member for Wannon. I know he is a fun guy, but he is a Victorian fun guy in denial. He was around. He actually witnessed the last election and he is trying to come into this place and say, 'We're standing on our achievements.' I am sure he did not say that too loudly in the Victorian election. When we come into this place, we are often spoken to about truth in politics. If you look at what has been achieved by that mob opposite in the last year, what they have been able to achieve has gone against everything they promised to be able to do for the Australian community.


People in the gallery will probably remember this. On the night before the election, the Prime Minister stared down the barrel of a TV camera, no doubt with his blue tie on, and said, 'I promise not to cut health. I promise not to cut education. There will be no change to the GST. There will be no change to pensions. And there will be no cuts to the ABC or SBS.' Over the last 12 months, they have delivered change in each of those areas. They have tried to repudiate everything they promised.


If you want to make a promise—this is a lesson to those opposite—and you do not want to keep it, do not do it on national TV, because four million people see it. It was on the ABC. Sometimes these things do unravel on them. Just think about it. Tony was doing all that stuff that night. What if he stood up and said, 'I will introduce an unfair GP tax. I will make you pay $100,000 for a university degree. I will slug motorists with a petrol tax. I will slash family payments. And I will cut $80 billion from schools and hospitals'? I wonder what the reaction would have been the next day for that election. That is precisely what they have done. They have delivered on that. They have brought a budget down to do that. There is only one thing stopping that from being achieved: us and the crossbenchers, whom they cannot convince to follow their unfair budget measures.


There are some achievements that we do need to refer to. This budget has produced change in our economy. Unlike what has been said by those opposite, I do not think these changes are something that you would want to go around crowing about. The unemployment rate has risen from 5.9 to 6.2 per cent since the budget. We have 42,000 more people unemployed. Jobs growth has slowed to around one-third of what it was at the beginning of the year. There has been no creation of full-time jobs. Tragically, youth unemployment has now reached a 13-year high. And what did we hear this week? There has been a lot of crowing over there about the free trade agreement. By the way, we actually support the free trade agreement on this side. But what did we hear earlier this year when the Treasurer goaded Holden to either put up or pack up and leave the shores of Australia? What did we hear last week? He had to make hard decisions to achieve a free trade agreement with Korea. He certainly was not honest with the Australian people about that. He was not honest with the people of Holden, whether they work in South Australia or in the component industry, which proliferates many of our electorates. Thousands of people are losing their jobs because he made a decision on the basis that he never communicated to this parliament and never communicated to the Australian people. That is what they believe they have been able to achieve.



I do not think that Australia can afford that as an achievement. If that is going to be their record, that leaves us in a parlous position for the future—a level of insecurity regarding jobs growth and even investment. We saw the figures only this week of what the investment agencies were saying. We have sluggish growth at the moment, despite the shine that the Treasurer was trying to put on this. The fact is that we have sluggish growth. We need to have some real change in our approach. We need to defend institutions that we hold dear. For instance, only one side of this parliament is standing up for Medicare. Only one side of this parliament is standing up for families earning less than $100,000 a year. Only one side of this parliament is standing up against $100,000 degrees. These are things that we believe are necessary. We believe that, unless we— (Time expired)

"Hogan, Kevin, MP",Nats,2014-12-04,"



Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (16:14):  It is a great pleasure of mine to be able to stand up today and talk about the Prime Minister's and, indeed, the government's achievements in our first 12 months, because there are many. I know, Deputy Speaker Whiteley, that you are aware of many of them. I am going to start local and talk about the achievements that this Prime Minister and this government have delivered to my local community.


The first one is that the government said they would, and have, delivered infrastructure and delivered the roads for the 21st century. One of the biggest infrastructure projects in the country is the Pacific Highway dual duplication, not least, because of the fatalities that it will save. Of course, it brings an economic boon while being built, and on completion it brings benefits as well. Deputy Speaker, you may be saying, 'Why are you talking about that, because I'm sure the Labor Party had the same position on this piece of infrastructure?' Well, you would be horribly wrong. At the last election the Labor Party put $3 billion on the table to complete the dual duplication. They wanted to walk away from the 80-20 funding split. So what did we, as an incoming government, do? We said that we would maintain the 80 per cent funding split, and that meant we put an extra $2 billion on the table. That will make sure that that duplication gets completed as quickly as possible. One of the first privileges I had as the member for Page was to turn the sod on a new tender at Pimlico Road, which we had announced within weeks of becoming elected, to make this duplication happen as quickly as we could.


There are a few other things I want to talk about, but let me go quickly to the free trade agreements. What do free trade agreements mean to me? What do free trade agreements mean to my community? I have four examples that I want to talk about. The first one is that I have a dairy cooperative in my electorate called Norco. They employ 600 people. They have told me that they are ecstatic about these free trade agreements. They are a well-managed cooperative, and they already export fresh milk to China, which began this year. After the free trade agreement they rang me and said that they were very happy because new markets for them mean increased returns for, not only them, but, very importantly, the dairy farmers in my community.


The biggest employer in my electorate is the Northern Co-operative Meat Company Ltd. They employ 1,100 people. When I was the candidate for Page, the CEO of that company was very concerned and said, 'One of the biggest issues we have is that we are falling behind countries like Brazil and even America, because they have free trade agreements with some of the countries that we export to', and they were falling behind in a price measurement. Their tariffs were getting lowered quicker. You can imagine the joy for their business with the free trade agreement. They said, 'Now our beef prices will be as competitive, if not cheaper, than our competitors to the countries that we export to.' Those 1,100 jobs are made safer in my community because of the good work done by the minister.


But there is more. My electorate is home to the macadamia industry. It employs, directly, hundreds of people and, indirectly, thousands of people. They export to China, and where we have had our tariffs lowered with the free trade agreements, it is going to make that industry more competitive. I am sure you like blueberries, Deputy Speaker. We have a New South Wales farmer of the year, who is a neighbour of mine, who has seen an opportunity. There is a three- or four-month opportunity where we can be the market that supplies China with blueberries. Again, the tariff on blueberries has been lowered and the farmer's investment is looking all the better for it.


You might think the achievements are contained to agriculture, Deputy Speaker, but you would be wrong. Last Friday I was in Ballina and went to see Kimberly Kampers, a manufacturing company, that makes high-end, very high-quality caravans. Guess what they are happy with? The manager said, 'You've just lowered the tariffs for me to sell my product into, not only Asia, but also the Middle East.' He was very excited. So, it is not just agriculture but also manufacturing companies.


There is more. I am finished, Deputy Speaker. I have pages to go.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Whiteley
):  Order! There is no more, member for Page. The discussion has concluded. I call the Treasurer.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2014-12-04,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney—The Treasurer) (16:19):  by leave—I rise to make a ministerial statement relating to delivering prosperity and growth for Australia.


The National Accounts released this week reiterate the need for Australia to work hard for future economic growth.


Complacency is our enemy.


After an almost unprecedented 23 consecutive years of economic growth, prosperity will not come our way with a policy to do nothing about our future.


Today I reiterate to the parliament the government's plan for strengthening Australia's economic growth and future prosperity.


Our plan will ensure that the high living standards we enjoy today will continue for future generations.


The government is embarking on a range of structural reforms that will help our economy to be more competitive and more resilient in the face of ongoing global economic change.


Without economic reform, the economy will drift.


Without economic reform, the economy will be more exposed to global volatility.


Without economic reform, our future prosperity is not assured.


Since coming to government just over 12 months ago much economic reform has been achieved.


Some of these decisions are delivering benefits now, and others are providing exciting future opportunities.


To start, we have removed the carbon tax, which is already delivering lower electricity prices and helping ease cost-of-living pressures on everyday household budgets.


And lower energy costs, which lower the costs of production, have helped Australian businesses cope with the downside impact of a stubbornly high Australian dollar.


We have also honoured our pledge to abolish the minerals resource rent tax. The mining tax raised just two per cent of its forecast revenue. But the fiscal mess came about because the previous government committed to new spending as if the tax raised 100 per cent of its forecast revenue.


It was a disaster on many fronts but most significantly it discouraged investment and raised sovereign risk around a sector that already has long-term, in-built, price and construction risks.


So now is the right time to create a more positive investment environment for the mining and resource sector. In the last twelve months we have accelerated planning approvals for over 300 major new projects around Australia that will deliver over $1 trillion of output for our country. Many of these projects in the mining and resources sector will help fuel Australia's future growth. 


As we witness the emergence of a new two-billion-people-strong middle class in Asia over the next three decades, what Australia has to potentially export will be in more demand than ever. This is our growth opportunity. By 2030 two-thirds of the global middle class will be residents of the Asia-Pacific region. China currently has a middle class of around 150 million people. This is expected to reach 1 billion people in just 16 years. India's middle class of 200 million people will triple in size over the same period. So during this massive period of unprecedented growth our energy and resources will help build the cities and infrastructure of a rapidly growing India, China, Indonesia and greater Asia. 


Regional demand for our hard commodities, such as iron ore, coal, copper, uranium and gold will not diminish. It will grow substantially. And regional demand for our soft commodities such as wheat, beef, lamb, dairy products and the like will also grow substantially. So now is also the time to diversify and strengthen our other export industries to meet head-on the massive growth in demand out of Asia.


In the case of services industries, which represent 70 per cent of the Australian economy, we have massive export growth potential. Australians involved in businesses that deliver services such as aged care, financial services, health care, construction and engineering, logistics and property services all have big growth opportunities right across Asia. Some service industries like education, tourism and hospitality have realigned over time to focus more on the Asian century of growth. 


But that does not exclude the need for further reform to cope with new and increased competition. That is why, for example, the government's higher education reforms are essential. They not only deliver better quality education services for Australians but provide our campuses with the opportunity to capitalise on the massive growth across the region. In other areas, such as communications, media and entertainment, and sport and culture, we have sophisticated skills that can meet the increasing demands of the world's new affluent consumers in Asia.


Currently services exports represent only 17 per cent of our exports. New growth in services exports is a blue-sky opportunity for many Australians, particularly those involved in our precious small businesses. That is why this year we have successfully negotiated new free trade agreements with some of our biggest trading partners after years of procrastination. New trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China make our exports more affordable for their citizens and make their exports to us more affordable for our citizens—everyday Australians.


The government recognises that it has been hard for Australians to give away industry subsidies this year. But if we are to successfully convince other countries with much larger markets to make room for Australian exports, then we need to give them the same sort of equal access to our marketplace. At the same time we should never discount our ability to compete with, and beat, the best of the world in advanced manufacturing, software development and medical research. Our innovation is world-class, and with the new streams of capital available, we can commercialise and export to our own great advantage. 


As a nation we produce much more than we consume, so breaking down global trade barriers makes us a richer country and it future-proofs our prosperity. In order to facilitate our future we must have productive and efficient infrastructure. This year we have cleaned up the inherited mess of the National Broadband Network. We have quarantined the losses and we are now building the network to ensure that Australians receive affordable and accessible high-speed broadband. 


As planned in the budget we are also delivering the largest national infrastructure program in our nation's history. Australians have often said we need a new Snowy Mountains scheme. How many times have we heard that? And it took 25 years to build the original Snowy Mountains scheme. The coalition government in this year's budget is facilitating the delivery of the equivalent of eight new Snowy Mountains schemes over the next ten years with projects like WestConnex, upgrades to the North-South Corridor in Adelaide and the Perth freight link. 


Our new spending, and our Asset Recycling Initiative in particular, is driving unprecedented microeconomic reform at the state level. The sober reality of constrained finances is now hitting state and territory governments that are facing massive infrastructure demands. We are facilitating a new wave of construction by rewarding states with new additional funding for infrastructure if they redeploy locked-up capital in existing assets. This will support near-term economic growth and boost productivity over the medium to long term. 


By putting government businesses into the productive hands of the private sector, we can deliver both better and greater services to households, and improve the productive capacity of our economy. Of course we have done our part this year by selling Medibank Private, which was the third-largest initial public offering in the world this year, returning $5.7 billion to the budget—$1 billion more than expected—and that has helped to pay for new infrastructure around Australia. 


For business to be less constrained we must remove the logjam of regulation. Through dedicated parliamentary repeal days we have removed around 57,000 pages of government regulation and legislation. This saves Australian business around $2 billion a year of red-tape costs.


And at the beginning of this year we inherited nearly 100 announced but unlegislated taxation measures dating back 12 years that created uncertainty and regulatory instability for taxpayers. We have, this year, resolved the mess and removed that backlog of uncertainty.


Yesterday's National Accounts highlight an Australian economy continuing to grow, and an economy transitioning from a mining boom to one with broader based growth. This is an adjustment that we expected.


Going forward, there are reasons to be optimistic about continuing economic growth. Consumers are becoming more confident and are showing early signs of a willingness to spend more. Retail sales figures released today rose for the fifth consecutive month and are now nearly six per cent higher over the year. Consumer confidence data has rebounded to above long-run averages. This is a further positive sign for our retailers going into the Christmas trading season. Businesses are more optimistic about trading conditions, which is a precursor to greater investment and hiring. This is supported by job vacancies data, which are now at a 20-month high. And our export volumes continue to increase. This is reaping the dividends of past investments, not only in the resources sector but also in service industries like tourism and education.


Yes, we face many challenges. We are feeling the headwinds of weaker global demand, which has led to the considerable fall in commodity prices. Iron ore represents around a fifth of our export income. I say again: iron ore represents around a fifth of our export income. And prices have fallen by more than 30 per cent since the budget. We have also seen falls in prices of other major commodities such as thermal coal and wheat. Despite these headwinds, the economy will continue to grow and jobs will continue to be created.


But government revenues have been impacted by a larger-than-anticipated decline in our terms of trade. This means the government will collect less in tax, which makes it harder to pay for existing government services. On top of this we have softer wages growth as the labour market adjusts to the transition underway in our economy. This too has a detrimental impact on revenue.


While these factors have made budget repair harder, they do not alter its necessity. Without the measures announced in this year's budget, deficits were projected for at least the next decade—a total of 16 years of consecutive deficits—leaving Australia vulnerable to external shocks, less equipped to cope with the ageing population, and increasingly reliant on future generations to pay off our debt. Without action every Australian born in 10 years time in 2024 would start life with a government debt of $25,000. This intergenerational buck passing is unfair.


When preparing the budget, the government was very mindful that we should deliver an economically responsible fiscal consolidation, both in size and in timing. The structural budget savings we put forward such as making Medicare and the PBS more sustainable, and welfare distribution fairer, were designed to ensure that the financial impact was relatively small in the short term, but delivered increasing budget repair over the medium to longer term.


We have also delivered a plan that carefully navigates the transition from the resources boom. Australia's incomes and living standards have, over the past decade, been boosted by unprecedented investment and profits in our resources sector. As the resources investment boom abates, the transition of our economy to more balanced sources of growth will depend on demand for goods and services in other sectors. That demand will then attract resources to those sectors, drive investment, and create jobs.


A sustained improvement in public finances is an essential part of these plans. The current economic environment reinforces the importance of getting the budget back in order.


I urge the Labor Party, together with the Senate, to take a more mature and collaborative approach to addressing the challenge of budget repair. This is what Australians want if we are going to be able, as a nation, to afford our future.




Mr Husic:
  There should be less statement and more apology.



The SPEAKER:  The Treasurer has the call.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Blanket opposition and mindless resistance is nothing to boast about if you truly care about Australia's future.


Early next year, the government will be releasing an Intergenerational Report, containing 40 years of budget projections. Like earlier Intergenerational Reports, it will show that as Australia's population ages, labour force participation will fall. Without economic reform this will slow the economy, reduce growth in the government's revenue base and create additional demands on government spending, particularly in health, aged care and pensions, which represent around 10 per cent of government expenditure.


With the terms of trade in decline and population ageing weighing on workforce participation, the key to sustaining growth in living standards is raising Australia's productivity. Over a year ago as a new Treasurer I said:


There could even be periods where living standards actually decline. We don’t want that!


If we want to sustain national income growth at its thirty-year average, there will need to be a very significant lift in productivity growth.


I said that a year ago and I say it again today. The drop in national income recorded in yesterday's National Accounts highlights that this risk is real. All of the government's actions are being taken with these risks in mind.


The government will support Australia's productive potential in 2015 by investing in infrastructure, improving the efficiency of the federation and the taxation and financial systems, and by sustaining our focus on competition and deregulation. We are transforming industry policy to support innovation and entrepreneurship. We have provided more incentives for new start-up business growth with landmark changes to employee share schemes. Enterprise will drive our growth. Business will drive job creation. This combination of investment and structural reforms will support Australia's long-term rate of economic growth.


In 2014 we made great progress in strengthening the Australian economy so that it is able to better cope with external challenges and internal transitions. But more work needs to be done. Reform has no finishing line in the 21st century. With the government's Economic Action Strategy underway we will all be able to achieve what we hope for—that is, a better and more prosperous future for our nation.



The SPEAKER:  If the Treasurer would present his Ministerial Statement.

Mr HOCKEY:
  Madam Speaker, before the member for McMahon does respond to my ministerial statement, with your indulgence, I would like to say a few words.



The SPEAKER:  The Treasurer has the call.

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Delivering Prosperity and Growth for Australia</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,17,1
"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-12-04,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (16:46):  by leave—I will now start my response to the Treasurer. The Treasurer and I agree on one thing: Australia's 24 years of uninterrupted economic growth should be celebrated and, even more importantly, it should be protected. It is a remarkable achievement—the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth for any developed country in the history of the world. Many people are responsible for it, but it is our responsibility to ensure it continues. I agree with the Treasurer that it is not inevitable that it will continue. Vigilance and reform are necessary. We agree on the end: continuing those 24 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Economic growth lifts people out of poverty and turns aspiration into reality. But we disagree on the method.


The Treasurer says the way to protect our economic growth record and our living standards is to embrace his budget, his budget which, to our way of thinking, is a fundamentally unfair document. He effectively says that the way to protect Australia's living standards is to attack Australia's living standards through the budget. The Treasurer's and the government's approach is that unfairness and regressive policies are the basis for reform and that reform must be unfair. This is where we differ.


The Treasurer, with due respect, has not learnt the lessons of history. The most successful reforming period in Australia's economic history was that period between 1983 and 1996. Never before had Australia been asked to embrace so much economic change—so much reform and so much change—and fairness was at its core. The talisman of the Hawke and Keating governments was restraint with equity. Equity was important. It was important for reasons of justice, but it was also important because it enabled Prime Minister Hawke and Treasurer Keating to make the case for reform, to explain to the Australian people that it was in the best interests of everybody to reform. If their reform package had been fundamentally unfair, it would have failed and Australia would have been worse off. That is the difference in approach between this side of the House and that side of the House.


We embrace economic reform. We do not run from it; we embrace it. We acknowledge that it is necessary to ensure ongoing growth, but we reject completely and utterly economic reform based on unfairness. At the core of the budget is the Treasurer's philosophy, which he shared with the House and with the people on budget night, dividing Australians into 'lifters' and 'leaners'. This is, again, where we differ. The way to make the case for reform is not to divide Australia down the middle. The way to make the case for reform is not to say, 'Some Australians deserve to benefit from economic growth and others do not.' This is what he was doing when he announced that the government would attempt to introduce unfair indexation for Australia's aged pensioners. This is what he was doing when he announced that he would take away the family tax benefit for children over six. This is what he was doing when he announced that the government believed it was necessary to create an underclass by taking people under 30 off the Newstart allowance. This is what the government were doing when they announced that low-income earners would receive zero tax support for saving for their future through superannuation. These are at the core of the government's philosophy and approach.


It was a regrettable thing for the Treasurer to divide Australia into lifters and leaners because, as has been said, what actually unites Australians is much greater than what divides us. We on this side of the House believe in inclusive growth. By that we mean that every Australian should be able to contribute to growth and every single Australian should benefit from economic growth. We do not divide Australians into lifters and leaners.


The Treasurer was not being original when he coined this phrase. He adopted the phrase from another politician. That politician was the vice-presidential candidate of the Republican Party, a Tea Party adherent who said that America was divided into 'makers' and 'takers'. That comment was adapted by the Treasurer. In fairness, that candidate for the vice-presidency later said that that was a mistake. He withdrew that statement. He was campaigning and an American citizen went up to him and asked, 'Can you explain to me who the takers are? Is it my aged pensioner mother who worked her whole life and is now relying on the United States federal government for the age pension? Is she a taker?' He reflected on that and he decided that that constituent, that United States citizen, was right and that he should not have said that. He withdrew it. He recanted it. He did so very explicitly and very deliberately. I say to the Treasurer that he, too, should recant and withdraw that statement about lifters and leaners in Australia. He should acknowledge that Australians do not need a Treasurer who divides them but one who unites them.


The Treasurer talked of economic growth. As I said in my opening remarks, we on this side of the House do not run from economic growth; we embrace it. We are the party of economic growth. Economic growth lifts people from poverty into prosperity. That is what drives the Labor Party. We will embrace things which promote economic growth and we will criticise things which take away from economic growth. We say creating an Australia which is more fundamentally unfair does not promote growth but diminishes growth and will in the long run be seen as a threat to growth. The government should recognise the same.


We talk of long-term economic growth. Let us focus on those matters in which the Treasurer is eating away at those long-term creators of economic growth. Let us focus in particular on education and innovation. Despite claims to the contrary, the budget contained $80 billion worth of cuts to health and education—$28 billion in education.


What is the long-term impact on economic growth of this? On this side of the House we believe that every Australian, regardless of their parents' wealth, regardless of their location around Australia, should have the capacity to grow and to be whatever they wish to be, to their full and maximum potential. We believe that as a matter of fundamental social justice. But we also believe it is very good economic policy, because we believe that if those young people are able to grow to be everything they can be, then Australia's economy as a whole will be better off. And I am not the only one who thinks that. For example, there are studies showing that measures to increase school retention rates will result in an additional annual taxation receipt for the Commonwealth of $2.3 billion, by 2040. Or, the effective increase in school and training retention rates amongst 15 to 24 year-olds from the current 80 per cent mark to around 90 per cent would have the same positive impact on the economy as increasing Australia's total migrant intake by 180,000 over the period to 2040. It would have a similar economic impact as increasing workforce participation rates of older workers by 6.6 percentage points, from nearly 53 per cent to nearly 60 per cent. And it would boost annual GDP by 1.1 per cent, the equivalent of $9.2 billion in today's figures.


This is the transformational, generational impact of an investment in education. Again there is a difference here. We see every dollar spent on education in this nation as an investment. Every single dollar. We see it as an investment in Australia's economic future, as well as the future of those individuals.


Let's look for a moment at the issue of skills and vocational education and training. It is another area that has been cut by this Treasurer and this government. This is an area where we can make a huge difference for individuals, their careers and their lives, and for the Australian economy. For example, closing the equity gap between people from low socioeconomic backgrounds and the general population, through vocational education and training, is estimated to increase real GDP by $3.9 billion by 2020, and in doing so will generate over 37,000 full-time equivalent jobs. That is an investment in the future. It is good for Australia's economy. Or, closing the equity gap between the general population and Indigenous people and people with a disability, through vocational education and training, is estimated to increase real GDP by $12.12 billion by 2020, and to generate 118,000 full-time equivalent jobs. This is the transformational opportunity of vocational education and training for our nation, one being eaten away by the short-sighted cuts of the Liberal Party and National Party in office. This is what we talk about when we say that this is a budget that is anti economic growth. I accept the intentions of the Treasurer when he talks about the need for economic growth, but I say to him that this government's actions eat away at the future sources of economic growth.


Then we come to innovation, that other great source of economic growth for Australia into the future. This is a budget that has cut the CSIRO funding, and just in the last fortnight we are seeing the impact of that cut—a cut in the CSIRO staffing levels that is very dramatic and will do Australia harm for many years to come.


We all know that science and research is primarily driven by the private sector, as it should be. But what governments do is important. We know that the CSIRO invented Wi-Fi. We know that the equivalent authorities and agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom were integral to promoting the internet and GPS. But we know that it is much less likely to happen in the future with these cuts.


We have seen many organisations abolished. The Treasurer boasted in his economic statement about the number of government organisations that have been abolished. Several of them are in the innovation, research and commercialisation space. That is not a matter for boasting. That is a matter for disappointment, and frankly a matter for shame. Of all the matters in the budget we are critical of—and they are many and varied—these are perhaps the most short-sighted and, frankly, dumbest cuts of all, because Australia will pay a price for many years to come.


I want to talk about the impact on economic growth in the shorter term of this government's economic policies, and the budget in particular. In his ministerial statement, the Treasurer again talked about confidence. Confidence is something we should talk about, because confidence has been smashed by this budget. Consumer confidence fell by seven percentage points in the month following the budget. It is 13 per cent lower than it was at the time of the last election. We were promised an adrenaline charge and we have had the opposite. That is on the Westpac figures. The Treasurer prefers to use the ANZ figures. So let's use the ANZ figures. The ANZ figures are not seasonally adjusted, but I am happy to use them if the Treasurer wants to use them. That is fine with me. The yearly average on the index is 111.4 for this year. The index for the last 10 years is an average of 115.2, and for the last 15 years it is 116.4.




Dr Leigh:
  And that includes the GFC.




Mr BOWEN:
  That is right. That includes the GFC. It is not correct to say that consumer confidence has returned to its long-term average, as the Treasurer claims. In fact, it is at its equal lowest level, and it is lower than it has been at any time, putting aside the GFC, since 1993.


This is about the budget. It is about the Treasurer's rhetoric, which is ill-judged and irresponsible. The Treasurer's rhetoric in the lead-up to the budget was talking up a budget crisis, and the Australian people listened, as they do when a Treasurer speaks, and they put away their wallets, and Australian businesses have paid the price for the Treasurer's ill-judged rhetoric.


Australian families have paid the price for the Treasurer's ill-judged rhetoric and his actions in the lead-up to the budget and since. The Australian people and Australian consumers have also responded to the mixed messages from the government—the lack of an economic strategy, the lack of an economic narrative. One day we are told: 'It is fine and that the budget is 75 per cent passed. What are you worried about? Everything is dandy.' The next day we hear: 'We have a crisis on our hands because of that terrible Labor Party, standing up for what they believe in—standing up for fairness. How dare they! They are blocking our budget.' Can Australian consumers be forgiven for being confused? If the Treasurer was competent, the Australian people would be confident. But he is not, and they are not. This is the impact of this government on consumer confidence, and consumer confidence has a big impact on business activity. 


The people who analyse these figures have been very clear about what has caused this reduction in consumer confidence. Let us have another look at the Westpac survey. Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans said in November in relation to the November results: 'This is an unsurprising but still disappointing result.' It is unsurprising because the Australian people and the commentators have become used to this government. Clearly this is sheeted home directly to the budget. I note that in July a record 74 per cent of those surveyed recall news on budget and taxation—the highest recall rate of the budget in the history of the survey— and 74 per cent said this was leading to their reduction in confidence. They went on to say that the recollections were extremely unfavourable and were likely to remain that way. Guess what? Later on there was another survey which was the second worst in relation to negative recall on the budget. They have got some achievements and they have got some records—the worst and second worst when it comes to the impact on consumer confidence of this budget. It is the result of this government's approach.


We do have a different plan for Australia; we do have a different vision for Australia. We say very clearly that the budget should be on a credible path back to surplus. We would support sensible measures to return the budget to surplus, as we have supported more than $20 billion worth of savings through this House and the other house. We have supported it and we would support it. We will support measures that are fair, but we will never support measures that unfair because they are bad for Australian families and bad for the economy and we will not stand for it. We believe in economic reform with equity at its core, and economic reform with equity at its core is better for the nation, as well as being better for Australian families. We will embrace the age of entrepreneurialism; we will embrace innovation. We will participate in that debate. The competitiveness report released by the government was a damp squib of a report—a report which was full of excuses and government announcements, which we welcomed as far as they went—it was a long time coming and disappointing when it was released. We will support and have supported those measures but we will point out that these measures go nowhere near far enough when taken against the $113 million of cuts to the CSIRO, the 1391 jobs lost from CSIRO, a 21.5 per cent reduction in the workforce. These are not small numbers—21.5 per cent reduction in the workforce of the CSIRO that Australia's economic growth rate will pay a price for for many years to come.


As we end this parliamentary year, let there be no doubt: the Labor Party will always be the party of economic growth. We believe in it; we will promote it; and in government we will deliver it. We will deliver it for the best interests of all Australians. We will not choose lifters and leaners; we will say every Australian should benefit from economic growth and every Australian should be encouraged to contribute to economic growth to the best of their ability and capacity. That will be the approach of a Shorten Labor government; that will be the contest of ideas undertaken in this chamber next year and across the nation. It is a contest of ideas that we intend to participate in and win.

Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (09:31):  I rise today to express a number of concerns on behalf of the Vietnamese Community in Australia. This organisation, which represents the ex-patriot Vietnamese community, is deeply concerned about the recent tensions in the South China Sea, Vietnam's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the ongoing persecution of political activists in Vietnam and to even some in Australia. Mr Tri Vo, President of the Vietnamese Community in Australia, and Mr Bon Van-Nguyen, President of the Vietnamese Community in Australia Victoria Chapter, are deeply concerned that the People's Republic of China has heightened the risk of war in South-East Asia by its latest unilateral and provocative installation in mid-2014 of its oil rigs within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone as part of China's unsubstantiated 9 dash line claim of more than 90 per cent of the Bien Dong, which is the East Sea—aka the South China Sea—by China.


The Vietnamese Community in Australia encourages the Australian government and all Asia-Pacific nations to request all claimants to settle their disputes through peaceful negotiations in accordance with international laws, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and support the negotiations between the PRC and ASEAN for a binding code of conduct to replace the non-binding 2002 Declaration of Conduct.


Over 10,000 members of the Vietnamese Community in Australia are concerned about China flexing its military muscle in the South China Sea around the pristine reef that is part of the disputed Spratly Islands chain claimed by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. The Vietnamese Community in Australia is calling for restraint and for China to discontinue its plans of filling in the reef's lagoon in order to create an island as a way of being able to fully claim the area in the future and use it for military purposes.


The Vietnamese Community in Australia also believes that conditions should be imposed on Vietnam before it can participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Trans-Pacific Partnership aims to enhance trade and investment among the 12 TPP partner countries to promote innovation, economic growth and development, and to support the creation and retention of jobs. The total GDP of TPP members is 37.5 per cent of global GDP and the total population is about 800 million people.


Vietnam will be one of the countries that will benefit the most from being a member of the TPP because it could export more to nations such as the United States of America. However, according to the Vietnamese Community in Australia, the Vietnamese authorities must do the following things before being a permanent partner of TPP. They must release all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. They must ensure the right of the Vietnamese people to have the freedom to establish independent unions, and permit organisation of strikes if necessary. They must ensure the right of the Vietnamese people to have the freedom to establish independent organisations and associations to serve the interests of groups and individual and they must ensure the right of the Vietnamese people to freely practise their religious beliefs. These matters have been raised by the Vietnamese Community in Australia, and I commend them for their work on behalf of the Vietnamese community.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2014-12-04,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Deputy Leader of the House and Assistant Minister for Employment) (10:34):  The tragic loss of Phillip Hughes, the batsman from the bush, has reverberated around the cricket world, shocked a nation and devastated the picturesque mid-North Coast town of Macksville. In Macksville flags flew at half-mast, people shook their heads in disbelief, shops and offices went quiet, and the few people on the streets carried on their business with eyes downcast. The local paper, the Nambucca Guardian News, reported on the day of his passing small groups of old men chatting solemnly on street corners and a line of cricket bats and caps standing outside the Macksville Public School—a tribute which has been copied around the globe. The message board at St Patrick's school paid tribute to Phillip, a former student.


In recent days I have spoken to people in Macksville. They were keen to share their memories of Phillip and their admiration for his achievements. Phillip Hughes was born there 26 years ago last Sunday to Greg and Virginia, hard-working banana farmers. Phillip was raised in a rural community with a strong agricultural heritage. He loved the land and he loved his sport. He was a country boy to a tee and was also a talented rugby league player, having played in the junior league with the famous rugby league international, Greg Inglis.


However, it was cricket that was his passion. He played for the Macksville Ex-Services Cricket Club Juniors. His talents were recognised early in his career, being selected for A Grade at the age of only 12—an amazing achievement in itself. Phillip instituted night cricket in the backyard of the Macksville family home with his brother Jason. They played for hours under a spotlight until called into the house each evening. Young men from country areas have been a source of great talent over the years for Australian cricket. Phillip took the big step of moving to Sydney when he was 17 to pursue his dream. He worked hard, tirelessly, to wear baggy green cap No. 408, to be a test player for Australia. It was not easy but he achieved his goal—the childhood dream of so many Australians.


It is common to many successful young people from the Nambucca Valley that they retain a love for their home towns and return whenever possible. This was also true of Phillip. He always came home when his extensive commitments permitted. He would attend the presentation nights at the Macksville Ex-Services Junior Cricket Club whenever he could. Mayor Rhonda Hoban described to me how Phillip never tired of signing an endless stream of favourite bats and caps. She said he appeared to remember what it was like to dream of playing for Australia. As well as his passion for cricket, Phillip had a passion for the land and his Angus cattle. He was working on improving a property which he purchased for the development of an Angus stud. As with his commitment to junior cricket in the Nambucca, he also took pride in showing and leading his cattle in the local show.


Yesterday I attended the service in honour of the life of Phillip Hughes along with the Prime Minister, Premier, Mike Baird, the sports minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Phillip's death is an event that has certainly united us in this House as it has united the nation in grief. The spirit of community runs deep in Macksville and it seemed the entire town and surrounding district turned out to show their respect. The local shops closed their doors and townspeople lined the streets for the funeral procession. Such was the esteem in which this young man was held that the service I would suggest was probably the largest event ever to occur in Macksville.


We cannot walk in the shoes of parents Greg and Virginia and siblings Jason and Megan but we can as a nation show that we care. The Hughes family can be rightly proud of the contribution their son and brother has made to Australian sport and our nation, of the young cricketers he has inspired and of the respect with which he was held in his community. He will forever remain an inspiration to the people of the Nambucca Valley. Phillip Hughes we honour you—63 not out

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (10:39):  I would like to share with the House an exciting and innovative approach adopted in Belmont to address the scourge of graffiti. We have called it 'Block by Block'. It is important to acknowledge that in every community in Australia there is a problem with graffiti—it is removed and then the next day it is back. It costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time. It is a big effort, and the current approach is very unsuccessful.


In Belmont we decided to create an art gallery. There was one area that was particularly badly hit by graffiti—the shopping centre behind my office. The Reject Shop, the dental surgery and all the other businesses got together and agreed to transform this area into an art gallery—and it is phenomenal. People have been coming from all over to look at the work being produced there. Some of the best graffiti artists in the country—and even some from New Zealand—have come to show off their work in this block. 


The project is called 'Block by Block' because we are hoping we can replicate the project, block by block, throughout the area. The new art gallery has been there for a couple of weeks now. This was an area where, if you cleaned off all the graffiti one day, the next it would be totally covered again. But now that is not happening. All the artwork is still there—the beautiful murals that have been produced are still on the walls. One of the most exciting ones, all along a very big wall of the Belmont Central Shopping Centre, is of a crocodile. People just come and stand and look at it and are mesmerised. Then we have an animal collage on the back of the Reject Shop. Next, moving over, there is an underwater scene across the back of Cafe Macquarie and the dental surgery. Frickers Shoes was one of the shops that had been constantly bombed by graffiti and they were one of the first shops to sign up to having this innovative approach to solving the graffiti problem tried out. On their roller door at the back they have a wonderful mural, and a beautiful bird has been produced down the side alley.


There will be a second round which will start at the end of January and the beginning of February. It will see the area further transformed. It is not uncommon to see young people standing there looking at it and families coming along to view the artwork. That is what it is; it is artwork. As opposed to the tagging that constantly takes place in lots of areas, this is something that enhances the visual environment.


I would like to give particular credit to Ana Benson. She is an event organiser as well as being one of the owners of Cafe Macquarie, which is next door to my office. I mentioned very flippantly to her one day that we should look at addressing graffiti in this way—and she took it up very seriously and was the catalyst behind this project. The chamber of commerce, particularly Sue, was very supportive. The artists involved have been BMD, Keo Match, Skubz, Mike Watt, Ape Seven, Oh Noes, Skulk and Che He He. They came from Melbourne, Sydney and New Zealand. They are phenomenal artists. There were also three young locals, Jordan, Daniel and Regan, who come from Belmont and Caves Beach. I encourage members to look at adopting such an innovative approach. 


I seek leave to table photos of the artwork.


Leave granted.
