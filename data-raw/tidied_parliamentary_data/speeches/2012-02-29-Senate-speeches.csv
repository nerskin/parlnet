Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (09:31):  We are dealing with Greens amendments (20) and (21), which provide that mutual assistance should be refused in all cases involving the death penalty without exception. I have had a long association with this issue. This government and all governments in Australia have continued to remain very strong against the death penalty throughout. The government does not in this instance, though, support removing the discretion to provide assistance in death penalty cases. The existing death penalty ground for refusing mutual assistance is consistent with Australia's strong opposition to the death penalty while still affording sufficient flexibility to ensure that assistance can be provided to combat serious criminal activity, because special circumstances may exist where the foreign country provides an undertaking that the death penalty will not be imposed or, if imposed, it will not be carried out. So we can find the way through this by ensuring that we have mutual assistance with other countries while maintaining our strong voice in international fora about how Australia condemns those countries who use the death penalty.


Another example where mutual assistance for special circumstances may arise is where assistance provided would assist a defendant to prove their innocence. The way the legislation is structured is to ensure that fairness is at the heart of the system. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act also enables conditions to be placed on the provision of assistance so that, in instances where there is a view taken by the government, we can place strong conditions on that. This could include, for instance, restricting the use of material to investigative purposes or requiring the country to seek the minister's authorisation to use material for the purposes of prosecuting a person. All of that means that the system that is in place will ensure that we continue to be strong advocates against the death penalty.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:36):  As I rise to make a contribution to this debate I am very pleased to once again have an opportunity to put on record my support of the National Broadband Network. I am proud to be part of a government that recognises the importance of bringing Australia's broadband services into the 21st century. As we move towards a digital economy we need to remain competitive in our region, and this is why we are delivering the NBN. No matter what the location, the NBN will ensure high-speed broadband to everywhere in Australia. All homes, schools and businesses will be included.


Fibre-to-the-premises technology, with speeds of one gigabit per second, will connect 93 per cent of premises. Satellite and wireless technology will service the rest of Australia and provide faster and affordable broadband. To put it in layman's terms, what we are talking about is broadband speed a thousand times faster than the speed that many people currently receive. Rural and regional communities, such as my home state of Tasmania, have already started to benefit from the NBN and will continue to prosper and thrive with the assistance of high-speed broadband. The NBN is the single largest infrastructure investment made by an Australian government. It will deliver a once-in-a-generation improvement of our telecommunications infrastructure and it will benefit all Australians. It is cutting-edge technology that will transform our economy and create new ways of connecting with each other and the world.


There have been Australian and international studies that have shown broadband to be one of the strongest ways to increase social and economic development. The Connecting Communities review by a global telecommunications solutions provider looked at the benefits of broadband in the United Kingdom and what this means for Australia. The findings were that high-speed broadband is directly related to strong regional areas and attracting and retaining employees, and also contributes to a low-carbon future. It can be summed up as being 'transformational for Australia'.


We know that, as a significant nation building project, the NBN will end up paying for itself. The advantages it will provide are incredibly widespread and touch on every facet of our lives, including health, education and business. At a grassroots level it will mean that local businesses can develop and get in touch with new markets and that people will be able to access health care without having to leave their homes.


I would like to share a story from my home state of Tasmania, which I know you will be interested in, Mr Deputy President, that highlights the benefits of the NBN. It involves a sign-writing business in Midway Point, which was one of the three towns in the initial rollout. Midway Point is in the electorate of Lyons and is represented by Dick Adams, who is a strong supporter of the NBN and a great advocate for his community. This business has seen an increase in its capacity to attract customers thanks to the NBN. As the broadband speed is faster and more reliable, large artwork files can now be sent and retrieved in a matter of seconds, which is a dramatic improvement and has increased the number of clients wanting to do business with it. The NBN means that distance is no longer an impediment to running a successful business, which is crucial for businesses in regional and rural Australia. This is just one example of the many success stories that highlight how the NBN is changing lives and creating opportunities.


Midway Point is joined by Scottsdale and Smithton as the towns where NBN services are currently available in Tasmania, and work has either commenced or will com­mence in 12 months on a number of other locations. These locations are George Town, Deloraine, Triabunna, Sorell, Somerset, St Helens, Launceston, South Launceston, Bellerive, Hobart, Kingston and Claremont. In Tasmania it is estimated that within 12 months 15,000 homes will have access to the NBN, with work planned to start on an extra 76,000 in the coming year.


Despite hearing stories about the very positive impact the NBN is having on people out there in the community, those opposite are hell bent on preventing Australians from having a world-class, affordable broadband service. If they were serious about ensuring Australians are able to access world-class telecommunications infrastructure, they would support the NBN rollout, as it is supported throughout the community.


This government wants everyone to have access to high-speed broadband, no matter where they live, and we are committed to delivering it for all Australians. As we continue this mission, the Telecom­munications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecom­munications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 are part of a package of legislation aimed at enabling the continuity of key telecom­munications safeguards. These bills are part of the next stage in the government's reform agenda for the telecommunications industry. The bills seek to reform the arrangements for the delivery of universal service and public policy outcomes. This will aid the evolution to the NBN and a more competitive telecommunications market.


Breaking this package down, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill provides the governance, funding and accountability framework for this new statutory agency. It will ensure that universal service outcomes and other important services for the community will still be delivered in a new competitive circumstance. The new entity will guarantee that all Australians have sufficient access to a standard telephone service and payphones, guarantee the continuing delivery of the Emergency Call Service and the National Relay Service, and guarantee that appropriate safeguards are in place to support voice-only customers transferring to an NBN fibre service as Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. It will also ensure that technological solutions will be developed to support the continuity of public interest services such as public alarm systems and traffic lights. These are vital ways to ensure the continuity of basic services to Australians in light of the changes to the telecommunications industry that will take place with the rollout of the NBN, including the gradual decom­missioning of Telstra's copper customer access network. The government is committed to reducing the disruption for industry and the wider community by keeping these basic safeguards.


Telstra will be required to keep its copper network to deliver voice services outside NBN fibre areas and will also be the retailer of last resort for voice-only services over the NBN fibre network. As well as providing accessible basic services, the legislation will also ensure that the new agency operates in an accountable and transparent manner. It will be required to keep a publicly available register with key terms and services to be provided under all contracts and grants, as well to as prepare annual reports and corporate plans. There will be a review before 1 January 2018 to consider how effective the agency has been. The estimated total cost of the agency is $340 million per year for its first two years and around $330 million per year following that. To help with these costs the government is contributing at least $50 million in funding per year for the first two financial years and $100 million per year after that.


The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill chiefly amends telecommunications legislation to assist the new arrangements for delivery of universal service outcomes within the telecommunications sector and to facilitate the establishment of the new agency and the changeover to new levy arrangements. An important part of the bill is the proposal of a robust framework for contracting with service providers for the delivery of universal service outcomes and related public interest services in the telecommunications sector. The Telecom­munications (Industry Levy) Bill is a bill that ensures the government can raise the consolidated industry levy. This package of legislation further progresses the work the government is doing to reform the telecom­munications industry and continue with the rollout of the NBN. The government is committed to giving all Australians access to affordable and high-speed broadband services. The NBN is critical infrastructure that will connect Australians with each other and the world, and I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:45):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and related bills. But, with the indulgence of the Senate, I will just touch on a couple of other matters initially. Firstly, because I may not have a chance on the record at any other time today to say this, I note that today, being the last day of February, is the culmination of Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. Knowing that Senator Conroy's office would be monitoring this, as this is his legislation, I note the participation of Senator Conroy and in particular his wife, Paula, in the ovarian cancer breakfast held in Parliament House this morning, and I note in this place, appropriately, the memories that many have of my predecessor in this Senate seat and your predecessor, Mr Deputy President, as Liberal Party whip, Senator Jeannie Ferris, who did so much to raise awareness of ovarian cancer during her battle, which she ultimately succumbed to, with ovarian cancer.


This legislation has come on a little earlier than anticipated because of the filibustering tactics the Greens are employing on the radioactive waste legislation—a shameful tactic from the Greens, who do not seem to recognise the importance to Australia of ensuring that we have a central repository for radioactive waste in this country. I note that having brought this debate on, though, this has moved out into an area of legislation where there is some broad agreement of principle and some concern over detail.


The universal service obligation is an important tenet and feature of Australia's telecommunications policy. It requires that basic telecommunications services, including home telephone services, business telephone services and payphones, be accessible to all Australians in a fair and equitable basis at an affordable price. The universal service obligation is especially important for telecommunications consumers in rural and regional Australia, as it ensures that basic telco services are available where it may not otherwise be economically viable for telecommunications companies to provide them. Without this subsidy, the tyranny of distance would be all the greater for many rural Australians who may not be able to afford basic services. For this reason, the coalition strongly support the USO. We have always done so, and we continue to do so. It is consistent with our overall support for communications services of the highest standard and order in rural and regional Australia.


Our support has not just been for the USO. If we look at what we had in place at the end of the Howard government, we see that we had in place a number of measures that were designed to provide a better standard and to continually raise the standard and the bar of telco services for rural and regional Australians. I think immediately of the regional telecommunications fund—$2 billion that had been set aside to be able to provide a constant source of funding to upgrade services to rural and regional Australians. Sadly, that fund is no more because, like all available piggy banks under this government, it has been raided and spent. It was spent in this case on the National Broadband Network, which thus far is not exactly rolling out vast new services in rural and regional Australia at a rapid pace.


Indeed, if we compare the NBN and where it is up to in its provision of, especially, wireless services to regional communities with what the coalition had in place at the end of the Howard government, we will see that we were on track to deliver wireless services to regional communities within a few years. They would have already had services under the OPEL contract that would have provided for better regional telecommunications services today than they currently have. That would have been delivered under a contract signed by the previous government and funded by the previous government and that would already have been operational today. Instead, we continue to hear promises but see delays from the government as it rolls out the NBN. We hear promises but there are delays and therefore consumers in rural and regional Australia are still waiting to see the genuine benefits of this claimed NBN.


Telstra currently delivers the universal service obligation. Being a former monopoly provider and the owner of much of Australia's fixed line telecommunications infrastructure, Telstra's role in this is understandable. Current regulation requires Telstra to provide basic services at an equitable rate. To compensate Telstra for this obligation, all telco carriers are levied, with the majority of funds raised provided to Telstra to offset the cost of their undertakings in this area. Presently the levy raised is approximately $145 million. This legislation also affects the provision of the Emergency Call Service and the National Relay Service. The National Relay Service delivers voice-equivalent services to Australians with speech or hearing impairments through voice-to-text and text-to-voice technologies. The NRS, I understand, costs around $17 million under its current contract provider.


Telstra has argued for some time that the fees levied from service providers which it receives to compensate it for the cost it incurs in relation to the provision of the USO are insufficient. Unsurprisingly, Telstra's retail competitors, who are levy payers, have opposed any increase to the levy. This legislation provides ultimately a convenient escape from this argument between companies. The government commissioned the Castalia report, an independent expert report, to consider this matter. It found that the cost of providing the USO combined with the cost of the NRS and provision of public payphones amounted to at least $250 million and up to $300 million annually. While this will in theory end the argument between Telstra and other retail service providers, it opens up a new potential front for argument between retail telco service providers and the government and in particular the new Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, TUSMA. We have seen that already with many of the other retail service providers in the telco space questioning the validity of the Castalia report and the costs and doubting whether the sums involved are indeed appropriate. While the current USO was appropriate while Telstra was the owner and operator of Australia's fixed line telecommunications network, with the changed environment foreshadowed by the government through their NBN and of course the planned ripping out of the copper network right around Australia—if, indeed, this ever does occur given the appallingly slow or extravagantly expensive rollout of the NBN to date—it makes sense to plan to alter the arrangements of the USO to fit with the government's overall policy direction. This bill is before us largely because Labor is seeking to create the NBN—a massive government owned communications infrastructure monopoly that will stifle competition and innovation in Australia's telecommunications sector, but that should not be any surprise to anybody given that private ownership, efficiency, competition and business innovation are anathema to what this government stands for. Nonetheless, as the government intends to limit facilities based competition by ripping copper line from the ground and implementing its new regulatory regime with a monopoly fibre provider, we must address the provision of the important services contained in the USO.


On the coalition side we expect transparency and competition in government tenders for services. The question here is whether the processes set out through this legislation and already undertaken by the government as part of the new TUSMA arrangement actually meet with those expectations of the coalition. This process sees the costs of services revealed and openly and transparently funded by both taxpayers and the retail service providers—not to mention it removes a somewhat onerous regulatory requirement from a private business: Telstra. This is all something that our party welcomes. If only the NBN as a whole was as transparent and up-front about the costs, subsidies and competitive impacts of this unprecedented government intervention.


While I welcome the increased transparency of the amount involved and the replacement of the USO and NRS levies with a single levy and the funding arrangements for it, there is of course, as always with Labor, a catch. As we have seen so openly this week, there is always more than meets the eye. Whenever Labor seeks to simplify, the outcome is always more complex. Whenever Labor seeks to cut costs, the outcome is always more expensive. Whenever Labor seeks to reduce regulation, the outcome is always a new bureaucracy. Labor talks of efficient government and transparent government, but it is of course addicted to bloated, big, inefficient government.


These bills sadly provide for more of the same in some ways. These bills create yet another new bureaucracy. We all know Labor has never seen a bureaucracy that it did not like. This time it is the Telecom­munications Universal Service Management Agency, or TUSMA—a mouthful if you do not take the acronym. TUSMA will be created to do what the Australian Communications and Media Authority already does in part—that is, assume responsibility for the USO. I am not sure why the minister lacked confidence in the ACMA to administer all of the operation of the USO, and perhaps he can explain this for us when he sums up. Indeed, perhaps he needs some extra positions to appoint some of his Labor mates to. Maybe we will even see Senator Arbib bobbing up and helping with the USO in his next life. As I understand it, the ACMA will of course continue to collect the industry levy, which will fund the USO. I understand that ACMA has staff of around 40 engaged in the responsibility for the USO and associated aspects. TUSMA will oversee the new regime and it will come at an administrative cost of around $5 million.


I mentioned earlier that the coalition, by our very nature, expect open and transparent tenders for government services, so it is therefore disappointing that, far from taking the opportunity to put the USO and NRS services out to a competitive, open tender, the government have entered into a 20-year contract with Telstra. We all know that Telstra's cooperation and acquiescence to the NBN model is essential for the success of the NBN model. Obviously in this case we see that, even with the USO contract, it does appear to have the image, as suggested by many, of being wrapped up as a potential little sweetener valued at around $2.7 billion over 10 years for Telstra.


One of the TUSMA jobs is to enter into contracts for the delivery of the USO. That begs the question that, if one of their core jobs is to enter into contracts for delivery of the USO but the government has already agreed to the first 20 years worth of contracts, perhaps the new bureaucratic agency is going to have a rather quiet first 20 years. Indeed, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy said as much during the inquiry into these bills. Departmental deputy secretary Mr Quinlivan stated:


These measures were agreed to support the government's broader package of telecom­munications reforms, implementation of the NBN and, most importantly in this context, the structural separation of Telstra.


We see an admission there from the department that this is not a pure approach about simply the provision of universal services to rural and regional Australians; this of course is all embedded in the government's approach to the implemen­tation of the NBN and the structural of separation of Telstra. Yesterday, the ACCC approved a much revised structural separa­tion undertaking between the government and Telstra—a structural separation undertaking that at least now does not include some of the remarkable provisions that NBN Co. and the government had sought to impose upon Telstra in the first place. Those conditions would have seen them limited to the manner in which they conducted competition for their non-fixed line businesses and non-fibre businesses and would have seen them not able to effectively promote their wireless services against NBN Co.'s monopoly services, because so scared is the government of any semblance of competition against its NBN model. I do not begrudge Telstra receiving this contract. It probably is at the current point in time the best placed of Australia's service providers to deliver it, given, of course, that it continues to be with the copper line being the product provided to the overwhelming majority of Australian premises. It is the owner of that service and the one best placed to ensure its maintenance and continuance into the future. We have the strange situation under the NBN model and under this proposal that the copper line is going to have to be maintained in certain parts of Australia for an indefinite period of time. Whilst the government proposes to rip up, switch off and disconnect the copper line services for 93 per cent of Australian premises—if, of course, it ever gets that far with its NBN—there is a question mark that remains for the remainder and an uncertainty as to how the services under the USO are going to be provided to those remaining households into the future in a cost-effective manner for all involved. The problem that we have, however, with the Telstra contract, with the report that was undertaken and with the approach going forward is that we will never know for sure if due process really was followed. Certainly we know that there was no real open tender conducted at this stage of events.


Senator Conroy, as the responsible minister, has quite an interesting history when it comes to tenders. I reflect on NBN stage 1 and the tender that was undertaken at that stage to provide the fibre-to-the-node broadband service. Fibre to the node was what the Labor government was originally elected promising. This was, if my memory is correct, a $4.7 billion promise.




Senator Ludwig:
  Did you buy the copper?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Ludwig wants to ask if we have bought the copper. As I just reflected, Senator Ludwig, large parts of Australia—including large parts of rural and regional Australia, critical to your portfolio—are in theory going to continue to be reliant on copper services under this proposal for an indefinite period of time into the future. But Senator Conroy went through that $4.7-ish billion contract for NBN stage 1, for fibre-to-the-node services, only, having spent millions of dollars on that tender, to have to abandon and scrap it, having wasted countless hours of government and private sector time, and to come up with a new model that just shifted the decimal place across by one so that we ended up with something closer to a $50 billion proposal. Clearly it was not a big deal to the government, because equally, as we all know, it was all dreamt up on the back of a serviette, or both sides of a serviette, or both sides of an envelope or a drinks coaster, on that famous VIP flight between Melbourne and Brisbane.


Senator Conroy, of course, continued his interesting history with tender processes in the recent Australia Network contract debacle that the government engaged in, which once again saw millions of dollars and countless hours of government and private sector time wasted on a botched tender process that is now the subject of dual investigations by the Australian Federal Police and the Auditor-General's office. But I digress. Senator Conroy has so many problems and debacles that I could not possibly cover them all now, so I shall return to the issue of TUSMA.


The coalition is concerned that telecommunications service providers, and ultimately consumers and taxpayers, will end up potentially paying more as a result of TUSMA and the arrangements in place. TUSMA's running costs will be paid and borne in part by taxpayers, at least over the immediate future, and of course by the telecommunications industry through the levy structure, with the government initially providing a flat $100 million contribution to provide the gap between existing levy arrangements and the expected funding necessary for the new USO arrangements. Of course, the industry levy structure in the future has the risk and the fear that there is a lack of incentive to rein in costs, and that has created fears that many retail service providers expressed to the Senate inquiry: they feared that the hit to industry and the costs to consumers will continue to grow and grow. Perhaps, if the government had conducted proper consultations on this matter, the reform would not have caused the concern in the telco sector that we heard about through the Senate inquiry. There was genuine concern about the consultation process and the government's admissions, effectively, that this was all wrapped up before the final legislation was developed. So we come to this process wanting to support the USO and accepting that a new model is necessary given the government's policy direction but with concerns about the bureaucracy and costs which will be expressed later.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:05):  I am pleased to rise to support the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the TUSMA Bill, and also the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011, or the reform bill, and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, or the levy bill. This legislative package delivers on the reforms to the universal service obligation announced by the government in June 2010 when Telstra entered into the financial heads of agreement with NBN Co. that set in motion Telstra's structural separation. I am pleased that that structural separation was approved by the ACCC yesterday. It is something that those opposite could never achieve in 11½ years of government. The bills will allow the progressive migration of Telstra's customers to the NBN Co.'s fibre network, a network that takes Australia into the modern age of telecommunications.


The three bills the government proposes to introduce to parliament—the TUSMA Bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Universal Service Reform) Bill and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill—represent further steps in the govern­ment's reform agenda for the telecom­munications industry. Together the bills form a legislative package to reform the long-term arrangements for the delivery of universal service outcomes and related public policy outcomes, which will facilitate the transition to the National Broadband Network and a more competitive and open telecom­munications market. These bills are part of the broad package delivering the NBN, and the resulting retail competition will certainly be a boon to all Australian consumers.


The TUSMA Bill will provide the governance, funding, and reporting/account­ability framework for this new statutory agency to make sure that universal service outcomes and other key public interest services continue to be delivered effectively in this new competitive environment. TUSMA will have responsibility for putting in place contracts or grants so that all Australians continue to have reasonable access to a standard telephone service and payphones—it is absolutely essential that payphones still be available in many regional areas and absolutely essential that consumers have access to standard telephone services. I want to make it clear that people will not be forced into any complex or confusing service arrangement with any of the providers. Australians will have reasonable access to standard telephone services and payphones. 


It is also important that calls to the Emergency Call Service will continue to be handled and transferred to the relevant emergency service organisation. We have witnessed some of the most devastating disasters in this country over recent years, and the government is well aware that we have to continue to provide an Emergency Call Service under these new proposals. TUSMA will also be responsible for ensuring that the National Relay Service continues to provide voice-equivalent services for those with a hearing or speech impairment. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring that people who have impediments, either physical or mental, have access to reasonable and decent services. That is what building a good society is about. 


Appropriate consumer safeguards will be in place to support voice-only customers migrating to an NBN fibre service as Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. I have heard a lot of talk about why the copper network should be maintained, but I have also heard in my position as chair of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee about the problems with the copper network—why the copper network is decaying around the country, why the copper network is costing more and more to maintain and why we need to make sure that we do migrate to an NBN fibre service that ensures the telecommunications security and telecommunications initiatives that a modern country needs to take its place in an international economy that is becoming more and more productive and more and more competitive. We need the NBN to deliver in that area. So customers who remain fixed-line voice-only customers after migration will have appropriate safeguards.


Technological solutions will be developed as necessary to support continuity of public interest services—for example, public alarm systems and traffic lights. We all know what happens when traffic lights go down—it causes absolute chaos. It is a productivity issue, it is a social issue, people cannot get home, and companies end up losing production if there are traffic jams and traffic chaos, especially in our bigger cities. Technological solutions will be developed to support continuity of these public interest services.


A key focus for the government is to minimise disruption for consumers and industry by maintaining basic safeguards as the NBN fibre network is rolled out and replaces the old copper network. Telstra is being required to maintain its copper network to deliver voice services outside NBN fibre areas. There are some areas where the copper network is rolled out where the NBN fibre will not go in, but for voice the government is requiring Telstra to maintain that copper network. Importantly, under the agreement Telstra made with the government, announced on 23 June 2011, Telstra will also be required to be the 'retailer of last resort' for voice-only services over the NBN fibre network.


The TUSMA legislation will ensure that basic telecommunications services remain available to all Australians and that the new agency responsible for delivering these services operates efficiently, transparently and with a high degree of accountability. The TUSMA Bill creates a rigorous oversight and accountability framework for TUSMA's activities. This includes a requirement that it maintain a publicly available register with key terms and services to be provided under all contracts and grants it makes. TUSMA will also be required to prepare annual reports and corporate plans and its operations will be reviewed before 1 January 2018 to consider how effective the agency has been in achieving its policy objectives.


Because of the complexity and sensitivity of many of the issues TUSMA will deal with, decisions that affect industry and consumers will be made collectively by a chair and members who together will have an appropriate mix of industry experience. TUSMA will be a statutory agency estab­lished under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and its CEO and staff will be employed under the Public Service Act 1999. The arrangements for remuneration, disclosure, termination and delegation for the CEO and members of TUSMA generally reflect the standard approach under Commonwealth legislation, as set out in the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005.



The TUSMA Bill enables existing consumer safeguard instruments made under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protec­tion and Service Standards) Act 1999 to form the basis of contract standards or benchmarks for voice and payphone services provided under the Telstra agreement 


he minister can also determine key performance standards or benchmarks for other contracts entered into or grants made by TUSMA.


It is expected that TUSMA will have total costs of $340 million per year for its first two years and around $330 million per year after that. To help it meet these costs and alleviate the burden on industry, the government for the first time is making a significant contribution of at least $50 million in budget funding per year for the first two financial years of TUSMA's operations and $100 million per year after that. The government is also consolidating the universal service obligation and the national relay service levies into a single levy. To provide a smooth transition for industry, arrangements will be put in place for 2012-13 and 2013-14 so non-Telstra contributors do not have to contribute more than their aggregate liability for the USO and NRS levies in 2011-12. The contribution of each participant towards the proposed new levy will be based, as is currently the case, on its eligible revenue as assessed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and they will remain responsible for collecting it. Arrangements will be put in place so smaller carriers with eligible revenue of less than $25 million will not be required to contribute to the new levy, consistent with current thresholds for the USO and NRS levies.


I turn to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011. The bill primarily amends telecommunications legislation to support the new arrangements for delivery of universal service outcomes within the telecommunications sector, and facilitates the establishment of TUSMA and the smooth transition to new levy arrangements. The government has previously committed to removing USO regulation. A key aspect of the bill is a proposed framework so that after a transitional period the minister may remove USO regulatory obligations from Telstra and move to a complete contractual delivery model. USO regulation can only be removed if the minister is satisfied within two years after commencement that there are satisfactory contractual arrangements in place. The minister will be required to take into account Telstra's record of compliance with its contract and regulatory obligations and any other relevant matters. Separate decisions are required in relation to the standard telephone service and payphone elements of the USO and each decision is subject to disallowance by parliament.


If there are satisfactory contract arrangements in place, the payphones element of USO regulation will be removed across Australia; and STS USO regulation will be removed in areas that will not be covered by the NBN fibre network. STS regulation in NBN fibre areas will be progressively removed as the NBN fibre network is rolled out and Telstra implements structural separation in those areas by closing down its copper network. Even if STS USO regulation is progressively removed, the existing regulated customer service guarantee that applies to all providers of the standard telephone service will continue to apply to telephone services provided by Telstra under the TUSMA contract.


I now turn to the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill. The Telecom­munications (Industry Levy) Bill is a short bill that ensures that the government can raise the consolidated industry levy. I chaired the inquiry of the Senate Standing Com­mittee on Environment and Communications into the bill and our report was tabled last Friday. Despite some concerns about the industry levy proposed in the bill, the telecommunications industry representatives supported the structural separation of Telstra and agreed that their positions in the market will be more competitive as the NBN is implemented. That is a key point. This is the industry conceding that there will be more competition as NBN is implemented—not less, as the argument has been put by the coalition. As a consequence of submissions from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the committee recommended that TUSMA and the TIO enter into the necessary agreements to share certain information to assist TUSMA's monitoring and reporting responsibilities and that the TUSMA bill be amended to enable TUSMA to disclose information to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. This is about transparency and openness in the industry and for customers to have confidence that the whole approach is working not just for the industry but for the community.


Our inquiry also heard from the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network. As a consequence of what they had to say, we recommended that the TUSMA Bill be amended to make it a criterion for one of the appointments to TUSMA to be a person with experience or knowledge of consumer affairs—again, an important part of ensuring that there is confidence in the whole NBN approach. 


These bills before the Senate today are a part of building one of Australia's biggest infrastructure programs ever. That infrastructure program, the NBN, is about delivering affordable high-speed broadband to all Australians, no matter where they live. The NBN is already in use in Tasmania, Armidale, suburban Melbourne and Kiama. Recently, it was announced that Australia's two largest telecommunications companies, Telstra and Optus, had signed up to the NBN, and we had yesterday an announce­ment that the ACCC has given final approval to develop the NBN. That is a major landmark for the nation's telecommunica­tions industry. The National Broadband Network is a key nation-building infra­structure project. The project will deliver significantly improved broadband services for all Australians at affordable prices. It will connect our cities, our regional centres and our rural communities—something that the coalition never imagined and could never achieve in 11½ years of government. This reforms Australia's telecommunications sector. 


The NBN is critical to our future digital productivity growth. It will deliver high-speed, reliable broadband to every home and business in Australia. The NBN will provide access to high-speed broadband to 100 per cent of Australian premises. Ninety-three per cent of those premises will have access to a high-speed fibre network capable of providing broadband speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. Seven per cent of Australian premises will have access to next-generation fixed wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of 12 megabits per second. For a country like Australia, with its massive area to cover, with the concentration of populations on the coastal fringes of our country, to be able to act to provide high-speed broadband to the whole country is a nation-building exercise. It is one of the best infrastructure projects this country has ever seen and it allows Australia to improve its productivity, to improve its communications and to take its place as a modern society as the rest of the world continues to adopt broadband infrastructure.


But the NBN is just a platform; it is the use of the NBN that will enable our businesses to develop new and efficient ways of doing things—new and efficient ways of improving productivity and improving communications. The NBN infrastructure supports the evolution of the Australian economy by inspiring a new wave of digital innovation that will change and improve the way Australians live, receive services and connect with the world. It will drive productivity improvement across Australian businesses by improving logistics, expanding customer bases and creating new ways of working. It will transform service delivery, increasing efficiency and effectiveness in areas such as health, education and government services. Why should Aust­ralians in the regional areas of this country not have access to the best medical advice? The NBN delivers that. This is a transforming approach by this government. It will transform the economy, it will transform health delivery, it will transform education, it will transform every aspect of the economy.


These bills before the parliament today help that process to come to fruition. These are major initiatives by the government and they should be supported by the whole parliament.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:25):  I enjoyed hearing Senator Cameron's remarks, and I will follow on in a similar vein. The Greens will rise, as the coalition has done, to support these bills. The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and the package of other measures in the related bills that come with it are really the last legislative pieces of the puzzle for the National Broadband Network rollout. This is something that I have taken a keen interest in since I arrived here. It has been one of the defining issues, obviously, in the communications portfolio. This last piece, effectively, of the regulatory framework is certainly deserving of support.


The bills create a new statutory agency to deliver basic voice, payphone and other public interest telecommunications services at an ongoing cost to the taxpayer of $100 million per year. We heard evidence during the hearings Senator Cameron referred to in the committee that he chairs that maybe we should not be doing that anymore. Some sections of industry think, 'In an NBN world, why should we be keeping the copper network up and why should we be providing these services to people when the age of broadband is here?' The fact is that the age of broadband is not yet here. Certainly in Canberra we get services and in Melbourne we get services. In regional areas and in some outer suburban areas where costs have been cut over the last couple of years, in fact services are terrible. So it is extremely important that we maintain the universal service obligation. We believe, actually, that it should be extended—that it should be brought into the 21st century. But at the very least, while the NBN project rolls out, there is the need to preserve and protect services and to make sure that they are not cut, particularly in areas where services have never been great in the first place.


The bills also mandate reviews in the future to assess exactly how well the USO is being delivered in an NBN world. This is an issue that will need to be revisited. We welcomed input into the Senate inquiry from consumers and from end users who convinced the committee on the need for a consumer affairs representative on the TUSMA board. As Senator Cameron outlined, that was one of the recommendations that the committee took up and has proposed. I understand that the government is interested in pursuing that amendment. The Australian Greens obviously believe that the USO should be brought into the 21st century. It is not merely voice telephony and public payphones. Really what we are talking about in this age is fast data services.


The broadband network is one of the most important infrastructure projects that this country has seen. The network, once established, will bring us closer to the rest of the world and it will be the envy of many countries, given that 93 per cent of the population will have fibre coverage to homes, schools and businesses and other premises. The other seven per cent of Australia's population will have data services through wireless and satellite. It will not be as good as you can get in the metro areas, but it is a huge step change in advance of what we have been able to deliver to people thus far.


Given convergence and the increasing reliance on data services to conduct business in the daily lives of so many people, data services have become an essential service just as much as public telephony has been for many years. We welcome the work of advocates like ACCAN for remembering that this is about people. We have tended to come in here on NBN bills and have long and exotic debates about engineering problems and about competition policy, and we tend to forget that these services are about people. The really interesting questions are around what we will do with the services when they do become ubiquitous.


Some issues with the bill were raised during the committee process. Some of the smaller telcos do not believe that they should continue to pay for the USO. They think that if Telstra is out there maintaining this infrastructure then either the price tag for providing those services should be lower or they should be somehow exempt from contributing. We believe, in line with the general principal, that the areas that are easy to service—the big cities, where the profit margins can be made—should cross-subsidise services in regional areas. I do not think it should be controversial that services should be cross-subsidised in the USO. Effectively, it is one way of doing that for areas where services are patchy. We disagree with the smaller telcos and some of the providers in that instance. We think it is important to maintain the USO.


Perhaps in 10 or 20 years it will be obsolete. Perhaps by then we will have closed the copper network down and we will be providing fast data services and there will be no need for the hardline. But I would imagine that, even though people certainly are abandoning fixed-line services in homes and are transitioning across to mobiles, it is still an essential service. The copper infrastructure still has value and it still provides services that cannot be delivered, at least in 2012, through other forms of technology.


In their evidence, Macquarie and Optus certainly argued that the NBN should render the USO obsolete. Why don't we revisit that question in a decade. Provided the coalition do not destroy the project, do not rip it up or do not flog the pieces off to private industry in an attempt to somehow balance their budget black hole, we should have a piece of infrastructure that will be providing ubiquitous, fast data services to most Australians and will also be generating a return to the Australian people. That is important to remember. In the obsession with privatising essential public services and monopoly infrastructure, we are building an asset. The reason it is off budget is that we are building an asset that will return a small premium back to the taxpayer as it is paying off its debts.


ACCAN, representing end users in the committee hearings, argued for a more integrated approach to providing disability access to telecommunications services. They propose that a range of services be brought under the TUSMA umbrella to be managed in a more integrated way than they are at the moment. We were told at the hearings that the minister was contemplating it but that it was too early and the bills would need to be passed first, so we do not have resolution on that. It is something I think this chamber should pursue. People who are interested in telecommunications and in making them available to people with any form of disability should uphold the mandate that we are extending these services to all Australians. We cannot forget that perhaps this is only part of the job.


Competitors to Telstra have argued that it is not appropriate for the government to simply contract out USO services to Telstra for the next 20 years as a consequence of the deal that was done between the government and Telstra to enable the NBN to go ahead. I have some sympathy for that point of view, because we know that this deal was done behind closed doors in an effort to get Telstra on board and that the universal service obligation had to go somewhere. I think it is appropriate that it has been brought back into public hands, but of course the industry noted—I think correctly—that all we are doing is simply contracting these services straight back out to Telstra, mostly, because they still hold the copper asset.


The bill as drafted does, however, maintain a 20th-century incarnation of the USO, but only for access to voice services. This is something the Australian Greens will be pursuing. I do not think that in the 21st century it is appropriate to contemplate a universal service obligation being simply a voice service. We have moved on. The government has quite correctly proposed a huge investment in telecommunications in this country precisely to provide fast data services to people. Therefore, I think the USO itself, and what we understand by the term 'universal service', should be updated and brought into the 21st century. We will revisit those issues.


The committee made a number of recommendations—it only made three—and I think we should propose a fourth: that the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency and the TIO, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, enter into a memorandum of understanding to formalise arrangements for the TIO to provide information to TUSMA for the purposes of TUSMA's monitoring and reporting responsibilities. That is just common sense. If the government moves that amendment we will certainly be supporting it.


Recommendation two was that the bill be amended to make it a criterion for one of the appointments to the membership of TUSMA to be a person with substantial experience or knowledge and significant standing in the field of consumer affairs. Again, the Greens believe that that is entirely reasonable, and we were persuaded by the evidence given by ACCAN in their advocacy work for the people who will actually use this technology.


The committee then recommended that the bills be passed. The Australian Greens believe that we need to revisit the idea of what the USO is. What is the universal service obligation? It is not simply a voice service in the 21st century; it is something more than that. We believe those issues should be revisited.


Yesterday we saw a huge piece of the puzzle fall into place outside this chamber concerning the bills that we passed well over a year ago now relating to the structural separation of Telstra—to separate out its wholesale and retail arms. Having that agreement signed off by the regulator was an incredibly important piece of the puzzle. The regulator had been holding out for a better deal for Telstra's competitors, for the smaller carriers and for the aggregators, who will take services from the NBN. That is a question about how the competitive landscape looks over the eight- or nine-year rollout of the NBN. It was tremendously important to get that agreement on the books. It removes a significant impediment to the volume rollout. Mr Quigley of NBN Co. told a budget estimates committee the week before last that the delaying of regulatory approvals by the ACCC was having a material impact on the volume rollout—on when we actually scale the build up and start rolling past not thousands but tens and then hundreds of thousands of premises. This was being held up because the ACCC and Telstra had not been able to come to an agreement.


So, what do we have? We have the regulator on board. We have Telstra on board, despite their fierce resistance to the bills. We have to coalition on board for the structural separation undertaking. Mr Turnbull confirmed that for us yesterday. They made it sound like the idea of disaggregating the wholesale and retail arms of Telstra had been their idea all along. The fact is that the coalition held up that proposal and that bill for a year. It cost us a year in the rollout, because former senator Nick Minchin was simply in here advocating for what he thought was the best interests of Telstra. As it has turned out, the best interest of Telstra is to take its place as a retail incumbent in an NBN world with a huge expansion of a customer base into regional areas, where services have never been provided before, and to get out and compete in the marketplace as a private entity. We do not think Telstra should have ever been privatised, but since it was it should play by the rules that everybody else has to play by.


We still do not know when exactly the coalition is going to drop its strange objection to the rollout. I do not understand why or how the National Party—and Senator Williams is in the chamber with us this morning—has stayed silent while its coalition partners try to wreck a proposal to bring world-class telecommunications to regional areas. What on earth are you doing?


I think it is high time the opposition simply dropped its destructive opposition to this project. It creates a degree of uncertainty amongst the NBN engineers, the people building the project and, most importantly, the people in the communities scheduled to get the services when you have the shadow spokesperson or the Leader of the Opposition marching around the landscape saying they are going to destroy the project. It is unbelievable. Let us simply get on with it.


I look forward to the committee stage of the debate on these bills. I look forward to seeing, hopefully, the government taking up some of the proposals that were put to it by the committee. I thank the committee staff and secretariat and the other members of the committee for their contributions, and we look forward to the passage of the bills.

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (10:38):  Following on from my colleague Senator Birmingham, can I say the coalition of course supports the implementation and continuation of the universal service obligation. The coalition reluctantly recognises the need to rejig that obligation, given that this government seems so bloody-minded as to continue to implement its National Broadband Network. In that context the coalition accepts the need to deal with this legislation.


The problem we have with it is that we simply do not trust the government to deliver, given that it is insisting on creating a new bureaucracy to deal with the universal service obligation and given that there is, arguably, already in place—in ACMA—a body that could be given the task of doing it, particularly given that the new body will not have any incentive to constrain its own costs. It will be funded to the tune of a flat $100 million, with any costs over and above that to be raised by an industry levy. That is, it will be paid for by participants in the industry. Ultimately, those costs will be passed on to consumers. And whilst TUSMA, the new agency, will be constrained by its policy objectives, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 gives the minister the discretion to expand the tasks TUSMA has—for example, on a public interest basis.


The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network has already recommended that the objectives of TUSMA be expanded—for example, to provide for people with a disability. That may well be a very good cause, and one can imagine the pressure to be put on the good minister—the minister for technology and gadgets—to expand the objectives of TUSMA to cover that. That is but one example of the sorts of ways in which the role of TUSMA may be expanded, with consequent and significant cost implications.


So why don't we trust the government to deliver? When the government first announced a version of its National Broad­band Network dream it was, as Senator Birmingham correctly said, a $4.7 billion promise for fibre to the node. When the tender fell in a heap, that promise was aborted and replaced by the promise that this government is now struggling to implement: the promise of a $43 billion fibre-to-the-home network. But the rollout of the NBN has been plagued by delays, secrecy, overspending and lack of transparency. Just a fortnight ago at estimates we were told that NBN Co. is falling well short of the fibre targets that NBN Co. projected—




Senator Conroy:
  No, you weren't—don't tell fibs!




Senator FISHER:
  in 2010, Minister, you know it well, for 2012. The minister attempted to downplay those projections on the basis that they were based on assumptions that have not been realised. It may well be—




Senator Conroy:
  'It may'; don't let the facts get in the way.




Senator FISHER:
  It may well be that the delay in reaching a deal with Telstra has impacted on those targets. It may well be that the delivery of fibre to greenfields sites was passed from NBN Co. back to Telstra. So it may well be that critical assumptions upon which NBN Co.'s 2010 projection was based—




Senator Conroy:
  Have changed.




Senator FISHER:
  It may be that those assumptions have changed. But the fact remains, Minister, that NBN Co. has still not met the targets projected in its 2010 corporate plan.




Senator Conroy:
  It couldn't.




Senator FISHER:
  Minister, it matters little that it couldn't; it projected that it would, if these assumptions came to bear. It was the government's task to ensure that these assumptions did come to bear so that you could deliver on your overall promise for the NBN. But not only did NBN Co. fail to deliver on its projection, it has spectacularly failed to deliver—or should I say demonstrably failed, because 'spectacu­larly' is meant to be a good word, and it is not good that they have failed to deliver.


The NBN Co. corporate plan, published in 2010, promised that fibre would pass by some 260,000 premises by June of this year. Yet, to date, just under 19,000 premises have been passed with fibre. And passing them with fibre is just the first step, because then they have to bother with getting connected. Some 19,000 of some 260,000 is only seven per cent of the target. That is a compelling 93 per cent shortfall from target, or some 240,000 premises, that NBN Co. has to address in the next four months—which it will not do, of course—in order to realise the target that it set two years ago. Because the assumptions failed to be met, NBN Co. did not pass fibre by one house in the last six months of last year. The ACCC's approval of the technical criteria in recent days will now free up the rollout of the NBN. We look forward to that changing. But we have little confidence that NBN Co.—or this government—will be able to deliver many of the targets that it puts before the Australian people.


The government is continuing to make it difficult for not only the opposition and other parliamentary parties but the Australian people themselves to work out whether or not the taxpayer is getting value for money with the rollout of the NBN. In answer to a specific question during the committee inquiry about the TUSMA model for the delivery of the USO and the negotiations with Telstra about the Telstra agreement, particularly as to whether future payments from TUSMA, the new agency, to Telstra under the Telstra agreement were a financial gain to Telstra, the department said:


This is a vexed question that you have obviously had quite a few people raise with you, as they have with us over the full course of these negotiations.


Of course, coalition senators, as part of what Senator Cameron said was 'my inquiry', considered at one point—as the minority on the committee inquiry chaired by Senator Cameron—that the negotiations were deficient. But leaving that aside for the moment, the department said:


This is a vexed question …  We think that we did a good job in negotiating a price with Telstra. … As to the actual cost of delivering them—


the services—


all I can say is that the negotiations with Telstra were very difficult. Whether there is a margin in there for Telstra I simply do not know. Telstra would not tell us and they did not tell you. Nobody else knows, so I cannot answer your question definitively. All I can say is that we did our best to negotiate a minimum price and we had some independent reassurance. 


The total lack of transparency in developing the TUSMA model and negotiating the agreement with Telstra to contract to deliver the USO is a fundamental concern given this government's track record on the rollout of the rest of the NBN, but it is hardly a surprise. I said earlier that Telstra has no incentive to constrain costs. From 2014 to 2015 the government's contribution—so read for that from the taxpayers—will be a flat $100 million and any blowout in TUSMA's costs will be recoverable through an industry levy with those costs ultimately to be passed on to consumers.


I also said earlier that we struggle to understand the necessity to create a new bureaucracy. As my good colleague Senator Birmingham said, this government has never met a bureaucracy that it did not love. Not only do we struggle to understand that, and I do not think that is to do with our IQ; it is particularly hard to understand that given that the government has largely removed the need for the new agency, TUSMA, to make decisions about contracts to deliver the USO for the next 20 years because that is done and dusted with this bill. It is only after the next 20 years that it is opened up to competition for others to deliver.


In the time that is remaining I want to raise some of the evidence that was given to the committee. For example, there is that from Macquarie Telecom, which said it was concerned about many aspects of the bills before the committee which included the limited capacity for industry participation in negotiations or consultation, the flawed basis upon which the universal service obligation was now based and the scope of universal service, which is an issue that I addressed earlier. The Optus evidence was interesting. Optus said that the universal service obligation bills were a missed opportunity because, in Optus's view, significant structural changes were having to happen because of the deployment of the NBN so the traditional USO network was no longer required—correct. Optus was saying that the most efficient and effective response would have been to either remove or significantly scale back that framework, hence a missed opportunity. They also talked about the increase in the cost of delivery of the USO from $160.5 million per year to $340 million per year without any additional consumer benefit and said, more so, that proposed changes to costing and funding were not, in Optus's view, competitively neutral given that Telstra's supply costs would be unchanged whilst the payments it got, which were funded by its competitors through the levy and passed on to consumers, would be significantly increased under the new arrangements. Optus also reinforced the concerns that TUSMA simply added a new level of bureaucracy and cost to the delivery of the USO which may lead to consequent cost increases and there being a barrier to long-term reform, given the fact that the minister had the ultimate discretion to expand the statutory functions that TUSMA was to perform.


Telstra was at pains to say that it supported the USO bills in the context of facilitating the implementation of the agreement and as part of Telstra's broader participation in the rollout of the NBN. But it did observe that the bills in their entirety would, in Telstra's view, increase adminis­trative costs and it said it had some concerns within its own house with respect to delegations and discretions, particularly those in the lap of the minister. Other comments from other witnesses, such as ACCAN and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, have been raised by colleagues, in particular Senator Ludlam.


So it is given these contexts that the coalition continue to be concerned. Whilst we totally support the universal service obligation and the need to recharacterise it as the government continues to attempt to deliver on its National Broadband Network promises, we have little confidence that the government will do so in an effective and efficient way. That having been said, we reluctantly support this legislation.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (10:52):  Firstly, can I thank all of those who have made a contribution. I welcome the opposition's constructive approach in supporting these bills, albeit with some reservations, and I am sure we will have a healthy discussion during the committee stage. We do welcome the support for the bills.


The package of three bills, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, will provide a flexible, accountable and transparent model for delivering and funding public policy objectives in the telecommunications sector. The reforms contained in the bills being considered are aimed at ensuring continuity of key consumer safeguards through the transition to the National Broadband Network and into the future. These include ensuring reasonable access to standard telephone services and payphones, the National Relay Service and the emergency call service. The bills address important unfinished business dating back to the privatisation of Telstra. They provide for increased transparency and rigour in the delivery of basic consumer safeguards. Under this approach, the realistic costs of delivering these important services will be appropriately recognised.


The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency—or TUSMA, as it has now become known as—Bill 2011 will establish a new entity to support continuity of key telecommunications safeguards in the transition to the National Broadband Network. TUSMA will be a small statutory agency with responsibility for the delivery of the universal service obligation—or USO, as it is more commonly known—and other public interest telecommunications services. The opposition has suggested that TUSMA will employ an army of bureaucrats. This is clearly absurd, given that TUSMA's administration costs are expected to be around $5 million per annum. It will be focused on efficient and effective contract management, despite the claims of those opposite. TUSMA will have the benefit of industry knowledge and experience, and incentives, to ensure contracts are efficiently and effectively managed. TUSMA will enter into and administer contracts and grants for these services in accordance with the policy objectives set out in the TUSMA Bill.


The creation of TUSMA is necessary because the rollout of the wholesale-only National Broadband Network and yesterday's historic acceptance of Telstra's structural separation undertaking will fundamentally change the structure of the Australian telecommunications market. These changes will see Telstra's near ubiquitous national copper fixed line network progressively decommissioned as NBN Co. rolls out its next generation fibre network. These changes will empower TUSMA to require carriage service providers to provide information or documents to TUSMA that are relevant to the achievement of the voice-only migration policy objective. 


The current USO regulatory arrangements that are imposed on Telstra were designed for a market where there was a vertically integrated operator of a national telecommunications network. The new National Broadband Network environment will enable all retail service providers to offer high-quality broadband services nationally. Therefore, in this environment it is appropriate to introduce a more competitive and open model for delivering universal service and other public policy telecommunications outcomes. These new arrangements will benefit both consumers and industry by promoting more innovative, effective and efficient service delivery arrangements. They will also clearly separate policy, regulatory and contractual functions respectively between the department, the Australians Communications and Media Authority—ACMA—and TUSMA. As such, TUSMA will be fulfilling different objectives to the ACMA. TUSMA will be subject to rigorous transparency and accountability requirements. This will help ensure that costs to industry do not increase unnecessarily.


The agreement with Telstra includes a range of incentives to promote cost savings. Further, a structured program of reviews provides opportunities for voice and payphone services to be provided more efficiently. In relation to concerns that TUSMA's scope should not increase unnecessarily, the legislation does provide some flexibility so that the services it delivers can be modified as circumstances change. Despite, again, the opposition's claims to the contrary, any proposed changes will be subject to clear parliamentary oversight and scrutiny.


The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 amends the universal service regime in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protec­tion and Service Standards) Act 1999. The amendments mean that within approximately two years of commencement of TUSMA's operations the minister must consider whether it is appropriate to remove the current regulated USO on Telstra to make the standard telephone service and payphones reasonably accessible. Subject to Telstra's record of compliance with its contractual and regulatory obligations, the minister may then make declarations that will commence the process for lifting regulation and shifting to a contractual model for the provision of universal service outcomes.


The Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 provides for the imposition of a new levy. This levy will replace two existing separate industry levies and will contribute to meeting TUSMA's costs for delivery of the USO and other public policy telecommunications outcomes. For the first time, government will also be making a substantial contribution towards TUSMA's costs and the delivery of key com­munications public interest safeguards. The government's budget contribution will be at least $50 million in 2012-13 and 2013-14 and $100 million each financial year thereafter. The government has also committed to increase its base funding in the first two financial years so that contributors to the industry levy, with the exception of Telstra, will not face an increase to that aggregate funding contribution. Furthermore, the government has also committed to review the levy arrangements and the need for any additional budget funding above its committed base funding during the course of the first two years of TUSMA's operation. 


The TUSMA bill creates a rigorous oversight and accountability framework. The new legislation will provide for TUSMA to have a board structure and require the minister to ensure that TUSMA includes members who have substantial experience and knowledge of and significant standing in the operation of the telecommunications industry and business or financial management. These members will be expected to take a strong role in managing the costs of TUSMA activities. TUSMA will also maintain publicly available registers of the contracts and grants it administers and report annually to the minister on all significant matters relating to the performance of contractors and grant recipients. It will prepare a corporate plan every three years as well as a comprehensive annual report. It will provide reports or information to the minister on specified matters relating to the performance of TUSMA's functions and undergo a comprehensive review for 1 July 2018. 


This accountability framework, together with the existing reporting requirements for statutory agencies under the FMA Act, will help give stakeholders the confidence that TUSMA will use its funding to fulfil its functions and policy objectives in an efficient, effective and appropriate manner. TUSMA will also be able to share information with other agencies and persons such as the ACCC and the ACMA. 


I want to address a couple of the arguments that have been put forward by those opposite. They have argued that the government did not follow due process in negotiating its contract with Telstra for the delivery of the USO and other public interest services. However, Telstra is the primary universal service provider under legislation and is the only telecommunications provider with a national, ubiquitous fixed line network that can be used to ensure the continuity of key telecommunications services during the transition to the National Broadband Network. I would also note that there have been contestability arrangements under the USO since 2001, but no alternative providers have sought to supply services under these arrangements to date. People who are currently receiving key services need certainty that their services will not be disrupted, possibly for a long time, while a new USO provider rolls out a network or finalises negotiations for access to infrastructure. 


TUSMA's 20-year agreement with Telstra to deliver key services such as standard phone services and public payphones will ensure continuity of basic safeguards for Australians and will strengthen the safety net for rural and regional Australia. I know there are some on the other side of the chamber who strongly claim to support basic safeguards for rural and regional Australia and a safety net. So we welcome their support for this bill. The agreement with Telstra does not—



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  You are buying back the copper, mate. That is not bad. Buying back the copper—that is a classic. The agreement with Telstra does not preclude contestability for other key services that TUSMA will deliver under the contract. Seriously, you are renationalising the copper. What a cracker of a policy. The opposition has claimed that other services will not be subject to contestable arrangements. This is simply not true. Existing national relay service contracts are due to expire shortly and a competitive process will need to be run by TUSMA before 1 July 2013. The government has also committed to TUSMA undertaking a competitive process for the emergency call service within five years. By introducing a more contestable and flexible model for providing the USO these bills will promote greater efficiency, transparency and competition in the delivery of the telecommunications services that Australians rely on while preserving key consumer safeguards. 


So I do commend these bills to the Senate but it is important to take into account that the National Broadband Network is being heavily contested. Senator Williams is going to slide out of the chamber now—sliding away from his commitments to regional and rural Australians, but they will be heartened by the fact that you want to renationalise. Did he check with you, Senator Fisher? Malcolm Turnbull yesterday announced that he is renationalising the copper. He said he will instruct the National Broadband Network company to take over Telstra's copper lines—renationalising it. That is what he announced, seriously. You should not let him blog—not live blog. It is really tragic. Renationalising the copper—I love it. Did he clear that with anyone, Senator Birmingham? Did anybody see it at all? Did anybody at all know what he was doing yesterday? That is billions of dollars that he has committed to give to Telstra to buy an asset that is dying in the ground, that is literally disintegrating in the ground, and he is going to give them billions of dollars for it. Even when they tried that on us we would not be in it. Fair dinkum, it is a cracker of a policy. I cannot wait to hear more about it. I look forward to seeing how much—



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  We are bypassing them. We are paying for them to come across and we are renting their ducts. We would never have been mugs enough to buy their copper. Buying their copper! Goodness me! Did you hear that, Senator Ludlam? I know you are back in the chamber now, and I will wind up in a moment. Did you know that the Liberal-National Party announced yesterday they are renationalising the copper network? 




Senator Ludlam:
  Communists. 




Senator CONROY:
  I think that needs to go on the record. Senator Scott Ludlam for the Greens just called the Liberal Nationals 'communists'. That has to go on the record. With that thought in mind—



Senator Mason interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  You will be voting for this, apparently, Senator. You spent your entire political life, to your credit, fighting communism. You thought you had led the destruction of communism only to discover that once you got back into bed with those rural socialists they'd get ya! And now we have a policy to renationalise copper. So I will leave it at that, Senator Ludlam, and look forward to the chamber's support for these bills.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:36):  As I rise to make a contribution to this debate I am very pleased to once again have an opportunity to put on record my support of the National Broadband Network. I am proud to be part of a government that recognises the importance of bringing Australia's broadband services into the 21st century. As we move towards a digital economy we need to remain competitive in our region, and this is why we are delivering the NBN. No matter what the location, the NBN will ensure high-speed broadband to everywhere in Australia. All homes, schools and businesses will be included.


Fibre-to-the-premises technology, with speeds of one gigabit per second, will connect 93 per cent of premises. Satellite and wireless technology will service the rest of Australia and provide faster and affordable broadband. To put it in layman's terms, what we are talking about is broadband speed a thousand times faster than the speed that many people currently receive. Rural and regional communities, such as my home state of Tasmania, have already started to benefit from the NBN and will continue to prosper and thrive with the assistance of high-speed broadband. The NBN is the single largest infrastructure investment made by an Australian government. It will deliver a once-in-a-generation improvement of our telecommunications infrastructure and it will benefit all Australians. It is cutting-edge technology that will transform our economy and create new ways of connecting with each other and the world.


There have been Australian and international studies that have shown broadband to be one of the strongest ways to increase social and economic development. The Connecting Communities review by a global telecommunications solutions provider looked at the benefits of broadband in the United Kingdom and what this means for Australia. The findings were that high-speed broadband is directly related to strong regional areas and attracting and retaining employees, and also contributes to a low-carbon future. It can be summed up as being 'transformational for Australia'.


We know that, as a significant nation building project, the NBN will end up paying for itself. The advantages it will provide are incredibly widespread and touch on every facet of our lives, including health, education and business. At a grassroots level it will mean that local businesses can develop and get in touch with new markets and that people will be able to access health care without having to leave their homes.


I would like to share a story from my home state of Tasmania, which I know you will be interested in, Mr Deputy President, that highlights the benefits of the NBN. It involves a sign-writing business in Midway Point, which was one of the three towns in the initial rollout. Midway Point is in the electorate of Lyons and is represented by Dick Adams, who is a strong supporter of the NBN and a great advocate for his community. This business has seen an increase in its capacity to attract customers thanks to the NBN. As the broadband speed is faster and more reliable, large artwork files can now be sent and retrieved in a matter of seconds, which is a dramatic improvement and has increased the number of clients wanting to do business with it. The NBN means that distance is no longer an impediment to running a successful business, which is crucial for businesses in regional and rural Australia. This is just one example of the many success stories that highlight how the NBN is changing lives and creating opportunities.


Midway Point is joined by Scottsdale and Smithton as the towns where NBN services are currently available in Tasmania, and work has either commenced or will com­mence in 12 months on a number of other locations. These locations are George Town, Deloraine, Triabunna, Sorell, Somerset, St Helens, Launceston, South Launceston, Bellerive, Hobart, Kingston and Claremont. In Tasmania it is estimated that within 12 months 15,000 homes will have access to the NBN, with work planned to start on an extra 76,000 in the coming year.


Despite hearing stories about the very positive impact the NBN is having on people out there in the community, those opposite are hell bent on preventing Australians from having a world-class, affordable broadband service. If they were serious about ensuring Australians are able to access world-class telecommunications infrastructure, they would support the NBN rollout, as it is supported throughout the community.


This government wants everyone to have access to high-speed broadband, no matter where they live, and we are committed to delivering it for all Australians. As we continue this mission, the Telecom­munications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecom­munications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 are part of a package of legislation aimed at enabling the continuity of key telecom­munications safeguards. These bills are part of the next stage in the government's reform agenda for the telecommunications industry. The bills seek to reform the arrangements for the delivery of universal service and public policy outcomes. This will aid the evolution to the NBN and a more competitive telecommunications market.


Breaking this package down, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill provides the governance, funding and accountability framework for this new statutory agency. It will ensure that universal service outcomes and other important services for the community will still be delivered in a new competitive circumstance. The new entity will guarantee that all Australians have sufficient access to a standard telephone service and payphones, guarantee the continuing delivery of the Emergency Call Service and the National Relay Service, and guarantee that appropriate safeguards are in place to support voice-only customers transferring to an NBN fibre service as Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. It will also ensure that technological solutions will be developed to support the continuity of public interest services such as public alarm systems and traffic lights. These are vital ways to ensure the continuity of basic services to Australians in light of the changes to the telecommunications industry that will take place with the rollout of the NBN, including the gradual decom­missioning of Telstra's copper customer access network. The government is committed to reducing the disruption for industry and the wider community by keeping these basic safeguards.


Telstra will be required to keep its copper network to deliver voice services outside NBN fibre areas and will also be the retailer of last resort for voice-only services over the NBN fibre network. As well as providing accessible basic services, the legislation will also ensure that the new agency operates in an accountable and transparent manner. It will be required to keep a publicly available register with key terms and services to be provided under all contracts and grants, as well to as prepare annual reports and corporate plans. There will be a review before 1 January 2018 to consider how effective the agency has been. The estimated total cost of the agency is $340 million per year for its first two years and around $330 million per year following that. To help with these costs the government is contributing at least $50 million in funding per year for the first two financial years and $100 million per year after that.


The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill chiefly amends telecommunications legislation to assist the new arrangements for delivery of universal service outcomes within the telecommunications sector and to facilitate the establishment of the new agency and the changeover to new levy arrangements. An important part of the bill is the proposal of a robust framework for contracting with service providers for the delivery of universal service outcomes and related public interest services in the telecommunications sector. The Telecom­munications (Industry Levy) Bill is a bill that ensures the government can raise the consolidated industry levy. This package of legislation further progresses the work the government is doing to reform the telecom­munications industry and continue with the rollout of the NBN. The government is committed to giving all Australians access to affordable and high-speed broadband services. The NBN is critical infrastructure that will connect Australians with each other and the world, and I commend the bills to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-02-29,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:45):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and related bills. But, with the indulgence of the Senate, I will just touch on a couple of other matters initially. Firstly, because I may not have a chance on the record at any other time today to say this, I note that today, being the last day of February, is the culmination of Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. Knowing that Senator Conroy's office would be monitoring this, as this is his legislation, I note the participation of Senator Conroy and in particular his wife, Paula, in the ovarian cancer breakfast held in Parliament House this morning, and I note in this place, appropriately, the memories that many have of my predecessor in this Senate seat and your predecessor, Mr Deputy President, as Liberal Party whip, Senator Jeannie Ferris, who did so much to raise awareness of ovarian cancer during her battle, which she ultimately succumbed to, with ovarian cancer.


This legislation has come on a little earlier than anticipated because of the filibustering tactics the Greens are employing on the radioactive waste legislation—a shameful tactic from the Greens, who do not seem to recognise the importance to Australia of ensuring that we have a central repository for radioactive waste in this country. I note that having brought this debate on, though, this has moved out into an area of legislation where there is some broad agreement of principle and some concern over detail.


The universal service obligation is an important tenet and feature of Australia's telecommunications policy. It requires that basic telecommunications services, including home telephone services, business telephone services and payphones, be accessible to all Australians in a fair and equitable basis at an affordable price. The universal service obligation is especially important for telecommunications consumers in rural and regional Australia, as it ensures that basic telco services are available where it may not otherwise be economically viable for telecommunications companies to provide them. Without this subsidy, the tyranny of distance would be all the greater for many rural Australians who may not be able to afford basic services. For this reason, the coalition strongly support the USO. We have always done so, and we continue to do so. It is consistent with our overall support for communications services of the highest standard and order in rural and regional Australia.


Our support has not just been for the USO. If we look at what we had in place at the end of the Howard government, we see that we had in place a number of measures that were designed to provide a better standard and to continually raise the standard and the bar of telco services for rural and regional Australians. I think immediately of the regional telecommunications fund—$2 billion that had been set aside to be able to provide a constant source of funding to upgrade services to rural and regional Australians. Sadly, that fund is no more because, like all available piggy banks under this government, it has been raided and spent. It was spent in this case on the National Broadband Network, which thus far is not exactly rolling out vast new services in rural and regional Australia at a rapid pace.


Indeed, if we compare the NBN and where it is up to in its provision of, especially, wireless services to regional communities with what the coalition had in place at the end of the Howard government, we will see that we were on track to deliver wireless services to regional communities within a few years. They would have already had services under the OPEL contract that would have provided for better regional telecommunications services today than they currently have. That would have been delivered under a contract signed by the previous government and funded by the previous government and that would already have been operational today. Instead, we continue to hear promises but see delays from the government as it rolls out the NBN. We hear promises but there are delays and therefore consumers in rural and regional Australia are still waiting to see the genuine benefits of this claimed NBN.


Telstra currently delivers the universal service obligation. Being a former monopoly provider and the owner of much of Australia's fixed line telecommunications infrastructure, Telstra's role in this is understandable. Current regulation requires Telstra to provide basic services at an equitable rate. To compensate Telstra for this obligation, all telco carriers are levied, with the majority of funds raised provided to Telstra to offset the cost of their undertakings in this area. Presently the levy raised is approximately $145 million. This legislation also affects the provision of the Emergency Call Service and the National Relay Service. The National Relay Service delivers voice-equivalent services to Australians with speech or hearing impairments through voice-to-text and text-to-voice technologies. The NRS, I understand, costs around $17 million under its current contract provider.


Telstra has argued for some time that the fees levied from service providers which it receives to compensate it for the cost it incurs in relation to the provision of the USO are insufficient. Unsurprisingly, Telstra's retail competitors, who are levy payers, have opposed any increase to the levy. This legislation provides ultimately a convenient escape from this argument between companies. The government commissioned the Castalia report, an independent expert report, to consider this matter. It found that the cost of providing the USO combined with the cost of the NRS and provision of public payphones amounted to at least $250 million and up to $300 million annually. While this will in theory end the argument between Telstra and other retail service providers, it opens up a new potential front for argument between retail telco service providers and the government and in particular the new Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, TUSMA. We have seen that already with many of the other retail service providers in the telco space questioning the validity of the Castalia report and the costs and doubting whether the sums involved are indeed appropriate. While the current USO was appropriate while Telstra was the owner and operator of Australia's fixed line telecommunications network, with the changed environment foreshadowed by the government through their NBN and of course the planned ripping out of the copper network right around Australia—if, indeed, this ever does occur given the appallingly slow or extravagantly expensive rollout of the NBN to date—it makes sense to plan to alter the arrangements of the USO to fit with the government's overall policy direction. This bill is before us largely because Labor is seeking to create the NBN—a massive government owned communications infrastructure monopoly that will stifle competition and innovation in Australia's telecommunications sector, but that should not be any surprise to anybody given that private ownership, efficiency, competition and business innovation are anathema to what this government stands for. Nonetheless, as the government intends to limit facilities based competition by ripping copper line from the ground and implementing its new regulatory regime with a monopoly fibre provider, we must address the provision of the important services contained in the USO.


On the coalition side we expect transparency and competition in government tenders for services. The question here is whether the processes set out through this legislation and already undertaken by the government as part of the new TUSMA arrangement actually meet with those expectations of the coalition. This process sees the costs of services revealed and openly and transparently funded by both taxpayers and the retail service providers—not to mention it removes a somewhat onerous regulatory requirement from a private business: Telstra. This is all something that our party welcomes. If only the NBN as a whole was as transparent and up-front about the costs, subsidies and competitive impacts of this unprecedented government intervention.


While I welcome the increased transparency of the amount involved and the replacement of the USO and NRS levies with a single levy and the funding arrangements for it, there is of course, as always with Labor, a catch. As we have seen so openly this week, there is always more than meets the eye. Whenever Labor seeks to simplify, the outcome is always more complex. Whenever Labor seeks to cut costs, the outcome is always more expensive. Whenever Labor seeks to reduce regulation, the outcome is always a new bureaucracy. Labor talks of efficient government and transparent government, but it is of course addicted to bloated, big, inefficient government.


These bills sadly provide for more of the same in some ways. These bills create yet another new bureaucracy. We all know Labor has never seen a bureaucracy that it did not like. This time it is the Telecom­munications Universal Service Management Agency, or TUSMA—a mouthful if you do not take the acronym. TUSMA will be created to do what the Australian Communications and Media Authority already does in part—that is, assume responsibility for the USO. I am not sure why the minister lacked confidence in the ACMA to administer all of the operation of the USO, and perhaps he can explain this for us when he sums up. Indeed, perhaps he needs some extra positions to appoint some of his Labor mates to. Maybe we will even see Senator Arbib bobbing up and helping with the USO in his next life. As I understand it, the ACMA will of course continue to collect the industry levy, which will fund the USO. I understand that ACMA has staff of around 40 engaged in the responsibility for the USO and associated aspects. TUSMA will oversee the new regime and it will come at an administrative cost of around $5 million.


I mentioned earlier that the coalition, by our very nature, expect open and transparent tenders for government services, so it is therefore disappointing that, far from taking the opportunity to put the USO and NRS services out to a competitive, open tender, the government have entered into a 20-year contract with Telstra. We all know that Telstra's cooperation and acquiescence to the NBN model is essential for the success of the NBN model. Obviously in this case we see that, even with the USO contract, it does appear to have the image, as suggested by many, of being wrapped up as a potential little sweetener valued at around $2.7 billion over 10 years for Telstra.


One of the TUSMA jobs is to enter into contracts for the delivery of the USO. That begs the question that, if one of their core jobs is to enter into contracts for delivery of the USO but the government has already agreed to the first 20 years worth of contracts, perhaps the new bureaucratic agency is going to have a rather quiet first 20 years. Indeed, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy said as much during the inquiry into these bills. Departmental deputy secretary Mr Quinlivan stated:


These measures were agreed to support the government's broader package of telecom­munications reforms, implementation of the NBN and, most importantly in this context, the structural separation of Telstra.


We see an admission there from the department that this is not a pure approach about simply the provision of universal services to rural and regional Australians; this of course is all embedded in the government's approach to the implemen­tation of the NBN and the structural of separation of Telstra. Yesterday, the ACCC approved a much revised structural separa­tion undertaking between the government and Telstra—a structural separation undertaking that at least now does not include some of the remarkable provisions that NBN Co. and the government had sought to impose upon Telstra in the first place. Those conditions would have seen them limited to the manner in which they conducted competition for their non-fixed line businesses and non-fibre businesses and would have seen them not able to effectively promote their wireless services against NBN Co.'s monopoly services, because so scared is the government of any semblance of competition against its NBN model. I do not begrudge Telstra receiving this contract. It probably is at the current point in time the best placed of Australia's service providers to deliver it, given, of course, that it continues to be with the copper line being the product provided to the overwhelming majority of Australian premises. It is the owner of that service and the one best placed to ensure its maintenance and continuance into the future. We have the strange situation under the NBN model and under this proposal that the copper line is going to have to be maintained in certain parts of Australia for an indefinite period of time. Whilst the government proposes to rip up, switch off and disconnect the copper line services for 93 per cent of Australian premises—if, of course, it ever gets that far with its NBN—there is a question mark that remains for the remainder and an uncertainty as to how the services under the USO are going to be provided to those remaining households into the future in a cost-effective manner for all involved. The problem that we have, however, with the Telstra contract, with the report that was undertaken and with the approach going forward is that we will never know for sure if due process really was followed. Certainly we know that there was no real open tender conducted at this stage of events.


Senator Conroy, as the responsible minister, has quite an interesting history when it comes to tenders. I reflect on NBN stage 1 and the tender that was undertaken at that stage to provide the fibre-to-the-node broadband service. Fibre to the node was what the Labor government was originally elected promising. This was, if my memory is correct, a $4.7 billion promise.




Senator Ludwig:
  Did you buy the copper?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Ludwig wants to ask if we have bought the copper. As I just reflected, Senator Ludwig, large parts of Australia—including large parts of rural and regional Australia, critical to your portfolio—are in theory going to continue to be reliant on copper services under this proposal for an indefinite period of time into the future. But Senator Conroy went through that $4.7-ish billion contract for NBN stage 1, for fibre-to-the-node services, only, having spent millions of dollars on that tender, to have to abandon and scrap it, having wasted countless hours of government and private sector time, and to come up with a new model that just shifted the decimal place across by one so that we ended up with something closer to a $50 billion proposal. Clearly it was not a big deal to the government, because equally, as we all know, it was all dreamt up on the back of a serviette, or both sides of a serviette, or both sides of an envelope or a drinks coaster, on that famous VIP flight between Melbourne and Brisbane.


Senator Conroy, of course, continued his interesting history with tender processes in the recent Australia Network contract debacle that the government engaged in, which once again saw millions of dollars and countless hours of government and private sector time wasted on a botched tender process that is now the subject of dual investigations by the Australian Federal Police and the Auditor-General's office. But I digress. Senator Conroy has so many problems and debacles that I could not possibly cover them all now, so I shall return to the issue of TUSMA.


The coalition is concerned that telecommunications service providers, and ultimately consumers and taxpayers, will end up potentially paying more as a result of TUSMA and the arrangements in place. TUSMA's running costs will be paid and borne in part by taxpayers, at least over the immediate future, and of course by the telecommunications industry through the levy structure, with the government initially providing a flat $100 million contribution to provide the gap between existing levy arrangements and the expected funding necessary for the new USO arrangements. Of course, the industry levy structure in the future has the risk and the fear that there is a lack of incentive to rein in costs, and that has created fears that many retail service providers expressed to the Senate inquiry: they feared that the hit to industry and the costs to consumers will continue to grow and grow. Perhaps, if the government had conducted proper consultations on this matter, the reform would not have caused the concern in the telco sector that we heard about through the Senate inquiry. There was genuine concern about the consultation process and the government's admissions, effectively, that this was all wrapped up before the final legislation was developed. So we come to this process wanting to support the USO and accepting that a new model is necessary given the government's policy direction but with concerns about the bureaucracy and costs which will be expressed later.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2012-02-29,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:05):  I am pleased to rise to support the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the TUSMA Bill, and also the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011, or the reform bill, and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, or the levy bill. This legislative package delivers on the reforms to the universal service obligation announced by the government in June 2010 when Telstra entered into the financial heads of agreement with NBN Co. that set in motion Telstra's structural separation. I am pleased that that structural separation was approved by the ACCC yesterday. It is something that those opposite could never achieve in 11½ years of government. The bills will allow the progressive migration of Telstra's customers to the NBN Co.'s fibre network, a network that takes Australia into the modern age of telecommunications.


The three bills the government proposes to introduce to parliament—the TUSMA Bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Universal Service Reform) Bill and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill—represent further steps in the govern­ment's reform agenda for the telecom­munications industry. Together the bills form a legislative package to reform the long-term arrangements for the delivery of universal service outcomes and related public policy outcomes, which will facilitate the transition to the National Broadband Network and a more competitive and open telecom­munications market. These bills are part of the broad package delivering the NBN, and the resulting retail competition will certainly be a boon to all Australian consumers.


The TUSMA Bill will provide the governance, funding, and reporting/account­ability framework for this new statutory agency to make sure that universal service outcomes and other key public interest services continue to be delivered effectively in this new competitive environment. TUSMA will have responsibility for putting in place contracts or grants so that all Australians continue to have reasonable access to a standard telephone service and payphones—it is absolutely essential that payphones still be available in many regional areas and absolutely essential that consumers have access to standard telephone services. I want to make it clear that people will not be forced into any complex or confusing service arrangement with any of the providers. Australians will have reasonable access to standard telephone services and payphones. 


It is also important that calls to the Emergency Call Service will continue to be handled and transferred to the relevant emergency service organisation. We have witnessed some of the most devastating disasters in this country over recent years, and the government is well aware that we have to continue to provide an Emergency Call Service under these new proposals. TUSMA will also be responsible for ensuring that the National Relay Service continues to provide voice-equivalent services for those with a hearing or speech impairment. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring that people who have impediments, either physical or mental, have access to reasonable and decent services. That is what building a good society is about. 


Appropriate consumer safeguards will be in place to support voice-only customers migrating to an NBN fibre service as Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. I have heard a lot of talk about why the copper network should be maintained, but I have also heard in my position as chair of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee about the problems with the copper network—why the copper network is decaying around the country, why the copper network is costing more and more to maintain and why we need to make sure that we do migrate to an NBN fibre service that ensures the telecommunications security and telecommunications initiatives that a modern country needs to take its place in an international economy that is becoming more and more productive and more and more competitive. We need the NBN to deliver in that area. So customers who remain fixed-line voice-only customers after migration will have appropriate safeguards.


Technological solutions will be developed as necessary to support continuity of public interest services—for example, public alarm systems and traffic lights. We all know what happens when traffic lights go down—it causes absolute chaos. It is a productivity issue, it is a social issue, people cannot get home, and companies end up losing production if there are traffic jams and traffic chaos, especially in our bigger cities. Technological solutions will be developed to support continuity of these public interest services.


A key focus for the government is to minimise disruption for consumers and industry by maintaining basic safeguards as the NBN fibre network is rolled out and replaces the old copper network. Telstra is being required to maintain its copper network to deliver voice services outside NBN fibre areas. There are some areas where the copper network is rolled out where the NBN fibre will not go in, but for voice the government is requiring Telstra to maintain that copper network. Importantly, under the agreement Telstra made with the government, announced on 23 June 2011, Telstra will also be required to be the 'retailer of last resort' for voice-only services over the NBN fibre network.


The TUSMA legislation will ensure that basic telecommunications services remain available to all Australians and that the new agency responsible for delivering these services operates efficiently, transparently and with a high degree of accountability. The TUSMA Bill creates a rigorous oversight and accountability framework for TUSMA's activities. This includes a requirement that it maintain a publicly available register with key terms and services to be provided under all contracts and grants it makes. TUSMA will also be required to prepare annual reports and corporate plans and its operations will be reviewed before 1 January 2018 to consider how effective the agency has been in achieving its policy objectives.


Because of the complexity and sensitivity of many of the issues TUSMA will deal with, decisions that affect industry and consumers will be made collectively by a chair and members who together will have an appropriate mix of industry experience. TUSMA will be a statutory agency estab­lished under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and its CEO and staff will be employed under the Public Service Act 1999. The arrangements for remuneration, disclosure, termination and delegation for the CEO and members of TUSMA generally reflect the standard approach under Commonwealth legislation, as set out in the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005.



The TUSMA Bill enables existing consumer safeguard instruments made under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protec­tion and Service Standards) Act 1999 to form the basis of contract standards or benchmarks for voice and payphone services provided under the Telstra agreement 


he minister can also determine key performance standards or benchmarks for other contracts entered into or grants made by TUSMA.


It is expected that TUSMA will have total costs of $340 million per year for its first two years and around $330 million per year after that. To help it meet these costs and alleviate the burden on industry, the government for the first time is making a significant contribution of at least $50 million in budget funding per year for the first two financial years of TUSMA's operations and $100 million per year after that. The government is also consolidating the universal service obligation and the national relay service levies into a single levy. To provide a smooth transition for industry, arrangements will be put in place for 2012-13 and 2013-14 so non-Telstra contributors do not have to contribute more than their aggregate liability for the USO and NRS levies in 2011-12. The contribution of each participant towards the proposed new levy will be based, as is currently the case, on its eligible revenue as assessed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and they will remain responsible for collecting it. Arrangements will be put in place so smaller carriers with eligible revenue of less than $25 million will not be required to contribute to the new levy, consistent with current thresholds for the USO and NRS levies.


I turn to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011. The bill primarily amends telecommunications legislation to support the new arrangements for delivery of universal service outcomes within the telecommunications sector, and facilitates the establishment of TUSMA and the smooth transition to new levy arrangements. The government has previously committed to removing USO regulation. A key aspect of the bill is a proposed framework so that after a transitional period the minister may remove USO regulatory obligations from Telstra and move to a complete contractual delivery model. USO regulation can only be removed if the minister is satisfied within two years after commencement that there are satisfactory contractual arrangements in place. The minister will be required to take into account Telstra's record of compliance with its contract and regulatory obligations and any other relevant matters. Separate decisions are required in relation to the standard telephone service and payphone elements of the USO and each decision is subject to disallowance by parliament.


If there are satisfactory contract arrangements in place, the payphones element of USO regulation will be removed across Australia; and STS USO regulation will be removed in areas that will not be covered by the NBN fibre network. STS regulation in NBN fibre areas will be progressively removed as the NBN fibre network is rolled out and Telstra implements structural separation in those areas by closing down its copper network. Even if STS USO regulation is progressively removed, the existing regulated customer service guarantee that applies to all providers of the standard telephone service will continue to apply to telephone services provided by Telstra under the TUSMA contract.


I now turn to the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill. The Telecom­munications (Industry Levy) Bill is a short bill that ensures that the government can raise the consolidated industry levy. I chaired the inquiry of the Senate Standing Com­mittee on Environment and Communications into the bill and our report was tabled last Friday. Despite some concerns about the industry levy proposed in the bill, the telecommunications industry representatives supported the structural separation of Telstra and agreed that their positions in the market will be more competitive as the NBN is implemented. That is a key point. This is the industry conceding that there will be more competition as NBN is implemented—not less, as the argument has been put by the coalition. As a consequence of submissions from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the committee recommended that TUSMA and the TIO enter into the necessary agreements to share certain information to assist TUSMA's monitoring and reporting responsibilities and that the TUSMA bill be amended to enable TUSMA to disclose information to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. This is about transparency and openness in the industry and for customers to have confidence that the whole approach is working not just for the industry but for the community.


Our inquiry also heard from the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network. As a consequence of what they had to say, we recommended that the TUSMA Bill be amended to make it a criterion for one of the appointments to TUSMA to be a person with experience or knowledge of consumer affairs—again, an important part of ensuring that there is confidence in the whole NBN approach. 


These bills before the Senate today are a part of building one of Australia's biggest infrastructure programs ever. That infrastructure program, the NBN, is about delivering affordable high-speed broadband to all Australians, no matter where they live. The NBN is already in use in Tasmania, Armidale, suburban Melbourne and Kiama. Recently, it was announced that Australia's two largest telecommunications companies, Telstra and Optus, had signed up to the NBN, and we had yesterday an announce­ment that the ACCC has given final approval to develop the NBN. That is a major landmark for the nation's telecommunica­tions industry. The National Broadband Network is a key nation-building infra­structure project. The project will deliver significantly improved broadband services for all Australians at affordable prices. It will connect our cities, our regional centres and our rural communities—something that the coalition never imagined and could never achieve in 11½ years of government. This reforms Australia's telecommunications sector. 


The NBN is critical to our future digital productivity growth. It will deliver high-speed, reliable broadband to every home and business in Australia. The NBN will provide access to high-speed broadband to 100 per cent of Australian premises. Ninety-three per cent of those premises will have access to a high-speed fibre network capable of providing broadband speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. Seven per cent of Australian premises will have access to next-generation fixed wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of 12 megabits per second. For a country like Australia, with its massive area to cover, with the concentration of populations on the coastal fringes of our country, to be able to act to provide high-speed broadband to the whole country is a nation-building exercise. It is one of the best infrastructure projects this country has ever seen and it allows Australia to improve its productivity, to improve its communications and to take its place as a modern society as the rest of the world continues to adopt broadband infrastructure.


But the NBN is just a platform; it is the use of the NBN that will enable our businesses to develop new and efficient ways of doing things—new and efficient ways of improving productivity and improving communications. The NBN infrastructure supports the evolution of the Australian economy by inspiring a new wave of digital innovation that will change and improve the way Australians live, receive services and connect with the world. It will drive productivity improvement across Australian businesses by improving logistics, expanding customer bases and creating new ways of working. It will transform service delivery, increasing efficiency and effectiveness in areas such as health, education and government services. Why should Aust­ralians in the regional areas of this country not have access to the best medical advice? The NBN delivers that. This is a transforming approach by this government. It will transform the economy, it will transform health delivery, it will transform education, it will transform every aspect of the economy.


These bills before the parliament today help that process to come to fruition. These are major initiatives by the government and they should be supported by the whole parliament.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-02-29,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:25):  I enjoyed hearing Senator Cameron's remarks, and I will follow on in a similar vein. The Greens will rise, as the coalition has done, to support these bills. The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and the package of other measures in the related bills that come with it are really the last legislative pieces of the puzzle for the National Broadband Network rollout. This is something that I have taken a keen interest in since I arrived here. It has been one of the defining issues, obviously, in the communications portfolio. This last piece, effectively, of the regulatory framework is certainly deserving of support.


The bills create a new statutory agency to deliver basic voice, payphone and other public interest telecommunications services at an ongoing cost to the taxpayer of $100 million per year. We heard evidence during the hearings Senator Cameron referred to in the committee that he chairs that maybe we should not be doing that anymore. Some sections of industry think, 'In an NBN world, why should we be keeping the copper network up and why should we be providing these services to people when the age of broadband is here?' The fact is that the age of broadband is not yet here. Certainly in Canberra we get services and in Melbourne we get services. In regional areas and in some outer suburban areas where costs have been cut over the last couple of years, in fact services are terrible. So it is extremely important that we maintain the universal service obligation. We believe, actually, that it should be extended—that it should be brought into the 21st century. But at the very least, while the NBN project rolls out, there is the need to preserve and protect services and to make sure that they are not cut, particularly in areas where services have never been great in the first place.


The bills also mandate reviews in the future to assess exactly how well the USO is being delivered in an NBN world. This is an issue that will need to be revisited. We welcomed input into the Senate inquiry from consumers and from end users who convinced the committee on the need for a consumer affairs representative on the TUSMA board. As Senator Cameron outlined, that was one of the recommendations that the committee took up and has proposed. I understand that the government is interested in pursuing that amendment. The Australian Greens obviously believe that the USO should be brought into the 21st century. It is not merely voice telephony and public payphones. Really what we are talking about in this age is fast data services.


The broadband network is one of the most important infrastructure projects that this country has seen. The network, once established, will bring us closer to the rest of the world and it will be the envy of many countries, given that 93 per cent of the population will have fibre coverage to homes, schools and businesses and other premises. The other seven per cent of Australia's population will have data services through wireless and satellite. It will not be as good as you can get in the metro areas, but it is a huge step change in advance of what we have been able to deliver to people thus far.


Given convergence and the increasing reliance on data services to conduct business in the daily lives of so many people, data services have become an essential service just as much as public telephony has been for many years. We welcome the work of advocates like ACCAN for remembering that this is about people. We have tended to come in here on NBN bills and have long and exotic debates about engineering problems and about competition policy, and we tend to forget that these services are about people. The really interesting questions are around what we will do with the services when they do become ubiquitous.


Some issues with the bill were raised during the committee process. Some of the smaller telcos do not believe that they should continue to pay for the USO. They think that if Telstra is out there maintaining this infrastructure then either the price tag for providing those services should be lower or they should be somehow exempt from contributing. We believe, in line with the general principal, that the areas that are easy to service—the big cities, where the profit margins can be made—should cross-subsidise services in regional areas. I do not think it should be controversial that services should be cross-subsidised in the USO. Effectively, it is one way of doing that for areas where services are patchy. We disagree with the smaller telcos and some of the providers in that instance. We think it is important to maintain the USO.


Perhaps in 10 or 20 years it will be obsolete. Perhaps by then we will have closed the copper network down and we will be providing fast data services and there will be no need for the hardline. But I would imagine that, even though people certainly are abandoning fixed-line services in homes and are transitioning across to mobiles, it is still an essential service. The copper infrastructure still has value and it still provides services that cannot be delivered, at least in 2012, through other forms of technology.


In their evidence, Macquarie and Optus certainly argued that the NBN should render the USO obsolete. Why don't we revisit that question in a decade. Provided the coalition do not destroy the project, do not rip it up or do not flog the pieces off to private industry in an attempt to somehow balance their budget black hole, we should have a piece of infrastructure that will be providing ubiquitous, fast data services to most Australians and will also be generating a return to the Australian people. That is important to remember. In the obsession with privatising essential public services and monopoly infrastructure, we are building an asset. The reason it is off budget is that we are building an asset that will return a small premium back to the taxpayer as it is paying off its debts.


ACCAN, representing end users in the committee hearings, argued for a more integrated approach to providing disability access to telecommunications services. They propose that a range of services be brought under the TUSMA umbrella to be managed in a more integrated way than they are at the moment. We were told at the hearings that the minister was contemplating it but that it was too early and the bills would need to be passed first, so we do not have resolution on that. It is something I think this chamber should pursue. People who are interested in telecommunications and in making them available to people with any form of disability should uphold the mandate that we are extending these services to all Australians. We cannot forget that perhaps this is only part of the job.


Competitors to Telstra have argued that it is not appropriate for the government to simply contract out USO services to Telstra for the next 20 years as a consequence of the deal that was done between the government and Telstra to enable the NBN to go ahead. I have some sympathy for that point of view, because we know that this deal was done behind closed doors in an effort to get Telstra on board and that the universal service obligation had to go somewhere. I think it is appropriate that it has been brought back into public hands, but of course the industry noted—I think correctly—that all we are doing is simply contracting these services straight back out to Telstra, mostly, because they still hold the copper asset.


The bill as drafted does, however, maintain a 20th-century incarnation of the USO, but only for access to voice services. This is something the Australian Greens will be pursuing. I do not think that in the 21st century it is appropriate to contemplate a universal service obligation being simply a voice service. We have moved on. The government has quite correctly proposed a huge investment in telecommunications in this country precisely to provide fast data services to people. Therefore, I think the USO itself, and what we understand by the term 'universal service', should be updated and brought into the 21st century. We will revisit those issues.


The committee made a number of recommendations—it only made three—and I think we should propose a fourth: that the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency and the TIO, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, enter into a memorandum of understanding to formalise arrangements for the TIO to provide information to TUSMA for the purposes of TUSMA's monitoring and reporting responsibilities. That is just common sense. If the government moves that amendment we will certainly be supporting it.


Recommendation two was that the bill be amended to make it a criterion for one of the appointments to the membership of TUSMA to be a person with substantial experience or knowledge and significant standing in the field of consumer affairs. Again, the Greens believe that that is entirely reasonable, and we were persuaded by the evidence given by ACCAN in their advocacy work for the people who will actually use this technology.


The committee then recommended that the bills be passed. The Australian Greens believe that we need to revisit the idea of what the USO is. What is the universal service obligation? It is not simply a voice service in the 21st century; it is something more than that. We believe those issues should be revisited.


Yesterday we saw a huge piece of the puzzle fall into place outside this chamber concerning the bills that we passed well over a year ago now relating to the structural separation of Telstra—to separate out its wholesale and retail arms. Having that agreement signed off by the regulator was an incredibly important piece of the puzzle. The regulator had been holding out for a better deal for Telstra's competitors, for the smaller carriers and for the aggregators, who will take services from the NBN. That is a question about how the competitive landscape looks over the eight- or nine-year rollout of the NBN. It was tremendously important to get that agreement on the books. It removes a significant impediment to the volume rollout. Mr Quigley of NBN Co. told a budget estimates committee the week before last that the delaying of regulatory approvals by the ACCC was having a material impact on the volume rollout—on when we actually scale the build up and start rolling past not thousands but tens and then hundreds of thousands of premises. This was being held up because the ACCC and Telstra had not been able to come to an agreement.


So, what do we have? We have the regulator on board. We have Telstra on board, despite their fierce resistance to the bills. We have to coalition on board for the structural separation undertaking. Mr Turnbull confirmed that for us yesterday. They made it sound like the idea of disaggregating the wholesale and retail arms of Telstra had been their idea all along. The fact is that the coalition held up that proposal and that bill for a year. It cost us a year in the rollout, because former senator Nick Minchin was simply in here advocating for what he thought was the best interests of Telstra. As it has turned out, the best interest of Telstra is to take its place as a retail incumbent in an NBN world with a huge expansion of a customer base into regional areas, where services have never been provided before, and to get out and compete in the marketplace as a private entity. We do not think Telstra should have ever been privatised, but since it was it should play by the rules that everybody else has to play by.


We still do not know when exactly the coalition is going to drop its strange objection to the rollout. I do not understand why or how the National Party—and Senator Williams is in the chamber with us this morning—has stayed silent while its coalition partners try to wreck a proposal to bring world-class telecommunications to regional areas. What on earth are you doing?


I think it is high time the opposition simply dropped its destructive opposition to this project. It creates a degree of uncertainty amongst the NBN engineers, the people building the project and, most importantly, the people in the communities scheduled to get the services when you have the shadow spokesperson or the Leader of the Opposition marching around the landscape saying they are going to destroy the project. It is unbelievable. Let us simply get on with it.


I look forward to the committee stage of the debate on these bills. I look forward to seeing, hopefully, the government taking up some of the proposals that were put to it by the committee. I thank the committee staff and secretariat and the other members of the committee for their contributions, and we look forward to the passage of the bills.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2012-02-29,"



Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (10:38):  Following on from my colleague Senator Birmingham, can I say the coalition of course supports the implementation and continuation of the universal service obligation. The coalition reluctantly recognises the need to rejig that obligation, given that this government seems so bloody-minded as to continue to implement its National Broadband Network. In that context the coalition accepts the need to deal with this legislation.


The problem we have with it is that we simply do not trust the government to deliver, given that it is insisting on creating a new bureaucracy to deal with the universal service obligation and given that there is, arguably, already in place—in ACMA—a body that could be given the task of doing it, particularly given that the new body will not have any incentive to constrain its own costs. It will be funded to the tune of a flat $100 million, with any costs over and above that to be raised by an industry levy. That is, it will be paid for by participants in the industry. Ultimately, those costs will be passed on to consumers. And whilst TUSMA, the new agency, will be constrained by its policy objectives, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 gives the minister the discretion to expand the tasks TUSMA has—for example, on a public interest basis.


The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network has already recommended that the objectives of TUSMA be expanded—for example, to provide for people with a disability. That may well be a very good cause, and one can imagine the pressure to be put on the good minister—the minister for technology and gadgets—to expand the objectives of TUSMA to cover that. That is but one example of the sorts of ways in which the role of TUSMA may be expanded, with consequent and significant cost implications.


So why don't we trust the government to deliver? When the government first announced a version of its National Broad­band Network dream it was, as Senator Birmingham correctly said, a $4.7 billion promise for fibre to the node. When the tender fell in a heap, that promise was aborted and replaced by the promise that this government is now struggling to implement: the promise of a $43 billion fibre-to-the-home network. But the rollout of the NBN has been plagued by delays, secrecy, overspending and lack of transparency. Just a fortnight ago at estimates we were told that NBN Co. is falling well short of the fibre targets that NBN Co. projected—




Senator Conroy:
  No, you weren't—don't tell fibs!




Senator FISHER:
  in 2010, Minister, you know it well, for 2012. The minister attempted to downplay those projections on the basis that they were based on assumptions that have not been realised. It may well be—




Senator Conroy:
  'It may'; don't let the facts get in the way.




Senator FISHER:
  It may well be that the delay in reaching a deal with Telstra has impacted on those targets. It may well be that the delivery of fibre to greenfields sites was passed from NBN Co. back to Telstra. So it may well be that critical assumptions upon which NBN Co.'s 2010 projection was based—




Senator Conroy:
  Have changed.




Senator FISHER:
  It may be that those assumptions have changed. But the fact remains, Minister, that NBN Co. has still not met the targets projected in its 2010 corporate plan.




Senator Conroy:
  It couldn't.




Senator FISHER:
  Minister, it matters little that it couldn't; it projected that it would, if these assumptions came to bear. It was the government's task to ensure that these assumptions did come to bear so that you could deliver on your overall promise for the NBN. But not only did NBN Co. fail to deliver on its projection, it has spectacularly failed to deliver—or should I say demonstrably failed, because 'spectacu­larly' is meant to be a good word, and it is not good that they have failed to deliver.


The NBN Co. corporate plan, published in 2010, promised that fibre would pass by some 260,000 premises by June of this year. Yet, to date, just under 19,000 premises have been passed with fibre. And passing them with fibre is just the first step, because then they have to bother with getting connected. Some 19,000 of some 260,000 is only seven per cent of the target. That is a compelling 93 per cent shortfall from target, or some 240,000 premises, that NBN Co. has to address in the next four months—which it will not do, of course—in order to realise the target that it set two years ago. Because the assumptions failed to be met, NBN Co. did not pass fibre by one house in the last six months of last year. The ACCC's approval of the technical criteria in recent days will now free up the rollout of the NBN. We look forward to that changing. But we have little confidence that NBN Co.—or this government—will be able to deliver many of the targets that it puts before the Australian people.


The government is continuing to make it difficult for not only the opposition and other parliamentary parties but the Australian people themselves to work out whether or not the taxpayer is getting value for money with the rollout of the NBN. In answer to a specific question during the committee inquiry about the TUSMA model for the delivery of the USO and the negotiations with Telstra about the Telstra agreement, particularly as to whether future payments from TUSMA, the new agency, to Telstra under the Telstra agreement were a financial gain to Telstra, the department said:


This is a vexed question that you have obviously had quite a few people raise with you, as they have with us over the full course of these negotiations.


Of course, coalition senators, as part of what Senator Cameron said was 'my inquiry', considered at one point—as the minority on the committee inquiry chaired by Senator Cameron—that the negotiations were deficient. But leaving that aside for the moment, the department said:


This is a vexed question …  We think that we did a good job in negotiating a price with Telstra. … As to the actual cost of delivering them—


the services—


all I can say is that the negotiations with Telstra were very difficult. Whether there is a margin in there for Telstra I simply do not know. Telstra would not tell us and they did not tell you. Nobody else knows, so I cannot answer your question definitively. All I can say is that we did our best to negotiate a minimum price and we had some independent reassurance. 


The total lack of transparency in developing the TUSMA model and negotiating the agreement with Telstra to contract to deliver the USO is a fundamental concern given this government's track record on the rollout of the rest of the NBN, but it is hardly a surprise. I said earlier that Telstra has no incentive to constrain costs. From 2014 to 2015 the government's contribution—so read for that from the taxpayers—will be a flat $100 million and any blowout in TUSMA's costs will be recoverable through an industry levy with those costs ultimately to be passed on to consumers.


I also said earlier that we struggle to understand the necessity to create a new bureaucracy. As my good colleague Senator Birmingham said, this government has never met a bureaucracy that it did not love. Not only do we struggle to understand that, and I do not think that is to do with our IQ; it is particularly hard to understand that given that the government has largely removed the need for the new agency, TUSMA, to make decisions about contracts to deliver the USO for the next 20 years because that is done and dusted with this bill. It is only after the next 20 years that it is opened up to competition for others to deliver.


In the time that is remaining I want to raise some of the evidence that was given to the committee. For example, there is that from Macquarie Telecom, which said it was concerned about many aspects of the bills before the committee which included the limited capacity for industry participation in negotiations or consultation, the flawed basis upon which the universal service obligation was now based and the scope of universal service, which is an issue that I addressed earlier. The Optus evidence was interesting. Optus said that the universal service obligation bills were a missed opportunity because, in Optus's view, significant structural changes were having to happen because of the deployment of the NBN so the traditional USO network was no longer required—correct. Optus was saying that the most efficient and effective response would have been to either remove or significantly scale back that framework, hence a missed opportunity. They also talked about the increase in the cost of delivery of the USO from $160.5 million per year to $340 million per year without any additional consumer benefit and said, more so, that proposed changes to costing and funding were not, in Optus's view, competitively neutral given that Telstra's supply costs would be unchanged whilst the payments it got, which were funded by its competitors through the levy and passed on to consumers, would be significantly increased under the new arrangements. Optus also reinforced the concerns that TUSMA simply added a new level of bureaucracy and cost to the delivery of the USO which may lead to consequent cost increases and there being a barrier to long-term reform, given the fact that the minister had the ultimate discretion to expand the statutory functions that TUSMA was to perform.


Telstra was at pains to say that it supported the USO bills in the context of facilitating the implementation of the agreement and as part of Telstra's broader participation in the rollout of the NBN. But it did observe that the bills in their entirety would, in Telstra's view, increase adminis­trative costs and it said it had some concerns within its own house with respect to delegations and discretions, particularly those in the lap of the minister. Other comments from other witnesses, such as ACCAN and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, have been raised by colleagues, in particular Senator Ludlam.


So it is given these contexts that the coalition continue to be concerned. Whilst we totally support the universal service obligation and the need to recharacterise it as the government continues to attempt to deliver on its National Broadband Network promises, we have little confidence that the government will do so in an effective and efficient way. That having been said, we reluctantly support this legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2012-02-29,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (10:52):  Firstly, can I thank all of those who have made a contribution. I welcome the opposition's constructive approach in supporting these bills, albeit with some reservations, and I am sure we will have a healthy discussion during the committee stage. We do welcome the support for the bills.


The package of three bills, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, will provide a flexible, accountable and transparent model for delivering and funding public policy objectives in the telecommunications sector. The reforms contained in the bills being considered are aimed at ensuring continuity of key consumer safeguards through the transition to the National Broadband Network and into the future. These include ensuring reasonable access to standard telephone services and payphones, the National Relay Service and the emergency call service. The bills address important unfinished business dating back to the privatisation of Telstra. They provide for increased transparency and rigour in the delivery of basic consumer safeguards. Under this approach, the realistic costs of delivering these important services will be appropriately recognised.


The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency—or TUSMA, as it has now become known as—Bill 2011 will establish a new entity to support continuity of key telecommunications safeguards in the transition to the National Broadband Network. TUSMA will be a small statutory agency with responsibility for the delivery of the universal service obligation—or USO, as it is more commonly known—and other public interest telecommunications services. The opposition has suggested that TUSMA will employ an army of bureaucrats. This is clearly absurd, given that TUSMA's administration costs are expected to be around $5 million per annum. It will be focused on efficient and effective contract management, despite the claims of those opposite. TUSMA will have the benefit of industry knowledge and experience, and incentives, to ensure contracts are efficiently and effectively managed. TUSMA will enter into and administer contracts and grants for these services in accordance with the policy objectives set out in the TUSMA Bill.


The creation of TUSMA is necessary because the rollout of the wholesale-only National Broadband Network and yesterday's historic acceptance of Telstra's structural separation undertaking will fundamentally change the structure of the Australian telecommunications market. These changes will see Telstra's near ubiquitous national copper fixed line network progressively decommissioned as NBN Co. rolls out its next generation fibre network. These changes will empower TUSMA to require carriage service providers to provide information or documents to TUSMA that are relevant to the achievement of the voice-only migration policy objective. 


The current USO regulatory arrangements that are imposed on Telstra were designed for a market where there was a vertically integrated operator of a national telecommunications network. The new National Broadband Network environment will enable all retail service providers to offer high-quality broadband services nationally. Therefore, in this environment it is appropriate to introduce a more competitive and open model for delivering universal service and other public policy telecommunications outcomes. These new arrangements will benefit both consumers and industry by promoting more innovative, effective and efficient service delivery arrangements. They will also clearly separate policy, regulatory and contractual functions respectively between the department, the Australians Communications and Media Authority—ACMA—and TUSMA. As such, TUSMA will be fulfilling different objectives to the ACMA. TUSMA will be subject to rigorous transparency and accountability requirements. This will help ensure that costs to industry do not increase unnecessarily.


The agreement with Telstra includes a range of incentives to promote cost savings. Further, a structured program of reviews provides opportunities for voice and payphone services to be provided more efficiently. In relation to concerns that TUSMA's scope should not increase unnecessarily, the legislation does provide some flexibility so that the services it delivers can be modified as circumstances change. Despite, again, the opposition's claims to the contrary, any proposed changes will be subject to clear parliamentary oversight and scrutiny.


The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 amends the universal service regime in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protec­tion and Service Standards) Act 1999. The amendments mean that within approximately two years of commencement of TUSMA's operations the minister must consider whether it is appropriate to remove the current regulated USO on Telstra to make the standard telephone service and payphones reasonably accessible. Subject to Telstra's record of compliance with its contractual and regulatory obligations, the minister may then make declarations that will commence the process for lifting regulation and shifting to a contractual model for the provision of universal service outcomes.


The Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 provides for the imposition of a new levy. This levy will replace two existing separate industry levies and will contribute to meeting TUSMA's costs for delivery of the USO and other public policy telecommunications outcomes. For the first time, government will also be making a substantial contribution towards TUSMA's costs and the delivery of key com­munications public interest safeguards. The government's budget contribution will be at least $50 million in 2012-13 and 2013-14 and $100 million each financial year thereafter. The government has also committed to increase its base funding in the first two financial years so that contributors to the industry levy, with the exception of Telstra, will not face an increase to that aggregate funding contribution. Furthermore, the government has also committed to review the levy arrangements and the need for any additional budget funding above its committed base funding during the course of the first two years of TUSMA's operation. 


The TUSMA bill creates a rigorous oversight and accountability framework. The new legislation will provide for TUSMA to have a board structure and require the minister to ensure that TUSMA includes members who have substantial experience and knowledge of and significant standing in the operation of the telecommunications industry and business or financial management. These members will be expected to take a strong role in managing the costs of TUSMA activities. TUSMA will also maintain publicly available registers of the contracts and grants it administers and report annually to the minister on all significant matters relating to the performance of contractors and grant recipients. It will prepare a corporate plan every three years as well as a comprehensive annual report. It will provide reports or information to the minister on specified matters relating to the performance of TUSMA's functions and undergo a comprehensive review for 1 July 2018. 


This accountability framework, together with the existing reporting requirements for statutory agencies under the FMA Act, will help give stakeholders the confidence that TUSMA will use its funding to fulfil its functions and policy objectives in an efficient, effective and appropriate manner. TUSMA will also be able to share information with other agencies and persons such as the ACCC and the ACMA. 


I want to address a couple of the arguments that have been put forward by those opposite. They have argued that the government did not follow due process in negotiating its contract with Telstra for the delivery of the USO and other public interest services. However, Telstra is the primary universal service provider under legislation and is the only telecommunications provider with a national, ubiquitous fixed line network that can be used to ensure the continuity of key telecommunications services during the transition to the National Broadband Network. I would also note that there have been contestability arrangements under the USO since 2001, but no alternative providers have sought to supply services under these arrangements to date. People who are currently receiving key services need certainty that their services will not be disrupted, possibly for a long time, while a new USO provider rolls out a network or finalises negotiations for access to infrastructure. 


TUSMA's 20-year agreement with Telstra to deliver key services such as standard phone services and public payphones will ensure continuity of basic safeguards for Australians and will strengthen the safety net for rural and regional Australia. I know there are some on the other side of the chamber who strongly claim to support basic safeguards for rural and regional Australia and a safety net. So we welcome their support for this bill. The agreement with Telstra does not—



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  You are buying back the copper, mate. That is not bad. Buying back the copper—that is a classic. The agreement with Telstra does not preclude contestability for other key services that TUSMA will deliver under the contract. Seriously, you are renationalising the copper. What a cracker of a policy. The opposition has claimed that other services will not be subject to contestable arrangements. This is simply not true. Existing national relay service contracts are due to expire shortly and a competitive process will need to be run by TUSMA before 1 July 2013. The government has also committed to TUSMA undertaking a competitive process for the emergency call service within five years. By introducing a more contestable and flexible model for providing the USO these bills will promote greater efficiency, transparency and competition in the delivery of the telecommunications services that Australians rely on while preserving key consumer safeguards. 


So I do commend these bills to the Senate but it is important to take into account that the National Broadband Network is being heavily contested. Senator Williams is going to slide out of the chamber now—sliding away from his commitments to regional and rural Australians, but they will be heartened by the fact that you want to renationalise. Did he check with you, Senator Fisher? Malcolm Turnbull yesterday announced that he is renationalising the copper. He said he will instruct the National Broadband Network company to take over Telstra's copper lines—renationalising it. That is what he announced, seriously. You should not let him blog—not live blog. It is really tragic. Renationalising the copper—I love it. Did he clear that with anyone, Senator Birmingham? Did anybody see it at all? Did anybody at all know what he was doing yesterday? That is billions of dollars that he has committed to give to Telstra to buy an asset that is dying in the ground, that is literally disintegrating in the ground, and he is going to give them billions of dollars for it. Even when they tried that on us we would not be in it. Fair dinkum, it is a cracker of a policy. I cannot wait to hear more about it. I look forward to seeing how much—



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  We are bypassing them. We are paying for them to come across and we are renting their ducts. We would never have been mugs enough to buy their copper. Buying their copper! Goodness me! Did you hear that, Senator Ludlam? I know you are back in the chamber now, and I will wind up in a moment. Did you know that the Liberal-National Party announced yesterday they are renationalising the copper network? 




Senator Ludlam:
  Communists. 




Senator CONROY:
  I think that needs to go on the record. Senator Scott Ludlam for the Greens just called the Liberal Nationals 'communists'. That has to go on the record. With that thought in mind—



Senator Mason interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  You will be voting for this, apparently, Senator. You spent your entire political life, to your credit, fighting communism. You thought you had led the destruction of communism only to discover that once you got back into bed with those rural socialists they'd get ya! And now we have a policy to renationalise copper. So I will leave it at that, Senator Ludlam, and look forward to the chamber's support for these bills.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (11:07):  Thank you to Senator Conroy. I always enjoy his interjections as well as his contributions in this place. I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and related bills. Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, you would be aware the international education sector in our country has been through a lot lately: the global economic crisis affecting demand, increasing foreign competition, an uncompetitively high Australian dollar, well-publicised provider collapses, and, indeed, violence against overseas students. These have all been subjected to very sharp media scrutiny. Last but not least, the sector has had to adjust to a series of reforms, of which the most recent raft is contained in the three bills before the Senate today.


It is very important that we get it right. Today's—and previous—education services for overseas students bills might sound right. They might sound rather technical and, indeed, they are at one level, but these changes belie their importance to the sector. International education is Australia's fourth-largest export industry and Australia's largest personal service industry, contributing over $16 billion to our national economy—not counting many less direct and less easy to quantify benefits.


I know I quote these statistics very often to the Senate and I will continue to quote them because I believe they are telling and need to gain more currency, both in the parliament and in the community. All too often still, post-secondary education, particularly but not just restricted to university education, is seen as something rather ethereal or boutique and far removed from the realities of everyday life—something of just niche interest. Yet it benefits the Australian economy nearly as much as gold and a few billion dollars more than tourism.


It is not our beaches, the Great Barrier Reef or the Outback that bring in most visitors to Australia. It is our lecture halls. The most common answer to the famous tourism ad slogan, 'Where the bloody hell are you?' is: 'At university, studying.' That is why it is imperative that we continue to nurture and grow this industry. International education deserves as much of our attention and appreciation as mining, tourism and manufacturing.


The proposed legislative changes before us today arise out of the Stronger, simpler, smarter ESOS: supportinginternational students report conducted by the former distinguished member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and former member for the House of Representatives, Hon. Bruce Baird. Several reforms recommended by Mr Baird have already been implemented, including changes to registration fees and the establishment of an overseas student ombudsman. These bills being debated today are in response to Mr Baird's recommendations, primarily recom­mendation 16 of his report. These bills will establish a single tuition protection service for all higher education providers listed on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students—CRICOS.


The Tuition Protection Service can be accessed by students to gain a refund on that part of their course which is not delivered in the event their higher education provider does not meet its refund obligations under the ESOS act. Students will only be eligible for a refund of the unused part of prepaid tuition fees. In other words, tuition for which the student has paid but which has not yet been delivered by the provider, rather than a full refund as was previously the case, in recognition that students may obtain credit for part of the study already completed.


The new scheme limits the collection of fees to no more than one study period in advance and requires providers who do not receive recurrent government funding to place all students' pre-paid course fees for their first study period into a designated account which can only be drawn down when the student begins study. In addition, these bills establish an online information service to allow students to select from suitable placement options in circumstances where their higher education provider does fold, and will establish national registration for providers operating in more than one jurisdiction.


These bills were referred to both the House of Representatives and the Senate committees on education and employment. All stakeholders had an opportunity to comment and some common threads have emerged. The Australian Council of Private Education Providers, ACPEP—the peak body for private higher education providers—Universities Australia as well as the Group of Eight universities are all concerned about the rushed implementation of these forecast changes. They think the time frames are unrealistically short. But beyond the time frame for the changes, there are also specific concerns relating to cash flow issues, quantum of fees and the approach to risk.


The coalition shares some of these concerns so let me briefly touch upon them in greater detail. The time frames proposed by the government for implementing this significant suite of legislation does indeed seem very short. The coalition would have preferred to have a longer lead time to allow some providers more time to change their business model, which the new fee regime will necessitate. We are not talking about a minor or cosmetic change here. The quantum of fees that institutions will be able to collect upfront makes a huge difference to cashflow. If the quantum is reduced, as it is under the proposed legislation, institutions have to restructure the way they operate and do business. Clearly, this is not something that can be done overnight. The ESOS Act, as it currently stands, requires providers to give notification of default within 14 days. While the coalition acknowledges some of the problems the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations outlined in evidence to the Senate committee with the current 14-day time frame, the opposition is not convinced that the proposed new 24-hour deadline is adequate—though I have just been looking through the recently released proposed government amendments and I do notice that amendment (1) changes the government's proposal from 24 hours and substitutes that for three business days. Looking at that amendment here and now, it would seem that that amendment is far more preferable. So I think the government is on the right track. I should also remind the Senate that both the House and the Senate committees that looked at the legislation recommended that the notification period be 72 hours or three business days respectively. So I do think the government is on the right track.


The coalition acknowledges the diverse nature of the providers who will be affected by the changes envisaged in these bills and has some concern about the one-size-fits-all nature of the way in which student tuition fees may be dealt with. The legislative changes proposed allow operators to collect, in most circumstances, only a proportion of upfront course costs and for those fees to be placed into a designated account. Many providers argue that this scheme may result in a destabilisation of their existing business model. On the other hand, the department believes allowing providers to collect pre-paid fees 'encourages poor business practices'. We acknowledge that for some operators the department's view is probably the correct one but we believe the department has underestimated the great diversity of the international education sector. For that reason the coalition would have preferred a legislative scheme in which riskier operators are subjected to more regulation than less risky operators in order to reflect this great diversity.


The coalition will support this legislation, but we will, as we often do—and as you have often heard me say in this place—monitor its implementation to ensure it achieves its policy objectives. We owe the international education sector nothing less.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:17):  International students are significant for our education sector in terms of what they bring to our education communities and the commercial strength of our tertiary sector. We benefit from the rich social capital, knowledge, skills and diversity international students bring not only to our classrooms and campuses but also to our communities. Those students who stay after studying here keep directly contributing to our prosperity and wellbeing. Those students who return home provide links with the regions around us and assist to connect us to the rest of the world.


International students are an important conduit for the flow of ideas, of personal and national relationships and obviously with investment and trade. Economically, overseas students studying in Australia poured some $16.3 billion into our economy last financial year. Education services are still our largest services export industry and Australia's third-largest export industry after iron ore and coal. International students generate demand for nearly 181,000 full-time equivalent employees and, with the short-sighted historic decline in public funding for higher education, now represent a substantial investment in our universities from which all Australian students profit.


I just mentioned the huge amounts of money international students bring in, and I think it is relevant to this debate that we note that this has decreased. Last year we saw a significant drop of 12.5 per cent in the international student income. That is actually a hefty $2.3 billion plunge from the 2010 high of $18.6 billion. So how we manage this sector is obviously vitally important.


These bills before us, the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Tuition Protection Service) Bill 2011 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Bill 2011, represent the latest in a line of legislation, beginning with the ESOS Act itself, seeking to strengthen protection of international students' interests. It is clear that there is a range of different approaches from the different parties represented in this parliament, but overall there is a commitment that protection needs to be in place. And the Greens certainly argue that the improvements are badly needed.


It is relevant to this debate to remember the terrible assaults experienced by Indian students in 2009 and also the default of a number of private providers, which has brought real disgrace on the sector in many areas. I understand that 49 private providers defaulted in 2009 and this affected about 11,000 students—and we know that it did severely damage Australia's reputation as a safe and welcoming country for overseas students. These problems have been compounded by some education agents and providers who in fact have misled students about courses, work opportunities and migration outcomes. This unethical behaviour has made it much more difficult, I believe, for Australia to present its best fact in an increasing sharp international competition. This competition is more and more attracting overseas students away from Australia. Again, it further underlines the need for this legislation.


Australia Education International has provided some very informative information for what we are considering here. Its September report showed that the perception of quality education as the most important factor for prospective students when choosing an international education destination. The same report showed Australia as ranking third out of five English-speaking competitor countries in perceived quality education. I would argue that that supports the Greens position for substantially more investment in our education systems.


These bills are the second in the tranche of responses to the Baird review, tightening regulation around the industry and protecting students' interests, and so working to rebuild and safeguard Australia's reputation and own interests in this incredibly important sector.


I would like to go on to some of the details of the bills. I mentioned the defaulting of private providers during 2009 and 2010. Out of the total of 54 college closures in the last five years only 11 have provided any refunds at all to their overseas students. Overseas students have been paying substantial amounts of money upfront for their education. In 2010 the cost of default refunds and student replacement services was $11.5 million. That was up by $2.2 million from 2009.


As of December 2010 there were 32 claims that were not finalised, and the government has been forced to subsidise the ESOS fund twice to cover unfunded student refunds. The centrepiece of these bills seeks to remove the risk of this happening again. Obviously, these are issues that are important for the reputation of the sector and there is also the issue of the financial burden that is put back on the public of Australia.


A new universal tuition protection service, or TPS, will be the centrepiece here. When providers default on commencing or completing a course at a particular location for which students have paid, TPS will organise alternative course placements or student tuition fee refunds. The Greens are pleased to see that low-risk publicly funded institutions will be exempt from two of the levy components: the base fee and the risk rated components. I note that low-risk private providers may also apply for exemption from the same components.


However, there is a major anomaly in calculating the TPS levy. The administrative fees are set at $100, plus $2 per enrolment for the previous year. The base fees are set at $200 plus $5 per enrolment for the previous year. I give emphasis to 'the previous year', but that is what this is all based on. Yet new providers seeking registration—and one could argue that they pose a higher risk of default—are in effect exempted from the $2 and $5 per student components because they do not have a prior history of enrolments. This is where we have an extraordinary anomaly.


I argue that this is an absurd contradiction in risk assessment terms. New providers must already provide projected domestic and overseas student numbers with their application for CRICOS registration. I will move an amendment to the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Billto ensure that new providers are also charged per student, using their projected likely total enrolments to complete the calculation. This could actually also provide a check against overinflated claims of student numbers that new providers might be tempted to provide.


The overseas student tuition fund will also pay for placement services and the costs of TPS staff, its director and the board—which is intended to represent the different sectors of international education providers. Some in the sector have expressed concerns that there is no requirement in the bill to ensure that representation, so we are inserting an amendment that requires the seven non-department board members to represent providers from across the international education and training sector, including providers of ELICOS courses, which provide major pathways into further Australian studies for overseas students.


The amount of initial prepaid tuition fees a provider can collect from each student before the course starts will be limited to one study period of 24 weeks, and may not be more than 50 per cent of the total tuition fees for the course unless the total length of the course is less than 24 weeks. Thereafter, providers may not receive overseas tuition fees more than two weeks before study commences. This is to minimise the amount of refunds a defaulting provider may need to repay to students.


I fully appreciate that this is a logistical challenge for providers. However, we need to remember that last year calls on the ESOS Assurance Fund were an unsustainable 523 per cent higher than the year before, with some $11.5 million being drawn from that fund, which had to be topped up by the government twice. Clearly, it is not sustainable and something has to give. Let us not forget that last financial year the sector lost $3.2 billion in income compared with the previous year, and it is suffering for it. We have to take the hard steps to ensure that our international students' money—and let us always remember that it is their money—is protected and available to give back to the students when providers do not deliver what the students have paid handsomely for. Surely, that is something that we could all agree on.


To that end, any initial prepaid—that is, pre course commencement—tuition fees should be kept in a designated prepaid fees account, which may only be drawn to a minimum balance of the unused fees as the course progresses. In the case of default, the unused portion of those fees can be transferred to an alternative course provider if the student accepts another placement, or the unused balance can be refunded to the student. State education providers and publicly funded universities are exempt from this requirement as low-risk providers, being effectively underwritten by the government, unlike private providers. However, regulations may exempt other such providers if they are determined to be similarly low risk. Moving on to the issue of accommodation, these provisions provide protection to overseas students by ensuring their unexpended tuition fees are available for refund should their education provider default on course provision. Clearly, this is incredibly important. However, there is nothing in these bills to protect students when they pay what are often substantial upfront accommodation fees to providers, and these can disappear with shonky providers and have done so. Some measure of protection surely belongs in this legislation. I am concerned that it was not in there from the very beginning. We will be amending these bills to afford prepaid accommodation fees the same protection as tuition fees, except in item 11, where providers will be able to draw down below the protected amount in order to make advance payments to accommodation suppliers, and may do so before a course commences.


We have also given attention to the issue of record keeping. Record-keeping require­ments, which obligate the confirmation and updating of written student contact details, academic progress and attendance records every six months, streamline student replacement or refunds in the case of default. It will provide another way of ensuring overseas students do not slip by unnoticed in the system, which is also the justification for the requirement to report any provider or student default within 24 hours.


There has been some argument around the tightness of this reporting deadline, and I understand it has caused some logistical challenges for providers. The department has committed that the reporting system will be online and easy to reverse. However, there have been significant delays in cases where overseas students have gone missing, some in very serious circumstances, with overseas governments expressing grave concern. The duty of care for the welfare and safety of students remains paramount. Clearly, their friends and family need to feel confident that they are safe at all times and that, if there are problems, they will hear about them quickly. In many cases, foreign governments are also playing a role here and want to be confident. Again, it goes to the perception of how international students fare in our country with regard to the key issue of safety.


Providers must notify students if that provider defaults on the provision or completion of a course the student has paid for and must either organise for students to be placed in another similar course, if the student so chooses, or provide a refund of unexpended fees. The provider must then advise within seven days of how they have met those obligations. Conversely, in the case of student default, providers must have a written agreement with each overseas student or intending student setting out refund conditions in the case of student default. They must pay any refund due to the student under the agreement within four weeks of the student's claim unless the student did not pay outstanding payments, had their visa refused because they did not start the course on the agreed date or withdrew from the course at that location.


There is a need for the national code to be updated, and for benchmarks and minimum standards for refund policies of providers to be instated, to ensure all students are entitled to consistent refund policies. That first requires consultation outside this legislative process. This is another small protection which does not yet exist but which these bills should afford a student. I look forward to the debate in the committee stage, because there is clearly room for improvement on these bills.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (11:34):  The Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Tuition Protection Service) Bill 2011 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Bill 2011 build on the significant and progressive reforms that the Gillard government has made in Australia's education sector. A commitment to a long-term, high-quality international education sector is at the forefront of the Gillard government's priorities. 


It would come as no surprise to anyone in the broader community that this government is delivering a significant number of reforms to our education sector. These reforms are aimed at ensuring not only that all Australians get the best education but also that Australia's reputation as a provider of high-quality, first-class educational services in the international community is fulfilled. In last year's budget, Labor outlined $3 billion of additional investment in training to address skill shortages across the industry. This government is putting back into a number of industries that matter most to our nation, and through these vocational education and training reforms we will see, in the longer term, productivity growth in our economy.


International education is one of Australia's most important industries. It is our third-largest export industry and annually provides revenue of more than $16.3 billion to the Australian government. Income generated in my home state of New South Wales by overseas education services amounted to $5.8 billion, or 37 per cent of export income from all onshore students, in 2010-11. In Victoria and Queensland, there was $4.8 billion and $2.5 billion respectively, while in other states the income from overseas students amounted to $2.6 billion. Of the total export income generated by education services, $15.8 billion was from spending on fees and goods and services by onshore students, and a further $595 million was earned through offshore and other educational activities. The international education sector in this country cannot be taken for granted. In recent times we have seen the effects that the high Australian dollar has had on the demand for placements of international students in Australia. And not only are the economic effects important; reputation is crucial to our nation's ability to attract international students and grow this important export market. That is why in 2009 the Prime Minister, in her then role as Minister for Education, asked Bruce Baird to conduct a review of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act and associated legislation. While the review was conducted the government moved to have the ESOS Act amended to require reregistration of all overseas student education providers to ensure ongoing integrity in this important industry. When the Baird report was released the government committed to a staged response to that review. April last year saw the enactment of the first stage of the government's response to the Baird review. Legislation soon followed in June to adjust the annual registration charge for cost recovery. This bill represents the government's fourth piece of legislation to strengthen the regulation of international education in Australia.


The government has already taken other significant steps towards creating a long-term future for international students in the higher education sector, including the establishment of a national regulator for the vocational education and training and higher education sectors and significant reforms to the student visa program. This bill will strengthen Australia's reputation as a high-quality education provider within the region and throughout the world. It does this by establishing a strong but fair regulatory regime for the provision of international education and training services. This ensures that the interests of overseas students are protected by establishing minimum standards and providing tuition and financial assurance for those overseas students. Also, the bill is designed to strengthen Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information that is relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas.


As I said earlier, the education sector is of huge significance to the Australian economy. It is one of our largest export industries, generating about $16.3 billion a year for our economy. The sector is also very important when it comes to employment. It is responsible for about 125,000 jobs throughout the economy. The international education sector in Australia has also grown considerably in a relatively short period of time—from about 50,000 students at the beginning of the 1990s to more than 600,000 students now. Obviously this growth has led to an increased number of international students at our universities. Macquarie University, in the north of Sydney, has around 12,000 international places, Monash University has around 13,000 places and my old stomping ground the University of New South Wales also has around 13,000 places.


On top of this we have also had a huge rise in the number of education providers for international students, particularly in the private sector. Significantly, there are now more than 1,200 providers in this sector. These huge numbers, and the relatively large increase in recent times, have caused pressures on the regulatory framework that underpins our international education sector. The Baird review focused on several major aspects of those pressures in the international education space. When the report was released in 2010 some of the key recommendations included strengthening the registration process; effective monitoring and enforcement provisions; empowering students with information about complaint handling; ethical recruitment; and stronger consumer protections for students.


In early 2011 the government acted to bring in a wide range of reforms designed to give effective enforcement, to restrict processes around the registration of education providers and to give access to the ombudsman to allow students who attend private schools and private education providers to access a fair and balanced complaints facility. These changes were necessary at the time and they have created a framework for this second round of reforms. These bills will address many of those remaining recommendations contained in the Baird report.


Key to those reforms is the strengthening of tuition protections, and education providers who close their doors will no longer be able to take their students' money with them without some recourse. The reforms contained in these bills are also the government's response to a series of closures within the sector that have cost students a great deal of time, money and heartache to get refunds but have also done damage to Australia's reputation in the international community as a market for overseas students.


Closures affect not only the students but also our reputation throughout the world as a stable provider of services. The current system requires all non-exempt providers to belong to a tuition assurance scheme and pay into the ESOS Assurance Fund. This process involves separate applications and fees as a condition of CRICOS registration. Often the process means that the costs of placing affected students are not distributed throughout the industry in an equitable way.


The introduction of the Tuition Protection Service allows for a single point of placement for students and, in the worst cases, a refund for students. The TPS will allow for all possible placement options for students, placement incentives for providers and greater student choice. A single TPS means greater flexibility in service, a single entry point for students, a single set of fees for providers and, of course, greater accountability to government. The TPS will also mean providers who take on displaced students will receive the equivalent of an unexpended prepaid fee. This means the education providers and, importantly, the students are not out of pocket when these circumstances occur. If students do not meet the entry requirements of an education provider there is no obligation to admit the student; and for providers who are unable to pay any difference in fees that may be payable to take on a student there are no compulsory placements. The TPS will include student refunds for unspent portions of upfront fees paid to education providers. Under the current system, if an education provider closes in the final weeks of a student's study, the student is entitled to a full refund even if they obtain credit for completed units of study from another provider. These changes are about ensuring that we strengthen the framework of our approach to providing education services. The changes will provide greater integrity and greater security which will only bolster Australia's reputation as a provider of first-class international student services.


In the past, growth was seen as the only objective; no thought was given to Australia's reputation as a global education supplier. Neither was any thought given to the welfare of students receiving the education nor, worst of all, to ensuring that their education was of a good standard. Growth in the overseas student education sector is fantastic for the Australian economy, and the creation of jobs servicing overseas students is of great importance to all of us. This bill is designed to ensure that growth in the industry continues and that we strengthen the reputations of the industries which are providing the services.


Let us take the example of a potential student from China, from where more than $4.1 billion of student related income comes into the Australian economy each year. That potential student will now be able to choose an Australian education provider and have confidence that their investment in the future will be secure. Another example is that of a potential student from India, from where more than $2 billion of student related income makes its way into the Australian economy each year. There are also potential students from Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. The combined economic benefit to the Australian economy of the education of students from these countries is more than $4.8 billion. These students expect to come to Australia and receive an education of the highest calibre; this government has an obligation to protect those students and to ensure that the Australian education sector has the reputation it deserves—and that is what these reforms will do.


Whether for Australian students or for international students, the Gillard government is delivering better education services in our economy which will provide the platform for better delivery of services as well as greater growth and greater strength in our economy. These are things that must be supported by the Senate.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (11:47):  I too rise to comment on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and associated bills. For the record, I acknowledge the many overseas students whose presence in our regional universities, TAFEs and colleges offers benefits to all Australian students as well as to our regional communities more generally. Only last week I participated quite vigorously—though probably less vigorously than I had in the late 80s—in the O-week celebration at Latrobe University in Bendigo. There I was able to see firsthand the social and cultural value of international students studying at our institutions as domestic and international students got to know each other through a range of social activities prior to commencing their university studies.


Australians are known to value the wealth of cultural diversity and social sophistication brought by international students to campuses and their associated communities. The internationalisation of Australian education provides people in all areas of Australia with the opportunity to learn about other cultures and languages. In addition, it provides Australia with a ready-made supply of future advocates in the best laboratories and the brightest boardrooms in countries right across the world. All overseas students need our recognition and our support.


According to the ABS, during the last 20 years there has been strong growth in transnational education. There are more than 3 million tertiary students worldwide who are enrolled outside their country of residence. That is an increase of more than 200 per cent since 1985, when just under 1 million students travelled overseas to study. Since the 1980s Australia has become a major player in the international student market by offering globally recognised courses and qualifications. Australia's international students are currently our second largest group of temporary entrants. In 1990 Australia welcomed 47,000 international students to our shores; by 2004, Australia attracted six per cent of all tertiary students enrolled outside their country of residence and was the fifth most popular destination for overseas students. Already by the year 2000 the number of international students had grown to 153,000. In 2005, overseas students represented approximately 18 per cent of all higher education students. In 2010, we welcomed more than 619,000 international students to universities, TAFE colleges and schools throughout Australia.


So the provision of education services to full-fee-paying overseas students is an important industry for the Australian economy, and many of the senators who have been commenting on this bill have made reference to that fact. Education services provided in Australia to international students were valued at over $9 billion in export earnings in the financial year 2004-05. At the time, it was the fourth-highest-earning export industry for Australia: in total, it generated more revenue than either wool, wheat or beef. Today, according to the Commonwealth government's Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, education services are Australia's third-largest export industry behind coal and iron ore—that is saying something—and the largest service export industry, ahead of personal travel services.


Full-fee-paying overseas students are therefore an important revenue source for Australian universities. In 2005, revenue from full-fee-paying overseas students represented 15 per cent of all revenue within the higher education sector, which is a significant proportion. As universities work towards delivering quality educational infrastructure right around our nation, it is important that they are well funded. By 2008, the Australian overseas student industry contributed $15 billion in export income to the Australian economy from spending on fees and goods. The latest comparable ABS estimate, which is for the year 2008-09, is $16.6 billion. Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, states that education exports are the clear No. 1 service export ahead of tourism. As well as being an important revenue source, overseas enrolments can help educational institutions reach the critical mass needed to diversify the range of educational programs on offer to all students. The international student population growth has led to significant expansion in the number of education providers offering services, particularly in the private vocational education and training space. There are now more than 1,200 providers ranging from large universities and TAFEs and public and private schools to small private colleges and English language providers, many in regional centres throughout Australia. Together this has resulted in pressures on the underpinning regulatory frameworks, exacerbated by external factors such as global economies and the increasing value of the Australian dollar.


The background to the more current problems facing international education in Australia is by now well known. Reputational damage associated with provider closures has affected all providers in the international education sector, and this has needed to be addressed. In my own home state of Victoria this was particularly the case. I have first-hand experience of this and it is great to see both institutions and jurisdictions working hard to repair the damage.


One of the issues highlighted through the recent provider closures was the ability to gain a national picture of education providers to determine how many students were going to be affected. Current figures indicate that approximately 230 providers operate across sectors and jurisdictions, contributing to a disjointed system for these providers in that they experience different processes and charges in each jurisdiction, and different initial and annual registration charges at the Commonwealth level. There may also be a duplication in registration assessments which are more global to the organisation rather than local to the course being delivered at a particular campus. Only 11 of the 54 providers that closed between 2008 and the end of March 2011 met or partially met their refund obligation to students. That would significantly play into the reputation of our Australian providers in this area, the issue obviously being that the international students—all 11,000 of them—are the ones left holding the can.


The Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill is part of a package of three bills to establish a tuition protection service for all our overseas students. The bill amends the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and places obligations on registered international education providers when a provider fails to start or finish providing a course or when the overseas student fails to start or finish a course. It also provides for a national regime of national registration of providers. It limits the amount of initial prepaid fees that may be collected by a registered provider and it provides that students are only eligible for a refund of the unused portion of prepaid tuition fees and specifies what details must be kept on student records.


In summary, the implementation of a new universal single-layer TPS framework will place students more effectively into the Australian tertiary education sector. It will limit refunds, remove unnecessary administrative layers and fees, and draw from a greater pool of available places in the education sector, with incentives for providers to place students. It will enable greater student choice and responsibility as well as direct contact with potential new education providers. It will also provide for transparent decision making and fee setting that better targets provider risks and ensures sufficient funds are collected from the sector to meet fluctuating requirements related to the risk of future provider default. We obviously appreciate greater transparency in this area. The changes will also complement Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas. 


As I examine the detail, I want to comment on one of the issues raised—that of prepaid fees. Providers will be limited to the amount of prepaid fees they can collect at any one time to no more than 50 per cent of the total tuition fees before the student has begun the course. The current ESOS provisions have no restrictions on prepaid fees, with students possibly paying 100 per cent of tuition fees, sometimes before a student visa is approved. While many providers take no more than one study period fees at a time, this amendment is designed to help reduce the liability to businesses by limiting the size of refunds owed to students and reduce any potential refunds.


The changes also propose to restrict a provider from collecting student tuition fees not more than two weeks before the commencement of a course. Stakeholders have regarded this restriction as impractical. The Council of Private Higher Education suggests the period should be extended to four weeks while the public university sector wants no time frame when a university can accept prepaid fees. All but the low-risk providers will also have to keep initial prepaid fees in a designated account until the student commences their first study period. Whilst the requirements do not apply to low-risk providers such as universities who receive Commonwealth funding and providers administered by the state education authority, they will apply to many smaller private universities, colleges and schools who are similarly low-risk providers and have quite strong reputations in the sector.


The Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations argues that the proposed changes will ensure providers are able to meet their refund requirements should the provider default or the student visa application be refused and will assist and encourage sustainable business practices. However, one-size policy solutions rarely result in a seamless implementation across a sector or an industry, so there is a bit of wait-and-see on this one. The change is designed to stop providers from using prepaid fees for operating expenses before the student commences, despite the fact that a lot of operating expenses in order to start teaching a student actually occur before they have to rock up on day one of classes and encourage more sustainable business models. Penalties have been recommended for non-compliance and for the misuse of prepaid fees. It is reasonable that if a provider defaults and fails to provide a course at an agreed location or a course does not start on an agreed date, then the student should be reimbursed. However, there needs to be some recognition of those providers with strong reputations such as the Holmes Institute, which has been operating for many years in this sector and offering a range of programs to international students, and similar low-risk providers who will be caught in these hasty policy implementations. Whilst it will protect Australia's reputation for delivering quality education services, it will mean that all providers are able to meet their student refund obligations in a timely way. This will obviously impact on the financial operations of the business and many institutions. I have reservations concerning the impact of this legislation on regional universities, TAFE colleges and boarding schools—all smaller institutions than the likes of Melbourne, Sydney or Monash universities. Invariably the most expensive two months of any year occur when the curriculum is being prepared, the teachers are gearing up and the equipment is being purchased—the charge will prove a challenging cashflow issue.


I recognise that the focus is on better managing risk upfront and throughout a provider's registration and that these need a legislative framework to provide security and support for all our overseas students. At the same time we must also ensure that the financial operations of all our educational providers is protected and a variety of educational providers is available in all areas of Australia. While international students provide welcome financial input into our tertiary sector and are a rich addition to the cultural and social experience for Australian students studying alongside them, it is incumbent on legislators and regulators to ensure that our higher education sector remains world-class. We have a responsibility to all students studying in Australia to ensure that they have a high quality educational standard. We also need to guard our reputation abroad as a destination of choice for the world's brightest. Financially, educationally and socially the experience of our international students needs to be positive, transparent and rewarding. There are challenges on these fronts, which universities, governments and communities are addressing. This legislation, based on the Baird review recommendations, goes towards addressing these concerns.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-02-29,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:02):  I rise also to contribute to the debate on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and cognate bills, and to affirm the comments of my colleagues—that is, the critical importance of overseas student education to this country, particularly in the Asian region. I am very pleased to acknowledge visitors in the public gallery who come from the very regions where we are hosting and, in some cases, receiving higher education. 


People must not overlook or dismiss the importance of overseas student education to the Australian economy, to our foreign affairs and to the long-term wellbeing of our relationships in the region. We are pleased to have a circumstance in which the export income to this country from the overseas higher education sector is now the third highest in the nation and it is the highest service based export income earner for Australia. This is undervalued by most Australians. It is not understood by most Australians, and it needs to be far more deeply seated into the psyche of our community. 


The benefit for us is not just when the students are here; there is also the long-term benefit that comes from them having studied in this country. In 2009 I had the pleasure of giving the occasional address at Edith Cowan University in Perth, where I was informed that one-third of the graduands in front of me that day were from overseas. I think back too to the occasion in 2004 when the company that I then ran opened an office in Manila in the Philippines. There was a Filipino businessman who could not have been more helpful to us in opening doors and in introducing us to people in government and in the business sector. At a function at the ambassador's home, I asked him: 'Why are you giving us so much assistance? Why are you so keen to see our company here?' He said: 'Because I got my opportunity during the Colombo Plan back in the 1950s. I studied at the University of Western Australia. It was an opportunity that would otherwise have been denied me and I have never forgotten it. I have never ever wasted an opportunity to be able to join with Australian companies and government in trying to advance their interests.'


I urge my colleagues and the wider community to understand and realise that as we move more into the Asian region, politically, diplomatically, militarily and economically, we have an enormous resource in the graduates and alumni of our Australian institutions—those who have come from overseas to study here and those who go back to their countries and who, hopefully, think well of their Australian experience. We should be building on that: we should be maintaining contact with the alumni and we should be using them as they move into senior positions in business, commerce and government. We should be using those links all the more into the future. That is why this legislation is so important. 


It has been mentioned by others that the income to this country from overseas students is now in the order of some $16.3 billion. It has been as high as $25 billion annually, and I want to explore for a few moments the reasons for its decline. Referring back to an earlier age, when I was engaged in business activities in India in the early part of the last decade, I remember reading and then discussing with our Australian consul in Mumbai the widely-publicised fact that Australia had passed the United Kingdom and was second only to America as a location popular with Indian students wanting to study overseas and gain overseas qualifications. I was very proud as an Australian and as one who had been on the faculty of the Curtin University in Western Australia, another university that has long had an association with overseas students and relies heavily on the income from full-fee-paying overseas students. I ask: why is it that we have gone down on the list? We would be no closer now than probably fourth or fifth. Yes, currency fluctuations and the high Australian dollar are points. Others have obviously alluded to the unfortunate publicity that occurred as service providers failed, as overseas students were left here helpless and, regrettably, as some students from overseas countries, particularly in this case India, seem to have been the subject of attacks, particularly in Melbourne. I made it my business to inquire about the background and the basis of that and I am absolutely satisfied that there was no deliberate attempt to target Indian students as such. What came home to me is the fact that those who arrive on our shores need some form of orientation—to be aware that you do not get on a train late at night with a laptop computer and the sorts of objects that others might want to steal from you, or they might cause physical damage to you. I am sure that we have seen that overcome.


Unfortunately, also evident to us when we undertook the hearings on this particular matter under the chairmanship of Senator Marshall in the Senate Education, Employ­ment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee was the lack of consultation prior to decisions being taken. I learnt that recently from vice-chancellors; we have certainly learnt it from other registered training providers. If there is one lesson that we all want to get out of this process it is that we must engage—government must engage and departmental senior officers must engage with all of the players before we make precipitous decisions. We had a circum­stance in which overseas students were coming to this country and enrolling in spurious courses—hairdressing and cooking type courses—with the expectation, often driven by agents in their home countries, that this was an easy path to Australian residency, ongoing to Australian citizenship. Those are the sorts of issues we should have foreseen and we should have put measures in place to prevent them happening.


We all know very well that overseas agents and, in some cases, Australian providers are only too willing to see the short-term benefit and ignore the long-term loss and the long-term damage that they cause by building up expectations that can never be realised. From this side of the chamber to the government side of the chamber, if we can work constructively to put those sorts of activities behind us we will be all the better for it.


The figures are interesting. A previous speaker mentioned that 125,000 full-time equivalent positions were generated here in Australia for service providers to provide educational services for overseas students—a very impressive figure. When we saw the downturn, unfortunately the dramatic loss of those positions was also reported to us. What is equally interesting to me is that, of the 380,000 students who had student visas, the average number of family member visits per student was 1.8 last year. If my calculations are correct, somewhere approaching 700,000 visitors come to this country who would not have come had their relative not been studying here. Again, that is something which we should surely be encouraging. I would be very interested to learn from tourism authorities and others about what the yield might have been. How high spending were those overseas visitors who came directly as a result of their student relative being here?


Of course, that 380,000 student figure is low because it only includes those on student visas. When you add in short-term, English-as-a-second-language students who come here on tourist visas, we would see that number of students, with the multiplier effect, dramatically increased. Those of us who have had sons or daughters overseas on Rotary exchange or similar types of programs always seem to find an opportunity to visit them when we otherwise would not have gone there. We all know the attraction and the power that accompanies these sorts of visits, and we would often see a multiplier effect with the visitors going back to their home country, speaking well of Australia, speaking well of their relative's experience here and generating others to come.


It is interesting to listen to the evidence, particularly from those who were providing short-term training, especially in the English language. For example, English Australia advised us that the number of students under the umbrella that they represented had decreased from 219,000 in 2008 to 122,000 in 2011. The number had almost halved in that three-year period. That has a dramatic effect on employment, service provision and the jobs of those who would have been providing the service. It is also interesting that there was a 30 per cent decline in the number coming from China for short-term courses in the English language, a 40 per cent decline in those coming from Thailand and a 50 per cent decline in those coming from Vietnam—some of the very markets that we want to promote to. I go back to tourism. Naturally enough, in terms of yield, in terms of dollars left and dollars invested—not in terms of numbers yet—we know that China has become the highest contributor to offshore tourism to this country. We should not overlook those opportunities.


Recommendations were put forward to the department and onwards to the government, especially when it came to questions about prepayment fees. I thought very good suggestions were put forward by those organisations. They said that we are now in stiff competition with service providers from other countries and that we do not want to put into place legislation that would make it so unnecessarily onerous for those wanting to come to Australia that they look to other countries. We would simply be denying ourselves the opportunity.


It was put to us that representatives support the intent of the legislation—and I am quoting here from correspondence to me—'to ensure that fees are utilised for the study period for which they are collected' and that 'the proposed legislation proposes two broad mechanisms to achieve it: firstly, depositing funds into a nominated account and drawing it down; and—not or; and—secondly, putting a limit on collection of no more than six months or 50 per cent of the fees themselves'. These people made the point eloquently that the objectives would be served by either one of those two but that the administrative burden of having to comply with the two of them was certainly unnecessary. They said it would be expensive and it would be confusing for the overseas students. So I still ask that the government give consideration to what have been very reasonable submissions from them.


If nominating an account and drawing it down was not enough, they would strongly recommend that legislation to limit fee collection to no more than two weeks prior to the course commencing be abolished entirely or extended to a minimum of six weeks. The point they were making is that, in a very short course, the confusion associated with having to break the payment into two, the administration associated with collecting the funds a second time and the inconvenience to those who are supporting overseas students in having to make two payments rather than one is simply unnecessary.


If ever there was an instance in which a risk management approach should be taken to this whole question, then the funding for and protection of overseas students as part of their education is a prime example. I am interested in knowing the sort of risk analysis that was done on those service providers who failed. I am interested in knowing, for example, the status and structure of those which failed. Were they the university sector? Were they the publicly owned TAFE sector? Were they long-established Australian companies? Were they long-established Australian private providers? Were they substantially overseas companies or organisations that had come into Australia to take advantage of this burgeoning demand?


Until we know the background of those who failed—of those who failed their students, of those who took money and ran with it—I do not believe we can introduce legislation that is a catch-all for all purposes. For example, do we think for one minute that any one of the 28 or 29 universities in this country are going to close up shop and run away with overseas student money? The answer is patently no. Do we think that would happen with state owned, run and managed TAFEs or their equivalent? The answer is no. Therefore, it is critically important that we apply legislation on the basis of risk, and where there is no risk or low risk then the legislation should reflect that. We have many analogies. We have the capacity to put funds into escrow. We have the capacity to place a bond on a new provider if we perceive there is a risk associated with their capacity or willingness to deliver on what they are charging and claiming. I do not yet see that we have this approach.


I see we have a sledgehammer to kill a nut. I see we have a one-size-fits-all approach. I do not think this is the way to go. I do not believe we get the best when we penalise those for whom there is no risk associated with the activity, function or legislation under which they will be caught. I made this point to the department, I made it in the hearing itself: we must be much more forensic, if that is the term, in identifying where the risk lies and in applying treatments to that risk to ensure that we minimise or negate it. If it does not exist, do not impose the penalty or imposition in the first place. Witnesses before us and submissions placed before us from the various service providers made that point.


On the point of competition, Australia has a great track record of 'aid, trade and fade'. If time permitted I could go through industry after industry where we have provided aid throughout regions of interest to us, that has led to trade and, for various reasons, we have faded. I make the plea that we do not fade. But, in so doing, I also make the point that it is such a lucrative opportunity that it is not just this country that has that opportunity, it is countries throughout Asia—the Philippines, for instance. Our universities have campuses in Singapore, Malaysia and other countries, and increasingly now in the Middle East, in the United Arab Emirates et cetera. So let us not think for a minute—arrogantly—that we are the only country capable of providing these educational services.


There are two things I do not want to see happening: firstly, our own service providers shifting offshore because they cannot—or do not want to and do not believe they need to—comply with restrictive legislation here and move offshore to locations where they do not have these levels of governance and insistence but can still equally and safely provide the education; and, secondly, our being disadvantaged as a result of overseas service providers setting up and taking the very market that we are building a reputation for and in which we have enormous capacity for growth.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-02-29,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:22):  I will first reflect on some of the comments made by Senator Back in his comprehensive contribution on this package of education services for overseas students legislation, not so much on points of difference but on matters that need to be sorted out in the committee stage. There is no doubt there is unanimity in this place about the importance of the overseas student sector. It is a significant part of Australia's economy. In my home state of South Australia it is one of the biggest export earners. South Australia is better as an economy and as a community because of the overseas student sector. It would be fair during the committee stage to explore the concerns around risk raised by Senator Back and others in the coalition. My understanding, as I read the bill, is that all but the lowest risk providers will have to keep prepaid fees in a designated account for the first study period. There is an element in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations that relates to risk that ought to be explored. The committee inquiry was very ably chaired by Senator Gavin Marshall and the deputy chair, Senator Back. 


We not only need to strike a balance between ensuring that we do not have so much red tape that it becomes an onerous burden on educational institutions but also need to have some security, some sense of guarantee, for those overseas students who sign up for these courses that they will be able to pay those fees with the security that if anything does go wrong with an education provider they will not be out of pocket. That is the very important policy balance that needs to be obtained.


Let us put this in perspective. This is a major sector which is very important to Australia's economy and very important to my home state of South Australia. I have spoken in the past about my concerns for the overseas student sector in Australia and how we slipped back for a whole range of reasons. One of the big challenges we now have is a very strong Australian dollar, which is making us less competitive in the overseas student sector. The government needs to be congratulated for the action it has taken so far. The Baird review was a positive review that looked at a whole range of issues to comprehensively deal with these problems. The fact that Mr Bruce Baird AM was a former senior coalition politician indicates that the government has tackled this issue in a bipartisan fashion, and that is a good thing.


In my home state of South Australia, overseas students make up nearly 10 per cent of the state's total exports compared to between seven and eight per cent nationally. That is why I have a vested interest, if you like, on behalf of my constituents to make sure we get this right. Unfortunately, some unscrupulous education providers have taken advantage of the strong growth in this sector to make a quick buck. In 2009 and 2010 we heard story after story of students who had come to Australia only to find the course was not what they paid for and, in some cases, the course and the provider no longer existed. There were also distressing stories of students forced to undertake long hours of physical labour in exchange for minimal education. This, coupled with disturbing accounts of isolated attacks against overseas students, even though they were universally condemned, began to reduce confidence in the sector. The overhaul of provider standards and regulations along with the establishment of an overseas students ombudsman have finally begun to pay off with improved standards and increased confidence for providers and students alike.


I note the work the government has done in implementing the Baird review, and this package of legislation is a part of that. The Australian overseas student education sector is much stronger as a result of these changes, and I support the government's intentions in these bills. I also support the government's amendments to these bills, which are in line with the recommendations made by the committee.


I will be moving again—I hope it is a case of third time lucky—amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and I will discuss these in more detail during the committee stage. In brief, my amendment simply gives the minister the discretionary power to make payments to overseas students to cover incidental costs such as travel or accommodation where a provider has failed to deliver the services as promised. It is a discretion for the minister that I think can be exercised in a way and in a manner that could enhance confidence in the sector. These payments could only be made after consultation with the Director of the Tuition Protection Service and if they do not put the TPS in financial difficulty. I am trying to get that blend of ensuring that it strengthens the sector and also ties it back to fiscal responsibility. These measures are sensible and straightforward and have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that they do not place an excessive burden on the scheme.


I support these bills. I think it is fair, though, that some of the concerns raised by Senator Back and other coalition senators in their additional comments to the committee report be addressed. As I see it, we need to strengthen support and confidence in the sector. That will involve some costs, but the benefits of that will be to have more overseas students coming to Australia knowing with greater confidence that they will be protected from unscrupulous operators, the very small minority that taint the sector. The measures in this bill are a positive step.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:28):  I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate and appreciate the positive manner and constructive way in which they have approached these issues. I will not delay the chamber too long in summing up other than to say that this is the final response to the Baird review, which I think has been a very good process designed to address some of the issues which were exposed in terms of the management and support for overseas students studying in Australia. I congratulate Mr Bruce Baird on the role he has played.


I also thank all those who contributed to the debate around these bills. We have listened to the sector and their concerns, but there is one overriding objective in all of this, which I continue to stress: this is a competitive international industry. Brand Australia is really important in this debate. For every closure of a college or every student who is treated poorly, the impact is felt around the world in terms of Australia's reputation. It does not matter whether it is the small cooking college in Melbourne or the Australian National University; a poor experience for someone in the small cooking college in Melbourne impacts on the ANU and every other university and college that is out there marketing its services as part of Australian international education.


So it is very important that we get this right. It is very important that we provide as much protection and support for those international students and the sector as possible. That is done by making sure we have a very rigorous regulatory environment which supports the sector, supports its capacity, supports its responsiveness to the needs of students and ensures that we continue to support a really strong international reputation for our international education sector.


I have heard the concerns of stakeholders about some of the business aspects of these changes and the good work that came out of the Senate committee inquiry, so the government will be moving some amendments to give providers more time to notify the TPS Director of provider and student defaults. We think these suggestions, made and picked up by the Senate committee inquiry, are good ones and so we will be moving amendments to support the approach that was recommended in that report.


I do not think we have enough evidence to support some of the amendments that have been moved by the Greens and Senator Xenophon. I am not sure whether he is still moving amendments; I heard he was moving amendments but I will have to double check.




Senator Xenophon:
  You heard right.




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  Okay. I heard right. You looked quizzical, Senator, so I thought maybe I had heard wrong.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  We will come to that in time, but I do appreciate the constructive manner in which senators have engaged in this. I remind people that the passage of these bills is essential if we are going to get the 1 July 2012 date, but I will deal with the amendments as we move through the committee stages.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:34):  I want to ask an opening question following on from Senator Back's contribution. I think it reflects the additional comments of the coalition senators. It is a genuine question based on the coalition's concerns in saying that this is a one-size-fits-all approach. I think that Senator Back said that for a university, one of the Group of Eight, or a state-run TAFE, the risks involved of anything going wrong with that institution are practically non-existent or negligible compared with, say, a private institution of the sort that have collapsed. My understanding is that the issue of risk is factored into the legislation in considering the regulatory burden. I just want that clarified, because it seemed to be the main criticism, as I understood it, from the coalition. I am just trying to establish whether issues of risk are greater. There was a gradation of issues of risk in determining the regulatory compliance.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:35):  Senator, the simple answer is that the TPS is a universal model. We decided to go down that path. That was what was recommended. We thought it was the best way to approach the issue. There were a lot of discussions in the sector about that, rather than trying to split off different sections and having different systems apply to them. There was some initial resistance to that, but I think most people came on board and understood that.


It is based on risk assessment—that is true—but I make the general point that I disagree with Senator Back in one regard. I think it is true to say that the universities are enacted by state legislation and they are much more secure than some of the other providers in the sector. That is the case, but I would not want to pretend that we have not had concerns about the university sector in Australia, that there were not a number of universities whose practices were of concern. I have certainly raised it directly with them, and a number of them are addressing those things. They are addressing them in terms of the Knight review response as well. It is equally true that not all the TAFEs have been, in my view, perfect citizens in this regard. So I just want to dispel the myth that somehow all of the concerns across the sector and how we deal with international students were centred on private colleges. I think I had a reputation for going pretty hard at some of the cooking college and hairdresser sector of the market as immigration minister. It needed to be cleaned up, and it has been. We have to be wary, but it is equally true that we need universities and TAFEs to provide first-class education services and proper supportive services for students. I am not one who believes 'university good, private college bad' or 'TAFE good, private college bad'. I think it is a much more complex set of circumstances than that. I think it is important that we have a universal system. But it is, as you say, important that, as we have done in response to the Knight review, we try to risk-rate what we are dealing with.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (12:37):  Just briefly, Minister, I thank you on behalf of the government for those amendments. I think it is fair to say that they generally reflect the findings of both the House of Representatives and Senate committees. We will discuss them in a moment, but I just want to thank you for that. I think that has moved the debate on considerably this afternoon, and I want to thank you. There was an issue raised in the Senate committee by several witnesses about the level of consultation by the department with many of the stakeholders, and we addressed this in the committee hearing in Melbourne. Can I just relay that concern and ask you, Minister, whether you are happy with the level of consultation. If you are not particularly happy, will we see improvements next time and how will that be done?

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:39):  There have been, as I understand it, two main consultation rounds with the sector, during and after the Baird report. There is obviously ongoing consultation. I myself have met with many providers. I had one of them in my room just before we came into the chamber, so I see providers all the time. Obviously, once we pass the legislation, the department will conduct information sessions for providers to explain the changes in detail. I have no reason to be critical of the department's consultative processes, but I am happy to take those up and make further inquiries. I did not realise that the criticisms were as strong as you indicate. Certainly the whole approach to this has been based on this being something that impacts on the sector and that they have to manage, so the whole thing has been about trying to get the sector to a place where, if not everyone is happy, at least they accept the legitimacy of it and accept that it is a broadly appropriate response to dealing with the problem. As I say, we very much followed the Baird-recommended approach. But I will have a look at the question you raise and seek my own feedback to see whether that concern is justified. I heard some initial rumblings, but they were more about whether or not they agreed that some of the universities were reluctant to be put into a universal scheme et cetera. But I will take on board your concern and make my own inquiries. That is the best I can do at this stage.

 (Queensland) (12:40):  I was simply reflecting the comments of some of the witnesses at the hearing. I am just relaying that, if I might. On the cost of the new scheme, again there was concern expressed that some of the small independent schools—with, let us say, fewer than 50 overseas students—may not continue to maintain their CRICOS registration as a result of these changes. Is that of concern?

We understand that schools will continue to recruit in that way, and we do not think the TPS arrangements are onerous for them. But certainly there has been no indication to us that somehow this is going to drive change in the sector.

  That is your advice? I understand that, Minister. Can I move to the time frames. You would be aware, Minister, that this has been a constant issue with respect to these reforms. With respect to the default provisions in the legislation and the time frames, has the government discovered that stakeholders are concerned about the time frames? Many of them, in fact, say this is a significant increase in regulatory burden. Of all the concerns—indeed, the complaints—expressed at the Melbourne hearing, I think it is fair to say that the time frames were the most significant, the most broadly expressed and perhaps the most virulent criticism of the legislation.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:43):  As I say, and as I think Senator Mason has acknowledged, we have tried to address the concerns that were expressed in the committee hearings about the provisions for reporting in the bill, and we have responded to those. Quite frankly, we have not responded in the same way as some would ask us to because there is the integrity of the system to protect. It is important, and this is why we are doing this. I think that one of our amendments goes a bit further than the committee recommended in terms of the time—it went from three days to five, I think. So we are trying to pick up what is reasonable without undermining the integrity of the system.


In terms of the commencement provisions, I think people have had a pretty strong warning about what was about to occur. Obviously they have had the Baird report since March 2010, and the bills have been in the parliament since September 2011. The first TPS levy, which has the most significant impact for providers, will not be imposed until 2013. I do not accept some of the wild claims made about the onerous nature of administrative costs. There is no doubt that there are requirements on providers, but I make no apologies: if you are going to have a system which provides protections, you have to make sure that people actually provide a framework that allows us to do that.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (11:07):  Thank you to Senator Conroy. I always enjoy his interjections as well as his contributions in this place. I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and related bills. Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, you would be aware the international education sector in our country has been through a lot lately: the global economic crisis affecting demand, increasing foreign competition, an uncompetitively high Australian dollar, well-publicised provider collapses, and, indeed, violence against overseas students. These have all been subjected to very sharp media scrutiny. Last but not least, the sector has had to adjust to a series of reforms, of which the most recent raft is contained in the three bills before the Senate today.


It is very important that we get it right. Today's—and previous—education services for overseas students bills might sound right. They might sound rather technical and, indeed, they are at one level, but these changes belie their importance to the sector. International education is Australia's fourth-largest export industry and Australia's largest personal service industry, contributing over $16 billion to our national economy—not counting many less direct and less easy to quantify benefits.


I know I quote these statistics very often to the Senate and I will continue to quote them because I believe they are telling and need to gain more currency, both in the parliament and in the community. All too often still, post-secondary education, particularly but not just restricted to university education, is seen as something rather ethereal or boutique and far removed from the realities of everyday life—something of just niche interest. Yet it benefits the Australian economy nearly as much as gold and a few billion dollars more than tourism.


It is not our beaches, the Great Barrier Reef or the Outback that bring in most visitors to Australia. It is our lecture halls. The most common answer to the famous tourism ad slogan, 'Where the bloody hell are you?' is: 'At university, studying.' That is why it is imperative that we continue to nurture and grow this industry. International education deserves as much of our attention and appreciation as mining, tourism and manufacturing.


The proposed legislative changes before us today arise out of the Stronger, simpler, smarter ESOS: supportinginternational students report conducted by the former distinguished member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and former member for the House of Representatives, Hon. Bruce Baird. Several reforms recommended by Mr Baird have already been implemented, including changes to registration fees and the establishment of an overseas student ombudsman. These bills being debated today are in response to Mr Baird's recommendations, primarily recom­mendation 16 of his report. These bills will establish a single tuition protection service for all higher education providers listed on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students—CRICOS.


The Tuition Protection Service can be accessed by students to gain a refund on that part of their course which is not delivered in the event their higher education provider does not meet its refund obligations under the ESOS act. Students will only be eligible for a refund of the unused part of prepaid tuition fees. In other words, tuition for which the student has paid but which has not yet been delivered by the provider, rather than a full refund as was previously the case, in recognition that students may obtain credit for part of the study already completed.


The new scheme limits the collection of fees to no more than one study period in advance and requires providers who do not receive recurrent government funding to place all students' pre-paid course fees for their first study period into a designated account which can only be drawn down when the student begins study. In addition, these bills establish an online information service to allow students to select from suitable placement options in circumstances where their higher education provider does fold, and will establish national registration for providers operating in more than one jurisdiction.


These bills were referred to both the House of Representatives and the Senate committees on education and employment. All stakeholders had an opportunity to comment and some common threads have emerged. The Australian Council of Private Education Providers, ACPEP—the peak body for private higher education providers—Universities Australia as well as the Group of Eight universities are all concerned about the rushed implementation of these forecast changes. They think the time frames are unrealistically short. But beyond the time frame for the changes, there are also specific concerns relating to cash flow issues, quantum of fees and the approach to risk.


The coalition shares some of these concerns so let me briefly touch upon them in greater detail. The time frames proposed by the government for implementing this significant suite of legislation does indeed seem very short. The coalition would have preferred to have a longer lead time to allow some providers more time to change their business model, which the new fee regime will necessitate. We are not talking about a minor or cosmetic change here. The quantum of fees that institutions will be able to collect upfront makes a huge difference to cashflow. If the quantum is reduced, as it is under the proposed legislation, institutions have to restructure the way they operate and do business. Clearly, this is not something that can be done overnight. The ESOS Act, as it currently stands, requires providers to give notification of default within 14 days. While the coalition acknowledges some of the problems the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations outlined in evidence to the Senate committee with the current 14-day time frame, the opposition is not convinced that the proposed new 24-hour deadline is adequate—though I have just been looking through the recently released proposed government amendments and I do notice that amendment (1) changes the government's proposal from 24 hours and substitutes that for three business days. Looking at that amendment here and now, it would seem that that amendment is far more preferable. So I think the government is on the right track. I should also remind the Senate that both the House and the Senate committees that looked at the legislation recommended that the notification period be 72 hours or three business days respectively. So I do think the government is on the right track.


The coalition acknowledges the diverse nature of the providers who will be affected by the changes envisaged in these bills and has some concern about the one-size-fits-all nature of the way in which student tuition fees may be dealt with. The legislative changes proposed allow operators to collect, in most circumstances, only a proportion of upfront course costs and for those fees to be placed into a designated account. Many providers argue that this scheme may result in a destabilisation of their existing business model. On the other hand, the department believes allowing providers to collect pre-paid fees 'encourages poor business practices'. We acknowledge that for some operators the department's view is probably the correct one but we believe the department has underestimated the great diversity of the international education sector. For that reason the coalition would have preferred a legislative scheme in which riskier operators are subjected to more regulation than less risky operators in order to reflect this great diversity.


The coalition will support this legislation, but we will, as we often do—and as you have often heard me say in this place—monitor its implementation to ensure it achieves its policy objectives. We owe the international education sector nothing less.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-02-29,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:17):  International students are significant for our education sector in terms of what they bring to our education communities and the commercial strength of our tertiary sector. We benefit from the rich social capital, knowledge, skills and diversity international students bring not only to our classrooms and campuses but also to our communities. Those students who stay after studying here keep directly contributing to our prosperity and wellbeing. Those students who return home provide links with the regions around us and assist to connect us to the rest of the world.


International students are an important conduit for the flow of ideas, of personal and national relationships and obviously with investment and trade. Economically, overseas students studying in Australia poured some $16.3 billion into our economy last financial year. Education services are still our largest services export industry and Australia's third-largest export industry after iron ore and coal. International students generate demand for nearly 181,000 full-time equivalent employees and, with the short-sighted historic decline in public funding for higher education, now represent a substantial investment in our universities from which all Australian students profit.


I just mentioned the huge amounts of money international students bring in, and I think it is relevant to this debate that we note that this has decreased. Last year we saw a significant drop of 12.5 per cent in the international student income. That is actually a hefty $2.3 billion plunge from the 2010 high of $18.6 billion. So how we manage this sector is obviously vitally important.


These bills before us, the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Tuition Protection Service) Bill 2011 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Bill 2011, represent the latest in a line of legislation, beginning with the ESOS Act itself, seeking to strengthen protection of international students' interests. It is clear that there is a range of different approaches from the different parties represented in this parliament, but overall there is a commitment that protection needs to be in place. And the Greens certainly argue that the improvements are badly needed.


It is relevant to this debate to remember the terrible assaults experienced by Indian students in 2009 and also the default of a number of private providers, which has brought real disgrace on the sector in many areas. I understand that 49 private providers defaulted in 2009 and this affected about 11,000 students—and we know that it did severely damage Australia's reputation as a safe and welcoming country for overseas students. These problems have been compounded by some education agents and providers who in fact have misled students about courses, work opportunities and migration outcomes. This unethical behaviour has made it much more difficult, I believe, for Australia to present its best fact in an increasing sharp international competition. This competition is more and more attracting overseas students away from Australia. Again, it further underlines the need for this legislation.


Australia Education International has provided some very informative information for what we are considering here. Its September report showed that the perception of quality education as the most important factor for prospective students when choosing an international education destination. The same report showed Australia as ranking third out of five English-speaking competitor countries in perceived quality education. I would argue that that supports the Greens position for substantially more investment in our education systems.


These bills are the second in the tranche of responses to the Baird review, tightening regulation around the industry and protecting students' interests, and so working to rebuild and safeguard Australia's reputation and own interests in this incredibly important sector.


I would like to go on to some of the details of the bills. I mentioned the defaulting of private providers during 2009 and 2010. Out of the total of 54 college closures in the last five years only 11 have provided any refunds at all to their overseas students. Overseas students have been paying substantial amounts of money upfront for their education. In 2010 the cost of default refunds and student replacement services was $11.5 million. That was up by $2.2 million from 2009.


As of December 2010 there were 32 claims that were not finalised, and the government has been forced to subsidise the ESOS fund twice to cover unfunded student refunds. The centrepiece of these bills seeks to remove the risk of this happening again. Obviously, these are issues that are important for the reputation of the sector and there is also the issue of the financial burden that is put back on the public of Australia.


A new universal tuition protection service, or TPS, will be the centrepiece here. When providers default on commencing or completing a course at a particular location for which students have paid, TPS will organise alternative course placements or student tuition fee refunds. The Greens are pleased to see that low-risk publicly funded institutions will be exempt from two of the levy components: the base fee and the risk rated components. I note that low-risk private providers may also apply for exemption from the same components.


However, there is a major anomaly in calculating the TPS levy. The administrative fees are set at $100, plus $2 per enrolment for the previous year. The base fees are set at $200 plus $5 per enrolment for the previous year. I give emphasis to 'the previous year', but that is what this is all based on. Yet new providers seeking registration—and one could argue that they pose a higher risk of default—are in effect exempted from the $2 and $5 per student components because they do not have a prior history of enrolments. This is where we have an extraordinary anomaly.


I argue that this is an absurd contradiction in risk assessment terms. New providers must already provide projected domestic and overseas student numbers with their application for CRICOS registration. I will move an amendment to the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Billto ensure that new providers are also charged per student, using their projected likely total enrolments to complete the calculation. This could actually also provide a check against overinflated claims of student numbers that new providers might be tempted to provide.


The overseas student tuition fund will also pay for placement services and the costs of TPS staff, its director and the board—which is intended to represent the different sectors of international education providers. Some in the sector have expressed concerns that there is no requirement in the bill to ensure that representation, so we are inserting an amendment that requires the seven non-department board members to represent providers from across the international education and training sector, including providers of ELICOS courses, which provide major pathways into further Australian studies for overseas students.


The amount of initial prepaid tuition fees a provider can collect from each student before the course starts will be limited to one study period of 24 weeks, and may not be more than 50 per cent of the total tuition fees for the course unless the total length of the course is less than 24 weeks. Thereafter, providers may not receive overseas tuition fees more than two weeks before study commences. This is to minimise the amount of refunds a defaulting provider may need to repay to students.


I fully appreciate that this is a logistical challenge for providers. However, we need to remember that last year calls on the ESOS Assurance Fund were an unsustainable 523 per cent higher than the year before, with some $11.5 million being drawn from that fund, which had to be topped up by the government twice. Clearly, it is not sustainable and something has to give. Let us not forget that last financial year the sector lost $3.2 billion in income compared with the previous year, and it is suffering for it. We have to take the hard steps to ensure that our international students' money—and let us always remember that it is their money—is protected and available to give back to the students when providers do not deliver what the students have paid handsomely for. Surely, that is something that we could all agree on.


To that end, any initial prepaid—that is, pre course commencement—tuition fees should be kept in a designated prepaid fees account, which may only be drawn to a minimum balance of the unused fees as the course progresses. In the case of default, the unused portion of those fees can be transferred to an alternative course provider if the student accepts another placement, or the unused balance can be refunded to the student. State education providers and publicly funded universities are exempt from this requirement as low-risk providers, being effectively underwritten by the government, unlike private providers. However, regulations may exempt other such providers if they are determined to be similarly low risk. Moving on to the issue of accommodation, these provisions provide protection to overseas students by ensuring their unexpended tuition fees are available for refund should their education provider default on course provision. Clearly, this is incredibly important. However, there is nothing in these bills to protect students when they pay what are often substantial upfront accommodation fees to providers, and these can disappear with shonky providers and have done so. Some measure of protection surely belongs in this legislation. I am concerned that it was not in there from the very beginning. We will be amending these bills to afford prepaid accommodation fees the same protection as tuition fees, except in item 11, where providers will be able to draw down below the protected amount in order to make advance payments to accommodation suppliers, and may do so before a course commences.


We have also given attention to the issue of record keeping. Record-keeping require­ments, which obligate the confirmation and updating of written student contact details, academic progress and attendance records every six months, streamline student replacement or refunds in the case of default. It will provide another way of ensuring overseas students do not slip by unnoticed in the system, which is also the justification for the requirement to report any provider or student default within 24 hours.


There has been some argument around the tightness of this reporting deadline, and I understand it has caused some logistical challenges for providers. The department has committed that the reporting system will be online and easy to reverse. However, there have been significant delays in cases where overseas students have gone missing, some in very serious circumstances, with overseas governments expressing grave concern. The duty of care for the welfare and safety of students remains paramount. Clearly, their friends and family need to feel confident that they are safe at all times and that, if there are problems, they will hear about them quickly. In many cases, foreign governments are also playing a role here and want to be confident. Again, it goes to the perception of how international students fare in our country with regard to the key issue of safety.


Providers must notify students if that provider defaults on the provision or completion of a course the student has paid for and must either organise for students to be placed in another similar course, if the student so chooses, or provide a refund of unexpended fees. The provider must then advise within seven days of how they have met those obligations. Conversely, in the case of student default, providers must have a written agreement with each overseas student or intending student setting out refund conditions in the case of student default. They must pay any refund due to the student under the agreement within four weeks of the student's claim unless the student did not pay outstanding payments, had their visa refused because they did not start the course on the agreed date or withdrew from the course at that location.


There is a need for the national code to be updated, and for benchmarks and minimum standards for refund policies of providers to be instated, to ensure all students are entitled to consistent refund policies. That first requires consultation outside this legislative process. This is another small protection which does not yet exist but which these bills should afford a student. I look forward to the debate in the committee stage, because there is clearly room for improvement on these bills.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (11:34):  The Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Tuition Protection Service) Bill 2011 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Bill 2011 build on the significant and progressive reforms that the Gillard government has made in Australia's education sector. A commitment to a long-term, high-quality international education sector is at the forefront of the Gillard government's priorities. 


It would come as no surprise to anyone in the broader community that this government is delivering a significant number of reforms to our education sector. These reforms are aimed at ensuring not only that all Australians get the best education but also that Australia's reputation as a provider of high-quality, first-class educational services in the international community is fulfilled. In last year's budget, Labor outlined $3 billion of additional investment in training to address skill shortages across the industry. This government is putting back into a number of industries that matter most to our nation, and through these vocational education and training reforms we will see, in the longer term, productivity growth in our economy.


International education is one of Australia's most important industries. It is our third-largest export industry and annually provides revenue of more than $16.3 billion to the Australian government. Income generated in my home state of New South Wales by overseas education services amounted to $5.8 billion, or 37 per cent of export income from all onshore students, in 2010-11. In Victoria and Queensland, there was $4.8 billion and $2.5 billion respectively, while in other states the income from overseas students amounted to $2.6 billion. Of the total export income generated by education services, $15.8 billion was from spending on fees and goods and services by onshore students, and a further $595 million was earned through offshore and other educational activities. The international education sector in this country cannot be taken for granted. In recent times we have seen the effects that the high Australian dollar has had on the demand for placements of international students in Australia. And not only are the economic effects important; reputation is crucial to our nation's ability to attract international students and grow this important export market. That is why in 2009 the Prime Minister, in her then role as Minister for Education, asked Bruce Baird to conduct a review of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act and associated legislation. While the review was conducted the government moved to have the ESOS Act amended to require reregistration of all overseas student education providers to ensure ongoing integrity in this important industry. When the Baird report was released the government committed to a staged response to that review. April last year saw the enactment of the first stage of the government's response to the Baird review. Legislation soon followed in June to adjust the annual registration charge for cost recovery. This bill represents the government's fourth piece of legislation to strengthen the regulation of international education in Australia.


The government has already taken other significant steps towards creating a long-term future for international students in the higher education sector, including the establishment of a national regulator for the vocational education and training and higher education sectors and significant reforms to the student visa program. This bill will strengthen Australia's reputation as a high-quality education provider within the region and throughout the world. It does this by establishing a strong but fair regulatory regime for the provision of international education and training services. This ensures that the interests of overseas students are protected by establishing minimum standards and providing tuition and financial assurance for those overseas students. Also, the bill is designed to strengthen Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information that is relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas.


As I said earlier, the education sector is of huge significance to the Australian economy. It is one of our largest export industries, generating about $16.3 billion a year for our economy. The sector is also very important when it comes to employment. It is responsible for about 125,000 jobs throughout the economy. The international education sector in Australia has also grown considerably in a relatively short period of time—from about 50,000 students at the beginning of the 1990s to more than 600,000 students now. Obviously this growth has led to an increased number of international students at our universities. Macquarie University, in the north of Sydney, has around 12,000 international places, Monash University has around 13,000 places and my old stomping ground the University of New South Wales also has around 13,000 places.


On top of this we have also had a huge rise in the number of education providers for international students, particularly in the private sector. Significantly, there are now more than 1,200 providers in this sector. These huge numbers, and the relatively large increase in recent times, have caused pressures on the regulatory framework that underpins our international education sector. The Baird review focused on several major aspects of those pressures in the international education space. When the report was released in 2010 some of the key recommendations included strengthening the registration process; effective monitoring and enforcement provisions; empowering students with information about complaint handling; ethical recruitment; and stronger consumer protections for students.


In early 2011 the government acted to bring in a wide range of reforms designed to give effective enforcement, to restrict processes around the registration of education providers and to give access to the ombudsman to allow students who attend private schools and private education providers to access a fair and balanced complaints facility. These changes were necessary at the time and they have created a framework for this second round of reforms. These bills will address many of those remaining recommendations contained in the Baird report.


Key to those reforms is the strengthening of tuition protections, and education providers who close their doors will no longer be able to take their students' money with them without some recourse. The reforms contained in these bills are also the government's response to a series of closures within the sector that have cost students a great deal of time, money and heartache to get refunds but have also done damage to Australia's reputation in the international community as a market for overseas students.


Closures affect not only the students but also our reputation throughout the world as a stable provider of services. The current system requires all non-exempt providers to belong to a tuition assurance scheme and pay into the ESOS Assurance Fund. This process involves separate applications and fees as a condition of CRICOS registration. Often the process means that the costs of placing affected students are not distributed throughout the industry in an equitable way.


The introduction of the Tuition Protection Service allows for a single point of placement for students and, in the worst cases, a refund for students. The TPS will allow for all possible placement options for students, placement incentives for providers and greater student choice. A single TPS means greater flexibility in service, a single entry point for students, a single set of fees for providers and, of course, greater accountability to government. The TPS will also mean providers who take on displaced students will receive the equivalent of an unexpended prepaid fee. This means the education providers and, importantly, the students are not out of pocket when these circumstances occur. If students do not meet the entry requirements of an education provider there is no obligation to admit the student; and for providers who are unable to pay any difference in fees that may be payable to take on a student there are no compulsory placements. The TPS will include student refunds for unspent portions of upfront fees paid to education providers. Under the current system, if an education provider closes in the final weeks of a student's study, the student is entitled to a full refund even if they obtain credit for completed units of study from another provider. These changes are about ensuring that we strengthen the framework of our approach to providing education services. The changes will provide greater integrity and greater security which will only bolster Australia's reputation as a provider of first-class international student services.


In the past, growth was seen as the only objective; no thought was given to Australia's reputation as a global education supplier. Neither was any thought given to the welfare of students receiving the education nor, worst of all, to ensuring that their education was of a good standard. Growth in the overseas student education sector is fantastic for the Australian economy, and the creation of jobs servicing overseas students is of great importance to all of us. This bill is designed to ensure that growth in the industry continues and that we strengthen the reputations of the industries which are providing the services.


Let us take the example of a potential student from China, from where more than $4.1 billion of student related income comes into the Australian economy each year. That potential student will now be able to choose an Australian education provider and have confidence that their investment in the future will be secure. Another example is that of a potential student from India, from where more than $2 billion of student related income makes its way into the Australian economy each year. There are also potential students from Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. The combined economic benefit to the Australian economy of the education of students from these countries is more than $4.8 billion. These students expect to come to Australia and receive an education of the highest calibre; this government has an obligation to protect those students and to ensure that the Australian education sector has the reputation it deserves—and that is what these reforms will do.


Whether for Australian students or for international students, the Gillard government is delivering better education services in our economy which will provide the platform for better delivery of services as well as greater growth and greater strength in our economy. These are things that must be supported by the Senate.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-02-29,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (11:47):  I too rise to comment on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and associated bills. For the record, I acknowledge the many overseas students whose presence in our regional universities, TAFEs and colleges offers benefits to all Australian students as well as to our regional communities more generally. Only last week I participated quite vigorously—though probably less vigorously than I had in the late 80s—in the O-week celebration at Latrobe University in Bendigo. There I was able to see firsthand the social and cultural value of international students studying at our institutions as domestic and international students got to know each other through a range of social activities prior to commencing their university studies.


Australians are known to value the wealth of cultural diversity and social sophistication brought by international students to campuses and their associated communities. The internationalisation of Australian education provides people in all areas of Australia with the opportunity to learn about other cultures and languages. In addition, it provides Australia with a ready-made supply of future advocates in the best laboratories and the brightest boardrooms in countries right across the world. All overseas students need our recognition and our support.


According to the ABS, during the last 20 years there has been strong growth in transnational education. There are more than 3 million tertiary students worldwide who are enrolled outside their country of residence. That is an increase of more than 200 per cent since 1985, when just under 1 million students travelled overseas to study. Since the 1980s Australia has become a major player in the international student market by offering globally recognised courses and qualifications. Australia's international students are currently our second largest group of temporary entrants. In 1990 Australia welcomed 47,000 international students to our shores; by 2004, Australia attracted six per cent of all tertiary students enrolled outside their country of residence and was the fifth most popular destination for overseas students. Already by the year 2000 the number of international students had grown to 153,000. In 2005, overseas students represented approximately 18 per cent of all higher education students. In 2010, we welcomed more than 619,000 international students to universities, TAFE colleges and schools throughout Australia.


So the provision of education services to full-fee-paying overseas students is an important industry for the Australian economy, and many of the senators who have been commenting on this bill have made reference to that fact. Education services provided in Australia to international students were valued at over $9 billion in export earnings in the financial year 2004-05. At the time, it was the fourth-highest-earning export industry for Australia: in total, it generated more revenue than either wool, wheat or beef. Today, according to the Commonwealth government's Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, education services are Australia's third-largest export industry behind coal and iron ore—that is saying something—and the largest service export industry, ahead of personal travel services.


Full-fee-paying overseas students are therefore an important revenue source for Australian universities. In 2005, revenue from full-fee-paying overseas students represented 15 per cent of all revenue within the higher education sector, which is a significant proportion. As universities work towards delivering quality educational infrastructure right around our nation, it is important that they are well funded. By 2008, the Australian overseas student industry contributed $15 billion in export income to the Australian economy from spending on fees and goods. The latest comparable ABS estimate, which is for the year 2008-09, is $16.6 billion. Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, states that education exports are the clear No. 1 service export ahead of tourism. As well as being an important revenue source, overseas enrolments can help educational institutions reach the critical mass needed to diversify the range of educational programs on offer to all students. The international student population growth has led to significant expansion in the number of education providers offering services, particularly in the private vocational education and training space. There are now more than 1,200 providers ranging from large universities and TAFEs and public and private schools to small private colleges and English language providers, many in regional centres throughout Australia. Together this has resulted in pressures on the underpinning regulatory frameworks, exacerbated by external factors such as global economies and the increasing value of the Australian dollar.


The background to the more current problems facing international education in Australia is by now well known. Reputational damage associated with provider closures has affected all providers in the international education sector, and this has needed to be addressed. In my own home state of Victoria this was particularly the case. I have first-hand experience of this and it is great to see both institutions and jurisdictions working hard to repair the damage.


One of the issues highlighted through the recent provider closures was the ability to gain a national picture of education providers to determine how many students were going to be affected. Current figures indicate that approximately 230 providers operate across sectors and jurisdictions, contributing to a disjointed system for these providers in that they experience different processes and charges in each jurisdiction, and different initial and annual registration charges at the Commonwealth level. There may also be a duplication in registration assessments which are more global to the organisation rather than local to the course being delivered at a particular campus. Only 11 of the 54 providers that closed between 2008 and the end of March 2011 met or partially met their refund obligation to students. That would significantly play into the reputation of our Australian providers in this area, the issue obviously being that the international students—all 11,000 of them—are the ones left holding the can.


The Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill is part of a package of three bills to establish a tuition protection service for all our overseas students. The bill amends the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and places obligations on registered international education providers when a provider fails to start or finish providing a course or when the overseas student fails to start or finish a course. It also provides for a national regime of national registration of providers. It limits the amount of initial prepaid fees that may be collected by a registered provider and it provides that students are only eligible for a refund of the unused portion of prepaid tuition fees and specifies what details must be kept on student records.


In summary, the implementation of a new universal single-layer TPS framework will place students more effectively into the Australian tertiary education sector. It will limit refunds, remove unnecessary administrative layers and fees, and draw from a greater pool of available places in the education sector, with incentives for providers to place students. It will enable greater student choice and responsibility as well as direct contact with potential new education providers. It will also provide for transparent decision making and fee setting that better targets provider risks and ensures sufficient funds are collected from the sector to meet fluctuating requirements related to the risk of future provider default. We obviously appreciate greater transparency in this area. The changes will also complement Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas. 


As I examine the detail, I want to comment on one of the issues raised—that of prepaid fees. Providers will be limited to the amount of prepaid fees they can collect at any one time to no more than 50 per cent of the total tuition fees before the student has begun the course. The current ESOS provisions have no restrictions on prepaid fees, with students possibly paying 100 per cent of tuition fees, sometimes before a student visa is approved. While many providers take no more than one study period fees at a time, this amendment is designed to help reduce the liability to businesses by limiting the size of refunds owed to students and reduce any potential refunds.


The changes also propose to restrict a provider from collecting student tuition fees not more than two weeks before the commencement of a course. Stakeholders have regarded this restriction as impractical. The Council of Private Higher Education suggests the period should be extended to four weeks while the public university sector wants no time frame when a university can accept prepaid fees. All but the low-risk providers will also have to keep initial prepaid fees in a designated account until the student commences their first study period. Whilst the requirements do not apply to low-risk providers such as universities who receive Commonwealth funding and providers administered by the state education authority, they will apply to many smaller private universities, colleges and schools who are similarly low-risk providers and have quite strong reputations in the sector.


The Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations argues that the proposed changes will ensure providers are able to meet their refund requirements should the provider default or the student visa application be refused and will assist and encourage sustainable business practices. However, one-size policy solutions rarely result in a seamless implementation across a sector or an industry, so there is a bit of wait-and-see on this one. The change is designed to stop providers from using prepaid fees for operating expenses before the student commences, despite the fact that a lot of operating expenses in order to start teaching a student actually occur before they have to rock up on day one of classes and encourage more sustainable business models. Penalties have been recommended for non-compliance and for the misuse of prepaid fees. It is reasonable that if a provider defaults and fails to provide a course at an agreed location or a course does not start on an agreed date, then the student should be reimbursed. However, there needs to be some recognition of those providers with strong reputations such as the Holmes Institute, which has been operating for many years in this sector and offering a range of programs to international students, and similar low-risk providers who will be caught in these hasty policy implementations. Whilst it will protect Australia's reputation for delivering quality education services, it will mean that all providers are able to meet their student refund obligations in a timely way. This will obviously impact on the financial operations of the business and many institutions. I have reservations concerning the impact of this legislation on regional universities, TAFE colleges and boarding schools—all smaller institutions than the likes of Melbourne, Sydney or Monash universities. Invariably the most expensive two months of any year occur when the curriculum is being prepared, the teachers are gearing up and the equipment is being purchased—the charge will prove a challenging cashflow issue.


I recognise that the focus is on better managing risk upfront and throughout a provider's registration and that these need a legislative framework to provide security and support for all our overseas students. At the same time we must also ensure that the financial operations of all our educational providers is protected and a variety of educational providers is available in all areas of Australia. While international students provide welcome financial input into our tertiary sector and are a rich addition to the cultural and social experience for Australian students studying alongside them, it is incumbent on legislators and regulators to ensure that our higher education sector remains world-class. We have a responsibility to all students studying in Australia to ensure that they have a high quality educational standard. We also need to guard our reputation abroad as a destination of choice for the world's brightest. Financially, educationally and socially the experience of our international students needs to be positive, transparent and rewarding. There are challenges on these fronts, which universities, governments and communities are addressing. This legislation, based on the Baird review recommendations, goes towards addressing these concerns.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-02-29,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:02):  I rise also to contribute to the debate on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and cognate bills, and to affirm the comments of my colleagues—that is, the critical importance of overseas student education to this country, particularly in the Asian region. I am very pleased to acknowledge visitors in the public gallery who come from the very regions where we are hosting and, in some cases, receiving higher education. 


People must not overlook or dismiss the importance of overseas student education to the Australian economy, to our foreign affairs and to the long-term wellbeing of our relationships in the region. We are pleased to have a circumstance in which the export income to this country from the overseas higher education sector is now the third highest in the nation and it is the highest service based export income earner for Australia. This is undervalued by most Australians. It is not understood by most Australians, and it needs to be far more deeply seated into the psyche of our community. 


The benefit for us is not just when the students are here; there is also the long-term benefit that comes from them having studied in this country. In 2009 I had the pleasure of giving the occasional address at Edith Cowan University in Perth, where I was informed that one-third of the graduands in front of me that day were from overseas. I think back too to the occasion in 2004 when the company that I then ran opened an office in Manila in the Philippines. There was a Filipino businessman who could not have been more helpful to us in opening doors and in introducing us to people in government and in the business sector. At a function at the ambassador's home, I asked him: 'Why are you giving us so much assistance? Why are you so keen to see our company here?' He said: 'Because I got my opportunity during the Colombo Plan back in the 1950s. I studied at the University of Western Australia. It was an opportunity that would otherwise have been denied me and I have never forgotten it. I have never ever wasted an opportunity to be able to join with Australian companies and government in trying to advance their interests.'


I urge my colleagues and the wider community to understand and realise that as we move more into the Asian region, politically, diplomatically, militarily and economically, we have an enormous resource in the graduates and alumni of our Australian institutions—those who have come from overseas to study here and those who go back to their countries and who, hopefully, think well of their Australian experience. We should be building on that: we should be maintaining contact with the alumni and we should be using them as they move into senior positions in business, commerce and government. We should be using those links all the more into the future. That is why this legislation is so important. 


It has been mentioned by others that the income to this country from overseas students is now in the order of some $16.3 billion. It has been as high as $25 billion annually, and I want to explore for a few moments the reasons for its decline. Referring back to an earlier age, when I was engaged in business activities in India in the early part of the last decade, I remember reading and then discussing with our Australian consul in Mumbai the widely-publicised fact that Australia had passed the United Kingdom and was second only to America as a location popular with Indian students wanting to study overseas and gain overseas qualifications. I was very proud as an Australian and as one who had been on the faculty of the Curtin University in Western Australia, another university that has long had an association with overseas students and relies heavily on the income from full-fee-paying overseas students. I ask: why is it that we have gone down on the list? We would be no closer now than probably fourth or fifth. Yes, currency fluctuations and the high Australian dollar are points. Others have obviously alluded to the unfortunate publicity that occurred as service providers failed, as overseas students were left here helpless and, regrettably, as some students from overseas countries, particularly in this case India, seem to have been the subject of attacks, particularly in Melbourne. I made it my business to inquire about the background and the basis of that and I am absolutely satisfied that there was no deliberate attempt to target Indian students as such. What came home to me is the fact that those who arrive on our shores need some form of orientation—to be aware that you do not get on a train late at night with a laptop computer and the sorts of objects that others might want to steal from you, or they might cause physical damage to you. I am sure that we have seen that overcome.


Unfortunately, also evident to us when we undertook the hearings on this particular matter under the chairmanship of Senator Marshall in the Senate Education, Employ­ment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee was the lack of consultation prior to decisions being taken. I learnt that recently from vice-chancellors; we have certainly learnt it from other registered training providers. If there is one lesson that we all want to get out of this process it is that we must engage—government must engage and departmental senior officers must engage with all of the players before we make precipitous decisions. We had a circum­stance in which overseas students were coming to this country and enrolling in spurious courses—hairdressing and cooking type courses—with the expectation, often driven by agents in their home countries, that this was an easy path to Australian residency, ongoing to Australian citizenship. Those are the sorts of issues we should have foreseen and we should have put measures in place to prevent them happening.


We all know very well that overseas agents and, in some cases, Australian providers are only too willing to see the short-term benefit and ignore the long-term loss and the long-term damage that they cause by building up expectations that can never be realised. From this side of the chamber to the government side of the chamber, if we can work constructively to put those sorts of activities behind us we will be all the better for it.


The figures are interesting. A previous speaker mentioned that 125,000 full-time equivalent positions were generated here in Australia for service providers to provide educational services for overseas students—a very impressive figure. When we saw the downturn, unfortunately the dramatic loss of those positions was also reported to us. What is equally interesting to me is that, of the 380,000 students who had student visas, the average number of family member visits per student was 1.8 last year. If my calculations are correct, somewhere approaching 700,000 visitors come to this country who would not have come had their relative not been studying here. Again, that is something which we should surely be encouraging. I would be very interested to learn from tourism authorities and others about what the yield might have been. How high spending were those overseas visitors who came directly as a result of their student relative being here?


Of course, that 380,000 student figure is low because it only includes those on student visas. When you add in short-term, English-as-a-second-language students who come here on tourist visas, we would see that number of students, with the multiplier effect, dramatically increased. Those of us who have had sons or daughters overseas on Rotary exchange or similar types of programs always seem to find an opportunity to visit them when we otherwise would not have gone there. We all know the attraction and the power that accompanies these sorts of visits, and we would often see a multiplier effect with the visitors going back to their home country, speaking well of Australia, speaking well of their relative's experience here and generating others to come.


It is interesting to listen to the evidence, particularly from those who were providing short-term training, especially in the English language. For example, English Australia advised us that the number of students under the umbrella that they represented had decreased from 219,000 in 2008 to 122,000 in 2011. The number had almost halved in that three-year period. That has a dramatic effect on employment, service provision and the jobs of those who would have been providing the service. It is also interesting that there was a 30 per cent decline in the number coming from China for short-term courses in the English language, a 40 per cent decline in those coming from Thailand and a 50 per cent decline in those coming from Vietnam—some of the very markets that we want to promote to. I go back to tourism. Naturally enough, in terms of yield, in terms of dollars left and dollars invested—not in terms of numbers yet—we know that China has become the highest contributor to offshore tourism to this country. We should not overlook those opportunities.


Recommendations were put forward to the department and onwards to the government, especially when it came to questions about prepayment fees. I thought very good suggestions were put forward by those organisations. They said that we are now in stiff competition with service providers from other countries and that we do not want to put into place legislation that would make it so unnecessarily onerous for those wanting to come to Australia that they look to other countries. We would simply be denying ourselves the opportunity.


It was put to us that representatives support the intent of the legislation—and I am quoting here from correspondence to me—'to ensure that fees are utilised for the study period for which they are collected' and that 'the proposed legislation proposes two broad mechanisms to achieve it: firstly, depositing funds into a nominated account and drawing it down; and—not or; and—secondly, putting a limit on collection of no more than six months or 50 per cent of the fees themselves'. These people made the point eloquently that the objectives would be served by either one of those two but that the administrative burden of having to comply with the two of them was certainly unnecessary. They said it would be expensive and it would be confusing for the overseas students. So I still ask that the government give consideration to what have been very reasonable submissions from them.


If nominating an account and drawing it down was not enough, they would strongly recommend that legislation to limit fee collection to no more than two weeks prior to the course commencing be abolished entirely or extended to a minimum of six weeks. The point they were making is that, in a very short course, the confusion associated with having to break the payment into two, the administration associated with collecting the funds a second time and the inconvenience to those who are supporting overseas students in having to make two payments rather than one is simply unnecessary.


If ever there was an instance in which a risk management approach should be taken to this whole question, then the funding for and protection of overseas students as part of their education is a prime example. I am interested in knowing the sort of risk analysis that was done on those service providers who failed. I am interested in knowing, for example, the status and structure of those which failed. Were they the university sector? Were they the publicly owned TAFE sector? Were they long-established Australian companies? Were they long-established Australian private providers? Were they substantially overseas companies or organisations that had come into Australia to take advantage of this burgeoning demand?


Until we know the background of those who failed—of those who failed their students, of those who took money and ran with it—I do not believe we can introduce legislation that is a catch-all for all purposes. For example, do we think for one minute that any one of the 28 or 29 universities in this country are going to close up shop and run away with overseas student money? The answer is patently no. Do we think that would happen with state owned, run and managed TAFEs or their equivalent? The answer is no. Therefore, it is critically important that we apply legislation on the basis of risk, and where there is no risk or low risk then the legislation should reflect that. We have many analogies. We have the capacity to put funds into escrow. We have the capacity to place a bond on a new provider if we perceive there is a risk associated with their capacity or willingness to deliver on what they are charging and claiming. I do not yet see that we have this approach.


I see we have a sledgehammer to kill a nut. I see we have a one-size-fits-all approach. I do not think this is the way to go. I do not believe we get the best when we penalise those for whom there is no risk associated with the activity, function or legislation under which they will be caught. I made this point to the department, I made it in the hearing itself: we must be much more forensic, if that is the term, in identifying where the risk lies and in applying treatments to that risk to ensure that we minimise or negate it. If it does not exist, do not impose the penalty or imposition in the first place. Witnesses before us and submissions placed before us from the various service providers made that point.


On the point of competition, Australia has a great track record of 'aid, trade and fade'. If time permitted I could go through industry after industry where we have provided aid throughout regions of interest to us, that has led to trade and, for various reasons, we have faded. I make the plea that we do not fade. But, in so doing, I also make the point that it is such a lucrative opportunity that it is not just this country that has that opportunity, it is countries throughout Asia—the Philippines, for instance. Our universities have campuses in Singapore, Malaysia and other countries, and increasingly now in the Middle East, in the United Arab Emirates et cetera. So let us not think for a minute—arrogantly—that we are the only country capable of providing these educational services.


There are two things I do not want to see happening: firstly, our own service providers shifting offshore because they cannot—or do not want to and do not believe they need to—comply with restrictive legislation here and move offshore to locations where they do not have these levels of governance and insistence but can still equally and safely provide the education; and, secondly, our being disadvantaged as a result of overseas service providers setting up and taking the very market that we are building a reputation for and in which we have enormous capacity for growth.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-02-29,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:22):  I will first reflect on some of the comments made by Senator Back in his comprehensive contribution on this package of education services for overseas students legislation, not so much on points of difference but on matters that need to be sorted out in the committee stage. There is no doubt there is unanimity in this place about the importance of the overseas student sector. It is a significant part of Australia's economy. In my home state of South Australia it is one of the biggest export earners. South Australia is better as an economy and as a community because of the overseas student sector. It would be fair during the committee stage to explore the concerns around risk raised by Senator Back and others in the coalition. My understanding, as I read the bill, is that all but the lowest risk providers will have to keep prepaid fees in a designated account for the first study period. There is an element in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations that relates to risk that ought to be explored. The committee inquiry was very ably chaired by Senator Gavin Marshall and the deputy chair, Senator Back. 


We not only need to strike a balance between ensuring that we do not have so much red tape that it becomes an onerous burden on educational institutions but also need to have some security, some sense of guarantee, for those overseas students who sign up for these courses that they will be able to pay those fees with the security that if anything does go wrong with an education provider they will not be out of pocket. That is the very important policy balance that needs to be obtained.


Let us put this in perspective. This is a major sector which is very important to Australia's economy and very important to my home state of South Australia. I have spoken in the past about my concerns for the overseas student sector in Australia and how we slipped back for a whole range of reasons. One of the big challenges we now have is a very strong Australian dollar, which is making us less competitive in the overseas student sector. The government needs to be congratulated for the action it has taken so far. The Baird review was a positive review that looked at a whole range of issues to comprehensively deal with these problems. The fact that Mr Bruce Baird AM was a former senior coalition politician indicates that the government has tackled this issue in a bipartisan fashion, and that is a good thing.


In my home state of South Australia, overseas students make up nearly 10 per cent of the state's total exports compared to between seven and eight per cent nationally. That is why I have a vested interest, if you like, on behalf of my constituents to make sure we get this right. Unfortunately, some unscrupulous education providers have taken advantage of the strong growth in this sector to make a quick buck. In 2009 and 2010 we heard story after story of students who had come to Australia only to find the course was not what they paid for and, in some cases, the course and the provider no longer existed. There were also distressing stories of students forced to undertake long hours of physical labour in exchange for minimal education. This, coupled with disturbing accounts of isolated attacks against overseas students, even though they were universally condemned, began to reduce confidence in the sector. The overhaul of provider standards and regulations along with the establishment of an overseas students ombudsman have finally begun to pay off with improved standards and increased confidence for providers and students alike.


I note the work the government has done in implementing the Baird review, and this package of legislation is a part of that. The Australian overseas student education sector is much stronger as a result of these changes, and I support the government's intentions in these bills. I also support the government's amendments to these bills, which are in line with the recommendations made by the committee.


I will be moving again—I hope it is a case of third time lucky—amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and I will discuss these in more detail during the committee stage. In brief, my amendment simply gives the minister the discretionary power to make payments to overseas students to cover incidental costs such as travel or accommodation where a provider has failed to deliver the services as promised. It is a discretion for the minister that I think can be exercised in a way and in a manner that could enhance confidence in the sector. These payments could only be made after consultation with the Director of the Tuition Protection Service and if they do not put the TPS in financial difficulty. I am trying to get that blend of ensuring that it strengthens the sector and also ties it back to fiscal responsibility. These measures are sensible and straightforward and have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that they do not place an excessive burden on the scheme.


I support these bills. I think it is fair, though, that some of the concerns raised by Senator Back and other coalition senators in their additional comments to the committee report be addressed. As I see it, we need to strengthen support and confidence in the sector. That will involve some costs, but the benefits of that will be to have more overseas students coming to Australia knowing with greater confidence that they will be protected from unscrupulous operators, the very small minority that taint the sector. The measures in this bill are a positive step.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:28):  I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate and appreciate the positive manner and constructive way in which they have approached these issues. I will not delay the chamber too long in summing up other than to say that this is the final response to the Baird review, which I think has been a very good process designed to address some of the issues which were exposed in terms of the management and support for overseas students studying in Australia. I congratulate Mr Bruce Baird on the role he has played.


I also thank all those who contributed to the debate around these bills. We have listened to the sector and their concerns, but there is one overriding objective in all of this, which I continue to stress: this is a competitive international industry. Brand Australia is really important in this debate. For every closure of a college or every student who is treated poorly, the impact is felt around the world in terms of Australia's reputation. It does not matter whether it is the small cooking college in Melbourne or the Australian National University; a poor experience for someone in the small cooking college in Melbourne impacts on the ANU and every other university and college that is out there marketing its services as part of Australian international education.


So it is very important that we get this right. It is very important that we provide as much protection and support for those international students and the sector as possible. That is done by making sure we have a very rigorous regulatory environment which supports the sector, supports its capacity, supports its responsiveness to the needs of students and ensures that we continue to support a really strong international reputation for our international education sector.


I have heard the concerns of stakeholders about some of the business aspects of these changes and the good work that came out of the Senate committee inquiry, so the government will be moving some amendments to give providers more time to notify the TPS Director of provider and student defaults. We think these suggestions, made and picked up by the Senate committee inquiry, are good ones and so we will be moving amendments to support the approach that was recommended in that report.


I do not think we have enough evidence to support some of the amendments that have been moved by the Greens and Senator Xenophon. I am not sure whether he is still moving amendments; I heard he was moving amendments but I will have to double check.




Senator Xenophon:
  You heard right.




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  Okay. I heard right. You looked quizzical, Senator, so I thought maybe I had heard wrong.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  We will come to that in time, but I do appreciate the constructive manner in which senators have engaged in this. I remind people that the passage of these bills is essential if we are going to get the 1 July 2012 date, but I will deal with the amendments as we move through the committee stages.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-02-29,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:45):  Over the last six months Tasmanians have opened their hearts to men seeking asylum at the temporary immigration detention facility at Pontville in southern Tasmania. Despite attempts at fearmongering and whipping up moral panic by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the Pontville Immigration Detention Centre has been embraced by Tasmanians, so much so that in recent weeks there has been a groundswell of support from the Mayor of Brighton, Tony Foster OAM, the Tasmanian government, including Premier Lara Giddings, support organisations and locals, who see the presence of the centre in their community as an opportunity rather than a threat. There can be no doubt that at the end of its six months in operation, Pontville has been a success and its impact on the local area overwhelmingly positive.


Not only is the Pontville centre safe and secure, but it is also supported by the outstanding Brighton community. In the months in which it has been open, the centre has become a focal point for national and local service providers, community organisations and volunteers, who have dedicated themselves to compassionate care and support to the asylum seekers. And there is no doubt that the great cooperation between the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and service organisations has assisted in the rapid processing of visa applications.


Tasmanians have reached out to these men, many of whom depend on the companionship of volunteer buddies to ease them through the trying time while their claims are being assessed and, in doing so, made that process smoother than it might otherwise have been. In these six months, almost 400 men housed at Pontville have already been released on permanent or bridging visas or into community detention. There remain currently 262 men in the Pontville Immigration Detention Centre. The large majority of these asylum seekers will be released into the community on permanent or bridging visas or released into community detention. I have been assured that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is working as hard as it can to enable the greatest number of asylum seekers to be released from Pontville over the next month before the centre closes. A small group of asylum seekers will be relocated over the next month as their applications are still being processed.


On 16 February 2012, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Minister Chris Bowen, reiterated his commitment that the Pontville Immigration Detention Centre will close. It is my belief that the proximity of the Pontville centre to Brighton and to Hobart has been critical to facilitating volunteer support, and I am encouraged that the men still being assessed will be relocated to immigration centres located near capital cities.


I would also take this opportunity to impress upon this chamber that the centre at Pontville was not only a model of detention that was mindful of the needs and care that ought to be accorded asylum seekers but also a model that was effective. I want to acknowledge the role of the facility's DIAC manager, Dean Hulme; SERCO manager Andy Senior; and the staff who all approached a challenging situation with good planning and respect for the needs of the centre's occupants. Though I understand the minister's commitment to close Pontville, I hope that this model can be replicated in other detention centres and the building's facilities at Pontville are maintained against the possibility that they may be required again in the future.


Naturally, all of us in this chamber hope for an orderly and regular refugee migration system—and one from an ever-decreasing pool of global refugees. But if we should be required to accommodate irregular migration on the basis of our international commitments then let us follow the lead of the Brighton community and do so with open arms. Let us be as the volunteers in that community and the people calling for this centre to stay open, and stand ready with the generosity and care that that community has demonstrated.


Alongside staff-run programs, the volunteer support has been able to provide activities that accelerate and ease the transition of asylum seekers into the community and make the time necessary for assessment useful. Those activities have included a range of English and Arabic language classes, driving lessons, world news updates, visits to iconic areas, gardening and yoga. In many cases, the volunteer programs have not just been about acclimatising asylum seekers to their new Australian environment; they have also been about sharing the skills, knowledge and experiences of asylum seekers with locals—providing a real opportunity to foster the kind of understanding and connection that is necessary to bind a community together outside the walls of detention.


One particular story, I think, captures the spirit of these relationships. The Brighton Knitting Club welcomed the asylum seekers by dedicating their time to knit beanies and other clothing in all sorts of colours for the men in the centre, cognisant of the newness of Tasmania's colder climate to the mainly Afghani asylum seekers. But a number of women went further, visiting the centre with knitting needles in hand, prepared to teach the men how to supplement the clothes they had been provided. They were surprised, and pleased, to discover that the Hazara occupants of the centre were already skilled at knitting, many having made their livelihoods with similar skills in making and weaving carpets. In the regular visits to follow, the men and women swapped skills at the same time as they swapped stories. There is little greater example, I think, of multiculturalism in action than people of totally different backgrounds and experiences bonding over the interests and activities that they share, each teaching the other a new ability and a new empathy.


It was a belief in these things that led Emily Conolan to harness the enthusiasm of the Tasmanian community and establish Tasmanian Asylum Seekers Support. Shortly after announcing the purpose of the group, Emily was overwhelmed by the number of people who wanted to be part of a constructive engagement with Australia's humanitarian immigration program. Over 150 volunteers have visited asylum seekers on a regular basis through the kind of coordinated activities about which I have spoken. Some have worked one on one with an asylum seeker to provide direct company and support. Each of those people deserves thanks—not just for their compassion but also for their preparedness to look past the barriers, the physical walls, the trepidation of the unexpected and the cultural differences that too often prevent us from genuinely engaging with others. Their support has helped to make Pontville a more hopeful place. And of course Emily deserves thanks for seizing the initiative that has made such a positive experience possible.


There is bipartisan consensus on the need for thorough immigration processing, including a period of mandatory detention. But we must always remember that the object of an orderly immigration program is not only to protect the Australian community but also to provide refuge to those seeking safety. The vast majority of people who seek asylum in Australia are those who have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin. For one reason or another, their very identity—their ethnicity, their beliefs or sexuality—make them unwelcome in their home countries. They have made the decision to uproot their lives because they face violence, intimidation and discrimination, without recourse to the laws we in Australia take for granted.


The stories of most asylum seekers are stories of fear. For them, Australia is exactly the lucky country of which its people are so proud. Asylum seekers come to our shores by whatever means they can in search of the freedoms, opportunities and rights that make us the liberal democracy we are. Through a storm of danger and desperation, Australia is the first safe harbour in which refugees are permitted to be themselves. In Australia, every person is protected by the law and by the social contract that is so deeply a part of our community, no matter the person's background or identity. Those who violate that contract by breaking the law surrender some of its benefits, such as liberty. But those who seek refuge from lawlessness or from violations of the universal laws of human dignity must be protected by our contract. They must have access to the protections of our society and the security and safety that implies. Such protections are the seeds of possibility. They offer the chance to make a life inspired by optimism rather than by apprehension. They offer hope.


During the years of coalition government from 1996 to 2007, Australia's immigration detention regime had the effect of systematically crushing the hope of refugees that they would ever have the chance to begin a new life. Under the Howard government, families with young children were kept behind razor wire for years on end. Some were released into the community with papers known as temporary protection visas, under which genuine refugees were required to constantly reapply to remain in Australia or be forced to return to the country in which they had suffered persecution. Under the so-called Pacific solution, other refugees were sent to detention on Nauru, a tiny island where some stayed for up to three years with little human contact. For every refugee who has overcome incredible odds to build a new life, there is a person whose hope has been consumed by tragedy or a journey to shelter which is just too far. 


Worst of all is when the promise on which their hope rested turns out to be as precarious as the lives they left behind. It is no surprise that many refugees who are already suffering under the weight of psychological trauma—from fleeing a crisis or enduring a prolonged ordeal—simply could not cope with such gruelling stress. Instead of escaping to safety, these asylum seekers too often found a novel type of torment: physical or psychological isolation, captivity and the restriction of freedom. In such conditions, the most tenacious hope would turn to a spiral of despair. In these conditions, optimism degenerated into severe mental disorders. The evidence is clear that length of confinement is associated with the progressive deterioration in mental state. Similarly, the uncertainty of TPV status was the greatest single contributor amongst refugees to post-traumatic stress disorder. The effects of such trauma are profound and enduring. Refugees held in detention for only a short time have far better settlement outcomes than those in prolonged detention. Those whose faith has survived until settlement in the community are less restless and far more likely to move quickly into employment and accommodation and to build relationships in the community.


I am pleased that under the Labor government the parameters for mandatory detention have been dramatically recast. Labor abolished TPVs, ending that regime of dreadful fear and uncertainty. On 18 October 2010, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that the government would expand the numbers of low-risk and vulnerable family groups and children being housed in community based accommodation rather than in detention centres. Today, children are no longer held in detention centres, and 1,600 people, mainly vulnerable families, are in the community under residence determination. Recently, the Department of Immigration And Citizenship updated this house through Senate estimates. By next year, one-third of asylum seekers will be issued bridging visas to live and work in the community while their claims are assessed, and another 20 percent will be in community detention.


Yesterday the Attorney-General and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs announced the next stage in the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture in order for Australian law to better reflect our commitment to human rights. OPCAT provides for a robust and thorough inspection regime amongst the detention facilities, including prisons, police custodial facilities and, of course, immigration detention centres.


The national interest analysis tabled yesterday by the government makes it clear that even when human rights are a principal consideration of existing detention facilities, as I believe they are under this Labor government, there is still great benefit in a strengthened inspection regime. Indeed, the New Zealand Human Rights Commission noted in its 2010 annual report that OPCAT was valuable for 'identifying issues and situations that are otherwise overlooked, and in providing authoritative assessments of whether new developments and specific initiatives will meet the international standards for safe and humane detention'. 


Checks and balances on any sort of power are a basic requirement for fairness and justice, and there can be no doubt that vigilance regarding human rights should be a basic requirement in the power exercised through the detention system. I look forward to discussing OPCAT, in particular when it comes to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, as I believe its ratification is of vital significance to the national interest and to honouring our obligation to the global community. I and this government are deeply committed to finding ways to promote the dignity of the individual, especially the vulnerable and those in need, while advancing the interests of the community as a whole. The continued reform of our immigration system is part of that—a reform program that will need to be sustained in order to reverse a punitive culture, reflecting the worst of attitudes towards those who seek only safety, that developed under the previous government. I acknowledge that, right now, too many people still languish in long-term detention, I acknowledge that we are still seeking an agreement to prevent lives being risked on leaky boats, and I acknowledge that immigration continues to be one of the most vexed policy issues in Australia, but surely the compassion displayed by Tasmanians at Brighton shows we all agree our policies should be guided by the hope that brings people to our shores to start a new and better life.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (15:02):  I seek leave to have additional information incorporated in Hansard in response to a question asked by Senator Back yesterday, 28 February.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—





The Government position on the ABCC has been clear for a long period of time.



Prior to the 2007 and 2010 elections, Labor made a commitment to the Australian people that it would replace the ABCC with a new body, a body that is part of our Fair Work system and a body that is charged with ensuring lawful conduct in the building and construction sector—which is such an important sector for our national economy. This Bill honours those commitments.




The Bill has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, 
Employment 
and Workplace Relations for inquiry and report. That occurred on 10 
November 2011.





The Committee has conducted their inquiry and the Committee are due to present their 
report to the Senate today 29 February 2012.





It is the not the first time the Committee has inquired into the Bill and not the first time it 
has reported on the key aspects of the Bill.





I note the Opposition have a motion on the notice paper that they want to refer the Bill to 
the Committee for a further inquiry and report.





The Opposition, rather than accepting the will of the Australian people are now just 
trying to stop the Government from implementing its commitment to them.



That's why the Government will not be supporting this motion from the Opposition.




We want to get on with delivering what the Australian people have asked for and so will 
not agree to the Bill going back to the Committee for a third time.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2012-02-29,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


Today's Australian tells us that Senator Carr was offered Senator Arbib's job and former foreign minister Kevin Rudd's job last week. Senator Arbib told the Senate today that he told the Prime Minister on Monday, 27 February that he was resigning. If this is the case, whose vacancy did Prime Minister Gillard have in mind? There must have been someone in mind to roll in New South Wales to enable the offer to be given effect to. Or was Senator Arbib really pushed, despite his assertions to the contrary?


Minister Carr has confirmed the offer; Julie Gillard had denied it. Who is telling the truth? Given the PM's form on so many broken promises, we know who to believe. So much for the Prime Minister's alleged new assertiveness; the faceless men have forced the withdrawal of her offer. Julie Gillard has egg on her face. It is business as usual.


It was very interesting to hear Senator Arbib's response to Senator Brandis. I am sure, Senator Arbib, that you take away from this place a wealth of information. I have of course suggested that you write a book. As I said yesterday evening, I am sure it will be a bestseller. But perhaps now, Senator Arbib, that you are retiring, you could transfer your considerable parliamentary skills and return to our screens on a full-time basis. Many of our colleagues in this place would be unaware that, before becoming a powerful New South Wales right factional leader, and ultimately one of the faceless men, our Senator Arbib was a star of the small screen.



An opposition senator:  What?




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Yes, and he started early. At the age of 18 there was our Senator Arbib on our screens in no less than that iconic Channel 7 soapie Home and Away. In a precursor of things to come, episode 368, aired on 8 April 1989, shows young Mark Arbib in the role of Freddie Hudson—a young man visiting the youth centre because he was having a few hassles at home. And here is a photo of him—even with hair! Here he is with a serious, grim, focused look.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Arbib, did you rise on a point of order?




Senator Arbib:
  Yes. Can I ask that that photo be tabled, please, or burnt—one or the other?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Arbib, of course I am happy to table it. Here he is with a serious, grim, focused look; a prelude to the political bloodletting, cutting and thrusting which was to propel him to the heights of New South Wales and national politics—but, as Senator Arbib allegedly gave Richo as his reason for leaving, he was 'sick of being covered in blood'. Anyone interested in seeing this, go to YouTube; I will give you the reference—clearly an omen for the current soap opera of unhappy political families that have become a daily feature of Australian political life. The closing credits recognise Mark Arbib as playing the character called Freddie. Funny—the acting was something, Senator Arbib, that you omitted to mention in your maiden speech when you listed the many occupations that you held before entering parliament. Mark Arbib's career has certainly been stellar—perhaps not quite in the same league as other former soapie stars, like Kylie Minogue, but he has certainly become a household name. It is interesting to note, Senator Arbib, that in your maiden speech you made mention of your grandmother's great disappointment when you told her you were running for the Senate. You stated:


She questioned why I would take a job that lasted only six years and suggested I consider taking a more secure job as a bank teller.


Sadly for your grandmother, your job here lasted all of three years and five months. Perhaps, with hindsight, the bank teller job may have been a safer and more edifying career option.


Senator Arbib may tell us that he is leaving to help the healing process. Great sentiment, Senator Arbib, but all it means is that there will be one less faceless man. There may be one less, but they will remain in charge. The only way to restore hope, reward and opportunity is to go to an election. In the sentiment in which my contribution was made, I take the opportunity to wish Senator Arbib all the best in his new career.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:08):  It is only Thursday, and groundhog day continues with this obsession on the other side of what is happening in our caucus. We had questions put to Minister Arbib from Senator Brandis about his desire to move on. Senator Arbib has legitimate reasons: he is a family man. I have seen his two young daughters and they are legitimate concerns and legitimate reasons for him to consider his resignation. 


Without casting aspersions on the other side, let us have a close look at what happens in their caucus room. Just yesterday—as you know, Deputy President Parry, because you were there—they were crying over spilt milk, or was it a glass of cheap milk? No doubt there were other members who leapt to the defence of the particular senator who was under attack by those from other factions when their group—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  Why don't you pop your Alzheimer's pills, Senator Macdonald? I am not directing that at you; I do not think you take any pills. You seem a fit and healthy senator.


Then it was Senator Boyce's turn. She wanted to talk about the Rolls-Royce parental leave scheme that Mr Tony Abbott has proposed that will harm big businesses and jobs. There is no surprise in that, about harming jobs, because we know their record when it comes to jobs. When we on this side implemented the national stimulus package, we protected jobs in our communities. Up to 200,000 jobs were protected from the global financial crisis. And what did those opposite want to do? They wanted to oppose it, and they did oppose it in this chamber and in the other place to stop people being employed, to stop people having opportunities to sustain their employment out in the community. That is just a small snapshot of what happens in the opposition caucus: spilt milk and Alzheimer's pills. Put them together and what sort of concoction will you get? Who knows.


Let us talk about some of the other questions that were put to senators on this side in question time today, particularly on climate change. Once again we heard the climate change coalition sceptics complaining about what we are doing for the environment. If I reflect back a couple of years ago, some senators who are here—Senator Cameron and Senator Pratt—were on a climate change inquiry with me. We heard cold, hard facts and evidence from the likes of the CSIRO, from NASA and from over 1,000 top scientists globally about why we need to act on climate change. Senator Cameron was well informed, along with the rest of us, including the now Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, about why we need to act on climate change. Yet those opposite, the climate sceptics, buried their heads in the sand, like they always do, and denied it. What does Mr Abbott say about climate change? Doesn't he call it 'absolute crap'? It is fitting to use that sort of language, given the language that was used in the coalition's caucus yesterday, with some senator being called an 'f-wit'. This is the type of opposition that wants to gain government at some stage in the future. Let us hope that never occurs, because that is their style. 


When it comes to the opposition's style, we know their position on policy and legislation in this place. It is a vacuum of empty cupboards. There is one word they are consistent with, though, and that is no: 'No, no, no'. They are consistently putting that position forward to present their case on how they wish to look after our great nation. But we are going to look after our nation. This government will make sure that at least nine out of 10 citizens will be assisted. Households will have permanent assistance as a result of pension rises of $338 a year and singles up to $510 a year. And that will be indexed as well.


I want to spend a little bit of time on the issue of what the coalition is going to do, conversely. They want to take back $1,300 a year from families as a result of what their policy will provide. In doing that, they will have their $70 billion black hole and they are going to have to run into severe deficit for a number of years. Where are they going to get that money from? Are they going to get it from pensioners? Are they going to rip it out of other areas where people need it the most? Are they going to rip it away from single mums and single householders that need that money the most? Surely that is the position they will come to. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2012-02-29,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:13):  I think I am going to have to raise the tone of the debate in this chamber and concentrate on Senator Wong's answers to questions today. Who remembers a few days ago, when the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Minister Combet, said this: 


From 2020, all nations face binding obligations to reduce emissions and our major regional trading partners … will expect us to deliver along with them.


And what have we learned today from the front page of the Australian? What is one of our major trading partners, indeed the world's third-largest economy, doing about a price on carbon? What have we learned? Let us have a look at page 1 of the Australian:


Senior Japanese diplomatic officials in Tokyo have told The Australian there is 'no chance' of the country adopting a scheme similar to Australia's carbon tax or emissions trading scheme in the foreseeable future.


That is what the front page of today's Australian reports the Japanese to be doing.


The coalition's argument against a carbon tax is simple, has always been simple and can be said in one sentence: the carbon tax is not in our national interest, certainly not now. We argue that only when a sufficiently comprehensive group of our major trading partners, particularly those countries that are, like Australia, energy-rich, trade exposed nations such as Canada, Russia and Brazil, commit to a price on carbon will it be in our national interest to do so. The coalition has argued that from the beginning. If Australia acts unilaterally, it will not change the environment, it will not change our weather and it will not change the climate at all. It is a very simple argument, and has been from the word go.


China and India say they are going to do something, but I will believe it when I see it. The Economist came out on 25 February. Just off the press, it said:


China is still likely to consume 4.4 billion tonnes of coal in 2030, when its carbon emissions are expected to have increased from 6.8 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent in 2005 to 15 billion tonnes.


That is more than double. The Chinese and the Indians can promise all they like, but their consumption is going up, and it is going way up.


The great lie is not about whether there should be a carbon tax or not. The great lie was not even the Prime Minister's dishonesty about whether there would be a carbon tax. That is not the great lie. The great lie is pretty simple: the Labor Party has argued very simply that it is in our national interest to have a price on carbon irrespective of what any other nation on earth does.




Senator Farrell:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order. We have a very good system for noise in this chamber. Could the senator be requested to tone his—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is not a point of order, but I take your point. Senator Mason, could you just monitor the decibels, not to curb your enthusiasm.




Senator MASON:
  I thought I was speaking very quietly, as I always do—and you know that, Mr Deputy President. This is the problem: the Labor Party has argued from the beginning that it is in our national interest to have a carbon tax even if no other nation on earth does anything. That is the great lie. That is the lie that this government should be pinned on. The Prime Minister's dishonesty comes and goes, but that lie will stick with the Labor Party from now to eternity because it is false and they know it is false.


In other words, the Australian Labor Party believe that Australia should act unilaterally, that it should act irrespective of what any other country on earth does. They are the great unilateralists. In the end, if we act fundamentally unilaterally it will destroy our economy and our way of life, and other resource-rich, trade exposed countries will take advantage of our leverage, our legislation and our carbon pricing. In the end, that is Labor's great failure. Only when this debate matures to the level where the Labor Party finally understands that we rely on the rest of the world to act will the government finally come to some sense, but I am not holding my breath.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:19):  Through you, Mr Deputy President, I assure those in the gallery that there is usually a far more serious debate in this place than they just heard from Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Here we are in a period where the global financial crisis is still destroying jobs around the rest of the world, where the US and Europe are trying to deal with huge problems, and what do we get? We get an absolute comedy routine from the opposition. Senator Mason's response was not much better; that was merely a comedy routine as well. If you know the coalition's policies—and I use the plural because you never know what their policy on climate change will be from one day to another—you will know that the coalition adopted a price on carbon to go to the last election that John Howard fought and lost. John Howard was arguing for a price on carbon.


Since people are showing things around, I will do a little advertising here. I picked up a book today called The Australian Moment: How We Were Made for These Times by George Megalogenis, one of the key economic commentators and writers in this country. He describes how John Howard dealt with climate change. He says that John Howard was a climate change chameleon: he changed whenever it suited him from one position to another. It is not just John Howard who is a climate change chameleon; the coalition are also climate change chameleons. They change their position whenever they think it suits their political position.


This is what George Megalogenis said about John Howard in this book, which was launched today and which I recommend everybody get a copy of to see the truth about the Howard government's position. In January 2007, it says, John Howard offered $10 billion for a federal takeover of the Murray-Darling without consulting Treasury for advice on the numbers. Those great economic managers over on the coalition side offered $10 billion and they did not even go to the Treasury to ask what it would mean and what it would do. So that puts the lie to the argument of economic responsibility on the other side. He said in June that he became a convert to a market based mechanism to deal with climate change after receiving his own report written by Peter Shergold, the head of the Prime Minister's department. 


If you do not know, Peter Shergold is highly respected around the place. He was one of the key advisers to John Howard and he wrote a report that said we should put a price on carbon and it should be based on a carbon emissions scheme. John Howard promised a domestic emissions trading scheme, a cap-and-trade system, beginning no later than 2012. We heard all that nonsense—and the chameleons were at it again over there. He said for years he had argued against Australia moving before anyone else in the region—and now he wants to go first! This is John Howard. He wanted to go before anybody with a price on carbon, as Australia had done with tariffs. 'Australia will continue to lead internationally on climate change,' he said, 'globally and in the Asia-Pacific region, not in a way that lectures and moralises but in a way that builds support for global action to meet the enormous challenge of climate change.'


That destroys the argument Senator Mason was putting up that the coalition are acting responsibly by not moving on climate change. The coalition's own report, the Shergold report—and anyone from the coalition who stands up after me will have to deal with the Shergold report—says you have to act early to deal with climate change because climate change is real; climate change is what your grandkids are going to be living with in the future; we have to deal with it, and the most economically responsible way to deal with it is by putting a price on carbon. These lunatics do not realise that. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:24):  I listened very intently to Senator Cameron's contribution. It followed the lines of Senator Wong today in question time, applauding and lauding the carbon tax that is going to be imposed upon all Australians and send every Australian's cost of living up. Senator Cameron, if it is so good, why is it that your leader, the leader of the Labor Party, the current Prime Minister—this week, anyhow—promised before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads? If it is so good, Senator Cameron, please explain to me why your Prime Minister, your Labor leader, promised to the Australian public, hand on heart, that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads?


I want to return to the carbon tax shortly. But this debate started with reference to Senator Arbib's imminent departure. I wish Senator Arbib well. I did not have a lot to do with him, but I thought he was one of the more competent Labor ministers—not that that is great praise for him. I wish him well in the future. I do not know what Senator Arbib is going to do. Some suggest he might be joining up with his old mates Mr Eddie Obeid and Mr Eric Roozendaal from the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. I understand they have had business dealings before. Perhaps they are going back into those business dealings. In fact, I just googled on my iPad a rather interesting article by Kate McClymont in the Sydney Morning Herald—not a paper I usually read in Queensland—that made a very interesting connection between Senator Arbib, Mr Obeid, Mr Roozendaal and Mr Williamson, from the Health Services Union, who is very prominent at the moment. There is a sort of winding up of what seem to be business interests there. So I wish Senator Arbib well, and I hope that he enjoys life outside of parliament.


I want to return to the carbon tax debate that was mentioned in question time today. Let me read you a passage from Hansard:


Let us deal with a few facts. Let us have a scientific debate about climate change and its potential impact on the tourism industry. Globally, aviation contributes just two per cent of greenhouse gas emissions but eight per cent of world GDP—that is, 28 million jobs and $US3 trillion. Recently, the less than august Australia Institute—an organisation for which I have no respect because it seems to pride itself on belting low-income people in Australia—proposed a carbon tax, an elitist tax, on domestic flights and called for an end to the promotion of the aviation industry. Never mind that, according to the Australian Greenhouse Office’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, civil aviation contributes just 0.9 per cent of Australia’s emissions. If we got rid of the entire aviation industry, as the Australia Institute would have it, we would still be left with 99 per cent of Australia’s emissions.


Who said that? It was Mr Martin Ferguson, the current Minister for Resources and Energy. When he said that, back in 2007, he was the shadow spokesman on transport. Martin Ferguson is a minister who I think is reasonably competent—again, that is not a great recommendation when you consider the ministers that we have. Martin Ferguson is sensible. There was Martin Ferguson saying what a ridiculous idea a carbon tax was. And yet, to Mr Ferguson's undying shame, he was one who breached the promise that the Labor Party would never introduce a carbon tax.


In the north of Australia, which I represent, Airnorth has just started a new direct service between Townsville and Darwin. It is a great service, but the cost is going to increase by $7 each way because of the carbon tax. Come 1 July, prices for airline travel all across Northern Australia will have to go up because of this ridiculous carbon tax, which will just add to the cost of living of all Australians.

NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT (REFORM) BILL (NO. 1) 2012


The Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill (No. 1) 2012 is the second iteration of Native Title reform proposed by the Australian Greens. 


The Bill seeks to address key failures of the Native Title Act 1993 (NTA). We want to provide meaningful rights and a basis for economic and community development to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Something the Act has failed to do in the 18 years since it came into force.


By introducing this Bill and any further reforms we intend to contribute constructively to a debate about native title reform that can ultimately lead to simpler legislation which produces more meaningful outcomes in a more timely fashion for all those involved.


In March 2011, I introduced the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill 2011. The Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Standing Committee in May last year. Over 35 submissions were received, from a range of stakeholders and government agencies during the course of the inquiry. The majority of these were supportive of the intent of the legislation – many noting the great need for the Native Title Act to be reformed. The submissions contained many useful suggestions on how the Bill might be strengthened and improved.


This new Bill builds on those suggestions. We have closely examined the submissions and incorporated numerous revisions, creating a more robust and effective piece of law.


In the original Bill we sought to address some of the 'low-hanging fruit' of native title reform – by targeting some of the areas of native title law where relatively simple amendments could have far-reaching implications for addressing some of the current barriers to effective native title outcomes. In this Bill we have chosen the most important and most urgent of those areas and drafted amendments which we hope will gain broad support.


We are still committed to incorporating aspects of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into the Native Title Act. We are currently exploring the best way to do this and intend to introduce another Bill later this year.


As I said when I introduced the original Bill, if we do not work together to traverse the ""impenetrable jungle""1 that is native title litigation, there is little hope for just outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The second reading speech for the original Bill is still relevant for this current revised Bill:


... nearly two decades after the introduction of the NTA it is clear that native title has failed to deliver on its promises.


The Preamble states that …


""The people of Australia intend:


(a)   to rectify the consequences of past injustices by the special measures contained in this Act… for securing the adequate advancement and protection of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders; and


(b)   to ensure that Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders receive the full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire.""


We hope that by the time we reach the twentieth anniversary of the NTA in 2013, the process of native title reform will be seriously underway, and we will be able to see native title delivering on some of the seemingly forgotten promises contained in the preamble to and objects of the NTA.


In practice, the people who the Act recognises and describes as ""…the most disadvantaged group in society…"" as a consequence of the dispossession of their lands, have had to rely on one of the longest and most complex pieces of Australian legislation to try to ""…secure their advancement…"" and to recognise and protect (not establish) their pre-existing rights.


In nearly two decades since its introduction, only a handful of native title claims have been resolved, with many of these being in remote areas which had been of little interest to European colonists. For the majority of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly those in urban areas and regional centres, native title has offered little and delivered less.


Meanwhile the promised complementary measures have also been a grave disappointment – the land fund has only been able to help out a limited number of communities, and the social justice package never eventuated.


It is clear that in the application and judicial interpretation of the NTA a huge gap has emerged between these original promises and intentions, and the on-the-ground experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities seeking to have their native title rights recognised and protected.


Justice Kirby characterised the barriers to the recognition of native title rights as comparable to an impenetrable jungle, saying:


""It would be easy for the judicial explorer to become confused and lost in the undergrowth to which rays of light rarely penetrate. Discovering the path through this jungle requires navigational skills of a high order. Necessarily, they are costly to procure and time consuming to deploy. The legal advance that commenced with Mabo v Queensland, or perhaps earlier, has now attracted such difficulties that the benefits intended for Australia's Indigenous peoples in relation to native title land and waters are being channelled into costs of administration and litigation that leave everyone dissatisfied and many disappointed."" 2


There are many who still believe that the recognition of rights to land, culture and resources through native title could provide a strong and sustainable basis for 'advancement' by underwriting and enabling community and economic development.


The former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, for instance, spoke of the capacity for respect for native title to provide a sturdy foundation for durable economic and social outcomes in his Apology speech.3


It is a tragic shame that neither his government nor its successor have done anything to seek to strengthen and facilitate recognition of the native title rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to help make that vision a reality. Instead the only changes to native title laws we have seen in these two terms of Labor Government have been those that either diminished native title rights or at the very least have failed to enhance the capacity of traditional owners to participate in securing meaningful outcomes.


This of course comes on the back of over a decade of Coalition Government under John Howard that systematically wound back the rights of Indigenous Australians, diminished native title rights, and saw the scrapping of all the existing avenues for representation and decision making with the removal of ATSIC.


The challenge for this government in moving forward to make the vision of the apology a reality is to put aside the paternalism of the Howard/Brough years and to actively engage Aboriginal communities in policy development, decision making and community development instead. This also means recognising, as the Cape York Land Council put it, that ""[m]eaningful respect for native title as a valuable property right is part of the solution … not an impediment""4.




The impetus for reform



The impetus for this bill arose from the interactions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and native title experts that took place in and around the 2009 inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the Native Title Amendment Bill 2009. A Bill which in and of itself had little to do with reforming native title to deliver better outcomes.


The discussions that took place around that Senate inquiry crystallised many of my long-standing concerns with the NTA which lead to a continuing dialogue on broader native title reform that has ultimately led to these reforms.


At the time of the introduction of the first 2009 bill, the Attorney General Robert McClelland stated that the intent of the Australian Government in introducing the bill was ""… achieving more negotiated native title outcomes in a more timely, effective and efficient fashion""5.


The vast majority of the evidence tended to that Senate inquiry supported the need for native title reform that would achieve more effective native title outcomes in a more timely and resource efficient manner but disagreed with the Attorney General's suggestion that the Government's reforms came anywhere near achieving those outcomes.


As Tony McAvoy of the National Native Title Council put it at the time:


""…the amendments that are proposed in this amendment bill are not controversial. They may make some small difference but they are not going to make any vast change in the way in which native title matters are dealt with. There is not going to be any rush of settlement of native title applications as a result of any of these amendments.""6


The submissions to that inquiry identified a number of other possible reforms to the NTA that promised to address the barriers to timely and meaningful native title outcomes and went beyond the narrow agenda of the government's first 2009 bill. These included addressing the 'burden of proof' through a rebuttable presumption of continuity7, strengthening the requirements for parties to 'negotiate in good faith', and raising the threshold on extinguishment, among others.


Many of the issues raised in this inquiry were further discussed and developed in the Native Title Report 2009 of the Australian Human Rights Commission by the then Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma. This report made an important series of recommendations for native title reform, many of which have provided the basis for the reforms proposed within this bill.


I note that this bill does not cover all of the reforms recommended by Tom Calma, and includes a number of measures that he did not discuss at the time. While many of the good ideas can be attributed to Mr Calma and to others, I take full responsibility for the way they have been interpreted as legislative amendments. I commend the work of the former Commissioner and thank him sincerely for his efforts.


I would also like to thank the native title experts, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, land councils and representative bodies that have contributed their thoughts, ideas and comments to us in response to our inquiries and as part of the consultation process we undertook around the discussion paper and draft amendments proposing these reforms.




The right to negotiate also applies offshore



This item seeks to improve procedural rights over offshore areas for native title holders. In doing so it seeks to address the contradiction between the existing provisions of subsection 26(3) of the NTA (that limits the right to negotiate to acts that relate to a place on the landward side of the mean high-water mark) and the fact that native title rights have been recognised to exist in offshore areas.8


This amendment is consistent with the views expressed by the then Attorney General Robert McClelland, who stated in 2009 that:


""When it comes to behavioural change, I accept that the Australian Government has to lead by example. I believe we are doing just that. For example, last year I announced that the Government will take a more flexible approach to recognising native title in Australia's territorial waters. The Australian Government now accepts that native title can exist out to the limits of the modern territorial sea, generally 12 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline. Given that the Government is involved in all claims over offshore waters, this approach should help bring about more negotiated settlements.""9


The limitation of procedural rights under subsection 26(3) that denies traditional owners a right to negotiate over future acts in offshore areas is clearly inconsistent with this recognition that native title can exist up to 12 nautical miles out to sea, and so item 2 of the bill remedies this by repealing subsection 26(3) to remove this unnecessary contradiction and allow traditional owners the right to negotiate over acts that impact on their sea country.




Strengthening good faith negotiations



The future acts regime plays a crucial role in the manner in which traditional owners are able to exercise their native title rights, by governing the requirements placed on parties negotiating agreements concerning proposed activities. There has been sustained criticism of the manner in which the future acts regime has led to protracted and uncertain outcomes, and calls for the act to be amended to create stronger incentives for beneficial agreements and to achieve greater procedural fairness by striking a better balance between native title and non-native title interests.


To this end the amendments proposed in items 3 to 12 of this bill expand on the current requirements for parties to negotiate 'in good faith' in relation to future acts.


Currently the burden of proof for proving the absence of good faith in negotiations is on the native title party, rather than the proponent of a proposed future act. This appears procedurally unfair as it is in effect the proponent who is effectively asserting that they have negotiated in good faith for the required period when they apply for a matter to be taken to arbitration.


Item 3 of this bill seeks to strengthen the requirement to negotiate in good faith, in line with the recommendations of the Native Title Report 200910.


The NTA as it stands prevents parties from resorting to an arbitral body, such as the National Native Title Tribunal, for a period of six months from the issue of a notice that the government intends to grant a mining tenement. This fixed negotiating period does not take into account the relative scope or difficulty of the proposed negotiations – it is the same irrespective of whether the parties have established previous agreements or are meeting for the first time, and irrespective of whether they are negotiating a single act or attempting to conclude an overarching agreement on a 'whole of claim' basis.


So on the one hand, parties who are undertaking complex negotiations in a genuine attempt to make efficient use of their time and resources to secure wide-scale agreements over large areas of land and multiple future acts need to do so within the six month limit (irrespective of the number of negotiations and the lack of resources of the native title representative body). On the other hand, proponents who are not inclined to enter into serious negotiations with native title holders can effectively stonewall and sit on their hands for six months, knowing they can then force the matter to arbitration without any requirement to demonstrate they have made all reasonable efforts to come to agreements.


To this end item 3 of this bill substitutes a new paragraph 31(1)(b) which requires parties to negotiate in good faith for at least six months and to use all reasonable efforts to come to an agreement about the conditions under which each of the native title parties might agree to the proposed future act. As made clear in the evidence to the Inquiry, this provision does not limit the ability of parties to reach agreement within 6 months but it does require negotiation for at least 6 months before either party can apply to the Tribunal.


Item 4 inserts new subsections 31(1A)–(1C), providing clarification of what the requirement to negotiate in good faith really means.


The good faith negotiating requirements are one of the few legal safeguards that native title parties have to protect their native title interests under the NTA. While section 31 of the NTA seeks to oblige the parties to negotiate in good faith during the negotiating period, in practice it is virtually impossible for claimants to establish that a proponent is not acting in good faith. This is borne out by the decision of the Full Federal Court in the matter of FMG Pilbara v Cox11 - a decision which substantially watered down the right to negotiate, to the extent that any negotiation in which the native title party cannot demonstrably prove bad faith is effectively considered to be a good faith negotiation.


Item 4 strengthens the requirement to negotiate in good faith by including explicit criteria for the type of negotiation activities that are indicative of good faith and clarifies that deceptive or unsatisfactory conduct is not a perquisite to demonstrate a failure to negotiate in good faith. Furthermore, it places a requirement on the arbitral body to consider the financial resources, and in the case of the native title party, the demands of cultural and religious practices, when considering whether a party has negotiated in good faith.


Item 7 reverses the onus of proof so that the party that is asserting good faith is the one that is required to prove it, by inserting a new subsection 31(2A).


Item 10 provides that a party may not apply to an arbitral body (under subsection 35(1)) until the party has first demonstrated good faith negotiations have taken place in accordance with section 31.




Strengthening coexistence by disallowing extinguishment



Another area where the NTA has failed to deliver is the manner in which the bar on extinguishment has been set too low. This has meant that in practice the principle of 'coexistence' of native title rights, which is clearly envisaged within the NTA, is too often brushed aside or ignored.


Item 13 of the proposed amendments seek to address this issue. Item 13 inserts new sections 47C and 47D. The new section 47C provides that in the case of National, State or Territory Parks, extinguishment is to be disregarded. Given the nature of national parks, it is appropriate for the non-extinguishment principle to apply and to allow for the co-existence of native title rights and interests. Chief Justice French has used the example of the vesting of a nature reserve on Crown land as one act which could be determined to have extinguished native title, where it would make sense to be able to disregard extinguishment and provide for an agreement between the traditional owners and the state to recognise native title rights in the interests of managing that reserve.12


New section 47D provides that at any time prior to a determination, the applicant and a government party can make an agreement that the extinguishment (or possible extinguishment) of native title rights and interests can be disregarded.


The current breadth and permanence of the extinguishment of native title through the provisions of the NTA is arguably unjustifiable, unnecessary and in breach of Australia's human rights obligations.13


Section 47 of the NTA provides a model for coexistence of native title and other rights on pastoral leases. The new sections in item 13 are consistent with the current application of the NTA, and allow the existing coexistence provisions to be extended to nature reserves and allow extinguishment to be disregarded by agreement in a wider range of circumstances.




Presumption of continuity



In practice, the bar for the recognition of native title rights has been set too high – with the onus of proof of cultural continuity being placed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and with evidence standards effectively mandating a reliance on the written accounts of European colonists that deny the predominantly oral nature of Indigenous cultures.


As the Australian Human Rights Commission argued in its submission to the 2009 Senate Inquiry:


""It cannot be disputed that Indigenous peoples lived in Australia prior to colonisation and that the Crown was responsible for the dispossession of Indigenous peoples throughout Australia.


It has also been acknowledged by governments over time through various policies, laws and statements of recognition, including the creation of land rights regimes and other mechanisms, that Indigenous peoples are the Traditional Owners of the land.


It is in this context that the Commission argues that it is unjust and inequitable to continue to place the demanding burden of proving all the elements required under the Native Title Act on the claimants.""


The issue of prior occupation and hence the pre-existence of native title rights is not being questioned (as the preamble to the NTA readily acknowledges) and so under these circumstances it seems to be 'fundamentally discriminatory'14 and a gross injustice to place the burden of proof upon the dispossessed. This is particularly true when we consider that it is State and Commonwealth Governments that have granted the rights that have lead to the possible extinguishment of native title, and that it is those governments who hold many of the historic records needed to establish connection.


The intent of providing for a rebuttable presumption of continuity is to shift the burden of proof in a way that encourages government parties (who must now take on the role of adducing evidence in their archives to rebut presumptions) to be more inclined to settle claims with a strong prospect of success – rather than dragging them out in the Federal Court as they are currently entitled to do.


Item 14 of our proposed amendments to the NTA seeks to address this issue, by putting into legislation amendments suggested by Chief Justice French15 that reverse the burden of proof to create a rebuttable presumption of continuity.


Moving to resolve more native title cases by consent determination could result in timelines being 'streamlined beyond recognition' and costs being 'reduced out of sight'16. However, as the Native Title Report 2009 points out17, a respondent would still be able to defeat a native title claim due to the operation of section 223, by providing appropriate evidence.


We have adopted a suggestion from the Law Council of Australia to insert new section 61AB clarifying that a court may determine that section 223 has been met notwithstanding substantial interruption of or significant change to traditional laws and customs if the interruption or change resulted from the action of a State or a Territory or a person or a party who is not an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.




Definition of 
'
traditional
'



As described in the second reading speech to my original Bill, in practice, the manner in which 'traditional' culture is defined by section 223 of the Act fails to recognise the dynamic and living nature of Indigenous Australian cultures. Instead it seeks to freeze culture in some pre-colonial past, which defines traditional culture based on a snap-shot of cultural practices at the time of European settlement and an expectation that they should continue unchanged. This ignores the fact that by their very nature the cultures of Australia's first nations were geared towards adapting to and surviving in an often harsh environment, not to mention the substantial efforts and resources expended by successive governments aimed at forcing or encouraging changes in behaviour.


This limited and unrealistic definition of 'traditional' means that in practice it is far too easy for a respondent to rebut the presumption of continuity by establishing a law or a custom is no longer practiced in exactly the same way it was at the point of colonisation. A more sensible and realistic definition of traditional culture would be one that ""encompasses laws, customs and practices that remain identifiable through time""18 and allows at law for an appropriate level of adaptation to the changing circumstances brought about by colonisation.


The narrow application of section 223 has created insurmountable barriers to cultural resurgence as clearly seen by the Noongar, Larrakia, Wongatha and Yorta Yorta cases. In practice, the policy decision to narrowly interpret continuity and traditional practice under section 223 in the Yorta Yorta19 case has created a situation which directly contradicts the original objects of the NTA – in that it means that there is no opportunity to raise the role of past injustices in the interruption of cultural continuity in an Act whose every intent is to provide remedy to those injustices.


Where a group has revitalised its culture, laws and customs by actively seeking out and recovering those elements of cultural continuity driven underground by dispossession, forced relocation, or the removal of children, a comparatively minimal interruption to the sharing of that culture across the claimant group should not be sufficient to prevent the recognition of native title rights.


This state of affairs is clearly at odds both with the stated intentions of the NTA and Australia's international human rights commitments. On this basis it would be sensible to empower the Court to disregard any interruption in the observance of traditional laws and customs where it is in the interests of justice to do so.


Item 18 of our proposed amendments inserts new subsections 223(1A), (1B), (1C) and (1D) which provide clarification of the definition of 'traditional' to ensure that the interpretation of what counts as ongoing Indigenous culture and law is based on a more realistic understanding of the maintenance and continuity of traditional practices and cultural values over time. This should help ensure that communities who have maintained a strong connection to their lands, laws, cultural practices and values will not have their recognition discounted based on changes which do not fundamentally alter the core of their cultural identity as traditional custodians of their land and sea country.




Commercial rights and interests



As mentioned in the second reading speech to my original Bill, in practice, the rights native title have delivered have also not been strong or complete enough to effectively provide 'for the advancement' of traditional owners or to provide a basis for economic and cultural development as they have not provided an unambiguous and exploitable right to land and resources.


Currently there is no mechanism to provide for the recognition of commercial rights to enable agreement making that delivers on the stated intent of the NTA ""for securing the adequate advancement … of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders"" by providing a vehicle for social and economic development. Furthermore, courts have appeared to take a view of customary Indigenous laws that does not properly recognise existing cultural economies and effectively distinguishes between customary or cultural rights and commercial ones.


This is at odds with a wealth of existing evidence of customary trade rights and practices which were based in customary rights to resources – including aquaculture, trade in clay and ochres and turtle shells, as well as crafts such as baskets and spears. It also includes strong evidence of a long-term trade relationship with Macassan fishermen from Indonesia.


The current Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, has stated that the Government considers that Indigenous communities should be able to use their native title rights to leverage economic development.20 However, as yet, this government has not sought to amend the NTA to strengthen the rights of native title holders in this or any other matter, and have largely confined themselves to amendments to the act that reduce the rights of native title holders.


The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, recently spoke of his ""determination to ensure that the Aboriginal people of Australia finally get a fair go where their land is concerned"" and went on to say that ""the land which Aboriginal people have secured is obviously a cultural and spiritual asset but it should also be an economic asset."" On the face of it, it would seem in principle that there is cross-party support for these measures.


To this end, item 19 the bill provides that native title rights and interests can be of a commercial nature, removing what is an unnecessary impediment to Indigenous economic development.




Conclusion 



As with our previous bill, the reforms contained in this legislation put forward clear and specific measures to address a number of key areas of interest to native title claimants.


They address the barriers claimants face in making the case to demonstrate their pre-existing native title rights and interests and they tackle some of the procedural issues within the future acts regime that restrict the ability of native title holders to assert and exercise their native title rights.


As we stated before, native title has the potential to play an important role as a basis for the economic and community development of those of Australia's first peoples who have been able to maintain their connection to their traditional lands and culture in the face of dispossession.


It is clear that the original intention of the Parliament was that the Native Title Act would 'rectify the consequences of past injustices' and secure their 'adequate advancement and protection', however, it is equally clear that in its application this complex area of law has failed to deliver on those hopes.


The strong relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their land and sea country should provide a firm basis on which to strengthen their culture and build their future. To make this happen, native title reform is needed.


The Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill (No. 1) 2012 is an important first step on that path – I commend it to the Senate.

 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:38):  I, and also on behalf of Senators Boyce and Cash, move: 


That the Senate—  


   (a) notes that 8 March is International Women's Day (IWD) and that the theme for IWD 2012 is 'Empower Rural Women – End Hunger and Poverty';  


   (b) acknowledges the work that UN Women, the United Nations (UN) organisation dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women, undertakes to improve the conditions of women, both domestically and internationally;  


   (c) notes the statement made by Kofi Annan, former UN Secretary-General on International Women's Day 2005 that 'study after study has taught us that there is no tool for development more effective than the empowerment of women. No other policy is as likely to raise economic productivity, or to reduce infant and maternal mortality.

No other policy is as powerful in increasing the chances of education for the next generation';  


   (d) acknowledges:   


      (i) that despite the many rights and privileges Australian women enjoy, there remain challenges that we must strive to overcome, and   


      (ii) that rural women with disabilities are particularly at risk;  


   (e) notes, with concern, that in Australia, violence against women is still far too common, with Australian Bureau of Statistics data continuing to show that 1 in 3 women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15; and

The PRESIDENT,,2012-02-29,"



The PRESIDENT
 (17:01):  During the adjournment debate on Monday 27 February, Senator Brown raised a point of order in relation to remarks made by Senator Macdonald. I undertook to review the Hansard and consider the matter. Having done so, I consider that there was no point of order because there is no prohibition in the standing orders on referring to matters that are before committees.


However, in the general—and I hope that people listen and understand that I am speaking in the general—I remind all senators that I have made several statements relating to a particular matter before the Privileges Committee and that I have warned senators against continuing to canvass those or related matters whilst they are before the Privileges Committee.


All senators have a right to feel that any matter before the Privileges Committee that may concern them is dealt with in accordance with its well respected practices without any attempts to argue the case in the chamber. There is an issue of fundamental fairness at stake. I remind senators that privilege resolution 9, which enjoins senators to exercise the great privilege of freedom of speech responsibly, refers specifically to the damage that can be done by allegations made in parliament and to the need for senators to have regard to the rights of others.


Whilst it is not my intention to constrain the rights of individual senators to debate, within the Standing Orders, matters of their choice in the chamber, it is clearly my intention to honour the spirit of privilege resolution 9. Therefore, as a matter of fundamental fairness, it is becoming intolerable to have contributions in the chamber refer to this matter whilst it is under consideration.


There will be time, when the committee reports, for the Senate to consider the committee's findings and recommendations and for there to be a robust debate. I therefore seek the cooperation of all senators to desist from engaging in any further comments and remarks on this matter until the Privileges Committee reports.

Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:05):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Mr President, your ruling is correct, and your quote on the matter is quite correct. But the Senate needs to reflect that, as far back as 1984, the Privileges Committee noted the possibility that the reputation of senators might be damaged if matters such as this were to continue to be raised. Damage to the reputation of senators was clearly—one has only to look at the Hansard—an outcome of Senator Macdonald's contribution the other night. You are quite right, Mr President, to have called it to order and to have made a breakthrough ruling that it should not happen again.


The Privileges Committee's deliberations at the moment are unprecedented in that there has been no result despite the matter's having been referred to it some three or four months ago. That in itself, in my view, is a travesty, and I am sure that Senator Milne shares that view. Never should this chamber lend itself through its debate system to the sorts of repeated accusations that were earlier referred to the committee.


Your ruling is correct, Mr President, and I hope that it will be implemented in the future so that the behaviour which Senator Macdonald engaged in on Monday night cannot ever be repeated in this Senate.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:07):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a brief statement on this matter.




The PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator ABETZ:
  I thank the Senate. Mr President, the coalition accepts your ruling and understands the manner in which you have approached this. I might say it is fair and reasonable. I simply remind people listening in that those that complain about canvassing these issues should remind themselves that they issued media releases about this issue: for example, commenting that certain issues 'highlights the opposition's highly compromised position as accusers' or, on another occasion, 'We have absolutely nothing to fear from this fairly sleazy move'—statements in the media by the Australian Greens. When they want to attack the accusers, they do so publicly. Yet again it seems as though there is one law for the Greens and another law for everybody else.


I also briefly remind honourable senators of the occasion when I was referred to the Privileges Committee on a certain matter. Might I say they kindly, and unanimously, found that I had acted in good faith at all times and the matter was dismissed. But, whilst that matter was before the Privileges Committee, I am sure all honourable senators will recall that other senators took it upon themselves to do media, constantly referring to the fact that I was before the Privileges Committee—



Government senators interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  There are interjections from those opposite. Mr President, in this game every now and then these things occur, but what is astounding in this matter is—including the point of order that was raised previously by Senator Bob Brown—and I simply say to the Australian Greens, that those that live in glass houses should not throw stones. Were the Greens stopped from talking about me when I was before the Privileges Committee? No. But should others be stopped when they are before the Privileges Committee? Yes, and that is the double standard.

The PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator MILNE:
  It had not been my intention to comment further, but the disingenuous remarks of Senator Abetz require a response. Firstly, the Australian Greens did not discuss any matter concerning Senator Abetz and its referral to the Privileges Committee at that time. Let me put that on the record. Secondly, Senator Abetz referred to media releases. What he did not say was that the media releases were in response to media releases and media coverage generated by Senator Abetz. Both in this chamber and outside on 6 July Senator Abetz put out lengthy press releases and chronologies which canvassed the matters which some months later became the subject of a reference to the Privileges Committee. Any media generated subsequently was in response to his attempt to beat up a story to besmirch the reputations of Senator Brown and me. I think it is important for anyone who is interested to realise that Senator Abetz on 6 July 2011 started the process in the media, and it was reported in Tasmania on the Tasmanian Times.

Lest anyone listening might be in any doubt, Mr President, having heard Senator Bob Brown say that you upheld his point of order, you rejected the point of order comprehensively. You did not, as Senator Brown attempted to suggest, uphold his point of order. You never did that and I appreciate your ruling. I thank you for it and I will abide by your urgings.

The speeches read as follows—



ANTARCTIC TREATY (ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2011


Antarctica has a unique place in Australia’s national identity.  We are tied to Antarctica through our history, our geology and our climate.


This year marks the 100th anniversary of the departure of the first Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by Sir Douglas Mawson.  Mawson stands alongside other giants of Antarctic discovery, like Scott and Shackleton, for his remarkable endeavours to explore Antarctica and claim a sizeable portion of the continent on behalf of all Australians.


It was Mawson who established Australia’s first scientific research base at Cape Denison in Antarctica. Over the past century, Australia has built on that legacy, establishing a strong reputation for Antarctic science in areas such as climate change, conservation, astronomy and geoscience.


Antarctica’s unique environment offers major opportunities for this scientific research.  The continent is recognised as a key indicator of global climate change.  Better understanding of Antarctic ecosystems, weather and climate is crucial to environmental protection in the region as well as understanding global climate trends.


Australia has also become a world leader in Antarctic protection. We were one of the 12 original signatories to the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, which enshrines the principle of peaceful use of the Antarctic.  Fifty years on, the Antarctic Treaty remains a model for global cooperation. 


Australia actively engages in the international governance of the Antarctic. We played a key role in the development of the broader system of international arrangements for the region, known as the Antarctic Treaty system. 


Just two decades ago, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke worked with former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard to prevent mining in Antarctica. For the first time, we recognised that the last pristine continent on earth should remain untouched. The opportunity was nearly missed, but the decision changed the world’s way of thinking just in time.


Their efforts led to the Madrid Protocol, which now protects the Antarctic environment, bans mining in Antarctica and designates Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science.


In October this year, I was honoured to join Bob Hawke and Michel Rocard in Hobart to commemorate the 20th anniversary of that Madrid Protocol.


We will continue to build on protections for this unique and special part of the world.


This Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Bill 2011 will amend the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980, which gives effect to our obligations under the Madrid Protocol and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals.


The Bill will align the Act with Australia’s new obligations in relation to three measures adopted under the Antarctic Treaty and Madrid Protocol, namely:


1. Measure 4 relating to insurance and contingency planning for tourism and non- governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area that was adopted in June 2004;


2. Measure 1 relating to liability arising from environmental emergencies that was adopted in June 2005; and 


3. Measure 15 relating to the landing of people from passenger vessels in the Antarctic Treaty area that was adopted in April 2009.


These Measures will establish more stringent arrangements to protect human and vessel safety in the Antarctic, and the Antarctic environment.


Key amendments included in the Bill include:


1. providing the ability for the Minister to grant a safety approval, an environmental protection approval, and to impose conditions on such approvals;


2. implementing new offences and civil penalties regarding unapproved activities, activities carried on in contravention of the conditions imposed by an approval, and offences and civil penalties related to environmental emergencies;


3. establishing a liability regime for environmental emergencies that occur in the Antarctic;


4. establishing an Antarctic Environmental Liability Special Account to receive payments from operators for the costs of response action to an environmental emergency caused by their activities in the Antarctic;


5. implementing new offences and civil penalties applicable to tourist vessels operating in the Antarctic; 


6. making minor and technical amendments to the Act; and


7. amending the long title of the Act to extend the scope of the legislation;


As Australia prepares to host the 35th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Hobart in June 2012, this Bill marks another chapter in Australia’s history of involvement in Antarctica and maintains our commitments under the Antarctic Treaty and Madrid Protocol.


CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (ANTI-DUMPING IMPROVEMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2011


I am pleased to present the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2011, representing the second tranche of legislation implementing the Government's reforms to Australia's anti-dumping system. 


The package of reforms announced by the Government in June are designed to provide better access to remedies for Australian industry, and to ensure those remedies are available as quickly as possible. They aim to improve the robustness and transparency of anti-dumping decisions and introduce stronger compliance mechanisms. 


The elements of the reforms that I am introducing into the House today are focussed on improving the robustness and transparency of anti-dumping decisions. 


In particular, I am proposing a new appeals process to replace the existing mechanism, and provide more flexibility in seeking extensions of time during the course of investigations. 


This Bill also provides a legislative basis for the International Trade Remedies Forum, which met for the first time in August this year. 


These amendments were drafted in close consultation with the Office of International Law within the Attorney General's Department, and the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade, to make sure that they are consistent with Australia's international law obligations.




New Appeals Process



The Bill implements a number of changes to the process for appealing decisions of the Minister or the Chief Executive Officer of Customs and Border Protection. 


Presently decisions may be appealed to the Trade Measures Review Officer, who was an employee of the Attorney-General's Department. The Review Officer will be replaced by a 3-member review panel able to take on a greater case work load. Members of the Panel will be appointed by the Minister based on their relevant expertise. Panel members will no longer be an employee of the Attorney General's Department, so will be independent of government. 


The Government will make available resources in the form of administrative and research assistance, to support the effective functioning of the Panel. 


Presently the Review Officer must accept an application for review, unless the applicant has failed to provide sufficient particulars of the findings to which the review application relates. This has resulted in approximately 80 per cent of Ministerial decisions being appealed to the Trade Measures Review Officer by one of the parties to the proceeding. The Government is proposing a higher threshold for appeal. Now, in order to initiate an appeal, the Panel will need to be satisfied that the applicant has established that the Minister did not make the correct and preferable decision. 


Presently there is a perception that International Trade Remedies Branch is conflicted in reinvestigating its own decisions. When the Review Officer reviewed a decision, the officer would recommend a reinvestigation to the Minister who referred it back to the Branch which reinvestigated and made recommendations to the Minister as to whether to overturn or amend the original decision. 


To address this, the Panel will now make recommendations directly to the Minister as to whether the original decisions should be affirmed, revoked or substituted. Where reinvestigation of a particular finding is required, the Panel will direct the Branch to reinvestigate that finding, and to report back to the Panel to inform their recommendation to the Minister. 


Parties will now be able to appeal the Minister's decision to continue or not continue measures, and also the Minister's decisions to vary or revoke measures (or not) on review. 


As part of the appeals process reforms, the Customs Act will be amended to allow for important stakeholder groups, such as downstream industry and trade unions to participate in administrative reviews. 


The changes to the appeals system allow for a more robust system which is better able to identify and process meritorious applications for review.




Extension of Time—
Investigations



Second, these reforms will allow for more flexible extensions to the timeframes of an investigation, review of measures, continuation inquiry or duty assessment. 


Australia's anti-dumping system contains one of the shortest investigation timeframes in the world, at 155 days. At present only one extension to that timeframe can be sought, and it must be prior to the publication of the Statement of Essential Facts at day 110. This can mean that extensions, where required, tend to be for significant periods, to anticipate any possible further need for an extension. 


Consistent with a recommendation of the Productivity Commission, the Bill will allow for more flexible extensions of investigation timeframes. 


The Minister will still have to approve all extensions of time. Implementation of this proposal will be carefully monitored to ensure it does not result in a blow out of investigation periods, and that extensions are only sought in complex cases, not routinely. 


The International Trade Remedies Branch will continue to provide in its annual report a consolidated summary of the timeliness of its investigations in the preceding 12 months. 


This proposed change will improve decision making by allowing extensions to accommodate complex cases and to allow for the consideration of critical new information that could not reasonably have been provided earlier. 




International Trade Remedies Forum



There is currently no stakeholder body to provide feedback to Government on the operation of the anti-dumping system. 


The Government has established the International Trade Remedies Forum to provide strategic advice and feedback on the implementation of the reforms, the ongoing operations of the anti-dumping system as well as reporting to Government on opportunities for further improvements.


The Forum, which met for the first time in August, comprises representatives of manufacturers, producers, and importers, as well as industry associations, trade unions and relevant Government agencies. 


The Government is establishing the Forum in legislation to ensure that this valuable dialogue with industry continues into the future. 


The Forum will meet a minimum of two times a year.




Concluding remarks



This second tranche of reforms directly respond to stakeholder concerns about enhancing the appeals process, providing adequate time for investigations and ensuring stakeholder consultation going forward. 


These amendments will further strengthen the anti-dumping system by enhancing the appeals process to allow for a more streamlined process better able to process meritorious applications, provide greater independence and afford new opportunities for parties to seek review for decisions they disagree with. 


The International Trade Remedies Forum will provide a greater opportunity for Australian industries and other stakeholders to play a role in the development and operation of Australia's anti-dumping system. 


The changes to extension of time for reviews will allow Customs and Border Protection more flexibility in dealing with complex matters and scope for consideration of new information.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-02-29,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:20):  I move:


That the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2012, as passed by the House of Representatives on 16 February 2012, be referred to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 May 2012.


It has been said:


Anybody who breaches the law should feel the full force of the law. Each and every breach of the law is wrong and each and every breach of the law should be acted upon.


So spoke the then Minister for Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard, in introducing legislation into this place to get rid of the Australian Building and Construction Commission.


As a result of this legislation being put forward, the Senate had an inquiry into the bill. After the Senate had finished its inquiry and was busily writing its report, the Labor government in the House of Representatives, at one minute to midnight, introduced a Greens-inspired amendment to absolutely gut that which would have remained of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. And the issue that needs to be reviewed by the Senate committee is not only a workplace relations issue. This goes to the very issue and fundamentals of the rule of law in our country. Indeed, that which Ms Gillard promised—like she promised with the carbon tax—has now been shown to be an empty promise. But this is even more serious than the carbon tax, because it undermines the very fundamentals of the rule of law. Allow me to explain. The amendment that the Greens inspired and the Labor Party passed in the other place means that a prosecuting authority can no longer pursue the prosecution if the parties have come to a settlement between themselves. Just imagine if the police were no longer allowed to charge somebody who drove through a red light, settled up with a person whose car they damaged—and paid them a bit of extra money—and as a result the police were denied prosecution of the case. Or imagine an arson case in which somebody does not want to go to jail, does not want to be prosecuted and goes to the person whose property he has burnt down and says, 'I'll pay for all the damages plus $100,000,' and the police are then denied prosecution of that person for arson.


That is what the Labor Party and the Greens want to introduce into the industrial law of this country. What it means is that big unions and big business—with big wallets—will be able to buy themselves out of prosecution but the individual worker will not be able to, because they will not have the money. The small subcontractor on our building sites will not have the money to do that. There will be institutionalised corruption and institutionalised pay-offs. What is more, this has been such a deceptive move. Indeed, when we as the coalition senators wanted the hearing to go on for a bit longer than we had been allowed we were told, 'All this has been canvassed for ages.' If it had been canvassed for so long—for ages—then why this last-minute amendment?


Let us be quite clear. The government must have known it was going to move this amendment but deliberately hid it from the Senate and the public to ensure that this amendment, which is just so fundamental in undermining the rule of law in our country, was hidden from the inquiry so it could no longer be investigated. Or it was a genuine last-minute amendment. And if it was a genuine last-minute amendment then, given that it is of such consequence that three state Attorneys-General have come out to condemn it as undermining the whole basis on which the rule of law runs in this country, this is worthy of further examination by the Senate.


The Australian Greens, I have no doubt, will be voting against this matter going to a Senate committee, as will the Labor Party. If they do so it will be proof positive that they knew about this beforehand and that it was deliberately denied to the Australian people. Either way, this matter should be going to a Senate committee for further consideration.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-02-29,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (17:25):  The government does not support this motion. In fact, the opposition knows that the Senate does not support the motion. Regardless of that, here they come again, the old relics of the Work Choices era, all lined up trying to stop one of the last bastions of fear from their terrible era in government from being abolished. They are so desperate to cling to this relic of the past, so desperate that—although a report on this bill is due to be provided to the Senate next in the schedule—they seek to send it off again to the same committee and for the same purpose, no doubt wasting the time of the industry in again making submissions and again appearing before the committee.


The government's position on the ABCC has been clear for a long period of time. Unlike the coalition with Work Choices, which was thrust upon an unsuspecting electorate, the Labor Party made a commitment to the Australian people prior to both the 2007 and the 2010 election that we would replace the ABCC with a new body, that we would provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry, that we would provide a body that is part of our fair work system. There can be no doubt that the government has a mandate to abolish the ABCC. We won the 2007 election and, much to the chagrin of those opposite, were able to negotiate confidence and supply from some of the Independents in 2010 because those Independents decided that the Labor Party was the best party to govern this country and progress reform for the betterment of hardworking Australians.


You also know full well that we have consistently stated that anyone who breaks a law should feel the full force of the law. As a responsible government we will not tolerate an environment in which people choose which laws to obey and which ones to ignore. But we expect this to apply for all industrial participants, and we expect that an industrial regulator will use its resources fairly and not just single out workers and their democratically elected representatives. They waltz in here with their attempts to stifle the work of the Senate with procedural debates and with this motion, which is to come just before the release of the report by the Senate committee.


Those opposite cannot accept that they lost the argument in 2007. The people spoke. The people said they wanted a fair industrial relations system in this country. This bill, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2012, moves well in that direction. This bill strikes a balance of fairness. It is sad for this country that those opposite are so committed to obscuring fairness in the workplace for everyday Australians—those workers who are building Australia. The construction industry is a dangerous and arduous industry to work in. It is characterised by a system of subcontracting, many small employers, widespread use of a labour hire workforce and intense competitive pressures. They can contribute to compromises on safety issues, breakdowns in the chain of responsibility and difficulties in maintaining effective employee representation on safety issues from job to job. Injury and fatality rates remain unacceptably high.


But it is a fact that there is a positive link between trade union involvement at workplaces and improved OH&S outcomes. Workers are best placed to know what issues make their workplace unsafe and workers should have the right and the power to seek changes to bad practice before accidents occur. If workers feel intimidated about raising issues of safety concern, everyone working at a site is at a higher risk of an accident.


The ABCC has its origins in the recommendations of the Cole royal commission into the building and construction industry. This was set up by those opposite in a desperate attempt to attack unions in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election campaign. The royal commission was an intensely politicised process from the outset. The focus was almost exclusively on union conduct. No serious attempt was made to balance the inquiry with an examination of employer conduct. Interestingly, despite its enormous cost to the public, of the 392 instances of so-called unlawful conduct in the final report only one was ever pursued and it was ultimately dropped without being prosecuted to finality.


The government understands that the industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees and as a result we have always supported a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all participants and a strong set of compliance arrangements for the building industry. This bill honours those commitments but, as the coalition fails to understand, it strives to strike a balance.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:30):  As the deputy chairman of the committee that investigated this issue—the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee—I wish to register in the strongest possible terms my absolute disgust at the attempt by the government and the Greens to try and pervert what I would call the course of justice in relation to this late amendment. It has been said that we wanted a range of people to appear before that committee and, of course, we were denied access to it. We went through this whole process in the best of good faith. To see now that this has appeared minutes before midnight and to see that it has been made public in a media release from a House of Representatives member, being a Greens member, is a travesty and something that this chamber should not accept.


It was then Minister Gillard, now the Prime Minister, who made these statements to the National Press Club: 


Anybody who breaches the law should feel the full force of the law.


She went on to say, and what empty words they were, as we know now as a result of her performance with the carbon tax:


… there should be absolutely vigorous, hard-edged compliance and no tolerance at all for unlawfulness. … each and every breach of the law is wrong and each and every breach of the law should be acted upon.


What this amendment does is go right to the core of those comments that Ms Gillard made. It emphasises again her absolute emptiness when it comes to any attempt with regard to justice and honesty and fairness in this process.


Yesterday I asked the minister with responsibility, Senator Arbib, if he could respond and, of course, in his final days in this place he has lost interest so therefore he was not only not across the issue but was not able to answer my question. But he made one allegation to me, and that is that my interests are with workers and small businesses and contractors. If he wants to apply that to me, I will accept that with pride, because what this committee tried to do was to absolutely protect the interests of workers, small businesses and contractors—and this amendment goes completely to the heart of those three particular groups. All Senator Arbib could do was bleat about a tough cop on the beat. If indeed the government knew that this amendment was coming on why was it not presented for the committee to debate? I am bitterly disappointed that my Senate colleague and chairman of this committee did not see fit to come into this place and to actually defend it. Why? Because I believe he would be as embarrassed as I, as the deputy chairman, am angry to have been dealt with in such a tawdry fashion.


So what are we going to have now if this is not going to be the subject of a reference back to our committee? What we are clearly going to have is pay-off money. We are going to see pay-off money at every level and it may well apply on the union side and it may well apply on the employer side. It does not matter what side it applies on. The fact of the matter is that this amendment, if passed, will remove the right of the police and other law enforcement agents to actually prosecute the case. We could think of many instances—as Senator Abetz has said, in a road accident or in a drug related situation—in which somebody is apprehended, they go to the other side, they put pressure on them and they may or may not offer them money in return for the case being dropped. Well, isn't that wonderful, given the level to which we have descended in this country where you can have a bit of a backroom deal between two parties, whether it is fair or whether it is not fair, and this Senate of the Australian parliament is actually going to endorse this! The Senate is going to improve it! The Senate is going to deny the police and other parties the right to actually investigate aberrant and illegal behaviour be it of employers, unions, contractors or whomever. And who are the losers in this? The ones that I spoke to Senator Arbib about yesterday. It will be workers on sites, it will be employees, it will be small contractors. They are the ones who will be the losers and they will look to this chamber and say, 'A pox on you for your failure to protect us.' This must go back to a reference to the committee. (Time expired)

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (17:35):  I must say that I find the opposition's hysteria on this particular issue somewhat amusing indeed, because if we did accept this motion from Senate Abetz we would find ourselves having this matter referred to a Senate inquiry not for the first time, not for the second time, not for the third time and not for the fourth time but for the fifth time. It would be the fifth time that the Senate would have looked at this particular issue. It was first looked at in 2003, then in 2005, in 2008 and in 2009 and we have done an inquiry that has just been completed and is the subject of a report before the Senate—and now Senator Abetz is asking for another inquiry into these provisions. I am all for scrutiny in this place, but this is beyond the pale. This is gilding the lily. This is an unbelievable waste of the Senate's resources, particularly in the context where in 2007 the Australian public made it very clear indeed that they had had enough of the Howard government's regime of workplace relations. They thoroughly rejected the Work Choices regime, the forcing of people to bargain as individuals, which cut rates, cut penalty entitlements and cut other entitlements, particularly for younger workers. They had had enough of the coercive powers of the building and construction industry commissioner. They said quite clearly at that election that change was required, and of course in the wake of that election the government acted on the Forward with Fairness election policies that we had taken to the 2007 election. The suite of reforms that are finally being introduced through the legislation and through the subject of this report deliver on that commitment that we made to the Australian public.


But we have also ensured that a process was undertaken in the building and construction industry to ensure that there would not be unintended consequences of the reforms. In that respect, the Hon. Murray Wilcox, QC, a former Federal Court judge, was instructed to conduct an inquiry into the transition to Fair Work Australia for the building and construction industry. He made a number of recommendations which are enshrined in the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2012, which will see established the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act. We have gone through the process three or four times. We have been through the arguments when it comes to reform in this area. We have been through the arguments in respect of the coercive powers and of differential penalties, and we have found, based on the recommendations, that we are implementing a fair and balanced system. 


There is no greater example of that than in the recommendations that were made and the provisions that are being enacted with regard to coercive powers. This legislation will still include the capacity for the director of the building inspectorate to obtain an examination notice authorising the use of powers to compulsorily obtain information or documents from a person who the director believes is relevant to an investigation. However, there will be a strong set of safeguards which will enshrine the principles of fairness and natural justice, and those powers will not be able to be used unless a number of safeguards have been satisfied, including a presidential member of the AAT being satisfied that the case has been made for their fair use.


In respect of the points made by Senator Abetz, the amendment will ensure that the building industry participants are not subject to multiple proceedings, that matters that have been the subject of litigation and are settled will not be reinvestigated and will not be the subject of further litigation. That is in accordance with accepted civil law principles. (Time expired)

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (17:40):  The government should cease and desist from trying to wave the spectre of Work Choices at the opposition because there has come a time when we will no longer be cowed by that. Senator Thistlethwaite and Senator Urquhart, you suggest that we are trying to go—




Senator Thistlethwaite:
  You're trying to go back to it!




Senator FISHER:
  Exactly! He just said it again: 'back to it'. Back to the past. This government with this amendment to the legislation is trying to take the entire country to a place that we have never been before. This government with this amendment, which was, as Senator Abetz said, snuck in—a dirty deal between the government and the Greens to buy the Greens' support for the bill in the Senate—five minutes before midnight, takes the entire country and the laws of this country to a place they have never been before, and it is a whole new low. As Senator Abetz said, this goes way beyond workplace relations. It even takes workplace relations itself to a whole new realm and of course, just as the CFMEU wants, it takes the building and construction industry to a whole new realm which did not even exist in the circumstances that led to the creation of the Cole royal commission into the building and construction industry. How so?


As to how this takes the country to a whole new place beyond workplace relations, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission retains discretion to prosecute, even in the event that the alleged victims of breach of the law might have reached agreement with the alleged perpetrator. ASIC still retains discretion to prosecute. No matter what the alleged offence, no matter what an alleged victim or an alleged offender might say about cease and desist or whatever else, the police properly retain a discretion to proceed. Nowhere in this country is there legislation that says that if there is some sort of settlement the authorities—be it ASIC, be it the police—are legislatively prevented from proceeding. But the government wants to have it in the building and construction industry. 


What then of the victim of repeated domestic violence? Look only at the history of that terrible type of crime, where victims often say, 'No action, thank you.' Is the government saying that police should not have the discretion to prosecute nonetheless in that scenario? What about in workplace relations itself, where the Fair Work Ombudsman has the discretion to prosecute, for example, an employer who underpays workers? Is Senator Cameron really saying that if the employer underpays workers the Fair Work Ombudsman should be legislatively prevented from prosecuting the employer for breaching the law? I would like to hear him say so. Is the government really doing with this legislation what it tries to say it is doing in its attempt at justification for the bill? 



The report says, 'The committee remains opposed to industry-specific legislation as a matter of broad principle. The goal should be coverage of all workers in the building and construction sector by the provisions of the Fair Work Act.' Are you going to make the provisions of the Fair Work Act in this respect apply to all workers? Do not be silly. No, no, no—the government is not only giving the CFMEU legislative encouragement to do dirty, dirty, dirty deals and legislative sanction to do dirty, dirty, dirty deals; it is encouraging it to do so in a way that was not even done before the commissioning of the Cole royal commission. This bill should be sent back to the Senate committee for inquiry. We are entitled to get the answers to questions like,'How does this keep Julia Gillard's promise about the industry?'She is disappointed that there are still pockets of the industry where people think they are above the law. Well, you are going to be legislating that the CFMEU can do a deal to take people out of the law. It allows sidestepping of the law. We are entitled to ask Mr Noonan if he thinks this is a good thing, because it would be a waste of taxpayers' money to prosecute when there is a deal. Does he say the same of an ASIC prosecution if there is a deal? Does he say the same of a police prosecution if the alleged victim and alleged perpetrator reach a deal? I hardly think so.

 (

):


If any worker is listening in then they should understand why other workers are very, very afraid of the coalition ever having anything to do with workplace relations law in this country. I did not hear Senator Abetz's contribution
,
 because I had constituents in my office, but I suppose Senator Abetz took his usual professional approach on this, which is very, very dangerous for workers. They should read between the lines of what Senator Abetz says every time he is on his feet, because Senator Abetz is one of the original work choice warriors. 





I have to say that the contributions from Senator Back and Senator Fisher were absolutely over the top. That must be how the debate goes on in the coalition party room, 
with 
people 
being 
really strident to make sure 
that 
workers do not have any rights, to make sure that 
they 
can get back to Work Choices and to make sure that 
they 
can get the ABCC to act in a way that disadvantages workers from having a fair go in the building and construction industry. 



I thought it was quite amazing that Senator Fisher said, 'There will come a time that we will not be cowed by it.' What she meant was that I was raising the spectre of Work Choices. You have got every reason to be cowed by Work Choices. You have got every reason to be cowed by that terrible legislation that was the ABCC. I have worked in the building and construction industry. I actually know the industry, and it is nothing like what you are saying and what is being promoted here. It is a tough industry. There are tough people in the industry amongst the workers, the unions and the employers. 


I draw to your attention the number of judicial criticisms of the ABCC. The ABCC was headed up by a guy called John Lloyd. John Lloyd was a professional Tory, a professional union buster, a professional who was there to make sure— 



Senator Fisher interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  You have just heard how this craziness from the other side becomes actual fact for workers on the job. When you get highly respected judges like Justice Spender saying that the ABCC were not performing in an even-hand manner then you have got to ask the question. When Justice Spender was commenting on the Steven Lovewell and Bradley O'Carroll case, he said: 


The case, as brought and as evidenced by the evidence yesterday, was misconceived, was completely without merit and should not have been brought. There is room for the view that if the commission—


that was the ABCC—


was even-handed in discharging its task of ensuring industrial harmony and lawfulness in the building or construction industry proceedings, not necessarily in this court and not necessarily confined to civil industrial law, should have been brought against a company, Underground, and its managing director and possibly another director. 


I have not got the time to go into all the details but there is case after case after case where senior judges of this country say that the ABCC have acted in a biased manner against union officials and against workers—case after case. It is an absolute disgrace. It is an absolute tragedy for democracy and a fair go in this country. What will it mean for workers if Senator Abetz, the work choice warrior, Senator Back, who does the bidding of the Western Australian mining companies, and Senator Fisher, who has made her career off the back of trying to destroy workers' rights, were in charge of industrial relations in this country? It will mean that their penalty rates will go. Their rights will go. They will be subjected to some of the worst law that will be seen not only in this country but in any comparable country overseas. No modern country has legislation like theirs. It is Tory legislation. It is conservative legislation. It is bad legislation. And we will not have a bar of it. (Time expired)

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:20):  I move:


That the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2012, as passed by the House of Representatives on 16 February 2012, be referred to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 May 2012.


It has been said:


Anybody who breaches the law should feel the full force of the law. Each and every breach of the law is wrong and each and every breach of the law should be acted upon.


So spoke the then Minister for Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard, in introducing legislation into this place to get rid of the Australian Building and Construction Commission.


As a result of this legislation being put forward, the Senate had an inquiry into the bill. After the Senate had finished its inquiry and was busily writing its report, the Labor government in the House of Representatives, at one minute to midnight, introduced a Greens-inspired amendment to absolutely gut that which would have remained of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. And the issue that needs to be reviewed by the Senate committee is not only a workplace relations issue. This goes to the very issue and fundamentals of the rule of law in our country. Indeed, that which Ms Gillard promised—like she promised with the carbon tax—has now been shown to be an empty promise. But this is even more serious than the carbon tax, because it undermines the very fundamentals of the rule of law. Allow me to explain. The amendment that the Greens inspired and the Labor Party passed in the other place means that a prosecuting authority can no longer pursue the prosecution if the parties have come to a settlement between themselves. Just imagine if the police were no longer allowed to charge somebody who drove through a red light, settled up with a person whose car they damaged—and paid them a bit of extra money—and as a result the police were denied prosecution of the case. Or imagine an arson case in which somebody does not want to go to jail, does not want to be prosecuted and goes to the person whose property he has burnt down and says, 'I'll pay for all the damages plus $100,000,' and the police are then denied prosecution of that person for arson.


That is what the Labor Party and the Greens want to introduce into the industrial law of this country. What it means is that big unions and big business—with big wallets—will be able to buy themselves out of prosecution but the individual worker will not be able to, because they will not have the money. The small subcontractor on our building sites will not have the money to do that. There will be institutionalised corruption and institutionalised pay-offs. What is more, this has been such a deceptive move. Indeed, when we as the coalition senators wanted the hearing to go on for a bit longer than we had been allowed we were told, 'All this has been canvassed for ages.' If it had been canvassed for so long—for ages—then why this last-minute amendment?


Let us be quite clear. The government must have known it was going to move this amendment but deliberately hid it from the Senate and the public to ensure that this amendment, which is just so fundamental in undermining the rule of law in our country, was hidden from the inquiry so it could no longer be investigated. Or it was a genuine last-minute amendment. And if it was a genuine last-minute amendment then, given that it is of such consequence that three state Attorneys-General have come out to condemn it as undermining the whole basis on which the rule of law runs in this country, this is worthy of further examination by the Senate.


The Australian Greens, I have no doubt, will be voting against this matter going to a Senate committee, as will the Labor Party. If they do so it will be proof positive that they knew about this beforehand and that it was deliberately denied to the Australian people. Either way, this matter should be going to a Senate committee for further consideration.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-02-29,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (17:25):  The government does not support this motion. In fact, the opposition knows that the Senate does not support the motion. Regardless of that, here they come again, the old relics of the Work Choices era, all lined up trying to stop one of the last bastions of fear from their terrible era in government from being abolished. They are so desperate to cling to this relic of the past, so desperate that—although a report on this bill is due to be provided to the Senate next in the schedule—they seek to send it off again to the same committee and for the same purpose, no doubt wasting the time of the industry in again making submissions and again appearing before the committee.


The government's position on the ABCC has been clear for a long period of time. Unlike the coalition with Work Choices, which was thrust upon an unsuspecting electorate, the Labor Party made a commitment to the Australian people prior to both the 2007 and the 2010 election that we would replace the ABCC with a new body, that we would provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry, that we would provide a body that is part of our fair work system. There can be no doubt that the government has a mandate to abolish the ABCC. We won the 2007 election and, much to the chagrin of those opposite, were able to negotiate confidence and supply from some of the Independents in 2010 because those Independents decided that the Labor Party was the best party to govern this country and progress reform for the betterment of hardworking Australians.


You also know full well that we have consistently stated that anyone who breaks a law should feel the full force of the law. As a responsible government we will not tolerate an environment in which people choose which laws to obey and which ones to ignore. But we expect this to apply for all industrial participants, and we expect that an industrial regulator will use its resources fairly and not just single out workers and their democratically elected representatives. They waltz in here with their attempts to stifle the work of the Senate with procedural debates and with this motion, which is to come just before the release of the report by the Senate committee.


Those opposite cannot accept that they lost the argument in 2007. The people spoke. The people said they wanted a fair industrial relations system in this country. This bill, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2012, moves well in that direction. This bill strikes a balance of fairness. It is sad for this country that those opposite are so committed to obscuring fairness in the workplace for everyday Australians—those workers who are building Australia. The construction industry is a dangerous and arduous industry to work in. It is characterised by a system of subcontracting, many small employers, widespread use of a labour hire workforce and intense competitive pressures. They can contribute to compromises on safety issues, breakdowns in the chain of responsibility and difficulties in maintaining effective employee representation on safety issues from job to job. Injury and fatality rates remain unacceptably high.


But it is a fact that there is a positive link between trade union involvement at workplaces and improved OH&S outcomes. Workers are best placed to know what issues make their workplace unsafe and workers should have the right and the power to seek changes to bad practice before accidents occur. If workers feel intimidated about raising issues of safety concern, everyone working at a site is at a higher risk of an accident.

 (South Australia) (17:40):  The government should cease and desist from trying to wave the spectre of Work Choices at the opposition because there has come a time when we will no longer be cowed by that. Senator Thistlethwaite and Senator Urquhart, you suggest that we are trying to go—




Senator Thistlethwaite:
  You're trying to go back to it!




Senator FISHER:
  Exactly! He just said it again: 'back to it'. Back to the past. This government with this amendment to the legislation is trying to take the entire country to a place that we have never been before. This government with this amendment, which was, as Senator Abetz said, snuck in—a dirty deal between the government and the Greens to buy the Greens' support for the bill in the Senate—five minutes before midnight, takes the entire country and the laws of this country to a place they have never been before, and it is a whole new low. As Senator Abetz said, this goes way beyond workplace relations. It even takes workplace relations itself to a whole new realm and of course, just as the CFMEU wants, it takes the building and construction industry to a whole new realm which did not even exist in the circumstances that led to the creation of the Cole royal commission into the building and construction industry. How so?


As to how this takes the country to a whole new place beyond workplace relations, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission retains discretion to prosecute, even in the event that the alleged victims of breach of the law might have reached agreement with the alleged perpetrator. ASIC still retains discretion to prosecute. No matter what the alleged offence, no matter what an alleged victim or an alleged offender might say about cease and desist or whatever else, the police properly retain a discretion to proceed. Nowhere in this country is there legislation that says that if there is some sort of settlement the authorities—be it ASIC, be it the police—are legislatively prevented from proceeding. But the government wants to have it in the building and construction industry. 


What then of the victim of repeated domestic violence? Look only at the history of that terrible type of crime, where victims often say, 'No action, thank you.' Is the government saying that police should not have the discretion to prosecute nonetheless in that scenario? What about in workplace relations itself, where the Fair Work Ombudsman has the discretion to prosecute, for example, an employer who underpays workers? Is Senator Cameron really saying that if the employer underpays workers the Fair Work Ombudsman should be legislatively prevented from prosecuting the employer for breaching the law? I would like to hear him say so. Is the government really doing with this legislation what it tries to say it is doing in its attempt at justification for the bill? 



The report says, 'The committee remains opposed to industry-specific legislation as a matter of broad principle. The goal should be coverage of all workers in the building and construction sector by the provisions of the Fair Work Act.' Are you going to make the provisions of the Fair Work Act in this respect apply to all workers? Do not be silly. No, no, no—the government is not only giving the CFMEU legislative encouragement to do dirty, dirty, dirty deals and legislative sanction to do dirty, dirty, dirty deals; it is encouraging it to do so in a way that was not even done before the commissioning of the Cole royal commission. This bill should be sent back to the Senate committee for inquiry. We are entitled to get the answers to questions like,'How does this keep Julia Gillard's promise about the industry?'She is disappointed that there are still pockets of the industry where people think they are above the law. Well, you are going to be legislating that the CFMEU can do a deal to take people out of the law. It allows sidestepping of the law. We are entitled to ask Mr Noonan if he thinks this is a good thing, because it would be a waste of taxpayers' money to prosecute when there is a deal. Does he say the same of an ASIC prosecution if there is a deal? Does he say the same of a police prosecution if the alleged victim and alleged perpetrator reach a deal? I hardly think so.

Senator CAMERON

 (
New South Wales

17:4

):


If any worker is listening in then they should understand why other workers are very, very afraid of the coalition ever having anything to do with workplace relations law in this country. I did not hear Senator Abetz's contribution
,
 because I had constituents in my office, but I suppose Senator Abetz took his usual professional approach on this, which is very, very dangerous for workers. They should read between the lines of what Senator Abetz says every time he is on his feet, because Senator Abetz is one of the original work choice warriors. 





I have to say that the contributions from Senator Back and Senator Fisher were absolutely over the top. That must be how the debate goes on in the coalition party room, 
with 
people 
being 
really strident to make sure 
that 
workers do not have any rights, to make sure that 
they 
can get back to Work Choices and to make sure that 
they 
can get the ABCC to act in a way that disadvantages workers from having a fair go in the building and construction industry. 



I thought it was quite amazing that Senator Fisher said, 'There will come a time that we will not be cowed by it.' What she meant was that I was raising the spectre of Work Choices. You have got every reason to be cowed by Work Choices. You have got every reason to be cowed by that terrible legislation that was the ABCC. I have worked in the building and construction industry. I actually know the industry, and it is nothing like what you are saying and what is being promoted here. It is a tough industry. There are tough people in the industry amongst the workers, the unions and the employers. 


I draw to your attention the number of judicial criticisms of the ABCC. The ABCC was headed up by a guy called John Lloyd. John Lloyd was a professional Tory, a professional union buster, a professional who was there to make sure— 



Senator Fisher interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  You have just heard how this craziness from the other side becomes actual fact for workers on the job. When you get highly respected judges like Justice Spender saying that the ABCC were not performing in an even-hand manner then you have got to ask the question. When Justice Spender was commenting on the Steven Lovewell and Bradley O'Carroll case, he said: 


The case, as brought and as evidenced by the evidence yesterday, was misconceived, was completely without merit and should not have been brought. There is room for the view that if the commission—


that was the ABCC—


was even-handed in discharging its task of ensuring industrial harmony and lawfulness in the building or construction industry proceedings, not necessarily in this court and not necessarily confined to civil industrial law, should have been brought against a company, Underground, and its managing director and possibly another director. 


I have not got the time to go into all the details but there is case after case after case where senior judges of this country say that the ABCC have acted in a biased manner against union officials and against workers—case after case. It is an absolute disgrace. It is an absolute tragedy for democracy and a fair go in this country. What will it mean for workers if Senator Abetz, the work choice warrior, Senator Back, who does the bidding of the Western Australian mining companies, and Senator Fisher, who has made her career off the back of trying to destroy workers' rights, were in charge of industrial relations in this country? It will mean that their penalty rates will go. Their rights will go. They will be subjected to some of the worst law that will be seen not only in this country but in any comparable country overseas. No modern country has legislation like theirs. It is Tory legislation. It is conservative legislation. It is bad legislation. And we will not have a bar of it. (Time expired)



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Abetz be agreed to.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (17:59):  Minister, you will be aware that the legislation is designed such that moneys are drawn down proportionately as courses are progressing. That is what the legislation allows for. One of the concerns I brought forward in the committee was that in some cases—for example in aviation training—the capital costs can be quite significant. One of the concerns expressed to the committee was that there may not have been sufficient time for some providers to restructure their debt arrangements prior to the commencement of this scheme. I was wondering if the govern­ment has paid heed to that, Minister.

You say, Minister, it has been addressed, but I cannot answer that. Let me tell you, Sir, that there is still great concern within the sector about this. I thought you should know that.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:04):  by leave—I move the Australian Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7193.


 (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 12 (line 19), omit ""Note"", substitute ""Note 1"".


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 12 (after line 19), at the end of subsection 47A(1), add:


   Note 2: For an exception to subparagraph (1)(c)(iii), see subsection (3).


(3) Schedule 1, item 1, page 12 (after line 24), at the end of section 47A, add:


   (3) An overseas student or intending overseas student does not default under subparagraph (1)(c)(iii) unless the registered provider accords the student natural justice before refusing to provide, or continue providing, the course to the student at the location.


These amendments essentially deal with the issue of natural justice. When these international students are in our country, they will clearly get into trouble at times—there will be misbehaviour, defaults on their commitments—and at the moment the way the system plays out results in students falling foul of the expectations and rules they are supposed to abide by. They end up being treated as second-class citizens. The amendments before us seek to deal with this situation. At the moment a student who is refused provision of their course because they have misbehaved is considered as defaulting and thus is not necessarily eligible for a refund of their prepaid tuition fees. Given that the bill is about ensuring the rights of overseas students are sensibly protected, we are seeking to raise the standards and ensure that international students are given a fair deal and are given a first-class education, that their rights are protected and that, if things go wrong, they are not going to lose out financially. Our amendment will insert: 'provider accords the student natural justice before refusing to provide, or continue providing, the course to the student' on the grounds of misbehaving. This allows due process because it allows students to appeal such a charge and it provides some surety that the student will not suffer disadvantage while waiting for the resolution of an appeal. It really is quite a simple mechanism. I think it is what any of us would expect to occur if we were in a similar situation in Australia or elsewhere. For students who default or where there is some form of misbehaviour they are allowed a fair form of justice so that they are not disadvantaged in the way that they are currently disadvantaged, with very few rights as it plays out. It could damage not only their immediate education but also their view of how these courses play out in Australia. I would be interested in the minister's response because it seems a necessary measure that is in keeping with the overall intent of the bill.

 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:08):  Senator Rhiannon, I begin by saying that I think the government is seized of the issues that you are describing. The government says that your proposed amendments are redundant because of existing protections that are found in the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2007—'the code', as it is generally referred to in this space. The code is enforceable under the ESOS Act. The government also notes that late last year the government established the Overseas Students Ombudsman to provide strong complaints handling for students. Notwithstanding those important facts, the government is happy to agree to the amendments proposed. I guess that is the happy end of it, Chair.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:10):  by leave—I move amendments (1) to (5), standing in my name on sheet 7197, together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 20 (after line 9), after subsection 50A(4), insert:


      Student incidental costs


   (4A) A call is made on the OSTF if:


      (a) a call is made on the OSTF under subsection (2), (3) or (4); and


      (b) the Minister determines that the student should be paid an amount in respect of reasonable incidental costs (including accommodation fees and travel expenses) incurred by the student in connection with the course; and


      (c) the Minister notifies the TPS Director of the determination and the amount.


   (4B) The Minister must consult the TPS Director before making a determination under subsection (4A), and must not make such a determination if the TPS Director advises the Minister that to do so would jeopardise the sustainability of the OSTF.


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 20 (line 13), omit ""or (4)"", substitute "", (4) or (4A)"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 1, page 20 (line 17), after ""OSTF"", insert ""(other than under subsection 50A(4A))"".


(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 21 (after line 15), after subsection 50B(4), insert:


   (4A) If a call is made on the OSTF under subsection 50A(4A) (incidental costs), then, as soon as practicable, the TPS Director must pay out of the OSTF an amount equal to the amount determined by the Minister under that subsection.


   (4B) The TPS Director must, in accordance with a legislative instrument made under subsection (5), pay the amount to the student.


(5) Schedule 1, item 1, page 21 (line 30), after ""section 50B"", insert ""(other than under subsection 50B(4B))"".


These amendments provide the minister with the discretionary power to make payments to cover incidental costs where an education provider has failed to deliver services. These costs could include travel, accommodation and the like. The amendments provide that the minister must consult with the TPS director and that the payment may not be made if a director advises that doing so would jeopardise the financial sustainability of the Overseas Students Tuition Fund.


Amendment (1) provides that a call can be made on the Overseas Students Tuition Fund if the minister determines that a student should be paid a reasonable amount with respect to incidental costs. The minister must also notify the TPS director of the determination and the amount. Under this item, the minister must also consult with the TPS director and must not make such a determination if doing so would jeopardise the financial sustainability of the fund. Amendment (2) provides that such a determination may not be made after 12 months, so there is a reasonable time frame. Amendment (4) provides that the TPS director must pay the determined amount to the student in accordance with the minister's decision. Amendments (3) and (5) exclude the discretionary payments from the provisions in the bill relating to course refunds. That sets out the technical aspects of this bill.


They are similar to amendments I have previously moved which Senator Hanson-Young, from the Australian Greens, supported in substance. They are very similar amendments in terms of the general principle of ministerial discretion. This sends a signal to overseas students that, in the event that something goes wrong, the minister has the discretion to say, 'Your losses go beyond tuition fees.' If there are accommodation expenses and the like, the minister has the discretion to set what that amount could be. It could be capped, but in this case—and this is where it differs from previous amendments I have moved, which were supported by the Australian Greens, and I am grateful for their support—I have bent over backwards to ensure that there is a link back to the financial viability of the fund so that this would be seen to be consistent and responsible regarding the fund and the financial constraints of the fund. All it does is give the minister the discretion to say that additional compensation or additional matters can be considered. The minister does not have to use that discretion. If the minister chooses to use his or her discretion, the minister can determine to cap the amounts of compensation payable.


I note that Minister Evans, in his summing-up to the second reading contributions, said that he was not inclined to support these amendments. I have tried to engage constructively and positively with the minister's office because I, the government, the opposition, the Australian Greens and the DLP in this chamber all believe very much in the overseas students sector. It is an important part of Australia's economy and it is an important part of our education system. There does not seem to be any logical reason to reject an amendment that simply gives the minister the discretionary power. The minister does not have to exercise it; it just gives the minister the power to provide additional compensation if the minister sees fit. In the absence of the government providing support for this, what undertaking is the government inclined to give to ensure that this live issue of an adequate level of compensation is dealt with? You may have an overseas student—and I have heard these stories—who, when their college collapses, can get their tuition and enrolment fees back but has just forked out for rent, incidental expenses, airfares and a whole range of expenses that they are lumbered with as a result of the collapse. Getting back just the tuition fees is still going to cause significant hardship for these families. Some of these families, from the Subcontinent, for instance, make great sacrifices for their children to come to this country. I think that simply giving the minister that level of discretion would strengthen the intent of the bill in a substantial way.


I am sorry that Senator Feeney, and not the minister, is here to take this question. I am always glad to engage with Senator Feeney; I am not sure that the feeling is mutual on Senator Feeney's part!




Senator Feeney:
  Always mutual!




Senator XENOPHON:
  It is always mutual, he said—I am not sure if he has misled the chamber! But I just want an explanation of why the minister does not even want the discretion for the minister to make certain determinations from time to time as he or she thinks fit.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:16):  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. As always, it is a pleasure dealing with you. Indeed, perhaps on a more serious note, I do honour the sentiments and the motivations that have encouraged you to bring these amendments, but, alas, as indeed you appear to understand, the government does not accept this amendment.




Senator Xenophon:
  I don't understand your reasoning, though.




Senator FEENEY:
  I will do my best to carry you through the government's reasoning. The government has implemented the Baird recommendation on this issue to allow regulators to impose any condition on a provider based on risk, including stopping them from collecting accommodation fees from the student. In addition, this issue has not been raised in submissions to the two inquiries that were conducted into this bill. Thirdly, the travel cost issues, we would submit, are easily managed through normal commercial travel insurance and do not require Australian government provisions. Fourthly, this proposed amendment would have financial implications for the TPS and for providers through the TPS levy. Fifthly, the reforms that the government is pursuing have at their heart the objective to deliver sustainable tuition protection. Your proposal, we would submit, seeks to expand the liability and it is worth noting, I think, that in the last two years the taxpayers of Australia have had to support the ESOS fund by injecting some $30 million into it. Lastly, the government believes this amendment is not straightforward and does not place any obligation on providers to refund a student's accommodation and travel expenses but instead expects the TPS to pick up that cost.


I might add further that the government have done, we would submit, a great deal in order to protect overseas students from unscrupulous providers. This is the third piece of legislation in two years to strengthen regulations under the ESOS. The govern­ment undertook systemic reregistration of all providers in 2010—I am sure you will remember that—which led to the removal of some 180 providers from the sector, and the government  established two new national regulators for higher education and VET. They are taking over full responsibility for regulation under ESOS from 1 July 2012.


In summary, Senator Xenophon, while the government has resolved to not support your amendment, it certainly maintains that the concerns you have are not only fair, legitimate and, as I say, genuinely held but something that the government believes it has ably dealt with.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:19):  Let us demolish some of these arguments once and for all. You do not need a bobcat or a big demolition thing; just one of those toy demolition trucks you can buy from Toys R Us for $29.95 would do. Let us deal with some of these arguments. Firstly, you say that these issues were not raised in the inquiry. I think it is implicit that, if there is a loss, the inquiry did deal with the issue of losses. If there are incidental losses, I would have thought that would have been within the remit of the Baird inquiry. I think Bruce Baird did a terrific job in dealing with a whole range of issues, but this is something that still is left untouched. I take your point about travel insurance, but if they do not have travel insurance it is still an incidental cost.


In terms of the financial implications for the TPS levy, that argument verges on the Orwellian—it is not quite Orwellian, but it verges on the Orwellian—for this reason: the amendment actually specifies that there cannot be any payment made if it would jeopardise the fund and that there must be consultation with the TPS director. In terms of a sustainable tuition fund, it actually acknowledges that. It says you cannot make any determination unless you consider those factors.


You mention that $30 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on the ESOS fund. That is a lot of taxpayers' money, but also very significant is the risk if we continue to have a slide in the number of overseas students in this country. It is a multibillion dollar industry. I do not know whether Senator Mason off the top of his head can provide me with some gratuitous assistance, but I think it is about $15 billion a year.




Senator Rhiannon:
  Sixteen.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Thank you—I should have asked Senator Rhiannon. It is a significant industry in my home state. If it means that we pay out another $10 million or $15 million a year, it is a very small insurance premium to pay to give certainty and confidence to overseas students, so students the world over will know that the responsible minister has the power, at his or her absolute discretion, to allow for additional compensation payments. Why is the government afraid of giving the minister a discretion that the minister can choose to use or not use? I do not understand why the government is so frightened of this amendment. Senator Feeney is not a man who knows the word fear—




Senator Feeney:
  I'm frightened all the time!




Senator XENOPHON:
  He is frightened all the time!


I just do not get why the government will not give this level of certainty to overseas students by saying, 'If worst comes to worst, the minister has the discretion to make additional payments.' I would be very grateful if the parliamentary secretary, Senator Feeney, can respond to that, and I am looking forward to Senator Mason's contribution. If, by chance, he disappoints me with the position he takes, I would like to find out why he does not want to give overseas students that level of protection.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:22):  A great deal of what you said was obviously rebuttal and I do not have much more to add to what I said in my earlier remarks, but let me say at least a couple of things. Firstly, the minister is aware that the joint committee on education which operates under SCOTESE—I am advised that is an acronym standing for Standing Council on Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, which is education ministers—is considering the issues described by you. Further, Senator Xenophon, the minister is willing to give an undertaking that he will review this issue again and report back to the Senate. So while the government remains of the view—




Senator Xenophon:
  In my lifetime?




Senator FEENEY:
  I am not in a position to talk to you about timing, alas—not for the absence of goodwill in my heart, Senator Xenophon, but probably for the fact that I do not have instructions to go further than I have.




Senator Xenophon:
  In 2050?




Senator FEENEY:
  I guess if you are still here in 2050, Senator Xenophon, I suspect you will be able to do whatever you please! On the one hand the government says that the amendment is not accepted by us, at least at this juncture, because of the issues I outlined earlier; but, above and beyond that, the minister is willing to undertake a review so that the issues exercising your concern will at least be able to be addressed. And I hope and trust you will all be thrilled with the demonstrable process and success of the bill.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (18:24):  Senator Xenophon may find the minister's arguments somewhat Orwellian or dystopian, but the opposition finds them, if not compelling, at least persuasive. I concede that it is a matter of balance and it is not clear-cut. I think even the minister would concede that. It is about the price of insurance and the regulatory burden on the one hand versus the convenience or the confidence of students on the other. Senator Xenophon, you are right to suggest that the last time we debated this group of bills on ESOS the opposition voted against a similar amendment. We did, not because we do not believe that, as the minister said, it is well intentioned; we do think it is well intentioned. These are often close calls. But on this occasion the opposition does agree with the government that it is a bridge too far for the providers and the Tuition Protection Service.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:25):  I will direct this to the opposition because they are the alternative government. Firstly, is Senator Mason, as the shadow minister responsible for this, saying that simply giving the minister the discretion, circumscribed by protections to ensure consultation with the fund and affordability of the fund, to deal with matters is a bridge too far? Is he honestly saying that? Secondly, does he concede—and this is a question for the government as well—that unless this amendment is passed there will be no mechanism to compensate students, in the event of a failure of an educational institution, for ancillary expenses or losses such as for accommodation? If there is a direct mechanism to cover other consequential losses, please outline that. There may be certain circumstances, but, as I understand it, there will be a whole range of loopholes where students will not have the ability to be compensated for the failure of an institution because at the moment that is constrained within the terms of the legislation. This discretion would allow for a safety valve for students that have been hard done by, that have been let down by an unscrupulous operator, to actually seek some redress.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (18:27):  To address Senator Xenophon's concerns, my point really was this: the price of insurance and the regulatory burden to be borne by higher education providers has to be balanced against other consequential losses for students. The point I am making, and I suspect the government would agree, is that it is not a one-way street; it is a very tough balance. Thus far, the opposition has been persuaded that it is appropriate that the current amendments as recommended by Mr Baird are enough. If the minister says he is going to review the situation at some stage, I am interested in that. But, thus far, the opposition is not persuaded that the balance should move any further.

 (South Australia) (18:29):  I should perhaps tell the chamber that I have just got a text message from someone who has been listening in, an academic who asks, 'What have you got against Orwell?' I do not have anything against Eric Blair, or George Orwell. I understand the parliamentary secretary's instructions are very limited, but there will be some review of undefined terms and with an undefined time frame. Will it be in the next 12 months? If it cannot be in the next 12 months then I cannot see that the government is serious about it, because it will then push it to a new parliament. I would have thought that a six- or 12-month time frame would at least be a useful exercise. Would it be undertaken by Mr Baird? Would it be undertaken by the department or some other mechanism? Or would the government be open to a Senate standing committee looking at this as a discrete issue? I do not know why you laughed then, Parliamentary Secretary, but I am interested in finding out why.




Senator FEENEY:
  I only laughed, Senator Xenophon, because the proliferation of committees in this place, I am sure, is driving many of my Senate colleagues to distraction.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:31):  The Greens will support Senator Xenophon's amendments. We have amendments that also cover this issue. We actually think that it needs to go further than Senator Xenophon has set out, but we will certainly still support this. In doing that, Senator Xenophon and I have had a bit of a chat about this, which he has outlined, because what he is putting forward is quite minimal. The senator has set this out, but I think it is worth unpicking this a little bit further because it is extraordinary that this amendment is not being supported.


As Senator Xenophon said, it merely gives discretionary powers to the minister—powers that could possibly deal with losses additional to the tuition fees.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  Yes, that is the emphasis here: that the minister could do nothing. It is the sort of thing that is amazing that the government did not come up with itself, so it would appear that it was doing something and then probably nothing would happen at all. I think we need to remember that what this ESOS bill is all about is seeking to strengthen protection of international students' interests. That is what many of us have spoken about here and that is what we are trying to achieve.


This issue does need to be addressed, because the damage that is being done to the education sector with regard to international students deciding if they will come to Australia is not just with regard to tuition fees. Many of them have been ripped off in other ways, and accommodation is a big one. I come from Sydney. I know how expensive accommodation in our city is, and this is so in many other areas. It can be a real burden on students and they often lose out. So here we have a minor regulatory mechanism that could be used if the minister so chose.


The fact that the government and the opposition are saying that they will not support it really does need to be emphasised because, while we have heard from the government and the opposition about the need for balance here, we are not seeing them striking a correct balance. What we are seeing is the balance being pushed to the providers and away from the students. The students are being left high and dry here. You can predict now that some international students are going to lose out when they are up for costs; they have put money forward and the services are not there. Accommodation is one of those areas where we know this will happen.


The failure of the government here again shows that while we have got a regulatory mechanism, which is essentially what this bill is all about, it is very minimal and in too many areas the providers are favoured over the students. I think the response we are hearing from the government and the opposition on this is actually very informative.

(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 31 (after line 17), after subsection 55C(2), insert:


   (2A) In appointing a Board member under paragraph (1)(b), the Minister must ensure that the Board members appointed under that paragraph, as a group, have qualifications or experience relevant to the operations of providers from across the international education and training sector, including providers of English language intensive courses for overseas students.


This takes up the issue of representation on the board. This does need to be tightened up. The current wording is quite loose, and it leaves it so open that it really ends up not being clear who would end up on the board. The Overseas Students Tuition Fund will pay for placement services and the cost of TPS staff and its director and the board, which is intended to represent the different sectors of international education providers. What we are dealing with here is who will be represented on that board. I understand that the sector has expressed concerns that there is no requirement in the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 before us to ensure that representation, so that is what our amendment addresses. We are inserting an amendment requiring that the seven non-department board members represent providers from across the international education and training sector, including providers of ELICOS courses, which provide major pathways into further Australian studies for overseas students. Picking up English language courses is clearly needed here, but it is not just about that; it is about making it clearer about representation on this board in terms of the non-department participants. So I recommend the Greens amendment to my fellow senators because it is an area that needs to be tightened up, because the loose wording at the moment is a concern.

 (New South Wales) (18:04):  by leave—I move the Australian Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7193.


 (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 12 (line 19), omit ""Note"", substitute ""Note 1"".

   (3) An overseas student or intending overseas student does not default under subparagraph (1)(c)(iii) unless the registered provider accords the student natural justice before refusing to provide, or continue providing, the course to the student at the location.


These amendments essentially deal with the issue of natural justice. When these international students are in our country, they will clearly get into trouble at times—there will be misbehaviour, defaults on their commitments—and at the moment the way the system plays out results in students falling foul of the expectations and rules they are supposed to abide by. They end up being treated as second-class citizens. The amendments before us seek to deal with this situation. At the moment a student who is refused provision of their course because they have misbehaved is considered as defaulting and thus is not necessarily eligible for a refund of their prepaid tuition fees. Given that the bill is about ensuring the rights of overseas students are sensibly protected, we are seeking to raise the standards and ensure that international students are given a fair deal and are given a first-class education, that their rights are protected and that, if things go wrong, they are not going to lose out financially. Our amendment will insert: 'provider accords the student natural justice before refusing to provide, or continue providing, the course to the student' on the grounds of misbehaving. This allows due process because it allows students to appeal such a charge and it provides some surety that the student will not suffer disadvantage while waiting for the resolution of an appeal. It really is quite a simple mechanism. I think it is what any of us would expect to occur if we were in a similar situation in Australia or elsewhere. For students who default or where there is some form of misbehaviour they are allowed a fair form of justice so that they are not disadvantaged in the way that they are currently disadvantaged, with very few rights as it plays out. It could damage not only their immediate education but also their view of how these courses play out in Australia. I would be interested in the minister's response because it seems a necessary measure that is in keeping with the overall intent of the bill.

The code is enforceable under the ESOS Act. The government also notes that late last year the government established the Overseas Students Ombudsman to provide strong complaints handling for students.

Question agreed to.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-02-29,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:10):  by leave—I move amendments (1) to (5), standing in my name on sheet 7197, together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 20 (after line 9), after subsection 50A(4), insert:


      Student incidental costs


   (4A) A call is made on the OSTF if:


      (a) a call is made on the OSTF under subsection (2), (3) or (4); and


      (b) the Minister determines that the student should be paid an amount in respect of reasonable incidental costs (including accommodation fees and travel expenses) incurred by the student in connection with the course; and


      (c) the Minister notifies the TPS Director of the determination and the amount.


   (4B) The Minister must consult the TPS Director before making a determination under subsection (4A), and must not make such a determination if the TPS Director advises the Minister that to do so would jeopardise the sustainability of the OSTF.


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 20 (line 13), omit ""or (4)"", substitute "", (4) or (4A)"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 1, page 20 (line 17), after ""OSTF"", insert ""(other than under subsection 50A(4A))"".


(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 21 (after line 15), after subsection 50B(4), insert:


   (4A) If a call is made on the OSTF under subsection 50A(4A) (incidental costs), then, as soon as practicable, the TPS Director must pay out of the OSTF an amount equal to the amount determined by the Minister under that subsection.


   (4B) The TPS Director must, in accordance with a legislative instrument made under subsection (5), pay the amount to the student.


(5) Schedule 1, item 1, page 21 (line 30), after ""section 50B"", insert ""(other than under subsection 50B(4B))"".


These amendments provide the minister with the discretionary power to make payments to cover incidental costs where an education provider has failed to deliver services. These costs could include travel, accommodation and the like. The amendments provide that the minister must consult with the TPS director and that the payment may not be made if a director advises that doing so would jeopardise the financial sustainability of the Overseas Students Tuition Fund.


Amendment (1) provides that a call can be made on the Overseas Students Tuition Fund if the minister determines that a student should be paid a reasonable amount with respect to incidental costs. The minister must also notify the TPS director of the determination and the amount. Under this item, the minister must also consult with the TPS director and must not make such a determination if doing so would jeopardise the financial sustainability of the fund. Amendment (2) provides that such a determination may not be made after 12 months, so there is a reasonable time frame. Amendment (4) provides that the TPS director must pay the determined amount to the student in accordance with the minister's decision. Amendments (3) and (5) exclude the discretionary payments from the provisions in the bill relating to course refunds. That sets out the technical aspects of this bill.


They are similar to amendments I have previously moved which Senator Hanson-Young, from the Australian Greens, supported in substance. They are very similar amendments in terms of the general principle of ministerial discretion. This sends a signal to overseas students that, in the event that something goes wrong, the minister has the discretion to say, 'Your losses go beyond tuition fees.' If there are accommodation expenses and the like, the minister has the discretion to set what that amount could be. It could be capped, but in this case—and this is where it differs from previous amendments I have moved, which were supported by the Australian Greens, and I am grateful for their support—I have bent over backwards to ensure that there is a link back to the financial viability of the fund so that this would be seen to be consistent and responsible regarding the fund and the financial constraints of the fund. All it does is give the minister the discretion to say that additional compensation or additional matters can be considered. The minister does not have to use that discretion. If the minister chooses to use his or her discretion, the minister can determine to cap the amounts of compensation payable.


I note that Minister Evans, in his summing-up to the second reading contributions, said that he was not inclined to support these amendments. I have tried to engage constructively and positively with the minister's office because I, the government, the opposition, the Australian Greens and the DLP in this chamber all believe very much in the overseas students sector. It is an important part of Australia's economy and it is an important part of our education system. There does not seem to be any logical reason to reject an amendment that simply gives the minister the discretionary power. The minister does not have to exercise it; it just gives the minister the power to provide additional compensation if the minister sees fit. In the absence of the government providing support for this, what undertaking is the government inclined to give to ensure that this live issue of an adequate level of compensation is dealt with? You may have an overseas student—and I have heard these stories—who, when their college collapses, can get their tuition and enrolment fees back but has just forked out for rent, incidental expenses, airfares and a whole range of expenses that they are lumbered with as a result of the collapse. Getting back just the tuition fees is still going to cause significant hardship for these families. Some of these families, from the Subcontinent, for instance, make great sacrifices for their children to come to this country. I think that simply giving the minister that level of discretion would strengthen the intent of the bill in a substantial way.


I am sorry that Senator Feeney, and not the minister, is here to take this question. I am always glad to engage with Senator Feeney; I am not sure that the feeling is mutual on Senator Feeney's part!




Senator Feeney:
  Always mutual!




Senator XENOPHON:
  It is always mutual, he said—I am not sure if he has misled the chamber! But I just want an explanation of why the minister does not even want the discretion for the minister to make certain determinations from time to time as he or she thinks fit.

 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:16):  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. As always, it is a pleasure dealing with you. Indeed, perhaps on a more serious note, I do honour the sentiments and the motivations that have encouraged you to bring these amendments, but, alas, as indeed you appear to understand, the government does not accept this amendment.




Senator Xenophon:
  I don't understand your reasoning, though.




Senator FEENEY:
  I will do my best to carry you through the government's reasoning. The government has implemented the Baird recommendation on this issue to allow regulators to impose any condition on a provider based on risk, including stopping them from collecting accommodation fees from the student. In addition, this issue has not been raised in submissions to the two inquiries that were conducted into this bill. Thirdly, the travel cost issues, we would submit, are easily managed through normal commercial travel insurance and do not require Australian government provisions. Fourthly, this proposed amendment would have financial implications for the TPS and for providers through the TPS levy. Fifthly, the reforms that the government is pursuing have at their heart the objective to deliver sustainable tuition protection. Your proposal, we would submit, seeks to expand the liability and it is worth noting, I think, that in the last two years the taxpayers of Australia have had to support the ESOS fund by injecting some $30 million into it. Lastly, the government believes this amendment is not straightforward and does not place any obligation on providers to refund a student's accommodation and travel expenses but instead expects the TPS to pick up that cost.


I might add further that the government have done, we would submit, a great deal in order to protect overseas students from unscrupulous providers. This is the third piece of legislation in two years to strengthen regulations under the ESOS. The govern­ment undertook systemic reregistration of all providers in 2010—I am sure you will remember that—which led to the removal of some 180 providers from the sector, and the government  established two new national regulators for higher education and VET. They are taking over full responsibility for regulation under ESOS from 1 July 2012.


In summary, Senator Xenophon, while the government has resolved to not support your amendment, it certainly maintains that the concerns you have are not only fair, legitimate and, as I say, genuinely held but something that the government believes it has ably dealt with.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:19):  Let us demolish some of these arguments once and for all. You do not need a bobcat or a big demolition thing; just one of those toy demolition trucks you can buy from Toys R Us for $29.95 would do. Let us deal with some of these arguments. Firstly, you say that these issues were not raised in the inquiry. I think it is implicit that, if there is a loss, the inquiry did deal with the issue of losses. If there are incidental losses, I would have thought that would have been within the remit of the Baird inquiry. I think Bruce Baird did a terrific job in dealing with a whole range of issues, but this is something that still is left untouched. I take your point about travel insurance, but if they do not have travel insurance it is still an incidental cost.


In terms of the financial implications for the TPS levy, that argument verges on the Orwellian—it is not quite Orwellian, but it verges on the Orwellian—for this reason: the amendment actually specifies that there cannot be any payment made if it would jeopardise the fund and that there must be consultation with the TPS director. In terms of a sustainable tuition fund, it actually acknowledges that. It says you cannot make any determination unless you consider those factors.


You mention that $30 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on the ESOS fund. That is a lot of taxpayers' money, but also very significant is the risk if we continue to have a slide in the number of overseas students in this country. It is a multibillion dollar industry. I do not know whether Senator Mason off the top of his head can provide me with some gratuitous assistance, but I think it is about $15 billion a year.

  Sixteen.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Thank you—I should have asked Senator Rhiannon. It is a significant industry in my home state. If it means that we pay out another $10 million or $15 million a year, it is a very small insurance premium to pay to give certainty and confidence to overseas students, so students the world over will know that the responsible minister has the power, at his or her absolute discretion, to allow for additional compensation payments. Why is the government afraid of giving the minister a discretion that the minister can choose to use or not use? I do not understand why the government is so frightened of this amendment. Senator Feeney is not a man who knows the word fear—




Senator Feeney:
  I'm frightened all the time!




Senator XENOPHON:
  He is frightened all the time!


I just do not get why the government will not give this level of certainty to overseas students by saying, 'If worst comes to worst, the minister has the discretion to make additional payments.' I would be very grateful if the parliamentary secretary, Senator Feeney, can respond to that, and I am looking forward to Senator Mason's contribution. If, by chance, he disappoints me with the position he takes, I would like to find out why he does not want to give overseas students that level of protection.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:22):  A great deal of what you said was obviously rebuttal and I do not have much more to add to what I said in my earlier remarks, but let me say at least a couple of things. Firstly, the minister is aware that the joint committee on education which operates under SCOTESE—I am advised that is an acronym standing for Standing Council on Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, which is education ministers—is considering the issues described by you. Further, Senator Xenophon, the minister is willing to give an undertaking that he will review this issue again and report back to the Senate. So while the government remains of the view—




Senator Xenophon:
  In my lifetime?




Senator FEENEY:
  I am not in a position to talk to you about timing, alas—not for the absence of goodwill in my heart, Senator Xenophon, but probably for the fact that I do not have instructions to go further than I have.




Senator Xenophon:
  In 2050?




Senator FEENEY:
  I guess if you are still here in 2050, Senator Xenophon, I suspect you will be able to do whatever you please! On the one hand the government says that the amendment is not accepted by us, at least at this juncture, because of the issues I outlined earlier; but, above and beyond that, the minister is willing to undertake a review so that the issues exercising your concern will at least be able to be addressed. And I hope and trust you will all be thrilled with the demonstrable process and success of the bill.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (18:24):  Senator Xenophon may find the minister's arguments somewhat Orwellian or dystopian, but the opposition finds them, if not compelling, at least persuasive. I concede that it is a matter of balance and it is not clear-cut. I think even the minister would concede that. It is about the price of insurance and the regulatory burden on the one hand versus the convenience or the confidence of students on the other. Senator Xenophon, you are right to suggest that the last time we debated this group of bills on ESOS the opposition voted against a similar amendment. We did, not because we do not believe that, as the minister said, it is well intentioned; we do think it is well intentioned. These are often close calls. But on this occasion the opposition does agree with the government that it is a bridge too far for the providers and the Tuition Protection Service.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:25):  I will direct this to the opposition because they are the alternative government. Firstly, is Senator Mason, as the shadow minister responsible for this, saying that simply giving the minister the discretion, circumscribed by protections to ensure consultation with the fund and affordability of the fund, to deal with matters is a bridge too far? Is he honestly saying that? Secondly, does he concede—and this is a question for the government as well—that unless this amendment is passed there will be no mechanism to compensate students, in the event of a failure of an educational institution, for ancillary expenses or losses such as for accommodation? If there is a direct mechanism to cover other consequential losses, please outline that. There may be certain circumstances, but, as I understand it, there will be a whole range of loopholes where students will not have the ability to be compensated for the failure of an institution because at the moment that is constrained within the terms of the legislation. This discretion would allow for a safety valve for students that have been hard done by, that have been let down by an unscrupulous operator, to actually seek some redress.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (18:27):  To address Senator Xenophon's concerns, my point really was this: the price of insurance and the regulatory burden to be borne by higher education providers has to be balanced against other consequential losses for students. The point I am making, and I suspect the government would agree, is that it is not a one-way street; it is a very tough balance. Thus far, the opposition has been persuaded that it is appropriate that the current amendments as recommended by Mr Baird are enough. If the minister says he is going to review the situation at some stage, I am interested in that. But, thus far, the opposition is not persuaded that the balance should move any further.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:28):  I support the comments just made. Senator Xenophon, I would finish on this note. It is about striking the correct balance and it would seem to me that at some point here the government has to be firm about the fact that is not going to be the insurer of last resort for the sorts of failings that you are describing. Obviously the government is committed to establishing a regulatory framework that protects all the participants where possible and practicable, but at some point the balance has to be struck so that taxpayers are not continually exposed for what I might describe as market failure.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:29):  I should perhaps tell the chamber that I have just got a text message from someone who has been listening in, an academic who asks, 'What have you got against Orwell?' I do not have anything against Eric Blair, or George Orwell. I understand the parliamentary secretary's instructions are very limited, but there will be some review of undefined terms and with an undefined time frame. Will it be in the next 12 months? If it cannot be in the next 12 months then I cannot see that the government is serious about it, because it will then push it to a new parliament. I would have thought that a six- or 12-month time frame would at least be a useful exercise. Would it be undertaken by Mr Baird? Would it be undertaken by the department or some other mechanism? Or would the government be open to a Senate standing committee looking at this as a discrete issue? I do not know why you laughed then, Parliamentary Secretary, but I am interested in finding out why.




Senator FEENEY:
  I only laughed, Senator Xenophon, because the proliferation of committees in this place, I am sure, is driving many of my Senate colleagues to distraction.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator FEENEY:
  That is true. I am not denouncing your remarks, but I am chuckling at them! Notwithstanding what you say about a standing committee—and I cannot possibly comment on that—all I can really say about the review, based on the instructions I have, is that, yes, it would be conducted within the time frame of the next 12 months and it would be conducted by the department.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:31):  The Greens will support Senator Xenophon's amendments. We have amendments that also cover this issue. We actually think that it needs to go further than Senator Xenophon has set out, but we will certainly still support this. In doing that, Senator Xenophon and I have had a bit of a chat about this, which he has outlined, because what he is putting forward is quite minimal. The senator has set this out, but I think it is worth unpicking this a little bit further because it is extraordinary that this amendment is not being supported.


As Senator Xenophon said, it merely gives discretionary powers to the minister—powers that could possibly deal with losses additional to the tuition fees.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  Yes, that is the emphasis here: that the minister could do nothing. It is the sort of thing that is amazing that the government did not come up with itself, so it would appear that it was doing something and then probably nothing would happen at all. I think we need to remember that what this ESOS bill is all about is seeking to strengthen protection of international students' interests. That is what many of us have spoken about here and that is what we are trying to achieve.


This issue does need to be addressed, because the damage that is being done to the education sector with regard to international students deciding if they will come to Australia is not just with regard to tuition fees. Many of them have been ripped off in other ways, and accommodation is a big one. I come from Sydney. I know how expensive accommodation in our city is, and this is so in many other areas. It can be a real burden on students and they often lose out. So here we have a minor regulatory mechanism that could be used if the minister so chose.


The fact that the government and the opposition are saying that they will not support it really does need to be emphasised because, while we have heard from the government and the opposition about the need for balance here, we are not seeing them striking a correct balance. What we are seeing is the balance being pushed to the providers and away from the students. The students are being left high and dry here. You can predict now that some international students are going to lose out when they are up for costs; they have put money forward and the services are not there. Accommodation is one of those areas where we know this will happen.


The failure of the government here again shows that while we have got a regulatory mechanism, which is essentially what this bill is all about, it is very minimal and in too many areas the providers are favoured over the students. I think the response we are hearing from the government and the opposition on this is actually very informative.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:42):  I move Greens amendment (4) on sheet 7193:


(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 31 (after line 17), after subsection 55C(2), insert:


   (2A) In appointing a Board member under paragraph (1)(b), the Minister must ensure that the Board members appointed under that paragraph, as a group, have qualifications or experience relevant to the operations of providers from across the international education and training sector, including providers of English language intensive courses for overseas students.


This takes up the issue of representation on the board. This does need to be tightened up. The current wording is quite loose, and it leaves it so open that it really ends up not being clear who would end up on the board. The Overseas Students Tuition Fund will pay for placement services and the cost of TPS staff and its director and the board, which is intended to represent the different sectors of international education providers. What we are dealing with here is who will be represented on that board. I understand that the sector has expressed concerns that there is no requirement in the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 before us to ensure that representation, so that is what our amendment addresses. We are inserting an amendment requiring that the seven non-department board members represent providers from across the international education and training sector, including providers of ELICOS courses, which provide major pathways into further Australian studies for overseas students. Picking up English language courses is clearly needed here, but it is not just about that; it is about making it clearer about representation on this board in terms of the non-department participants. So I recommend the Greens amendment to my fellow senators because it is an area that needs to be tightened up, because the loose wording at the moment is a concern.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:46):   I thank Senator Rhiannon for her contribution. I do not think there is any disagreement here about the board needing to be representative. We have not actually specified in the bill the cohorts that would be represented, and this amendment, Greens amendment (4), seeks to add one particular group—that is, the ELICOS group—without actually considering the others.


We have not gone for something that is prescriptive—that says that there must be one representative of this and one representative of that. So I cannot support the amendment in its current form, in the sense that it just specifies one group and other groups will say, 'Well, why aren't we specified in the bill?' What I would suggest is that either I am going to have to oppose it and say that this is naturally what we will do, that my intention would be to have a cross-sector representative group, or, having looked at the amendment, I would be happy to support the amendment if the senator was prepared to move it with a full stop at the end of 'sector' and not put 'including providers of English language intensive courses for overseas students'—on the understanding that they, of course, would be one of the groups represented. But under this amendment only one of them is named and the others are not named. So the intent I agree with—that it be broadly representative—and, if the senator is prepared to drop that last bit out of the amendment, I will accept the amendment. That would give her a broad policy intent, which is to have recognised that we need a broader group with a range of experiences. But I do not think we should just name one group that ought to be representative without thinking about the overall balance.


So if the senator is prepared to do that, to put a full stop where the comma is before the last bit, I am prepared to accept the amendment; otherwise, I will have to oppose the amendment.

The reason I objected to the last part of your original amendment is that we have not done that consideration and I was not able to be clear yet which groups ought to be represented—so I did not want to do that on that run. Clearly, your amendment, which will now become part of the bill and hopefully the act, provides for people having 'qualifications or experience relevant to the operations of providers from across the international education and training sector'. So it will be representative of the various sections across that—obviously, university, VET, private and public—but I do not want to try on the run to define those things.


I can give you an assurance that someone with experience in the ELICOS area would need to be part of that, and we will work our way through the group. But, clearly, by the insertion of this clause it has to be representative of the breadth of the sector, and I am quite happy to indicate that ELICOS is an important part of the sector and it will need to be part of that representative group.

   (2) The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to any accommodation fees for a study period for a course that are received by a registered provider after this item commences.




Some of these issues were canvassed in the discussion that we had when we considered Senator Xenophon's amendment. The Greens have taken a somewhat different approach but it does deal with the same issue, which is largely about accommodation costs that international students incur when they are in our country.





The Greens do believe that this should be a key aspect of 
these
 bill
s
. What we are dealing with here is protection of overseas students to ensure their unexpended tuition fees are available for refund should their education provider default on course provision. 
W
e are arguing that the protection does need to go further, because there is nothing in these bills to protect students when they pay other upfront substantial fees, such as accommodation fees to pro
viders—and that does happen. The
s
e
 can disappear if there is a shonky provider. There have been examples of that—and, sadly, we know there will be further examples. A key issue here is that there needs to be some measure of protection in this legislation.





We 
propose
 amending the 
bill
 to afford prepaid accommodation fees the same protection as tuition fees. That is the question that the minister does need to answer here. Except for our item 11, where providers can draw down below the protected amount in order to make advance payments to accommodation suppliers
,
 and may do so before a course commences, that protection does need to be in place.





I would put to senators that 
these amendments recognise
 the reality of paying upfront accommodation bonds and rent while ensuring the money is used only for 
accommodation, which is what the student has paid for. Again, the essence of this is about protecting the upfront money students have paid—in this case, in the main for accommodation.
 I
f we are willing to put protection in place for tuition fees, why do we not give greater certainty and confidence to students who come here? As Senator Xenophon said, so many families 
make
 enormous sacrifice
s
 for their children and their loved ones to come and study in this country.


Surely we need to be rebuilding the reputation of our education services. At the moment, this legislation goes 
only 
part of the way to achieving that. If this protection is not put in place, it again suggests that the providers are having too much say 
in
 how this government brings forward legislation.





I would very much like to hear from the minister. Obviously I hope that the government will support these amendments. From previous comments made by Senator Feeney before Senator Evans arrived, it was set out that the issue of accommodation costs would not be picked up in the 
legislation
. 
W
hy have we got two ways of handling the issue between tuition costs and accommodation costs if that is the way that the government is going to go?





Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:55):  I think the first thing to say, Senator Rhiannon, is that this is a policy response to the concerns about protection of tuition fees. That is the first answer. The second answer is: as I understand it, the issues you raise have not been raised in the debate around the 
bills


in the committee inquiry,


s
o I have been quite surprised by Senator Xenophon
's
 and your focus on this.
 These are not issues that have been raised with me in recent times. It is of course factually the case that while there are some people who accept 
accommodation packages as part of the student's tuition and enrolment processes, the majority do not. This is not an issue that has been at the forefront of anyone's attention in recent times. We did, I understand, have one bad case where a provider with those sorts of arrangements in place did become insolvent.



This is not an issue that has been consulted on. We have had a consultative process with people and we have had the committee inquiry. We would now be saying, 'By the way, we are going to add in this major change to the legislation.' Normally people say to me, 'You have not consulted enough,' but if the parliament is going to say, 'Throw this in the mix as well' and 'By the way, it is also going to pick up those issues,' I think that is not a good way to do business. Secondly, the financial implications of this have not been costed. I do not know what this would cost the Commonwealth. I think this is not the appropriate response to a problem which you say exists but which has not been generally talked about nor generated concern.


I am obviously concerned that we get the best system we can in place. This is the last of a whole set of reforms responding to the Baird review and the terrible situation that developed in the international student area a couple of years ago. As you know, as immigration minister at the time I took a keen interest in these issues, because I think a lot of bad practice had developed with a small number of providers. We have done our best to clean it up both from the immigration end and the education end. I think things are vastly improved, but we have got to constantly be vigilant about these issues; because, as I said earlier, this is about 'brand Australia'. Every time there is a bad student experience it impacts on all providers and on Australia's international reputation. So as well as the impact on the student there is the impact on the international education sector.


One of the things we have done is to set up the Chaney committee, which is reviewing the international education sector to make sure we have got a more holistic view of how that sector is managed, of government's engagement with the sector and where we see that sector going in the longer term. It is a very large industry; it is a huge export earner for Australia, and we have never thought about it in those terms. I think that the rapid growth without any structure around the actual industry led to some of the problems we have seen. Hopefully the Chaney report will give us that context. I understand that Senator Feeney, on my behalf, gave an assurance about reviewing the impact of the issues around accommodation that you raise. I am happy to do that. If there is a genuine problem, we will address it. I indicated that I am happy to address any issue that is there, but this is not something that has been raised with me. It is not something that was raised beyond the Baird process or in the committee inquiry. So I am not inclined to say, on the run, that we ought to do this without consulting anybody—without clear evidence of a problem or what you suggest is the solution. I am happy to take the issue seriously and to see what we can do to analyse if there is a problem, what is the problem, and what might be a policy response. We will put the assurances we gave in place, and obviously I will find a mechanism for reporting back to the Senate about how that is going. If there is a problem, I am happy to address it.

It is not something that anyone has been raising with me since I have been in the portfolio.


We will be able to do that by the end of the year. I am happy to set the wheels in motion. We have not had submissions on this and we have not had people raising it with us, but I will get the department to get out there. I just said to the department for Senator Feeney to represent me in saying we are happy to take it up, and if there is a problem we are happy to address it. I do not have an announcement in terms of the review, but I am happy to let you know.


We will put something in place that allows us to go out and test the waters, and to see whether this is a big issue, or what the aspects of the issue are. I will write to each of the senators with an interest in the matter when I have had a look at how best to do that. I am sorry I cannot be more helpful. As I said, this was raised with me this morning, but we have undertaken to do a review and I will write to you in the next week or two about how I intend to conduct that, once I have worked it out.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:01):  Firstly, I indicate my support for this amendment. Whilst it is quite a different approach to the approach in my amendment it still covers the same principle, in a sense; that is, what do you do in circumstances that go beyond where there is a loss of accommodation expenses, particularly prepaid expenses? I understand the government's position, and that was also traversed in my amendment with Senator Feeney, but my question to the minister is, is there any scope at the moment in this bill to cover a loss that a student may sustain as a result of prepaid accommodation expenses? In other words, is there any capacity for that student, who has paid accommodation upfront in addition to tuition fees, to receive some form of recompense or compensation?

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:02):  The answer is no. It is not designed to pick up accommodation, air fares, medical expenses or any of the range of other expenses a student might incur in coming to Australia. It is designed as a tuition payments protection scheme. It does not pick those other matters up.


It is the case, though, that we have the capacity to make some decisions about a particular provider based on risk. That potential is there. One could conceivably make a decision that a particular provider or set of providers should not be accepting payment for accommodation because they are seen as being of risk, but I am not sure how successful or appropriate that would be. I am not suggesting it as a policy response, just that there is some capacity there. But no, the bill is not designed to pick up this question of accommodation.


As I said, it has not been raised with me in recent times and it has not been raised as part of the committee process, so it has come as a bit of a surprise to me that there is so much focus on it. I am happy to go out there and see how big the problem is. I have no idea, for instance, how many providers actually provide accommodation packages as part of that provision. I have no idea how many people have been affected in the past. It raises the question of what happens if someone then transfers to another provider. There is a whole lot about this proposition that you and the Greens are advancing that, quite frankly, I do not think we know enough about. I am unwilling to accept amendments when no-one has raised it with me and no-one has provided any evidence in recent times about this issue. I just do not think we have the factual understanding to move to implementing legislation regarding the issues being raised. As I have given an undertaking to do the review, if Senator Xenophon, Senator Rhiannon or anyone else has issues, examples or experiences they want to bring to our attention I would be happy to receive them, because that would give us some context.

 (South Australia) (19:04):  I appreciate the minister's undertaking to look at this, but I think it is fair to say that it is not as though this matter is one that has come as a total surprise. When part of this tranche of bills was dealt with a year or two ago there was an amendment about the minister's discretion to deal with issues, which Senator Hanson-Young co-sponsored with me. It is not as though it has come entirely out of the blue, but I understand what the minister has said, and I agree with him about the Baird review process.


The intention for this amendment, as with my amendment, Senator Rhiannon's amendment and the Australian Greens' amendment, is to give a higher degree of certainty and comfort to overseas students in the event that something goes wrong. We cannot take it any further, but I can indicate again my support for this amendment.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (19:05):  I assure both Senator Rhiannon and Senator Xenophon that the opposition is not opposing either of their amendments this evening reflexively—not at all. We are not doing it on behalf of education providers or anyone else. It comes down to balancing the regulatory and financial burden that providers would suffer versus the consequential projections for students and, indeed, the uncertainty of how much it would cost, and what the cost impost would be on providers.


It is really a matter of us not having the information. It is certainly fair to say that the proposal by Senator Rhiannon on behalf of the Greens is an extension of an insurance scheme for fees that is not provided in other, similar contexts. For that reason, the opposition will not be supporting this amendment.

91 (line 23) to page 92 (line 6)
, omit subsections

   Limit on when remaining tuition fees may be required






(3) Once an overseas student begins a course, the registered provider for the course must not require any of the remaining tuition fees for the course to be paid, in respect of the overseas student, more than 2 weeks before the beginning of the student's second study period for the course.



This amendment is to do with the limit on when remaining tuition fees may be required. We think this will clarify the legislative drafting on prepaid fees. It is an issue that was raised with us, and we are seeking to address it. It provides that up to 50 per cent of total course fees, or 100 per cent for a course of 24 weeks or less, can be paid upfront at any time before the course commences. Once a student has begun a course, the provider cannot require the student to pay any further tuition fees more than two weeks prior to the second study period. If a student chooses to pay earlier, there is no requirement for the provider to return the tuition fees to the student and they would not be found non-compliant. This will protect the interests of students and reduce refunds flowing to the TPS without imposing unworkable requirements on providers.


The changes will give greater clarity to the sector in understanding their obligations. There was concern raised about how clear this was in the legislation. This is designed to give that clarity and to reassure people of what their obligations are. So it is just a response to feedback we have had from people with an interest. There is no change to the rules, as it were; it is just to make it clear.

      (ii)   for a provider who is not yet registered—the likely total enrolments for the provider for the year (assuming the provider becomes registered).


These amendments are framed as requests because they are to a bill which imposes taxation within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution. The Senate may not amend a bill imposing taxation.


As this is a bill imposing taxation within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution, any Senate amendment to the bill must be moved as a request. This is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate.




Senator RHIANNON:
  These amendments deal with a failure in the legislation to bring new providers into the TPS levy. What we have right now is a system where new providers are effectively exempt, and that really is a major anomaly for legislation that is supposedly bringing in a tighter regulatory framework for how this industry operates. 


I put it to my fellow senators that these amendments are essential. New providers really are at greater risk of defaulting, leaving students high and dry. How this works is that the administrative fees we are dealing with here are set at $100 plus $2 per enrolment for the previous year. The base fees are set at $200 plus $5 per enrolment for the previous year. But when it comes to new providers, clearly there is not a previous year. So what is happening is that they are being left out. How the system works is that new providers seeking registration are in effect exempt from the $2 and $5 per student components because they do not have a prior history of enrolments. You would have to say this is an absurd contradiction in risk assessment terms. Again, I would be interested to hear from the minister. How did they miss this out? Surely it can be easily solved—and that is what our amendments attempt to do.


As I understand it, new providers must already provide projected domestic and overseas student numbers with their application for CRICOS registration. So our amendment to this bill would ensure that new providers are also charged per student using their projected likely total enrolments to complete the calculation. So it really can be sorted out quite easily. It is a serious anomaly; it leaves out new providers. We all know that, when businesses first get going, it is more likely that they will default, that they will in some way fold. We also know that these new providers have to put forward their likely total enrolments. So let us use that to bring them into the current system with regard to the setting of administration fees. I look forward to the minister's comments about this, because surely it is an anomaly that needs to be fixed up.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:14): The government cannot support this request for amendment. I think I understand what Senator Rhiannon is trying to do, but we are not able to support it. This amendment effectively puts a cost on providers before they have registered or have any enrolments, and somehow we have to estimate how many enrolments they are going to get and reconcile that. I am not quite sure what Senator Rhiannon would be trying to achieve by this amendment.


We do require new entrants to the market to pay a $7,500 entry fee as part of their registration process, but we do not require them to pay the TPS levy until they are effectively enrolling students. That is the logic of it—they have to get registered by following the normal processes to provide assurance about themselves as a provider, but they are not required to pay the TPS levy until 1 January when they are registered.


I think that what Senator Rhiannon's amendment does is say, 'You've got to pay the levy when you do not have any students.' But it is not clear how you are going to estimate and reconcile that. The system provides that they start paying the levy when they have students, and I think that that is a fairly sensible proposition.

You are asking us to charge people on the basis of the number of students that they may enrol, but we do not know the number. That is the bottom line, so we do not see that we can agree to the amendment request.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:46):   I thank Senator Rhiannon for her contribution. I do not think there is any disagreement here about the board needing to be representative. We have not actually specified in the bill the cohorts that would be represented, and this amendment, Greens amendment (4), seeks to add one particular group—that is, the ELICOS group—without actually considering the others.


We have not gone for something that is prescriptive—that says that there must be one representative of this and one representative of that. So I cannot support the amendment in its current form, in the sense that it just specifies one group and other groups will say, 'Well, why aren't we specified in the bill?' What I would suggest is that either I am going to have to oppose it and say that this is naturally what we will do, that my intention would be to have a cross-sector representative group, or, having looked at the amendment, I would be happy to support the amendment if the senator was prepared to move it with a full stop at the end of 'sector' and not put 'including providers of English language intensive courses for overseas students'—on the understanding that they, of course, would be one of the groups represented. But under this amendment only one of them is named and the others are not named. So the intent I agree with—that it be broadly representative—and, if the senator is prepared to drop that last bit out of the amendment, I will accept the amendment. That would give her a broad policy intent, which is to have recognised that we need a broader group with a range of experiences. But I do not think we should just name one group that ought to be representative without thinking about the overall balance.


So if the senator is prepared to do that, to put a full stop where the comma is before the last bit, I am prepared to accept the amendment; otherwise, I will have to oppose the amendment.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:49):  Thank you, Senator Rhiannon. The reason I objected to the last part of your original amendment is that we have not done that consideration and I was not able to be clear yet which groups ought to be represented—so I did not want to do that on that run. Clearly, your amendment, which will now become part of the bill and hopefully the act, provides for people having 'qualifications or experience relevant to the operations of providers from across the international education and training sector'. So it will be representative of the various sections across that—obviously, university, VET, private and public—but I do not want to try on the run to define those things.


I can give you an assurance that someone with experience in the ELICOS area would need to be part of that, and we will work our way through the group. But, clearly, by the insertion of this clause it has to be representative of the breadth of the sector, and I am quite happy to indicate that ELICOS is an important part of the sector and it will need to be part of that representative group.

Some of these issues were canvassed in the discussion that we had when we considered Senator Xenophon's amendment. The Greens have taken a somewhat different approach but it does deal with the same issue, which is largely about accommodation costs that international students incur when they are in our country.





The Greens do believe that this should be a key aspect of 
these
 bill
s
. What we are dealing with here is protection of overseas students to ensure their unexpended tuition fees are available for refund should their education provider default on course provision. 
W
e are arguing that the protection does need to go further, because there is nothing in these bills to protect students when they pay other upfront substantial fees, such as accommodation fees to pro
viders—and that does happen. The
s
e
 can disappear if there is a shonky provider. There have been examples of that—and, sadly, we know there will be further examples. A key issue here is that there needs to be some measure of protection in this legislation.





We 
propose
 amending the 
bill
 to afford prepaid accommodation fees the same protection as tuition fees. That is the question that the minister does need to answer here. Except for our item 11, where providers can draw down below the protected amount in order to make advance payments to accommodation suppliers
,
 and may do so before a course commences, that protection does need to be in place.





I would put to senators that 
these amendments recognise
 the reality of paying upfront accommodation bonds and rent while ensuring the money is used only for 
accommodation, which is what the student has paid for. Again, the essence of this is about protecting the upfront money students have paid—in this case, in the main for accommodation.

f we are willing to put protection in place for tuition fees, why do we not give greater certainty and confidence to students who come here? As Senator Xenophon said, so many families 
make
 enormous sacrifice
s
 for their children and their loved ones to come and study in this country.


Surely we need to be rebuilding the reputation of our education services. At the moment, this legislation goes 
only 
part of the way to achieving that. If this protection is not put in place, it again suggests that the providers are having too much say 
in
 how this government brings forward legislation.





I would very much like to hear from the minister. Obviously I hope that the government will support these amendments. From previous comments made by Senator Feeney before Senator Evans arrived, it was set out that the issue of accommodation costs would not be picked up in the 
legislation
. 
W
hy have we got two ways of handling the issue between tuition costs and accommodation costs if that is the way that the government is going to go?





Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:55):  I think the first thing to say, Senator Rhiannon, is that this is a policy response to the concerns about protection of tuition fees. That is the first answer. The second answer is: as I understand it, the issues you raise have not been raised in the debate around the 
bills


in the committee inquiry,


s
o I have been quite surprised by Senator Xenophon
's
 and your focus on this.
 These are not issues that have been raised with me in recent times. It is of course factually the case that while there are some people who accept 
accommodation packages as part of the student's tuition and enrolment processes, the majority do not. This is not an issue that has been at the forefront of anyone's attention in recent times. We did, I understand, have one bad case where a provider with those sorts of arrangements in place did become insolvent.



This is not an issue that has been consulted on. We have had a consultative process with people and we have had the committee inquiry. We would now be saying, 'By the way, we are going to add in this major change to the legislation.' Normally people say to me, 'You have not consulted enough,' but if the parliament is going to say, 'Throw this in the mix as well' and 'By the way, it is also going to pick up those issues,' I think that is not a good way to do business. Secondly, the financial implications of this have not been costed. I do not know what this would cost the Commonwealth. I think this is not the appropriate response to a problem which you say exists but which has not been generally talked about nor generated concern.


I am obviously concerned that we get the best system we can in place. This is the last of a whole set of reforms responding to the Baird review and the terrible situation that developed in the international student area a couple of years ago. As you know, as immigration minister at the time I took a keen interest in these issues, because I think a lot of bad practice had developed with a small number of providers. We have done our best to clean it up both from the immigration end and the education end. I think things are vastly improved, but we have got to constantly be vigilant about these issues; because, as I said earlier, this is about 'brand Australia'. Every time there is a bad student experience it impacts on all providers and on Australia's international reputation. So as well as the impact on the student there is the impact on the international education sector.


One of the things we have done is to set up the Chaney committee, which is reviewing the international education sector to make sure we have got a more holistic view of how that sector is managed, of government's engagement with the sector and where we see that sector going in the longer term. It is a very large industry; it is a huge export earner for Australia, and we have never thought about it in those terms. I think that the rapid growth without any structure around the actual industry led to some of the problems we have seen. Hopefully the Chaney report will give us that context. I understand that Senator Feeney, on my behalf, gave an assurance about reviewing the impact of the issues around accommodation that you raise. I am happy to do that. If there is a genuine problem, we will address it. I indicated that I am happy to address any issue that is there, but this is not something that has been raised with me. It is not something that was raised beyond the Baird process or in the committee inquiry. So I am not inclined to say, on the run, that we ought to do this without consulting anybody—without clear evidence of a problem or what you suggest is the solution. I am happy to take the issue seriously and to see what we can do to analyse if there is a problem, what is the problem, and what might be a policy response. We will put the assurances we gave in place, and obviously I will find a mechanism for reporting back to the Senate about how that is going. If there is a problem, I am happy to address it.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:01):  Firstly, I indicate my support for this amendment. Whilst it is quite a different approach to the approach in my amendment it still covers the same principle, in a sense; that is, what do you do in circumstances that go beyond where there is a loss of accommodation expenses, particularly prepaid expenses? I understand the government's position, and that was also traversed in my amendment with Senator Feeney, but my question to the minister is, is there any scope at the moment in this bill to cover a loss that a student may sustain as a result of prepaid accommodation expenses? In other words, is there any capacity for that student, who has paid accommodation upfront in addition to tuition fees, to receive some form of recompense or compensation?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,26,2
"Evans, Sen Christopher",ALP,2012-02-29,"



Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:02):  The answer is no. It is not designed to pick up accommodation, air fares, medical expenses or any of the range of other expenses a student might incur in coming to Australia. It is designed as a tuition payments protection scheme. It does not pick those other matters up.


It is the case, though, that we have the capacity to make some decisions about a particular provider based on risk. That potential is there. One could conceivably make a decision that a particular provider or set of providers should not be accepting payment for accommodation because they are seen as being of risk, but I am not sure how successful or appropriate that would be. I am not suggesting it as a policy response, just that there is some capacity there. But no, the bill is not designed to pick up this question of accommodation.


As I said, it has not been raised with me in recent times and it has not been raised as part of the committee process, so it has come as a bit of a surprise to me that there is so much focus on it. I am happy to go out there and see how big the problem is. I have no idea, for instance, how many providers actually provide accommodation packages as part of that provision. I have no idea how many people have been affected in the past. It raises the question of what happens if someone then transfers to another provider. There is a whole lot about this proposition that you and the Greens are advancing that, quite frankly, I do not think we know enough about. I am unwilling to accept amendments when no-one has raised it with me and no-one has provided any evidence in recent times about this issue. I just do not think we have the factual understanding to move to implementing legislation regarding the issues being raised. As I have given an undertaking to do the review, if Senator Xenophon, Senator Rhiannon or anyone else has issues, examples or experiences they want to bring to our attention I would be happy to receive them, because that would give us some context.

 (South Australia) (19:04):  I appreciate the minister's undertaking to look at this, but I think it is fair to say that it is not as though this matter is one that has come as a total surprise. When part of this tranche of bills was dealt with a year or two ago there was an amendment about the minister's discretion to deal with issues, which Senator Hanson-Young co-sponsored with me. It is not as though it has come entirely out of the blue, but I understand what the minister has said, and I agree with him about the Baird review process.


The intention for this amendment, as with my amendment, Senator Rhiannon's amendment and the Australian Greens' amendment, is to give a higher degree of certainty and comfort to overseas students in the event that something goes wrong. We cannot take it any further, but I can indicate again my support for this amendment.

 (Queensland) (19:05):  I assure both Senator Rhiannon and Senator Xenophon that the opposition is not opposing either of their amendments this evening reflexively—not at all. We are not doing it on behalf of education providers or anyone else. It comes down to balancing the regulatory and financial burden that providers would suffer versus the consequential projections for students and, indeed, the uncertainty of how much it would cost, and what the cost impost would be on providers.


It is really a matter of us not having the information. It is certainly fair to say that the proposal by Senator Rhiannon on behalf of the Greens is an extension of an insurance scheme for fees that is not provided in other, similar contexts. For that reason, the opposition will not be supporting this amendment.

   Limit on when remaining tuition fees may be required






(3) Once an overseas student begins a course, the registered provider for the course must not require any of the remaining tuition fees for the course to be paid, in respect of the overseas student, more than 2 weeks before the beginning of the student's second study period for the course.



This amendment is to do with the limit on when remaining tuition fees may be required. We think this will clarify the legislative drafting on prepaid fees. It is an issue that was raised with us, and we are seeking to address it. It provides that up to 50 per cent of total course fees, or 100 per cent for a course of 24 weeks or less, can be paid upfront at any time before the course commences. Once a student has begun a course, the provider cannot require the student to pay any further tuition fees more than two weeks prior to the second study period. If a student chooses to pay earlier, there is no requirement for the provider to return the tuition fees to the student and they would not be found non-compliant. This will protect the interests of students and reduce refunds flowing to the TPS without imposing unworkable requirements on providers.


The changes will give greater clarity to the sector in understanding their obligations. There was concern raised about how clear this was in the legislation. This is designed to give that clarity and to reassure people of what their obligations are. So it is just a response to feedback we have had from people with an interest. There is no change to the rules, as it were; it is just to make it clear.

      (ii)   for a provider who is not yet registered—the likely total enrolments for the provider for the year (assuming the provider becomes registered).


These amendments are framed as requests because they are to a bill which imposes taxation within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution. The Senate may not amend a bill imposing taxation.


As this is a bill imposing taxation within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution, any Senate amendment to the bill must be moved as a request. This is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate.




Senator RHIANNON:
  These amendments deal with a failure in the legislation to bring new providers into the TPS levy. What we have right now is a system where new providers are effectively exempt, and that really is a major anomaly for legislation that is supposedly bringing in a tighter regulatory framework for how this industry operates. 


I put it to my fellow senators that these amendments are essential. New providers really are at greater risk of defaulting, leaving students high and dry. How this works is that the administrative fees we are dealing with here are set at $100 plus $2 per enrolment for the previous year. The base fees are set at $200 plus $5 per enrolment for the previous year. But when it comes to new providers, clearly there is not a previous year. So what is happening is that they are being left out. How the system works is that new providers seeking registration are in effect exempt from the $2 and $5 per student components because they do not have a prior history of enrolments. You would have to say this is an absurd contradiction in risk assessment terms. Again, I would be interested to hear from the minister. How did they miss this out? Surely it can be easily solved—and that is what our amendments attempt to do.


As I understand it, new providers must already provide projected domestic and overseas student numbers with their application for CRICOS registration. So our amendment to this bill would ensure that new providers are also charged per student using their projected likely total enrolments to complete the calculation. So it really can be sorted out quite easily. It is a serious anomaly; it leaves out new providers. We all know that, when businesses first get going, it is more likely that they will default, that they will in some way fold. We also know that these new providers have to put forward their likely total enrolments. So let us use that to bring them into the current system with regard to the setting of administration fees. I look forward to the minister's comments about this, because surely it is an anomaly that needs to be fixed up.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:14): The government cannot support this request for amendment. I think I understand what Senator Rhiannon is trying to do, but we are not able to support it. This amendment effectively puts a cost on providers before they have registered or have any enrolments, and somehow we have to estimate how many enrolments they are going to get and reconcile that. I am not quite sure what Senator Rhiannon would be trying to achieve by this amendment.


We do require new entrants to the market to pay a $7,500 entry fee as part of their registration process, but we do not require them to pay the TPS levy until they are effectively enrolling students. That is the logic of it—they have to get registered by following the normal processes to provide assurance about themselves as a provider, but they are not required to pay the TPS levy until 1 January when they are registered.


I think that what Senator Rhiannon's amendment does is say, 'You've got to pay the levy when you do not have any students.' But it is not clear how you are going to estimate and reconcile that. The system provides that they start paying the levy when they have students, and I think that that is a fairly sensible proposition.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (19:21):  I rise this evening on adjournment to speak about some of the fantastic activities happening in the electorate of Denison supported by the Gillard Labor government. King George V Oval—or KGV as it is fondly known by Tasmanians—is home to local AFL team, the Glenorchy Magpies. The Magpies receive a huge amount of support from the local community, with thousands of people braving all kinds of weather to support their team. This is a place that is the hub for the sporting community in Glenorchy. Thanks to the Gillard Labor government, change is afoot and a redevelopment of this important community hub will commence later this year.


We are investing $8.7 million in this important redevelopment which will result in a significant rejuvenation in the municipality of Glenorchy. The redevelopment includes health and wellness centres, including a hydrotherapy pool. It also includes a sports house and upgrades to the Glenorchy District Football Club facilities; a theatrette, a meeting room and training room; function rooms, including bar and bistro; cafe and commercial kitchen; changing rooms; kiosk and public amenities; transport museum shed; refurbished cricket training nets; multipurpose synthetic spots pitch; and a new pedestrian entrance and landscaping. 


The new KGV precinct will also offer a new home to the Migrant Resource Centre. The Migrant Resource Centre is such a key service provider for migrants and refugees in Tasmania that it has outgrown its Hobart premises. Under the CEO, Cedric Mannen, and staff, the Migrant Resource Centre is a vibrant place and, with a base in the Glenorchy municipality where many migrants settle, I am sure the influence and value of the Migrant Resource Centre will only increase


Importantly, the King George V redevelopment complex will be open to all. I know the community will embrace the opportunity to make use of these first-class facilities. This important redevelopment, made possible thanks to the Gillard Labor government, will add another place for the community to gather, to participate in sport and wellbeing—be it playing, supporting, celebrating or even meeting. I look forward to joining the community at the redeveloped KGV precinct, cheering on the Glenorchy Magpies, as well as seeing the great benefits of the other new facilities that will be open to all ages in Glenorchy's broader community. I thank those members of the community who have worked and lobbied to make this become a reality.


Another exciting initiative taking place in the municipality is the Glenorchy on the Go project. This program is run by the Glenorchy City Council, thanks to a $700,000 grant delivered by the Gillard Labor government under the Healthy Communities Initiative. Glenorchy on the Go is about improving the health and wellbeing of the people of Glenorchy. Glenorchy on the Go is a free program which encourages participants to be physically active, teaches them the importance of maintaining a healthy diet, and how best to go about this through cooking classes, walking groups, sports sessions for those with a disability and the development of community gardens.


This program is as much about social interaction as it is about promoting healthy lifestyles. Glenorchy on the Go offers people who may otherwise be isolated within their community an opportunity to seek friendship and improve the quality of their health at the same time. To date, more than 575 people have participated in Glenorchy on the Go programs. Seventy-five per cent of these participants are over the age of 55 and one in seven of them have a disability. Currently Glenorchy on the Go offers 15 walking groups, 10 Heartmoves—a gentle exercise group—and four sessions of sport ability for people with disability. There are also come and try activities such as archery, linedancing and bowls, and chronic health education sessions, which I understand will commence in March. I want to make special mention and commend the work of the Heart Foundation for their involvement in this project as they run the walking groups taking place around the Glenorchy municipality.


I was fortunate to attend the launch of Glenorchy on the Go. The community turned out in force. Together we spent about 10 minutes being put through our paces with some fun exercises and interactive movements. It was wonderful to hear the stories of those who have been involved with Glenorchy on the Go since its inception and to hear how people's energy levels have increased. I have also met with program coordinator, Elisa Ryan, and project manager, Len Yeats. Their enthusiasm is boundless. I have no doubt that this program will continue to build momentum and change lives, thanks to the passion of all those involved and the funding they received.


I want to acknowledge the work and dedication of former senator Margaret Reynolds, especially in her role as state director of National Disability Services, a post that she has recently moved on from. Margaret is well known in this place, having served as a Labor senator for Queensland from 1983 to 1999. Margaret served as the Minister for Local Government and also as the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. History shows that Margaret made a valuable contribution during her time in this place and the Senate's loss has been Tasmania's gain as Margaret has now returned to her home state.


In the 13 years since Margaret left this place, she has worked on many projects. In East Timor, Fiji and Africa she worked to give women an understanding of decision-making at local, national and international levels. In Australia, Margaret engaged with young people, encouraging them to engage with our democracy and to be active and involved with the political process, particularly through Youth Parliament. Margaret was President of the United Nations Association of Australia at a time when the international community were struggling to understand why Australia needed to send what was considered a small number of asylum seekers to isolated detention centres.


I had the privilege of serving on the National Council for the United Nations Association of Australia with Margaret and also at a local level in the Tasmanian branch of the UNAA. I also served under Margaret's chairing of the Tasmanian Women's Council to help improve access and equality for women in Tasmania. Margaret has also written two books. Margaret gave me a copy of her book The last bastion for my 30th birthday, now some 10 years ago, before I entered state parliament. It was a great read about the challenges facing women in political life and gave me a good understanding of the challenges which lay ahead for me. I have regarded Margaret as a mentor and a friend. She has certainly inspired me to want to be in this place, and if I can make the kind of contribution she made in this place then I would certainly have achieved a great deal.


In 2004, Margaret accepted a position with National Disability Services, Australia's peak body representing disability service providers, and she retired from this role just last week. Through hard work, Margaret and her colleagues across Tasmania and Australia put disability services firmly on the political agenda. She began this role at a time when mental institutions were closing in a bid to give intellectually disabled people the opportunity to live in their community, yet little money was directed towards supporting this endeavour. Margaret retires at a time when disability reform is firmly on the government's agenda—with the National Disability Insurance Scheme set to become a reality under the Gillard Labor government.


Margaret will continue her contribution to the Australian community as chair of the Australian Centre of Excellence in Local Government. She will also build upon her good work in disability reform as a member of the National People with Disability and Carers Council. I wish Margaret well and thank her very much for what I know will be an ongoing contribution to the Australian community.
