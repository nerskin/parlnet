"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-09-21,"—by leave—I move:
That on Tuesday, 21 September 1999, the routine of business be varied to provide that the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall not be proposed till after the conclusion of consideration of the motion on East Timor, or a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister.
I might just state that it is clear from the speakers list that the current debate before the chamber on Australia's involvement in East Timor would not be concluded by 10 or 11 o'clock tonight if senators take up an average amount of time. The Senate is due to adjourn somewhere after 6.50 this evening. We have had discussions with senators around the chamber to ensure that the debate can continue into this evening. I have sent a letter around. Senator Brown would not have re 
 ceived his as yet, but there have been discussions with Senator Brown.
The Senate will sit tonight but it will be on the basis that there be no divisions and no quorums. It would mean that senators who have other engagements—bearing in mind the Senate would not normally sit tonight, that is understandable—will not need to be in the chamber. I understand that the motion will be put and concluded tonight. It will be able to be voted on and there should not need to be a division. It should be carried on the voices. I believe that is everyone's understanding. That is the government's intention: no divisions and no quorums after 6.50 this evening, to allow any senator who wishes to speak on this debate to do so, and for the debate to be concluded tonight.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-09-21,"—The opposition supports the motion as moved by the Manager of Government Business on the basis he has outlined—that is, no quorums and no divisions after 6.50 tonight. The calculation of time that he has made for the consideration of what is obviously an extremely important matter for the entire Australian community is that at about 2.30 tomorrow morning we may conclude this matter, if everyone takes their 20 minutes and if there are no further senators who wish to add their names to the speakers list.
It is obviously a matter that will take considerable time and it is our view that, on a no quorums, no divisions basis, this matter should be put tonight. It is our understanding that that is the government's intention and there will not be a division on the matter itself at the conclusion of this debate. On that basis, we are happy to support the motion.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-09-21,"—Tonight I rise to declare my 
 formal position on the issue of Australia becoming a republic. I entered the Senate eight years ago as a constitutional monarchist and stand here tonight as a republican. My journey over this time parallels that of many of my colleagues. In the federal parliamentary Liberal Party at present, the balance between the constitutional monarchists and the republicans stands at about fifty-fifty. This is a major shift in Liberal Party sentiment.
It was only five years ago that the Young Liberals in Sydney had the temerity to suggest to the state council of the party that they should debate the proposition that Australia become a republic—just debate it. The motion created uproar. A mere five years later, such a suggestion would be considered passe.
Leading the debate in the councils of the Liberal Party at that time was Marise Payne. Three years before entering the Senate, Marise Payne stuck to her principles as a member of the Australian Republican Movement and eloquently backed the then unpopular cause of the republic in the councils of the Liberal Party at that time. Tonight I pay tribute to her personal and political courage. With a Senate preselection imminent, it was—to quote Yes, Minister—a `courageous stand'.
But, tonight, Senator Payne's stand is not radical. Many Liberals have been won over to the republican cause by the sheer weight of the argument—people like Marie Wood, former President of the Women's Council of the Liberal Party, who would have called herself a conservative. At that time, she and I accepted the traditional monarchist argument that `if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.
Of course, our current system of government has served us very well to this point in our political evolution. But as we stand at the beginning of the new century it is time to move on, just as we decided 100 years ago that it was time to move on when we formed the Australian Federation. At that time, Australia was seen as a laboratory for democratic reform. Back then, a growing number of people began to see themselves as liberal democrats, people who rejected tyranny of all kinds—particularly hierarchy and privilege. Indeed, before Federation, in this laboratory we had created for democratic reform, Aus 
 tralia had already achieved secret ballots, universal male voting and the abolition of property qualifications of MPs—all things that we take for granted now but which at the time were considered quite progressive.
When we adopted an Australian federation in 1901 under the aegis of the British Empire, we also adapted the British Westminster system of democratic government. This also brought with it for Australia the considerable economic benefits of our special trading arrangements with the British Empire. But during this century our formal ties with Britain have slowly faded. Special trading arrangements ended in 1962 when Britain entered the European Economic Community. In 1971 Britain shut down its defence presence east of Suez. God Save the Queen was replaced by Advance Australia Fair in 1984. And appeals to the Privy Council formally ended with the passage of the Australia Act in 1986. Now, as we stand on the edge of a new century, the ties to our former colonial master are purely symbolic.
Just as we grasped change at the end of the l9th century, it is now time, at the end of the 20th century, to move on. Now it is time to take the next step in our political evolution. If our symbolic ties to the British monarchy serve no useful economic, political or strategic value, why keep them and create an impression in the rest of the world that Australia is not a truly independent nation?
This point was brought home to me very starkly during a luncheon in honour of the United States President, Bill Clinton, in 1997 in parliament's Great Hall. Like many of my colleagues, I crossed the Rubicon between the constitutional monarchy and the republic at the point of toasts offered by the Prime Minister and the US President. Mr Howard toasted the President of the United States. Mr Clinton toasted Queen Elizabeth II. The protocol was impeccable but the exchange seemed totally bizarre to many observers.
It is time to move on and to become a truly independent nation in reality and perception.
It is time for an Australian republic. We have spent most of the 1990s debating what shape a republic would take. The proposed republic represents a small evolutionary step, much smaller than the step we took in 1901.
It is unfortunate that such a reasonable proposition has been subjected to such a smear campaign by some of the pro status quo mob. Terms like ethnic cleansing and appeasers, invoking the images of the German Weimar Republic before the rise of Hitler and talk of a possible coup have no place in this debate. Such a campaign has been branded as inflammatory, unnecessary and irrational.
As the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, has pointed out, what is proposed is a small but very important change for Australia. The model is home grown. The proposal does not affect the present powers in the Constitution. It would not give the President more powers than or different powers from the Queen's representative in Australia, the Governor-General. We are assured of this by the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, former Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowan and two former High Court chief justices, Sir Anthony Mason and Sir Gerard Brennan.
Surely this is an evolutionary improvement—a less capricious selection of a head of state while maintaining the rest of our political system with all its checks and balances. We will keep our two houses of parliament, our Prime Minister, our legal system, our Constitution, our flag and our membership of the British Commonwealth. Let us seize this historic opportunity to have a head of state chosen on merit, not by privilege of birth—an Australian President who represents our unique Australian identity as we face the new millennium, someone who will proudly promote Australia and our interests first, someone who is one of us. I urge all my colleagues to support the yes case for an Australian republic at the November referendum. A republic will deliver a fully independent Australia in perception and reality.
