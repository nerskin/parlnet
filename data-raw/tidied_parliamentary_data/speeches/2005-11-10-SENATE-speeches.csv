Australian Passports Determination 2005 and Foreign Passports Determination 2005

11 August 2005
The Hon Bruce Billson MP
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Suite R2.85
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Parliamentary Secretary

I refer to the following Determinations made under section 57 of the Australian Passports Act 2005 and section 8 of the Australian Passports (Application Fees) Act 2005 and section 24 of the Passports Act 1938 respectively

Australian Passports Determination 2005

The Committee raises the following matters concerning this Determination.
First, subsection 2.1(3) lists the special circumstances in which the Minister may issue a passport to a child even though a person with parental responsibility for the child has not given consent to the child travelling internationally. Paragraph 2.1(3)(g) specifies the issue of a family violence order, as defined under Part VII of the Family Law Act 1975, against the non-consenting parent as one such special circumstance. The definition of ‘family violence order’ under the Family Law Act includes interim orders (see section 60D(1)). An interim order may be issued without evidence and in the absence of the party accused of violence. The Committee seeks your advice on whether it is intended that a passport may be issued to a child in such circumstances and, if so, whether a passport that is issued on the basis of an interim family violence order may be cancelled if the interim order is not subsequently confirmed.

Secondly, section 17 of the 
Legislative Instruments Act 2003
 directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business. Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate. The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken. The Explanatory Statement that accompanies this Determination, though detailed, makes no reference to consultation. The Committee therefore seeks your advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation. The Committee also seeks an assurance that future explanatory statements will provide information on consultation as required by the Legislative Instruments Act.

Dear Senator Watson


Thank you for your letter dated 11 August 2005 seeking advice on Determinations made under section 57 of the 
Australian Passports Act 2005
 and section 8 of the 
Australian Passports (Application Fees) Act 2005
. I apologise for the delay in replying.


Australian Passports Determination 2005


Each application to issue a passport to a child in accordance with paragraph 2.1(3) (g) of the Australian Passports Determination 2005 would be considered on an individual basis, and this includes interim orders. Passport issue would also be determined in accordance with paragraph 2.1(2).


A passport issued under 2.1(3) (g), on the basis of an interim family violence order that was not subsequently confirmed, would not be automatically cancelled. However, consideration may be given to cancellation of the passport in accordance with Section 22(2) (e) of the 
Australian Passports Act 2005
.


Public consultations were undertaken with interested groups prior to the introduction of the Australian Passports Bill into Parliament to ensure the revised legislation met the needs of Australian passport holders. This process involved the setting up of a Passport Legislation Consultative Group to allow key stakeholders to be briefed on the proposed legislation and comment on the changes. Participants of the group were drawn from privacy, human rights, consumer, family law, police and citizenship groups and from travel, financial and biometrics industries with ex officio participation by the Privacy Commissioner.


The first of three meetings was held in Canberra on 23 February 2004. Public meetings were also arranged in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra to allow members of the public the opportunity to comment on the revised legislation. Written submissions were also sought from interested members of the public. Proposals from these consultations were fed directly into the drafting of the bill.


Details on the level of consultation undertaken on legislative changes will be included in explanatory statements in future.

Dear Mr Chairman


I refer to your letter of 15 September 2005 to the Senator the Hon Chris Ellison, Minister for Justice and Customs, requesting details of the nature of the consultations carried out in relation to the 
Australian Passports Act 2005
 and the 
Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2005.


Public consultations were undertaken with interested groups prior to the introduction of the Australian Passports Bill into parliament to ensure the revised legislation met the needs of Australian passport holders.

Written submissions were also sought from interested members of the public. Proposals from these consultations were fed directly into the drafting of the bill.


The seizure powers introduced under the 
Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2005
 were not covered by the public consultation arrangements due to the timeframe set by ASIO for this legislation to be introduced into Parliament.


Details on the level of consultation undertaken on legislative changes will be included in explanatory statements in future.


Thank you for your enquiry.

Public Accounts and Audit Committee Regulations 2005, Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 127

Senator the Hon Nick Minchin

Suite M1.49
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

I refer to the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Regulations 2005, Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 127.
Schedule 1 to these Regulations specifies the fees payable to witnesses appearing before the Public Accounts and Audit Committee. The Committee notes that Items 1 and 2 in this Schedule specify a fee “for each day on which the witness appears”. It is not clear what, if any, fee is payable if a witness appears for only part of a day.
The Committee would appreciate your clarification on this matter as soon as possible, but before 2 September 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear John
Thank you for your letter of 11 August 2005 in relation to the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Regulations 2005, Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 127 (the Regulations).
As the Explanatory Statement to the Regulations states, the Regulations repeal and replace the former Public Accounts Committee Regulations (the former Regulations). Both sets of Regulations set out the scale of fees and travelling expenses for witnesses appearing before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA). However, the former Regulations contained an outdated reference to the title of the JCPAA’s Act, several instances of non-gender-neutral language and an ambiguous reference to the High Court Rules. The Regulations clarify these references. The JCPAA was consulted regarding the Regulations.
You have requested my clarification in relation to Items 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations. These Items specify a fee “for each day on which the witness appears” but does not state what, if any, fee is payable if a witness appears for only part of a day.
As was the case under the former Regulations, the fees payable under these Items are linked to the High Court Rules. The Registry of the High Court of Australia has advised my Department that, where such fees are payable, the full daily fee would be paid for each day’s appearance, including part days. That is, if a witness appeared for one and a half days, two days’ fees would be paid.
It is proper to follow the High Court’s approach in relation to the administration of those fees linked to the High Court Rules in the Regulations. That is, a witness appearing before the JCPAA, who is to be paid a fee in accordance with Item 1 or 2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, should be paid the full day’s fee, even where that witness appears for only part of a day.
The Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing in the Attorney-General’s Department has confirmed to my Department that this approach is an appropriate incorporation of the High Court Rules.
I have provided a copy of this letter to Mr Bob Baldwin MP, JCPAA Chair.
Yours sincerely
Nick Minchin

Health Insurance (Obstetric Item 15999) Determination HS/02/2005

8 September 2005
The Hon Tony Abbott MP
Minister for Health and Ageing
Suite MG.43
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

I refer to the Health Insurance (Obstetric Item 15999) Determination HS/02/2005 made under subsection 3C(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973.
This Determination is expressed to apply until 31 October 2005. The Committee notes that it revokes and replaces a previous determination (HS/09/2004) that would cease to have effect on 2 September 2005. The Explanatory Statement does not give a sufficient explanation as to why it is necessary to, in effect, extend the operation of the previous Determination for 2 months. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice on the reasons for extending the cessation date.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 30 September 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson
Thank you for your letter of 8 September 2005 regarding the Health Insurance (Obstetric Item 15999) Determination HS/02/2005 made under subsection 3C(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973. I apologise for any confusion that the Explanatory Statement to this Determination may have caused.
By way of information, the purpose of Determination (HS/09/2004) was to introduce Medicare coverage for the planning and management of pregnancies that progress beyond 20 weeks. It was always the Department’s intention to move this service from the Determination into the General Medical Services Table (GMST) which will occur for the 1 November 2005 update of the Medicare Benefits Schedule.
As you are aware the current Determination (HS/09/2004) ceased to have effect on 2 September 2005, so the purpose of the new Determination (HS/02/2005) is to allow for benefits to be payable between 2 September 2005 and 31 October 2005, prior to the 1 November 2005 GMST taking effect. This will ensure continued coverage for all patients and a seamless transition from the Determination into the GMST.
I trust that this information is of assistance.
Yours sincerely

Variation to Licence Area Plan for Scottsdale Radio—No. 1 of 2005

8 September 2005
Senator the Hon Helen Coonan
Minister for Communications, Information
Technology and the Arts
Suite MG.70
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

I refer to the Variation to Licence Area Plan for Scottsdale Radio —No. 1 of 2005 made under subsection 26(2) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, varies the characteristics of the technical specification with which services in the Scottsdale Area of Tasmania area must comply. This Instrument is dated 5 August 2005.
The Committee notes that the opening paragraph to the Instrument, and the Explanatory Statement, each state that the Variation was made by the Australian Communications and Media Authority on 4 August 2005. The Instrument does not contain a commencement clause that specifies a day or time for commencement. Accordingly it appears that paragraph 12(1)(d) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 applies; that is, the Instrument is taken to have commenced on the day after it is registered. If, on the other hand, it is intended that the Instrument commenced on 4 August, there is no assurance in the Explanatory Statement that the retrospective commencement does not adversely affect the rights of persons other than the Commonwealth. The Committee therefore seeks clarification of the commencement date of this Instrument.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 30 September 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Request for advice on Licence Area Plan Variation for Scottsdale Radio
Thank you for your letter of 8 September 2005 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances seeking clarification of the intended date of commencement of licence area plan (LAP) variations.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has confirmed that in accordance with paragraph 12(1)(d) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, each LAP variation is taken to have commenced on the day after it is registered.
Accordingly, there is no retrospective commencement as noted in the Standing Committee’s letter and I am advised by ACMA that the rights of persons other than the Commonwealth are not adversely affected.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-11-10,"—It is with great concern that I stand to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005, because it is another piece of legislation in a raft of legislation from the Howard government that represents a direct attack on working people in Australia. What we have before us is effectively a piece of blackmail. This piece of blackmail says to universities in this country: ‘We’re not going to allow you to govern yourselves with an appropriate array of corporate governance rules applying. We’re going to set conditions on how you employ your staff.’ This level of microintervention into the management of universities is being done for one reason only. The reason is that the Howard government is seeking to impose its Australian workplace agreements on the employees of universities right around the country.
It is very clear from the actions of universities to date that this is unwelcome. If it were welcome, or indeed had any semblance of business sense, I am sure that a different response would have been received from the vice-chancellors and the university staff. The bottom line is that this is not good for Australia’s universities. It will force upon the management of our universities a new system of employment that disfranchises directly the pay and conditions of academic staff, support staff and general staff and impose on the management a regime that they do not want. It does not make sense in terms of permitting universities to do what the Howard government thinks they should be doing—as we have heard in general policy announcements—which is competing effectively in what is a global education market. How can they, when they are not even permitted to make choices about how they pay their staff and apply minimum wages, conditions, awards and collective agreements that are now well established?
The problem the Howard government has is that it does not understand and chooses to reject the notion that employers and employees—in this case we are talking about universities and university staff—are capable of coming to a reasonable agreement. We have a century’s worth of history behind the development of awards and collective agreements in this country. We have come to a point now where this dictatorial approach effectively blackmails universities into adopting these conditions. Make no mistake about this level of blackmail, either: if they do not comply by 31 August, the universities will not get the funding they need to survive. But the Howard government does not care about that. It is prepared to throw away the history, culture and good practice that have existed all the way through, culminating in the way in which university staff and university management sort out their wages and conditions.
You cannot look at this legislation outside the context of the IR legislation that is being debated in the other place. Just a few days ago we deliberated over the abandonment, the abolition, of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. We had many pieces of legislation prior to 1 July this year—some got through this place but most did not—that constituted an ideological raid on good practice in industrial relations over many years. I say ‘good practice over many years’ because for over a century Australia had a system of industrial relations that was enshrined in our Constitution, that was given form and substance with the 1904 Conciliation and Arbitration Act and then, through a large number of struggles by unions, reactive campaigns by employers and arbitrated decisions culminating in awards, led to a system that is unique and was unique for all of that time.
Even under previous Liberal governments the strength of our industrial relations system in this country was acknowledged. That was until we got the Howard government, until the Howard government came along, full of ideologues. They seem to have cleaned out all the wets, following the 1993 loss by the Liberals in the federal election. All these ideologues ran ultra right-wing campaigns through the eighties, through the Labor government’s good management of industrial relations and the economy. We found most of them were elected in 1996. Those who were not elected managed to find their way in here soon afterwards. So the same group of people who constitute the bulk of the Cabinet Office under the Howard government were the group of ideologues who were the first to emerge in the Australian political system and who had any power at all in the Liberal Party through the late eighties and the early nineties.
It is that ideological campaign that has been unleashed with full force in the federal parliament since 1 July, when the coalition government got the majority in the Senate. Now we are experiencing a campaign in a very old ideological battle—an ideological battle that perhaps was started back with the Harvester case, with HR Nicholls running what can only be described as an out-of-this-world campaign against the reality of life in Australia in the earlier part of the previous century. That person has become the icon of the conservative Right in this country. People worship HR Nicholls, who opposed a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay. That is what they were fighting against; that is what HR Nicholls was taking on. HR Nicholls has become the icon now, so much so that it would be very interesting to see just who on the front bench of the coalition is still a paid-up member of the HR Nicholls Society.
The HR Nicholls Society was very active during the 1980s, when the Liberal Party were completely out of their depth in making any impact on the then Labor federal government. Having those same ideologues cutting loose with this agenda is going to do untold damage to Australian working people and to the Australian economy and will take away this unique system we have of resolving industrial relations disputes and effectively managing fairness in Australian workplaces. A system that was enshrined through the federal power in the Constitution to resolve disputes across state borders, and further codified in the 1904 Conciliation and Arbitration Act.
Where does that leave us? We have a gagged debate in the other place and industrial relations laws that are so far departed from what we have always understood to be a system for managing fairness in the workplace that it is hard to predict what the impact will be. Having come from the building industry—I am sure my Senate colleagues are aware of that; if they were not aware of it they now are—I know that how these changes will manifest themselves at the grassroots in industries like the building industry is going to be devastating. As I said the other day, as a former organiser of the Building Workers Industrial Union, I know that, with the loss of the ability and power of unions to have access to workplace sites, safety standards will drop. Employers and employees alike relied on the resources of the trade unions in that industry to play that watchdog role in occupational health and safety standards and to reassure both parties that work practices were safe and that people’s lives and health were protected.
One of the upshots of this ideological attack on unions and union bashing that we have seen so consistently from the Howard government—using whatever powers they could before they got the numbers in the Senate and certainly completely unleashed now to disfranchise unions and to deprive them of their rights and powers and to deprive workers of the right to collectively organise—will be a reduction in health and safety standards in workplaces around Australia. There cannot be any other outcome because of the practical way these workplaces function.
I have particular experience in the building and construction industry but I know that it is exactly the same in many other areas. The role that the unions have played in the development of standards and of codes of practice and the information and intelligence they are able to feed into the development of those codes of practice and health and safety standards has been absolutely critical in the attempt to reduce workplace illness, accident and death in Australia. We do not have such a good record in this regard because we have a lot of dangerous industries. Whether it is mining, agriculture, building and construction or the manufacturing sector—not just physical grades work—many accidents happen in a range of areas. It appals me to think that the government are so mindless in their ideological pursuit of these changes that they are prepared to sacrifice health and safety and ultimately put more people’s lives and health at risk.
Another aspect of the broad attack on unions through the IR changes comes through the dignity of and right to work. The right to collectively bargain is another way in which awards have been able to be perpetuated with particular workplace conditions being taken into account. Without the base of the awards it is very hard to allow those workers who do have a bit of industrial clout—and this has always been an acknowledged pattern—to stand up for those workers who do not. This is one of the great strengths of the award system and indeed the establishment of the minimum wage. Workers around the country took care of each other through the system of collective representation, collective bargaining, arbitrated decisions resulting in awards and ultimately a national wage case being run on the minimum wage. It is essential to the Australian sense of a fair go.
It is interesting to hear a lot of talk about values in this place. All sides of politics talk about values. Values about fairness and opportunity go to the heart of how you manage fairness in the workplace. These industrial relations changes that are taking place have no moral basis whatsoever. They remove what has been a longstanding Australian value: that the strong look after the weak.
Another particularly important area was sharpened in my mind this morning as I listened to the news. Yesterday, we saw Senator Abetz struggle with a very straightforward question on the impact of accumulating a 38-hour week over a period before penalty rates cut in. The answer we could not get was whether that would guarantee people a 38-hour week and not more hours. The government are not giving that guarantee because they cannot. Their new system will allow employers to average 38 hours a week over a whole year. Employees could find themselves working without penalty rates for more than 38 hours per week, provided those core hours are averaged over a whole year and annualised.
What does that mean for workers, particularly young workers? What does that mean for families and what does that mean for the weekend? Mr Howard yesterday said that the concept of the five-day week had to go, or some such comment. It was the unions that brought the weekends to the workers of Australia, as they did in most places around the world where they established the 40-hour week and various penalty rates associated with working beyond that. That was linked to a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay—eight hours sleep, eight hours leisure and eight hours work, and all of those fundamental tenets of what constitutes fairness in the workplace and, indeed, fairness in life.
The Prime Minister was alluding to the concept of having a balance between family time and work time. That is out the window. The Prime Minister of this country is saying that no longer will that principle be applied in this country. The balance between life and work will be now be solely determined by employers. That is one of the gravest changes that will happen with the industrial relations amendments that have been gagged in the House and which, no doubt, we will see here in a few weeks time when the Senate resumes. It will deprive Australian working people of any protection from employers who are, perhaps, bound by law to pursue their shareholders’ interests to maximise every bit of profit and therefore to work their workers for as little money and for as many hours as possible. That is rational corporate behaviour, some would argue. Where does the government get off by removing from this essential balance the federal checks and balances via our industrial relations system, via our awards, via the minimum wage and via protecting conditions of employment? Make no mistake: there is only one group of employers that really understand the core of this change—that is, the big companies that at their heart are bound by the corporate behaviour which the whole system sets up to use their ability to make a return and divest it amongst their shareholders.
Other employers, particularly small business, may find themselves caught up in the ideological campaign that this is about empowering them. But I do not know too many small businesses that employ people that would want to see those lives completely exploited. They will not know how to deal with pressure from companies that can find the means or are able, because they have a complete lack of commitment to their employees’ welfare, to pursue these changes. What happens to the competitive tension between the big and small end of town when you take away these regulated checks and balances on conditions of employment?
We do not quite know how what the government is unleashing will pan out. What will happen to those employers who have a conscience, who want to pay and reward their employees well and who want, heaven forbid, to continue with current rates of pay or, perhaps, a worthy allegiance to an existing collective agreement or award? What will happen to them in the competitive market when they are competing against companies who have thrown those principles away at the behest of the Howard government? It messes with the economy in a way that I think a lot of businesses do not understand. They have not thought about it, because those running the campaign in the business community, who find themselves so closely aligned with the Liberal Party of Australia, are indeed the big end of town.
Ultimately, these changes will hurt workers and their family lives. The point is that if you have to work longer hours in a given working week—perhaps for less pay; perhaps not for less pay until there is a downturn in the economy—what happens to the work-family balance that we all claim to be pursuing? What happens to the principles of getting one’s life in order and being able to spend time with one’s children or elderly folk in the ultimate pursuit of the great nirvana of the 21st century: work-life balance? More than anything else, the Prime Minister’s comments yesterday in relation to this issue expose the fact that work-life balance is no more important to the Howard government than any principle associated with IR has been. This industrial relations legislation is absolutely and fundamentally about work-life balance. That balance, which is so hard fought for and has been for a century now by Australian workers, is directly under threat.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-11-10,"—The Australian Democrats have expressed their concerns about this legislation in its myriad forms over the last couple of years. Both you, Mr Acting Deputy President Murray, and I have made clear, on behalf of the party, the concerns that we have. Most recently, along with opposition senators, we provided a contribution to the Senate committee report that makes clear our recommendation that the legislation in its current form should, for many of the reasons that have been articulated in this debate by other speakers, be rejected.
It is difficult to see this legislation as other than part of the continuing attacks on the sector. As commentators and other speakers in this place have pointed out, it is a twin attack. On the one hand, there is the government’s arguably ideological obsession with workplace relations; on the other hand, there is the government’s ideological agenda in relation to higher education. So it is the worst of all possible worlds.
The legislation in its most basic form requires that all new staff be offered AWAs by the end of this month, November 2005, and that all existing staff be offered AWAs by August of next year. It allows AWAs to override collective agreements through a provision in enterprise agreements. It removes the restriction on fixed term and casual employment from enterprise agreements and—to quote from an NTEU briefing paper—an agreement ‘must not limit management’s capacity to make decisions; for example, having to consult staff and unions’. It enforces the notion that unions can only become involved in an industrial matter if an employee requests it.
We are looking at some fairly bizarre, draconian provisions that largely rely on coercion. Indeed, at the bottom of this is the issue of blackmail and the fact that universities, if they fail to implement these legislative changes, will be short-changed. This legislation will have an impact on their funding and their access to the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, the CGS. More broadly, it will have a deleterious impact on research quality, on teaching practices and on the notion of university and academic life generally—that is, academic and general staff in a general sense. That is something that I have talked about repeatedly in this place—in fact just this week—given that we have dealt with a raft of higher education legislation.
I cannot help but see this legislation in the context of continuing attacks on the sector. This is the seventh bill that we have dealt with that changes the Higher Education Support Act. It is the seventh bill since 2003 and the implementation of that legislation. As I remarked in this place earlier this week when dealing with the budget measures legislation—and, again, not reflecting on a vote of the Senate—that legislation was the sixth fix-it bill in relation to higher education legislation, particularly the Higher Education Support Act. So this is the seventh piece of legislation that we have had to deal with. There will be another bill this afternoon dealing with higher education legislation—and, indeed, there are more to come.
So when it comes to this particular sector and questioning whether it is under attack, there is no doubt. We are dealing with inadequate indexation arrangements. We are dealing with proposals to implement so-called voluntary student unionism, which will emasculate the services and facilities provided for students, be they sporting services, representative services, media services, child-care services, catering services—you name it. We have got unprecedented HECS hikes, deregulation of the postgraduate sector and fees, charges and costs unlike most public university institutions in the industrialised world. We have threats to academic independence as never before—absolute, blatant interference in university autonomy—continual underfunding and now, through this legislation, blackmail of a kind that I am not sure many institutions around the world have been privy to. It is quite an extraordinary precedent for us to set in this country.
So you get the context—to the point where it is becoming boring. I am sick and tired of standing up in this place and having debates about higher education legislation when there is nothing positive. This bill achieves nothing positive. It completely underestimates the modern-day university. It completely underestimates the changes that have gone on in terms of workplace relations within those institutions. It is completely unnecessary. It is sector specific—so it is totally ideologically driven. Apart from the building and construction industry, this is the only other industry-specific legislation with which we are dealing in relation to workplace relations in this country.
This bill signifies, yet again, a complete renege on a commitment that was made by this government. We talked about it this week when we were dealing with the budget measures bill. When it comes to indexation and the Commonwealth Grants Scheme and the debate and the deal that was struck in 2003 with the four Independent senators, the government has completely reneged on the deal that was made at that time—in the same way that the indexation deal was made and broken.
I cannot quite ascertain the reason for this legislation—so, no doubt, everyone in this place is particularly sceptical and calling it ideologically driven. I have to say, though, that the committee inquiry into and the public hearings held on this legislation were interesting. The public hearings were attended by Senator Trish Crossin on behalf of the Labor Party, the chair, Senator Judith Troeth, for the government, and me on behalf of the Democrats. In addition to the submissions that were provided to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, we heard public submissions from a range of groups in the sector—I would argue, a representative group of the sector—and the Department of Education, Science and Training. The really important thing to note here is that the sector was completely united in its criticisms and rejection of the legislation. In some ways, they encapsulated the concerns best.
The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, represented at that stage by Professor Richard Larkins, who is the Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, summed up the AVCC’s objections by giving us seven points—a nice neat seven points. He said:
I will give seven reasons for that opposition. The first is that it is unnecessary; the second is that it is unprincipled; the third is that it is discriminatory; the fourth is that it is impractical; the fifth is that it has procedural unfairness associated with it; the sixth is that it is counterproductive; and the seventh is that it is rigid and micro-regulatory.
That is a brilliant summation of what is wrong with the legislation. I quote the AVCC because the government has an association with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. When it comes to the Higher Education Support Act and the deal that was struck in 2003, apparently the government relied heavily on the AVCC’s recommendations and advice.
I will go to some of the seven points, because it is actually a reasonable way of addressing the higher education workplace relations legislation before us. Talking about the first point—that is, it being unnecessary—Professor Larkins said:
... for several years now, the universities have actually been exercising considerable flexibility. Indeed, most staff on the higher level—
the high-performing staff—
are on performance contracts which reward good performance. In addition, through the performance management system, we have methods of dealing with unsatisfactory performance—which, although time consuming, are effective. Therefore, as there is current flexibility, the legislation is unnecessary.
That is because universities already have the power to introduce, to offer and to provide AWAs. They already have a degree of flexibility. They already understand, as most workplaces do, the concept—if not the flexibility—of rewards, good performance and addressing the issues of poor performance.
To me, this exemplifies something that I have known for a long time in this place, but particularly under this government and, indeed, the current Minister for Education, Science and Training: this parliament has no concept of the modern university. It is still mired in these notions of ivory towers, vice-chancellors who have little to do with administration or their students and, indeed, academia that is on tenured contracts—not a problem with that, I might say. The notion is of academia that are in some way not responsive to the current, modern needs of their workplaces, their students, their teaching, their research and their other roles.
Mr Acting Deputy President Murray, do you remember the comments in this place by then Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, encouraging institutions to dob in an academic? ‘Put the brown paper bag under the door’—no kidding! And then they are talking about ivory towers. These are romantic but somewhat misleading perceptions, or conceptions, of how a university works in this day and age. This legislation exemplifies that fact. There is no understanding. The vice-chancellors are saying this. I often describe them—with all due respect, because I have and always have had a very good working relationship with that body—as not the most radical bunch of people. So when they are effectively telling the government to dump the legislation, I wonder who is listening.
The second point is the issue of the legislation being unprincipled. Again, the entire legislation is unprincipled, but Professor Richard Larkins, on behalf of the AVCC, points out:
... at the time of the Higher Education Support Act and negotiations surrounding that prior to its passage in December 2003, there was considerable discussion about linking higher education workplace relations requirements to the Commonwealth Grants Scheme increases.
He goes on to talk about the deal that was struck with the four Independent senators—after negotiation, he adds of course, with the AVCC—and he says their support was:
... very much around the decision by government to drop the requirement for linking the—
workplace relations requirements—
to the CGS increase—
that is, the Commonwealth Grants Scheme increase. He went on to say:
To go back on that agreement, which was one of the bases of the AVCC supporting the legislation at that time, would seem to be unprincipled.
Hear, hear! It is blackmail. This legislation is blackmail: you do not get your funds unless you implement these workplace relations changes. You do not get your funds unless you allow, for the first time in modern history—certainly in this country and arguably around the world—public university institutions to have their autonomy interfered with and a level of ministerial discretion that is inappropriate, unprecedented and not the basis on which universities should be working.
The third point, he says, is that it is discriminatory. You bet it is. He goes on to say:
The universities are perfectly willing to conform to workplace relations requirements that apply throughout the work force.
Hear, hear! But why design a sector-specific workplace relations system and make funding contingent upon that? Why single out universities in this way? No wonder people conclude it is ideological obsession. No wonder people hark back, as I heard Senator Lundy do, to HR Nicholls and people’s past student lives, or what have you. No wonder they cannot help doing that, because you have to wonder: why pick on universities specifically? Again, if the AVCC are asking the question, obviously the rest of us have to wonder.
Professor Larkins says the fourth reason the AVCC have problems is that the legislation is impractical:
The component that is impractical is the requirement to offer AWAs to casual workers.
Now, hello! If there is one aspect of this legislation that the government could clean up it is the requirement that casual workers will be covered by this legislation. Casual workers will be covered—whether they are people invigilating exams or helping out from one month to the next! Who is going to provide the additional funds with which the universities will administer this process? Casual workers are going to be offered AWAs for the purposes of what—how many weeks or months that they are there? Is it really necessary to have this in law? It is quite extraordinary and, again, totally underestimates the modern functionings of an Australian university workplace. As Professor Larkins of the AVCC says:
To offer all of those AWAs is incredibly complex and would achieve nothing. We would suggest that, if the legislation were to go ahead, the requirement to offer AWAs to casual workers be deferred indefinitely for casual workers employed for a period of less than six months.
Good idea. I was going to move that amendment, but I read the numbers, so I am appealing to the government now. If you are going to go ahead with such draconian legislation, such ideologically driven law, that is okay. We accept that you have the numbers now. But, for goodness sake, at least when it comes to the casual workers provision—in fact, I may still move that amendment, I am so angry about this.
—Good on you!
—Thank you, Senator Conroy. I know it will fail. It would be so much better if the government moved that amendment. It is a practical, good idea. Yes, I will reserve my right on that one.
The fifth reason is procedural unfairness, and Professor Larkins goes on to talk about those universities that have EBAs in current operation:
To require them to implement the HEWRRS by 30 November this year and the other universities not until the following year is an example of procedural unfairness.
The sixth reason is that it is counterproductive, Professor Larkins suggests:
... because the requirement to deliver a conforming EBA actually gives substantial bargaining power to the unions ...
So here they are actually worried that the unions are going to have too much power as a consequence of this legislation. Again, these statements do not necessarily encapsulate all of my views and certainly not those of the NTEU, and it was an interesting debating point at the committee. But if they are telling you that this legislation does not actually achieve what you want it to achieve, government, then certainly you have to rethink.
The seventh and final point is that it is rigid and microregulatory. Professor Larkins asked:
Why do we have to have an EBA, for example? Why can’t we have other ways of interacting with our work force?
Hear, hear! Go back to the drawing board, government. This legislation is not appropriate. It is sector specific, it is full of blackmail, it is ideologically driven and it is unnecessary.
That does not even get to the impacts on the work force, on morale, on academic quality and on research and teaching, the core roles of those institutions—not that I necessarily think that some in government argue that anymore. I draw senators’ attention to an advertisement that was placed in the Australian this week, organised by the National Tertiary Education Union but supported by more than 200 professors in this land. More than 200 professors in this land did this statement for the media. The union held a press conference on Monday morning and they outlined their concerns about the impact of these proposals, particularly on university autonomy and academic quality. They called for this government to reject, or at least withdraw, the proposals contained in this legislation. They claimed:
The HEWRRs—
the workplace relations requirements—
are part of the Government’s broader WorkChoices industrial agenda, and require the offering of Australian Workplace Agreements to all university staff and the removal of limits on fixed term and casual employment.
The statement urges the Federal Government to withdraw these proposals and, if they do not, for the Senate to reject them. So, honourable senators, this is our chance. Listen to the intellectual lifeblood of this country. More than 200 professors in this land have signed a half-page advertisement in the Australian calling for this legislation to be rejected. You do not sniff at that, although I have seen what has happened when people have spoken out on behalf of intellectualism and fair debate in this country in recent times, particularly academics. Those professors acknowledge that this legislation will see universities denied $300 million in much needed funds in 2006-07 unless they adopt these hardline workplace relations requirements.
On that note, I made clear earlier this week when talking about the issue of indexation that we have to put this in perspective. Since this government came to power we know that universities have lost anything up to $500 million in revenue. At the risk of being seen to be unfair I just want to make clear that successive governments are responsible for not addressing adequately the indexation issue of universities but this government has compounded that, along with all its other measures that have seen our higher education system go backwards in terms of equity and access, whether it is fees, charges, barriers, lack of income support, proposed voluntary student unionism—you name it. The indexation requirements are the single biggest priority issue for groups like the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, and this legislation does nothing to address that.
The government’s own ministerial reviews and reports show that between $911 million and $988 million is required over the next four years in order to adequately resource universities when it comes to indexation. If that is what the legislation provided it would be a joyful day. Instead of that the government is blackmailing universities by saying that they will get their meagre Commonwealth Grants Scheme money in return for workplace relations requirements. If this legislation were adequately dealing with indexation it would be a joyful day for those 200 professors and the students, graduates and aspiring students in this country. But, no, we are just dealing with another bill that does very little for education in this country, I am sad to say, and the Democrats will be opposing the measures.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I want to make a couple of points on this particular piece of legislation. Many people have contacted our office with their concerns about the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005. Amidst all the other legislation that we have to consider, there have been many calls and emails about this one. Their concerns are not new. Many of the emails and comments I have received talk about the fact that this legislation has come back before us and that there have been clear attempts to bring this one forward in the past. It has not been able to get through previously and now it is back because of the situation we face where the government has achieved the numbers.
Notwithstanding that, and echoing many of the comments that Senator Stott Despoja has made, I think it is important that at least we put the issues out there so that we can have some debate over something that is going to impact upon the university sector. It is such an incredibly important sector in our community, one that we talk about a lot. But I wonder whether people really understand the value the university sector gives to our community. It is not just in terms of the intellectual studies that come and the areas of research and the experience levels that we have there. I think it is also the impact that universities have on local communities. That is no more real than in areas such as where I come from in Toowoomba. We speak of the university there as ‘our university’ because it grew with the community and in fact only acquired its university status because of demonstrations made by local people to say that they wanted this kind of institution to benefit and augment the kind of life that was available for people who live on the Darling Downs.
That kind of institution is replicated in places like Central Queensland, where we have the Rockhampton campus and also the burgeoning campuses that have spread out through Central Queensland, and there is also James Cook University. I am mentioning the regional campuses—and this is by no means a way of giving certain weight to them as opposed to others—because of the impact of the legislation that we are facing. I think that in many ways you can see a snapshot of exactly what will occur by seeing what will happen in places like Toowoomba or Townsville or Rockhampton. Sometimes when we talk about universities we tend to concentrate on the academic staff because universities are there to teach, but the legislation that we have before us will not only impact on those people who are fortunate enough to be educators. Look at the wide range of people who are employed on a university campus. It is wonderful to visit the campuses and see the people who work in the libraries, in the gardens and in the kitchens. All of them proudly identify as members of that university community. All of those workers will be impacted by this legislative change so when we are considering that we should look across the board at the impact.
It was really difficult sitting here before and hearing all the things that I was going to say being said by the other speakers. Senator Stott Despoja’s contribution dealt with many of the issues that I wanted to raise so I will not go over them all again, but the kinds of emails that I got were saying, ‘Why do we need this legislation?’ There is already a healthy situation in terms of what already occurs in negotiating process—though apparently ‘negotiating’ is a dirty word, because the evidence I got from the department was that they really do not like the word ‘negotiation’; it should be removed from the whole process, which should now always reflect ‘consultation’ rather than negotiation. But in all the discussions we have had around this process what is clear is that there is already a healthy industrial relationship at the universities. When this legislation is pushed through there will be the imposition of the industrial relations changes that the government will already be wanting to push through with the legislation coming before us in a couple of weeks time. The key difference here, as Senator Stott Despoja said, is that it is some kind of industry experiment, in that we are clearly focusing on this particular area. But it seems to me to be particularly confronting because we have a list of expectations being given out to university management groups and they are being directed to change their way of operating in the area of workplace relations, and if they do not implement those changes by a certain date they will automatically lose funding.
We in this place all know how terribly important the issue of funding is to our university sector. We have heard already statements made about the volume of expenditure that has been reduced from university funding over the last 10 years. We have had strong representations from people saying that there needed to be more funding given to universities to allow for greater research and greater activity to implement the kinds of environmental changes that we would like to have. But, in this particular case, not only is the government wanting to use the university sector as some kind of pilot or trial for the workplace relations changes that are all included in the workplace relations bills—which will be before us probably in the next sitting—but they also want to get those changes enforced in the university area first, with the added threat that, if the universities do not do it, they will lose money.
That process is, to me, one of the saddest things about the circumstances we are discussing with this legislation. Whether you agree or disagree with the range of changes that the minister is imposing through this legislation, the actual way that it is being implemented must cause everyone in this chamber some concern because it is a direct threat: do it or you lose your money. We have seen the government attempting to do that in other pieces of legislation on the construction industry and funding to various state programs, but I find it particularly offensive that the very industry which should be the place where free thought and free expression is blossoming is the one that is going to be used as the pilot, and I use that term again, for pushing through these industrial relations changes.
Other speakers have talked about the various things that will happen as a result of this legislation, but I just want to go through them a little to justify my speaking here. When this legislation first came on we were told that it was a simple matter of choice. We were told that the only change that was going to be put in place by this was that people would have the option to have Australian workplace agreements in their industrial options. It was something that we should not have been too concerned about. All it was going to do was to offer the people who work in universities—and, even then, there seems to be a concentration on the academic ranks, but in fact it is for all people working in universities—the option of being able to take up an AWA. It is more than that. Certainly the AWA clause is very important in the whole process, but it is not just the offer. It is that every single person who will be working in this sector must be offered an AWA.
Once again, it is a change. This has come through in the difference between this legislation and what we had before. It is not just in some flexible options list that is available for everyone to take up—that you can have a certified agreement, that you can have these other ways and, if you did seek information on AWAs, that could be a choice that you may want to take. No, with this legislation we are going one step further. We are saying that in this industry there must be the offer of an Australian workplace agreement. It would be no surprise to people from the government that that is an option that I do not value particularly highly. The indications that we have already on the history of Australian workplace agreements are that people who take them are not always getting the best deal. Certainly my own experience in the Australia Public Service was that over the series of Australian workplace agreements—in some parts of that industry we are into second and third times—people do not always get the best possible outcomes.
For me—and I understand that people would accept that I have a particular philosophy on this point—the real issue is that this actually focuses again on the individual; it is always on the individual. It is the competitive and divisive nature of this form of enterprise discussion which offends me and, in fact, it scares me for the future. If you have a community which is focused on achieving an outcome and you impose—and I use that verb absolutely clearly—upon them a system for their workplace relations which focuses exclusively on the individual and also encourages people, through the terms that are offered, to outbid each other on how hard they can work and what kinds of things they can provide, it breaks down the sense of shared working experiences. It breaks down the sense of community. Once again, it focuses on the individuals being out for themselves.
Also, in this particular case—where we have the change so that it is no longer an option but it must be offered—we have a situation where the people who are being offered these agreements, in the individual choice element, are asking, ‘What happens to me if I don’t take up this offer?’ We all know that the university sector is an intensely difficult area of education to work in. There are huge demands and challenges for people who work in that area. We also know that, in the university sector, it has been very difficult over the last 15 to 20 years in Australia to obtain long-term secure work. People feel very threatened by anything that could make their employment even more vulnerable, particularly in an environment where other forms of funding are very questionable. People survive, grant by grant, to see whether they will be able to maintain their work.
Once again, it is not just the people directly involved in education but all those people surrounding them who are part of the university family. By imposing this process of having a single contract, it could lead to—and I am not saying that it automatically leads to it in all cases—individuals feeling so threatened and vulnerable that they would be prepared to accept any form of contract just to ensure employment. That is the worst possible outcome of a system which enshrines individual contracts, and an environment where division and competition seem to be the norm.
It goes on to the different principles of the direct relationship and freedom of association—one of my favourite terms. When we talk about freedoms that should be enshrined, freedom of association is one that is very dear to me. In terms of the environment in which we are operating, within this particular legislation a great effort is being made to ensure that there is balance, that there is no favouritism and that there is the option for people to take up their rights to be a part of an union agreement and to be part of a union, if they choose to.
I will now refer to comments that have already been made by the department to universities regarding arrangements for agreements that are being negotiated now, in order to meet the deadline imposed by the department that if you have an enterprise agreement it must be finalised by the end of this month. With respect to clauses to do with negotiations that currently take place in the university between a staff member, their union and their boss, the department has commented:
Clauses should be amended to replace the word ‘negotiation’ with ‘consultation’ and, where appropriate, should also specify exactly between whom the consultation takes place.
And this is the bit that I am really worried about:
‘With a view to reach a shared decision’ and ‘with a view to reaching agreement’ also inhibit flexibility and should be removed.
That deeply concerns me. If, in a current workplace discussion—and I will try to keep away from the unfortunate word ‘negotiation’—we are able to achieve an outcome which enshrines in an agreement the term ‘with a view to reach a shared decision’, should not we be applauding that? Should not we be saying that that is actually a successful outcome? But under the current guidelines and the current advice being given to employers on this basis, that is seen as somehow inflexible. On that point, having regard to the words that are in front of us, and having regard to the environment that is being created by this government across the community, when you have that clear advice that you should be avoiding use of the term ‘with a view to reach a shared decision’ in an agreement between employers and employees on the basis that it could be inflexible, that must raise some concerns. It certainly does for me.
Because of my particular bias, in that I strongly support the role of unions, particularly when people have an issue about which they want support, I will quote another comment made by the department about employers currently involved in negotiations. It refers to a staff member who happens to be a member of a union getting some assistance when they are facing a situation in the workplace. The advice from the department is as follows:
The definition of ‘representative’—
and that is the kind of support that someone could get—
provides an advantage to a union member in that they can have access to a representative from the union or another staff member, where a non-union member of staff only has access to a staff member to represent them. This should be amended so that all staff members have the same flexibility and choice as to who represents them.
It interests me that there is so much focus on excluding access by an employee to help from their union, even though we have protestations about individual union members being able to have someone from the union in to talk to them. In fact, on this point I cannot help referring to the advertisements displayed across the media at the moment—and I will not mention how much they have cost; you are very well aware of that, Mr Acting Deputy President Forshaw. I refer to that wonderful scene where the employer and the employee together usher in the representative from the union to assist in working through an issue. We are not quite sure what the issue is, but they are actively welcomed and ushered in to be part of the discussion.
From the advice that is currently being given about what will happen, it seems to me that, whilst being very clear to meet the legal requirements in not totally excluding the option of having someone from the union present, the onus is completely on the individual. As I said earlier in my contribution, my concern is that, where the onus is entirely on the individual, there is the possibility that they may be intimidated and may not have the strength or knowledge to take up the options which are there but which are not highlighted.
We have clear advice on a written agreement that a staff member who chooses the option of accessing a member of the union or a staff member to help them has an advantage that is somehow unfair. That reflects more clearly the intent of this process. From my reading of it, and definitely from the concerns that have been raised with me in my office, there is a fear that this is yet one more attempt to totally break the nexus between an employee who chooses to be a member of a union and their right to meet with their union representative in the workplace. It will prevent open access to union activity in any form of negotiation or discussion in the workplace.
We know that is the intent of the government having regard to the wider community. What is also now being forced upon the university culture and community, quite unnecessarily, through this separate piece of legislation, is the fear, anxiety and concerns that have been raised, when there is no necessity for this to occur. The natural processes that will occur in this country over the next few years will mean that this kind of debate will take place, so why, at this time, are the people who work in higher education being confronted with their workplace being subject to not only the industrial relations changes that we have identified but also to the added blackmail that their key funding will be cut if they do not take up, word for word, the instructions that have been given by the government?
Where do we go now? We will have a debate on the matter, and the government will continue to be lobbied on it. We know that will happen, because we have seen the process that has occurred in the media. Members of university communities across the country have said that this does not make them feel more secure, it does not make them have a greater sense of fairness, it does not make them feel more productive and it certainly does not make them feel more flexible. We will go through this process because it is important that issues about fairness, genuine productivity and a clear community focus on our education system are put clearly on the record. This means the information will be on the record not only for this debate but for future debates, and people in the future will have a clear understanding of what happened with this legislation in 2005. It has been defeated before, but we will see what happens now, in 2005.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I rise as the final speaker in the debate today on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005. As we have heard from several other speakers, this is an example of how this government is forcing inappropriate workplace relations requirements onto higher education institutions and Australian employees. It is interesting to note that to date there has been no contribution from government senators prepared to defend this legislation. We have to wonder why that is the case—perhaps it is, ‘Why bother?’ or ‘Does it matter?’ or, even worse, ‘Who cares?’
The purpose of the bill is to offer additional funding to our universities and other higher education institutions under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, but it is conditional on the adoption of the government’s higher education workplace requirements. Universities that comply with these requirements will receive increases in their basic CGS funding of 2½ per cent in 2005, five per cent in 2006 and 7½ per cent in 2007 and beyond. And there is a 30 December 2005 compliance deadline for our universities. The rub in this bill is not even subtle. Vice-chancellors have been told, ‘Implement this workplace relations scheme and offer all employees Australian workplace agreements, or you do not get the dollars.’ Several speakers have already mentioned the explicit blackmail that is inherent in that message. We heard the same message in the TAFE funding agreement legislation debated during the last session: no choice, no time, no scrutiny. It equates to bully boy tactics of our institutions and interference in their administration by a government that on the one hand, like yesterday, talks up the capacity, innovation and dynamics of our universities and, on the other hand, hacks away at the resources of these institutions.
As I said, Senator Crossin and Senator Stott Despoja have called it blackmail and I agree. The workplace reforms are being debated in the other chamber and here in the Senate we are debating a bill that gives no indication of, for example, maintaining a no disadvantage test for AWAs in higher education institutions. This despite the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, in his second reading speech saying:
As with collective agreements, AWAs are subject to a no disadvantage test.
It is just another sleight of hand. The government insists that it is not enforcing the issue of AWAs and that take-up is voluntary and yet, in this bill, is tying additional funding to the offering of AWAs.
At the ARC awards yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, who stepped in at the last minute for Minister Nelson, was spruiking the value of research partnerships. The figures quoted confirmed that the federal government contributes a small proportion of the total funding in the higher education sector. Evidence to the Senate inquiry into this bill indicated that higher education funding from the Commonwealth government to that sector is now less than 50 per cent. Yet this is a government that wants total control of what happens in higher education institutions right down to the employment conditions of each and every employee—from the university vice-chancellors to the cleaners and casual outdoors staff.
The bill reintroduces the industrial relations elements that were defeated here in December 2003. Of course, the circumstances are very different now and this government is intent upon imposing a range of obligations on universities to meet provisions under the national governance protocols and the higher education workplace relations requirements. There are dire consequences for failure to satisfy these requirements and that is a cut in their proportion of university funding.
Under this legislation, every university staff member will have to be offered an AWA by August next year. What is that all about? This goes beyond the requirements for employees in any other industry. Universities are confronting enterprise agreements that are going to be stripped back to a frightening safety net. We are going to see greater casualisation, and limited contracts for staff will be encouraged and facilitated through the legislation. What are the consequences for our communities going to be? Certainly, we have heard a lot in the debate about university independence. We have heard about academic and support staff who will lose their tenures. Job security will certainly disappear and there will be limits on fixed-term and casual staff.
We heard in the debate yesterday and this morning about the Industrial Relations Commission’s decision 10 years ago about fixed-term and casual employment in higher education institutions. We have heard from the Prime Minister that if employees do not like conditions that might be unfair and potentially unreasonable under these arrangements, they can go somewhere else. Senator Moore raised the issue of the regional universities and just how many options people might have to go somewhere else. If you think about universities in Darwin, Alice Springs, Toowoomba, Gladstone, Wagga Wagga, Albury, Bathurst, Orange or Bendigo, if you are dissatisfied with your employer, who happens to be one of those universities, and who you believe is dealing with you unfairly, just where do you go and what you do? You do not really have very many options at all.
As the final speaker in the debate, I would like to summarise the five specific conditions that must be met that Labor is completely opposed to. The first relates to choice in agreement making. Under the provisions, universities must offer Australian workplace agreements to all new employees employed after 29 April this year and to all other employees by 31 August next year. Until 30 June next year, universities are exempt from offering AWAs to casual employees engaged for a period of less than one month. Any certified agreements made by the university and certified after 29 April this year, are to include a clause that expressly allows for AWAs to operate to the exclusion of the certified agreement or to prevail over the certified agreement where there is any inconsistency.
At the moment, as we know, universities may offer AWAs to staff under existing certified agreements. That is something that was agreed to as part of the negotiations in 2003, but apparently it is not enough for this government. A new condition imposed in this bill is that every single university employee must be offered an AWA by 31 August 2006. This absolutely demonstrates the minister’s misunderstanding, lack of understanding or, perhaps, complete disregard for how universities operate and, certainly, his lack of concern about how employees on Australian workplace agreements might manage.
By mandating that every employee must be offered an AWA rather than leaving it as one of various options, this provision goes well beyond the existing position. In the process, the government is actually seeking to introduce a stipulation for the higher education sector that, as we have heard from several speakers already, is way in excess of its own extreme industrial relations policy for the work force generally.
Many people will be quite specifically impacted. The first group I want to speak to are women. Women employed on individual contracts now earn about 11 per cent less an hour than men employed on collective agreements. Currently, women receive about 90 per cent of the hourly rate of men employed on collective agreements. That percentage is reduced further under AWAs, where women earn only about 80 per cent of the hourly pay of men. So we know from current experience that when employees are put on individual contracts they are, on average, worse off. It certainly is the case that AWAs are bad news for employees in universities—especially for women, because we know that women represent more than 50 per cent of university staff.
The second part of the bill relates to direct relationships with employees. Several speakers in the debate have discussed how much this is actually about undermining the role of unions. This condition stipulates that university workplace agreements, policies and practices must provide for direct consultation between employees and the institution about workplace relations and human resource matters. Further, so-called third-party involvement in the representation of employees must occur only at the request of an affected employee. That means that the union can intervene on behalf of an employee only at the request of the employee.
Another detail under this condition is that consultative and other committees must include direct employee involvement and that employee involvement in negotiations on industrial relations issues must not be restricted only to third-party representation. We know, as we have heard several times, that this is about excluding the unions from a role in consultative processes related to staff. If third-party involvement can occur only at the request of an individual employee and not as a right, it is all too easy to imagine that many university staff will feel intimidated and forgo the opportunity to be represented at all. I am not even going to explore how that impacts on staff who might be from a non-English-speaking background or unskilled outdoor or support staff who perhaps do not have the capacity to represent their own interests and need the representation of something like their union. Just on that fact alone, Labor is certainly not going to support this legislation.
The next condition is about workplace flexibility. That condition states that workplace agreements should expressly displace previous workplace agreements in relevant awards. Those new workplace agreements are not to limit or restrict the ability of the universities to make decisions and implement change in respect to course offerings and associated staff requirements, and limitations are not to be placed on forms and mix of employment arrangements.
So what is this all about? Really, those provisions will help the Howard government to nullify the impact of the existing higher education contract of employment award. That is the employment award made by the Industrial Relations Commission and spoken to so clearly by Senator Crossin. Under this condition, the government is also taking aim at the vital protections in place through restrictions on casual employment that were agreed to between the universities and the unions in the last round of enterprise bargaining. The level of casualisation in the higher education sector is very high; it is second only to that of the hospitality and tourism industry. There can be no doubt that, if the bill is passed, the government will press universities to strip back essential protections from their agreements until the result is something that resembles very much hollowed-out safety net awards.
The next area is productivity and performance. The university workplace agreements must include a fair and transparent performance management scheme to reward so-called high-flyers and must also include efficient processes for managing poorly performing staff. What this seems to ignore is that all universities are already able to do just that. They are able to reward their high-flyers, and they do so using salary loadings and the payment of market and merit loadings. Existing arrangements also provide mechanisms for dealing with unsatisfactory or poor performance. So what is really going on here? It really is about making it much easier to terminate the employment of staff that universities deem to be unsatisfactory. We again see that this is undermining the protections that are already in place for university staff and which were agreed so sensibly in the last round of enterprise bargaining.
The next issue goes to freedom of association. Again, we have had lots of discussion about this part of the bill. Under this condition, university enterprise agreements must be consistent with freedom of association principles contained in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and institutions must neither encourage nor discourage the membership of unions. The bill also imposes a condition prohibiting universities from using the Commonwealth Grants Scheme funds to pay university union staff salaries or to fund union facilities. The prohibition on the capacity of universities to use the Commonwealth Grants Scheme funds to assist in the resourcing of officers, facilities or salaries of the local branch of a relevant union certainly exposes this government’s anti-union agenda.
The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Prime Minister and others, as we well know, repeatedly express the view that employers and employees should be free to choose the form of agreement that best suits them and should be free to determine for themselves what should be included in their agreement. Yet what is going on in this legislation is that we will have a third uninvited party—that is, the Commonwealth government—muscling in to add confusion to the debate, as well as greater complexity and regulation, in absolute contradiction to their stated aims of choice and flexibility, which is what we are hearing about in the industrial relations legislation.
This is a very confusing and frustrating bill that will not be supported by Labor. It is clear that the bill is ideologically driven and is all about the industrial relations agenda. This time, the setting is the higher education sector. There are six principles in Labor’s industrial relations policy that we will reflect in our policy direction for higher education. The six key features of our position are that a Labor government would recognise: the need for a strong safety net of minimum award wages and conditions; the need for a strong independent umpire to assure fair wages and conditions, and to settle disputes; the rights of employees to bargain collectively for decent wages and conditions; the rights of workers to reject individual contracts which cut pay and conditions and undermine collective bargaining and union representation; proper rights for Australian workers who are unfairly dismissed; and the right to join a union and be represented by a union. They are the principles that Labor will base our industrial relations policy on.
Labor are committed to a productive and fair industrial relations system and want to see a return to dignity as well as productivity in the workplace. They certainly do not seem to matter to this government. This bill is creating a vehicle for the salaries and working conditions of university employees to be eroded and diminished. This has often been misunderstood, but we are not talking just about academic staff; we are talking about all employees of universities. Many of these hard-won conditions will be wound back or lost if the bill proceeds.
There are some other issues that I am very concerned about. One that was raised in the House of Representatives in this debate was the issue of maternity leave and the negotiations that have gone on around maternity leave in universities. Another is the restriction on the number of casual staff able to be employed in our universities. We need to think about who the losers are going to be: the staff, the students and the communities which the universities operate in and support.
Paid maternity leave is only one area where there will be a reduction in conditions. It is something that is of real concern when you consider the number of women working in universities—as I mentioned before, women make up more than 50 per cent of university staff. In many universities, maternity leave provisions have quite recently been improved. The community standard for maternity leave under the Howard government is no paid leave at all, and the community standard is the one that the universities will have to measure themselves against. What we could see is those hard-won maternity leave provisions, which have been carefully negotiated to support women in the higher education system in both work and study, being stripped back. That is a very significant issue when we are looking at the role of higher education and research in this nation.
The restriction on casual staff employed in universities is also a critical issue. We know that the level of casualisation in the higher education sector is as high as it is in the hospitality and tourism sectors. There are many examples where the conditions negotiated for casual employees will be undermined because of the way that negotiations will have to take place under the new regime. Individual contracts will undermine many of the conditions that have been so carefully won for casual staff. That does not seem to be of any interest to this government at all. We know students are going to be the great losers. We know that students make up quite a reasonable number of the part-time and casual staff employed at universities. Recently, at the University of Canberra—where I studied—we saw students supporting themselves and helping to pay for their HECS fees by working in the library, in student support services and in the cafeterias and shops that are at the university. Those people are going to be very significantly impacted by these changes.
It seems very clear that this is not about quality of education; it is not about improving productivity in the universities; it is not about anything except the industrial relations agenda that this government is trying to impose. The idea that you can use this legislation to push the industrial relations reform debate that is going on in the other house is an appalling misuse of the higher education legislation—and of the higher education sector. We know that education is fundamentally threatened by this legislation. Labor are not going to support it in any shape or form, and we are going to be telling the community that right up to the election.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-11-10,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 is necessary if Australia is to retain its competitive edge in the provision of higher education. Increasingly, Australian and overseas students will make their choices on the basis of cost, reputation for standards, and local and overseas career options. In order to compete with international universities, Australian universities need to be able to attract and keep the best staff and reward them in accordance with their skills. Universities are failing to attract and retain talented academics to undertake great teaching and research. Research undertaken for the Department of Education, Science and Training has shown that salaries for university academics in Australia are less competitive than similar positions in the private sector and overseas.
The higher education workplace relations requirements are designed to support a workplace relations system in universities focused on greater freedom, flexibility and individual choice. The workplace relations requirements enable members of staff and higher education providers to negotiate mutually beneficial work arrangements tailored to meet the needs of both the individuals and the institution. AWAs allow greater flexibility than certified agreements to provide bonuses and other rewards for high performance. They assist employers to offer incentives to attract and retain the best employees. Under this legislation, universities will be required to offer an AWA to all employees. Under the workplace relations requirements, certified agreements may not inhibit productivity, flexibility or the form and mix of employment arrangements. To fulfil the requirements, universities must be able to offer employment on the condition of an AWA if universities so wish.
The government’s approach is about providing choice, not prescribing particular outcomes. Choice is about providing scope for individuals to negotiate pay and conditions which suit their particular needs and circumstances rather than being locked into a one-size-fits-all approach. In debating the bill it has been argued by opposition senators and in the other place that universities already have the capacity to offer individual arrangements and recognise high-performing staff. They have said that this happens through individual common law contracts rather than AWAs. What they have not said is that these contracts are usually offered to senior staff and no-one else. This means that the majority of university staff are not able to negotiate conditions that are mutually beneficial to them and their university.
There has also been criticism that the workplace relations requirements force universities to have in place agreements that displace previous awards and agreements. This is not new. The government’s former workplace reform program between 2000 and 2004 also included this element. Before the introduction of this program, some universities had agreements that needed to be read in conjunction with up to 10 different awards. The majority now have single agreements containing all of the relevant conditions of employment in one comprehensive document.
The workplace relations requirements will have no impact on academic freedom. Universities will still be able to make their own decisions about the appointment of staff and other academic activities. The requirements will encourage universities to develop a culture of direct communication with their staff. Third parties, including unions, will only be allowed to represent an employee at the request of that employee. Whilst staff liaison committees will be able to continue to exist with an important consultative function, they will not be able to exert powers to block change and hinder progress and productivity.
The requirements will provide universities with increased flexibility to offer courses that are relevant to the needs of the country and the students, and that will respond to market pressures and the demands of our immediate environment. The reforms will assist institutions to encourage individual and organisational performance and productivity, including rewarding high-performing individuals, efficiently managing underperformance and strengthening management and leadership capability. Through the higher education reforms that this government introduced this year, the government has committed more than $11 billion in additional support for higher education. However, this funding will only assist the sector if it is accompanied by significant changes in the way that universities are managed.
I understand that the Greens have moved a second reading amendment, which the government opposes. Their amendment is in four parts. I will not delay the Senate for long on this. In relation to subparagraph (a), I simply indicate that the requirements that we will be legislating will have no impact on university independence. In relation to the suggestion in subparagraph (b) about funding, I refer to the fact of the extra $11 billion boost to our higher education sector, which effectively debunks that part of the amendment. In relation to subparagraph (c), I indicate that the only change is that the requirements provide that third parties, including unions, may only be involved at the request of an affected employee. Finally, it is the government’s view that the time for significant workplace reform in Australia’s higher education system has well and truly come. That is why we are moving the bill and that is why we are rejecting the Greens’ second reading amendment. I commend the bill to the Senate.
 (Senator Forshaw)—The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I rise to oppose the motion moved by Senator Abetz. This motion demonstrates once again the growing contempt of the Howard government for the legitimate role of the Senate as a house of review. The 2006 parliamentary sitting schedule caps an unprecedented decline in the number of scheduled sitting days for this chamber. In the first year of the Howard government, the Senate sat for 71 days. Next year, in 2006, it will sit for just 56.
The Senate used to play a valuable role in Australia’s democracy. The Senate used to be a house of review. The Senate used to be able to go over government legislation with a fine toothcomb, identifying all of the unintended consequences of legislation, identifying the inevitable drafting errors in legislation and protecting the Australian public from the excesses of unfettered executive power—but no more. Apparently, control of both houses of parliament has made the Howard government infallible.
We have all heard the speeches from those opposite about how important the role of the Senate was, how important the states house was. Each and every one in the Howard government has stood on their feet in this chamber and defended the role of the Senate; yet, at the first sniff of an absolute majority in each chamber, they just rip up the procedures and rip up the practices. It really puts paid to Prime Minister John Howard’s disingenuous promise earlier this year to use his Senate majority soberly, wisely and sensibly. The Howard government sees no role for the Senate as a house of review. In fact, it sees so little role for the Senate that it sees fit to slash the number of sitting days. This contempt for the Senate and the senators who comprise it demonstrates the growing extremism and arrogance of the Howard government.
—It’s an outrage!
—It is an outrage, Senator Marshall. It is clear that the Howard government views the Senate as nothing more than a rubber stamp for its ideological agenda. Unfortunately, the Howard government’s contempt for legitimate parliamentary accountability is not just limited to the number of days that the Senate is permitted to sit; the Howard government’s contempt for the role of the Senate extends to all aspects of its day-to-day activities. Take question time. In the past, question time has provided a valuable opportunity for the opposition to hold the government to account and to scrutinise its activities. In recent times, however, the government has been moving to unacceptably restrict this longstanding parliamentary process.
In the previous Senate, before 30 June, when the extreme Howard government’s excesses were checked by an independent and active Senate, the opposition was able to ask at least six and often seven questions of the government per day—but no more. Immediately after obtaining Senate control, the government moved to change the question time rules to deny Labor and the minor parties the opportunity to submit it to scrutiny. Under the new arrangements for question time, the opposition is averaging just five questions per day. Five questions is all we are allowed to ask. And increasingly, as we saw again yesterday, the opposition is being restricted to asking just four questions a day—just four chances to try to shine some light on the activities of an increasingly extreme ideological and out of touch government.
What have we got instead? I do not want anyone listening to this debate to think we are getting questions of substance. Instead of the opposition getting questions, we are getting more dorothy dixers: more opportunities for ministers to regurgitate scripted government propaganda.
—Senator Abetz is a prime example.
—He is one of the worst examples, Senator Sherry, you are dead right. As if spending hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money on government advertising was not enough. Michelle Grattan recently pointed out in the Age that the Howard government:
... has about as much regard for Senate rights as it has for advertising guidelines ...
Things have reached such a poor state that even yesterday, when calling someone to ask a question, the President of the Senate made reference to the farce that question time has become. We have examples like Senator Ian Campbell, who spent his response to one dorothy dixer talking about how he had been inspired by the Qantas inflight video. Even when the President called him to order, not once but twice, he kept talking about the Qantas inflight video that he had seen while flying from Perth to Canberra. That is the level of debate and scrutiny that this government is interested in: the Qantas inflight video gets a run in Senate question time. Just yesterday, he surpassed himself. I did not think it was possible, but yesterday he won the Al Gore ‘I invented the internet’ award for his global quest to save whales, when he announced:
I will work harder than anyone else on this planet to save the whales ...
I mean, really! That is the sort of mindless propaganda we are being subjected to instead of question time in its legitimate role, which is for the opposition to hold the government of the day accountable.
The Howard government’s contempt for the longstanding role of the Senate as a house of review is also evident in the government’s treatment of committee scrutiny. Senate committees have made a significant contribution to Australian democracy over the years. Senate inquiries have investigated some of the most important policy and governance issues faced by Australia and have played an important role in scrutinising both the actions and policies of governments. They have done this under Labor governments and under this government when no-one has had the control of both chambers.
Senate committees have often identified drafting errors in legislation and discovered unintended consequences of government legislation. They have also given the broader Australian public a chance to be heard—a chance to go on the public record on the big issues—through public hearings held across the country. Unfortunately, the Howard government has nothing but contempt for the roles these committees have played. The government’s approach to Senate committees since it took control of both houses of parliament has been nothing short of arrogant and contemptuous. It is all summed up in some comments Senator Brandis made to the party room. He labelled the Senate committee system as ‘stupid’. This is indicative of the contempt in which this government now holds this chamber.
Upon the introduction of the Telstra sale legislation, the government allowed only one day of scrutiny of five extremely complex bills. There was one day of hearings, restricted to Canberra, only two days after the bill had been introduced and with only 24 hours notice to the public to allow the public to have their say. There was one day of hearings in Canberra on an issue that will have a massive impact across Australia, especially in rural and regional areas. How can people in rural and regional areas possibly have their say on this issue when they have this short a period in which to even lodge a submission to the inquiry, let alone appear at the hearing? In fact, the government was so rushed that it missed the advertising deadlines for two newspapers and missed a spelling error in the headline of the published advertisement. Is this responsible government?
Is complete avoidance of any parliamentary scrutiny the way to produce legislation free from drafting errors and unintended consequences? Of course not. The real reason for the Howard government’s nobbling of the committee system is that it knows its ideas will not hold up to that kind of scrutiny. The real reason the Howard government does not want the people of Australia and their elected representatives to have a say on legislation like the sale of Telstra is that it knows the extremism of its policies would be revealed. The Howard government’s real objective is to hide the growing extremism of its policies. That is why it is limiting these inquiries. That is why it is rushing its legislation through. It wants to hide the growing extremism of its policy agenda.
That is why it has drafted the terms of reference of the Telstra inquiry to exclude any discussion on the question of privatisation. That may sound odd. You have a legislation committee whose job is to look at legislation, yet when the resolution turns up from the government it says, ‘Okay, you can look at the bill, but you can only look at these bits of the bill.’ What is the point of a legislation inquiry into legislation if the government says: ‘You cannot ask any questions about this part. You cannot ask any questions about this part. You can only ask questions about this part of the bill.’ What is the point? What have you got to hide? That is the question the Australian public is beginning to ask.
The Australian public is starting to wake up to the Howard government and realise the arrogance and extremism behind the government’s policy agenda. The Howard government is doing everything it can to handicap Senate scrutiny, because it knows that if the Senate is allowed to perform its role the Howard government will be exposed. Nowhere is this more evident than in the area of industrial relations, where a Senate inquiry will have just two weeks to examine the most radical and extreme changes to workplace laws in 100 years. Even that ridiculous two-week inquiry period had to be fought for tooth and nail, with the government initially refusing to allow scrutiny of the bill through a Senate inquiry. Shame on you, Senator Sandy Macdonald. This kind of arrogance and contempt for accountability is dangerous for Australia.
In the near future the Senate will consider new antiterrorism laws. You could hardly think of a more serious subject of public policy for Australia, particularly in the light of recent events. Terrorism must be an issue where we can put aside partisan differences to ensure that the government’s response to this issue is airtight. Senate scrutiny on this issue should play an important role in the process. Let us look at what Tony Blair did. Faced with the same sorts of threats that Australia is faced with, Tony Blair called together all the parties.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,11,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I would like to make a few comments in relation to the Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 to outline our position and to indicate our view on Senator Murray’s amendments, even though they have not been put yet. The bill before the chamber amends section 197 of the Corporations Act, which affects the potential indemnity of directors of corporate trustees from the liabilities of the trust. The intent behind the amendment is to ensure that directors of corporate trustees have a level playing field with regard to indemnity from liability, as do directors of other entities. This is a clarification of section 197 that Labor accept as necessary.
Specifically, the amendment will clarify the potential personal liability of the directors of corporate trustees following the case of Hanel v O’Neill in the South Australia Supreme Court. In effect, the decision in Hanel v O’Neill meant that the liability of directors of corporate trustees would include the paying of trust debts. This was a level of liability that extended beyond that of directors of other companies and certainly beyond the original intent of section 197 of the Corporations Act. Given this, the amendment contained in the bill is a necessary clarification of section 197.
From Labor’s perspective, it is important that we note that the amendment proposed will not indemnify a director of a corporate trustee for liability if they commit a breach of trust or act against the interests of the trust as per the trust agreement. This interpretation is in line with the original intent of section 229A of the Companies Code—a position which we say should be maintained. Labor have always sought to ensure that the Corporations Law balances the need of business proprietors for reasonable protection in the conduct of their business affairs, whilst ensuring that there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent the abuse of these protections. This objective and intent for precedent laws to the current section 197 was outlined by the then Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, in October 1985 in his second reading speech on the then companies and securities legislation. He said:
Currently persons contracting with a trustee, whether an individual or a corporation, are entitled to be subrogated to the trustee’s right of indemnity out of the trust assets to meet liabilities properly incurred. However if the trustee acts in breach of trust or in a manner which is not authorised by the terms of the trust, the trustee’s right of indemnity, and therefore the creditor’s right of subrogation, is lost.
The problem this creates for creditors has been exacerbated by the widespread use of business structures involving a nominally capitalised corporate trustee to carry on business on behalf of a trust, together with other refinements, such as the careful siphoning of funds into the trust business. In such cases the creditor’s primary right to sue the corporate trustee for the debt may well be worthless.
I think there is a general recognition in the business community that the legal system cannot tolerate the continued use of artificial legal contrivances which result in the deliberate avoidance of liabilities legitimately owed to other persons. It is proposed to amend the Companies Act to impose personal liability on directors of companies acting as trustee when a debt has been incurred but the trustee company is not entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the trust.
That is the position that the then Attorney-General outlined. With that considered view in mind, I indicate the opposition initially held reservations about some implications of the drafting of the current amendment set out in the bill before the chamber. In particular, we were concerned that the terms of the amendment would limit its application to very narrow circumstances and thereby work against the objective of ensuring these provisions could not abused. However, we have received advice from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer—and I thank him for his assistance in this regard—and we have also consulted with some commercial lawyers familiar with the Hanel v O’Neill decision. We are advised by the government that the intent of the amendment is not to diminish the potential liability of directors who have not met their obligations to the trading trust. On this basis we support the legislation. Ensuring the right balance between the rights of directors and business stakeholders remains as important and objective now in our corporate law as ever.
Since this bill has passed through the other place, concerns have been raised with me, and I also understand with other senators, in relation to the application of the proposed changes to section 197 contained in the bill in relation to trust splitting. I understand this is the issue that Senator Murray’s amendments are directed at. I am advised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer of Treasury’s assessment of those concerns. I put on record my understanding that the government has considered the matters raised by the lawyers who have communicated their concerns on this issue, and that the government will address this issue if it considers it necessary. I understand also that the representing parliamentary secretary today will outline the government’s views in relation to its advice on the trust splitting issue. On that basis, we will be supporting passage of the legislation today.
Given these considerations, the proposed amendment to the potential liability of the directors of corporate trustees under section 197 to bring it into line with that of other directors is a sound objective and one that Labor supports. We have sought to cooperate with the government on this bill, recognising that uncertainty for many directors of corporate trustees in this country should be addressed as soon as possible. As a result, we agree that the amendment is a necessary clarification of the application of section 197 and should provide the certainty the directors of corporate trustees are seeking in this regard.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-11-10,"—In speaking to the Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005, at the outset I want to thank the parliamentary secretary and his advisers for a helpful and cooperative approach with regard to the queries we have made with respect to this bill. We have before us today an amending bill to that cumbersome piece of legislation known as the Corporations Law. Section 197 has been found wanting as a result of an expansive interpretation by the courts. Before I address that section and my amendment to that section, I would like to address section 1462. I indicate to the chamber that I do not intend to discuss my amendment in the committee stage. I will take that amendment on the voices, and I will address my motivation for the amendment in my speech on the second reading. So we will be able to proceed quite rapidly.
I would like to first address section 1462 because it amends the Corporations Law and relates to the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, in which I and other members of the chamber were heavily involved. Although this amendment is a clarifying amendment to ensure that the application of the Corporations Act and related legislation is clear, it does provide me with an opportunity to again bring the Senate’s attention to the limitations of the CLERP amendments which were made. I speak, of course, about auditor independence.
There are major changes afoot in corporate Australia, and auditor independence will become increasingly important—not least because of the increasing dynamism, volatility and more market-responsive activity that we will see because of the changes to the harmonised, and internationally harmonised, accounting standards. During the last decade, we have seen auditors shirk their duty in a number of areas—for example, in the cases of One.Tel, HIH insurance and, of course, the recent fiasco in my own state with the Sons of Gwalia.
Most of the corporate problems can be placed at the feet of two sets of people: one is auditors who were not diligent enough, and the other is directors who were poor in the execution of their duties. Sometimes the auditors were hoodwinked, but more often than not they did not ask the hard questions and did not cover the range of issues that they should have. They did not want to investigate the information they were given. They did not want to delve deeply into a matter that looked a bit suspicious, because it might embarrass their mates in those particular companies, which have been exposed as being so badly run that they have resulted in a scandalous dereliction of duty to shareholders and stakeholders. That is not good enough for Australian shareholders and stakeholders. It is not good enough for people relying on insurance companies to keep them covered in times of crisis. It is not good enough when shareholders’ hard-earned money is lost. Of course, the government has quite properly reacted to that crisis and has produced law changes which have been thoroughly supported by the chamber.
Turning back to the particular case of the Sons of Gwalia as an example, Ferrier Hodgson has pointed the finger at the directors of the company, the Lalor brothers, plus Thomas Lang, who was the chairman of the audit committee, and at the auditors—who are one of the big four—Ernst and Young. There is a suggestion in that report from the administrators that this is an example of auditors not doing their job properly, of not being properly independent and not looking out for the interests of shareholders. If there had been proper scrutiny of the conduct of the company between 1994 and 2000, many of the issues which led to the demise of the company might well have been averted. According to an article in the Australian Financial Review on 18 August 2005, the report from administrators Ferrier Hodgson states that:
Save for the journal entries representing the net deferral, all of the detail of the trading transactions was kept from the chief accounting officer then responsible for preparation of the financial statements.
We were advised that the company’s auditors worked with the senior executive in the development of the accounting treatment.
Needless to say, Sons of Gwalia shareholders are angry that they were misled by information in the annual report and in the figures presented to them. They want their money back because they believe they were lied to by the people who ran the company and they believe they were lied to, or let down, by the people who audited the books of the company. The reason I raise that specific example is because it is an example of why an independent audit committee and an independent auditor are essential for the good governance of corporate entities in this country and that is why I will keep harping on about it.
But one of my great concerns is that people automatically assume audit committees are independent. Currently the appointment of an auditor is a decision of the board of a company and this can give the board a dangerous level of power over the auditor if the board itself is not independent and therefore the audit committee itself is not independent. Legislatures and regulators the world over are trying to tighten up on these appointments—and for very good reason. However, an audit committee is not independent—and an auditor is not independent, therefore, as an extension—if that audit committee or if that auditor is subject to the patronage or direction of the dominant shareholder or dominant shareholders, especially if that dominant shareholder, or those dominant shareholders, has a majority of representatives on the board. The auditor will generally be chosen because he or she is seen to be able to ‘work with the board’, and working with the board may mean that the auditor is not looking out for the best interests of all shareholders but for a select group of dominant shareholders that may have control over the appointment of directors—and therefore the appointment of the audit committee, and therefore the appointment of the auditor.
Independence is a state of mind that allows for opinions to be arrived at without being affected by external influences. And the independence of audit committees is important to ensure that the external auditor is free from management interference. Such independence, I believe, is associated with raising the quality of the audit and safeguarding the integrity of corporate financial reporting. As I have previously quoted, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission provided a compelling description of the importance of the independent audit function when it said they are important to public trust. An auditor’s opinion furnishes investors with critical assurances that the financial statements have been subjected to a rigorous and forensic examination by an objective, impartial and skilled professional team. And, therefore, the investors, shareholders and stakeholders can rely on them.
The Democrats believe that, at its very core, existing company law is inadequate in terms of corporate governance, that the board and directors are central to the relationship between shareholders and company, and that those relationships are still not sufficiently regulated. In discussing corporate governance, our political and constitutional language is a helpful tool. ‘Best practice regular elections’: how many people can believe that the companies on the stock exchange all conduct best practice regular elections? ‘Compulsory voting’: we are supporters of compulsory voting of institutional shareholders. ‘Representative bodies’: well, sometimes that applies in companies, sometimes not. Independent institutions and people; appointments on merit; the separation of powers; transparency, accountability and full disclosure—these are the elements of our national democracy; they should be the elements of corporate democracy.
In keeping with this, I believe that a small corporate governance board separate from the main board has great merit. Dr Shann Turnbull is one of the significant writers and thinkers on this, but I have been on about this for many, many years. Importantly, such a board would be elected by shareholder and not shareholding, so avoiding the trap of dominant shareholders exercising patronage. The corporate governance board would be composed of non-executive directors with a limited remit. Part of their responsibility would be the appointment of auditors and other advisers such as valuers, and they would also be responsible for management of the process to elect directors and executive management. One of the interesting features of Senator Joyce’s vote to pass the Telstra legislation is that, if the negotiation for the sale of Telstra had ended up in my hands, Telstra might well have found itself with a corporate governance board, courtesy of that concept I have just outlined.
As I stated in my speech in the second reading debate on the Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003, which was the CLERP (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003 as well, the separation of powers seems a difficult concept for the traditional business community to fully appreciate even though it has worked well and has been embraced in our broader political democracy. When we talk about independent auditors, we are talking about nothing else but the separation of powers. The Australia Democrats have sought, through the committee process, through our consultations with business and through advocacy in the Senate, to get an understanding of and a response to the sorts of philosophical beliefs which should underpin the way in which board directors and companies operate. In our view, you cannot approach corporate governance and corporate law without questioning the basic underpinning of corporate law in this country, which is dominant shareholder orientated. We think there needs to be a shift in the way in which these matters are addressed.
The Democrats will keep putting this proposal before the Senate and before corporate Australia in the hope that repetition of this concept will result in a greater understanding and support for the general propositions we are putting. Of course, there is nothing but dominant shareholder interest to stop companies doing that already and it is perfectly open to companies to change their constitutions but, of course, the way in which institutions and dominant shareholders vote will affect any prospect of that outcome.
The other aspect of the bill before us involves clarifying the application of section 197 of the Corporations Law. The government’s proposed amendment is designed to plug a hole that was identified by judges in the court case Hanel v O’Neill in relation to trust law. I am not a great supporter of trusts when they are used as a tax minimisation tool and I remain deeply concerned that the Ralph review mechanism was not used to limit them being used as a tax minimisation tool. However, I do believe in equity and certainty before the law. I do believe that, if trusts are available, the people who take advantage of them and order their business accordingly should all be treated equally.
I have received correspondence, which was referred to by my colleague from the Labor opposition earlier, from lawyers Jackson McDonald in Perth—in particular, partner Jonathan Ilbery, who is a life member of the Taxation Institute of Australia and who works extensively in the area of taxation and succession law. He is well known to all sides of the house and, of course, to the treasury department itself. He has pointed out shortcomings in the government’s proposed legislation. He is not alone as there are several other members of the Tax Institute and other bodies who also see shortcomings with the current wording. I understand that the government has also received this correspondence, has responded to it and has had discussions with Mr Ilbery but that the government does not fully agree—as yet, perhaps—that the problem as identified needs to be addressed in this legislation. In its current wording, the bill’s amendment may well create another problem which will need to be addressed by the courts in the future, at some cost to those who have to go to the courts, or will need to be addressed in a further amendment to the Corporations Law.
I do not pretend to be an expert on succession law—in fact, Senator Wong is undoubtedly going to be better in that field than I am—but an example which clarifies the difficulty with the current wording involves trust splitting in relation to a business like a family farm. Farms these days are often owned via trust structures. When parents retire from the business of farming, they often divide the business. The original trust is split up with a new trust set up for the active farming business going to, say a daughter, while passive assets established in another trust are distributed, say, to the son. Not all farming businesses thrive and many face financial difficulty brought on by drought or bad luck, and the farm may go belly up. In the new split trust arrangement, if the farm fails, there may be an argument that creditors can go after the personal assets of the farmer, and even possibly assets of the passive trustee. This is because they are trusts split off from the original trust of the parents—they are not entirely separate trusts for the purposes of the application of trust law—and that leads to an inequitable situation.
Trusts are established to avoid personal liability, except in the case of fraud; however, in the current wording of the amendment, it is not sufficiently clear that the directors will avoid personal liability in this particular situation. All people who establish trusts should be treated equally under the law. The current wording appears to be open to a number of interpretations, which will create problems for lawyers drafting trust documentation and when they are trying to assist people in succession planning.
This is a matter which is not only of concern to farming businesses but also important throughout the business community. While I respect their opinion, I am concerned enough that the government is unwilling to clarify the amendment recommended by someone who deals in the application of this law on a day-to-day basis that I have moved amendments today, which, on advice, would clarify the very points I have outlined. I understand that lawyers will always have disagreements about interpretation and I understand that if the government cannot see its way clear to agree to my amendment then it is imperative that it clarify instead, today, in this second reading debate, the situations to which their amendment will apply.
I understand that Treasury has advised interested parties that it may look at the concerns raised by Mr Ilbery, and it has given that assurance to Senator Wong on behalf of the Labor Party opposition, and that it will consult others in a possible further amendment to the Corporations Law. The danger with that, of course, is that, for the next 12 months or perhaps longer, the drafting of trust deeds and succession planning may be problematic, if Mr Ilbery is right. My judgment is that he seems to be. It seems that the government are plugging up one hole in the Corporations Law but they might well spring a leak somewhere else in doing so. That is why I propose to move the amendment during the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2005-11-10,"—I thank Senator Wong and Senator Murray for their constructive contributions. I note that Senator Murray does not propose to deal with his amendments in committee so—
—I will be, but not formally speaking to them.
—I understand that. Perhaps I might respond to your comments in the sum up of the second reading. In introducing this bill, the government’s chief concern is to remove business uncertainty in this area by restoring the longstanding interpretation of section 197(1). The amendments put by Senator Murray relate to the potential impact of section 197(1) on the practice of trust splitting. Specifically, it has been suggested that any limitation on a trustee having recourse to the assets of other subfunds in relation to post separation liabilities may ground a liability under section 197(1).
The government considers that this submission involves a misreading of this longstanding provision. The critical question is identifying the capacity in which the corporation is acting as trustee. A corporate trustee of a particular subfund of a trust will only be acting as a trustee in relation to assets of that subfund. It must follow that, in applying section 197(1), the trust assets are the assets of that particular subfund. A term in a trust deed that purports to limit indemnity from the assets of another subfund in relation to post-separation liabilities could not alone ground a liability under section 197(1). Such a term purporting to limit indemnity from the assets of an entirely separate trust could not. To the extent, if any, that the text of section 197 permits a construction suggested by Senator Murray, this would be inconsistent with the apparent object of the provision. Section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 states that:
In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act ... shall be preferred ...
I also note that, notwithstanding the long history of trust splitting and the even longer history of section 197(1) and its predecessor provisions, this issue has not arisen in practice. Moreover, the concern has not been raised by the accounting or legal professions. The proposed variation of this longstanding provision could have unforeseen adverse effects on the efficacy of the provision. This is an inherent risk in tinkering with the law in this matter. As such, the government does not support the proposed amendment.
I will make some other comments in the summing up of the second reading debate. This bill will clarify the scope of the personal liability of directors of corporate trustees. It will address concerns that have arisen in the light of the recent decision in Hanel v O’Neill, which extended the personal liability of these directors under section 197(1) of the Corporations Act 2001. Prior to the December 2003 decision of the full court of the South Australian Supreme Court in Hanel v O’Neill, section 197 and its predecessors had traditionally been interpreted as applying in very limited circumstances. Hanel v O’Neill radically reinterpreted section 197, significantly increasing the level of exposure to personal liability for directors of all corporate trustees. In effect, the judgment renders the directors of corporate trustees guarantors of any debt incurred by the corporate trustee on behalf of the trust. This radical reinterpretation of the law would affect all corporate trustees, from large superannuation trusts through to trading trusts running a small business. It is inconsistent with the treatment of directors of general companies who are protected by the insolvent trading defences. There is no economic or social justification for such inconsistency.
In introducing this bill, the government’s chief concern is to remove business uncertainty in this area by restoring the longstanding interpretation of section 197(1). For constitutional and broader policy reasons, the bill is not retrospective. As such, facilitating early passage of this bill is particularly important. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all stakeholders who made submissions on the proposed reforms. In addition to the clarification of section 197(1) of the Corporations Act, this bill also contains technical amendments to clarify the operation of a transitional provision in the CLERP 9 legislation. This will ensure that the auditor independence provisions, which applied before the enactment of that legislation, will continue to apply to financial years commencing prior to 1 July 2004. In conclusion, I take the opportunity to note that this bill will work to rebuild business confidence, importantly. It will also preserve the application of the auditor independence provisions of the pre-CLERP 9 legislation. I acknowledge and thank the opposition for its support of the bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-11-10,"—The stated intent of the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005 is to amend the National Health Act to improve vaccine funding advisory arrangements for the government’s funded National Immunisation Program, commonly known as NIP, as announced in the 2005-06 budget.
The intention of the bill, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, is to ensure that vaccine funding advisory arrangements place an emphasis on cost-effectiveness assessment and provide a transparent and robust framework for evaluating vaccines and making decisions on whether or not to publicly fund them. The EM states that the amendments will provide:
… a stronger focus on cost-effectiveness assessment by utilising the established transparent and rigorous decision-making processes of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) for vaccine funding recommendations.
Currently, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, ATAGI, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, PBAC, consider vaccines for listing on the National Immunisation Program and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme using very different criteria. When a vaccine is listed on the National Immunisation Program it is because universal coverage—to develop what is called ‘herd immunity’—is considered a cost-effective public health initiative. Those vaccines which are listed on the PBS, such as Hepatitis A and influenza, are not considered that way but are still required to meet cost-effective criteria.
There are concerns that the Howard government is increasingly looking to reduce immunisation costs by ignoring expert advice to add new vaccines to the National Immunisation Program. We saw this most recently with pneumococcal, oral polio and chickenpox vaccines. In the case of the latter two vaccines, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, tried to get ATAGI to reconsider their advice to list them—which, to their credit, ATAGI refused to do. As a consequence of this, and as a result of Labor pressure, these vaccines have finally been added to the National Immunisation Program.
It seems that the downgrading of ATAGI’s role in vaccine listing is a payback for this. This proposal was included in the last budget without any consultation with or advice to ATAGI and resulted in the immediate resignation of the chair of ATAGI, Professor George Rubin. ATAGI is still without a chair. We are concerned that the very substantial expertise that exists within ATAGI will not be utilised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, although I understand that there are a couple of new places on PBAC as a result of this legislation. We know that Minister Abbott has on the public record expressed disdain for the advice that health experts provide.
There are concerns that the Howard government will see new vaccines which are likely to come on the market in the next few years—vaccines against Human Papilloma Virus, which causes cervical cancer; gonorrhoea; and rotavirus, which causes intestinal flu, particularly in children—as addressing ‘lifestyle’ conditions and therefore not worthy of listing on the NIP. This change would potentially facilitate that sort of move.
The Howard government has a shameful record of inaction in the funding of vaccines for Australian children. As I have mentioned, there was a delay in listing the replacement of oral polio vaccine with inactivated polio for infants. There was also a delay in the introduction of chickenpox vaccine for children which caused inordinate stress and, potentially, some deaths in the Australian community. We know that ATAGI had recommended, on two occasions, the listing of those two vaccines on the National Immunisation Program. We have also seen a delay in funding of the pneumococcal vaccine. In my view, that funding only occurred after consistent and very vigorous agitation, particularly from the Labor shadow minister, Julia Gillard, who highlighted the continued risks to children of nonlisting of the pneumococcal vaccine.
ATAGI will no longer provide recommendations to the government on which vaccines will be funded by the government. This is the price that ATAGI will pay for giving independent advice to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Sadly, it is not just ATAGI who will suffer the consequences; so will hundreds of children and their families if sound health outcomes advice is not taken in a timely way by this government.
We will watch this process very carefully to ensure that needed new vaccines continue to be available in a timely fashion and that these will be funded through the National Immunisation Program when it is considered by medical experts to be appropriate because of population health evidence. We will support the bill with that provision. We will watch very closely the operation of vaccine recommendations made by PBAC.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (IMMUNISATION PROGRAM) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-11-10,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech on the second reading.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The purpose of the National Health Amendment (Immunisation program) Bill 2005 is to change the current arrangements for providing advice to the government in relation to the National Immunisation Program.
This bill will transfer some of the advisory powers of the government’s expert group—the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisations (ATAGI)—to the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The Government is going to allow the PBAC to take over the role of considering the cost-effectiveness of vaccines and to advise the government when it is making decisions on whether to publicly fund a vaccine.
The Democrats will not be opposing the bill but we do have a number of concerns that we would like to raise.
Australia’s record on immunisation has not always been as good as it currently is.
Back in 1990’s, statistics demonstrated that Australia had appalling levels of immunisation. The national immunisation rate was as low as 53 per cent—one of the lowest rates for a developed country and a disgrace for a country as wealthy as Australia.
There has been considerable work undertaken over the past decade by all levels of government to improve this situation and ATAGI has been an important part of those efforts.
They have assessed the evidence for new vaccines, taking into account their safety, their impact on the burden of disease and their cost effectiveness, and have provided frank and fearless advice on which vaccines should be subsidised.
Unfortunately at the end of 2002 we saw the government decide to ignore the advice of ATAGI—the very group that it had set up to advise and make recommendations on immunisation.
On 5 September 2002, ATAGI advised the government of several recommendations for the inclusion of new vaccines on the Australian standard vaccination schedule.
Among those recommendations was meningococcal C, which the government had already agreed to fund. However, also on that list were several other vaccines.
But the government decided it didn’t want to fund them.
The most controversial of these decisions was the decision not to fund the vaccine against pneumococcal disease.
The Government was finally shamed into funding this recommended vaccine in the last budget by extensive campaigning on many fronts.
And ATAGI was at the forefront of that campaigning. Despite repeated refusals on the part of the government to heed the advice of its own advisory body, ATAGI kept on arguing for the pneumococcal vaccine.
The Government’s decision to stop following the advice of its own expert committee on funding of immunisation has undermined the progress that has been made in promoting immunisation within the broader community.
Immunisation experts said that we should fund vaccines against pneumococcal, chickenpox and polio but in a move which can only be due to cost cutting, the government did not follow this advice. It refused to fully fund Australia’s immunisation program.
This caused confusion amongst parents and weakened the message on the importance of immunisation.
It took almost two years for the government to respond to calls for funding for the pneumococcal vaccine and the funding was only announced in the lead up to an election.
And now that that election is past, the Budget only contains funding for that vaccine up until December 2006. And there is still no funding for the chicken pox or polio vaccines.
By taking so long to provide funding and for continuing to refuse to fund all of the recommended vaccines the Government has revealed its lack of commitment to preventative health and measures that would save suffering and lives in the short term and health costs in the long term.
And just to make sure that it is not embarrassed in the future, the government is now stripping ATAGI of its advisory powers and transferring those powers to the Pharmaceuticals Advisory Committee.
It is true that there are new challenges in the field of vaccine development and vaccine safety.
More complex vaccines are being developed and tested. These may require increasingly sophisticated screening and monitoring systems.
They will change delivery schedules and simplify delivery technologies.
The benefit-to-risk ratio of some newer vaccines may be lower than that of many older vaccines.
Although safe and effective, some newer vaccines may be many times more expensive and deaths from the disease they prevent less common or confined to high risk groups.
Decisions about whether a vaccine should be in the routine childhood schedule, limited to high risk groups or given to school children or adults and whether they should be fully funded by government will become more complex and difficult in the future.
These decisions will be increasingly important in an environment where we face persistent warnings of a global flu pandemic and threats of biological terrorism.
Health spending is all about tough choices. In a perfect world all vaccinations would be free. But in a world in which we make choices about which vaccines are funded by the government and which are not, it is important that the opinions of immunization experts are taken into account.
Of course cost-effectiveness and health economics will also have a role in informing decision making.
It is true that one of the strengths of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is its use of cost-effectiveness criteria to determine under what conditions people will be able to access a PBS subsidised treatment.
However the PBS is not without its faults and there is no evidence to suggest that ATAGI were not performing adequately in relation to the funding advice they were providing to the government—there is only evidence that the government did not want to follow that advice.
Questions have long been raised concerning the transparency of the processes used by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, as the information they use in their decision making process is not made public.
There have also been concerns raised about the length of time taken for decisions to be made by the PBAC.
The move to a cost-recovery approach to operations, similar to the one used by the TGA, also presents some problems. Many organisations have raised concerns about the ability of the TGA to act independently when its activities are closely linked to income. It is difficult to see how this will be different with the PBAC and may have implications for the evaluation of vaccines.
It is also difficult to see how adding another body into the approval process will ‘stream line’ the process—which has been the rationale put forward by the Government for relieving ATAGI of its role in advising on the funding of vaccines.
One also has to question whether the PBAC has the necessary knowledge and skills in the area of immunization to be able to correctly determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccinations.
As well as doctors and consumers, ATAGI has immunisation experts on its committee. The PBAC does not have this representation and although the government has indicated that there would be two additional members of the PBAC with expertise in vaccines and virology, there is no guarantee of this. Nor have we seen the additional guidelines that the PBAC is supposed to consider when it is evaluating vaccines.
Decisions on new vaccinations will always be influenced by many different factors. There will be (often contradictory) pressures from vaccine manufacturers, the media, the public and lobby groups.
There will be ongoing debate about the merits of new and existing vaccines. Such discussions are an important element of a democratic society.
However it is vital that controversy over changes to the immunisation program do not undermine recent successes in increases in immunisation coverage.
The challenge today is to keep up the momentum amongst the community so that the decline of vaccine preventable diseases is maintained.
We do not want to go back to the situation where we were ranked 68th in the world, with immunisation levels below countries such as Vietnam, Algeria, India and China.
To this end we need a public that is informed by impartial, accessible evidence about the benefits, risks and costs of immunisation.
We do not need a process that is going to occur behind closed doors and which is controlled by politicians rather than guided by expert knowledge.
There is already a section of the community that harbours sufficiently serious doubts about the benefits of vaccination that they refuse to have their children vaccinated or to be vaccinated themselves.
Some people believe that information about the adverse reactions to vaccinations are, at best, being underreported, and at worst being deliberately suppressed and ignored.
They also argue that the benefits are hugely overstated.
It is true that people who raise concerns about vaccination are not a large group. Australia wide the proportion of all children registered with Medicare for whom there is a registered conscientious objection to immunisation is less than 1%.
But there are parents who report that people are pressured into having their children immunised because they can not get the conscientious objection form signed or because they can not access child care or schools if they do not have their child immunised.
Vaccination is not and can not be compulsory but the availability of the best possible information and evidence on the risks and benefits will always be the best way to make sure that people are making decisions armed with all of the necessary facts.
It is important that all adverse reactions to vaccinations are reported and that this information is readily available. It is also important that we continue to collect information on the effectiveness, or otherwise, of vaccinations in preventing disease outbreaks within the population.
It is important that decisions about vaccination, whether at the individual or government level, are made on the basis of information and advice from people with expertise in public health and immunisation.
Immunisation has been demonstrated by research and in the field to be one of the most effective public health tools we have.
Let us hope that this government is not moving away from protecting the health of Australian children and the health of the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (IMMUNISATION PROGRAM) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2005-11-10,"—I did grant leave for Senator Allison to incorporate the speech, understanding that if I had refused she of course could have read the speech into Hansard. There are, I am advised, a couple of aspects of the speech that the government is not happy with, but they are in her speech and they shall be acknowledged as such. The National Immunisation Program, NIP, is a joint Australian state and territory government initiative through which vaccines are provided free of charge to the Australian community.
Prior to the government’s announcement in the 2005-06 budget, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, ATAGI, provided advice to the minister on vaccines suitable for funding under the NIP, along with advice on the clinical administration of vaccines to the National Health and Medical Research Council. Following the government’s announcement, the funding advisory function is transferring to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, PBAC. This change requires amendments to the National Health Act 1953 to allow the PBAC to consider vaccines for funding under the NIP. The PBAC will retain the ability to assess vaccines for suitability for subsidisation through the PBS.
Australian government expenditure on vaccines increased from $13 million a year in 1996 to $288 million in 2004-05, a massive 22-fold increase. Despite this significant increase in government investment in the NIP, the immunisation program still relied on the same advisory structures as in 1998 when the ATAGI was established. The new arrangements ensure that the ATAGI is resourced to undertake the role it does best—that is, providing evidence based clinical advice. ATAGI will continue to provide advice to the NHMRC and the minister on the medical administration of vaccines. The PBAC is being asked to contribute what they do best—that is, giving advice on cost-effectiveness in a transparent and rigorous way.
This bill will extend the functions of the PBAC to consider and make recommendations to the minister on the funding of new vaccines under the NIP, with the system to take effect from early 2006. This will introduce a strong focus on cost-effectiveness and ensure the government receives expert advice on the cost-effectiveness of new vaccines proposed for the funding under the NIP and for any changes to the funding arrangements. In the 2005-06 budget, the government also announced administrative arrangements to improve vaccine pricing processes and the role of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority will be extended to include vaccine price setting. Vaccines currently funded under the NIP will continue to be funded according to the current arrangements. I thank Senator McLucas for her contribution, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-11-10,"—In the absence of a Labor speaker at this time, I will speak, albeit briefly. I cannot incorporate a speech because I tend not to write them these days and, with the raft of higher education bills coming before us, it is enough to keep up with the legislation. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005 is our second higher education bill for today. As senators would be aware, it is our third for this week and, just in case you do not think I am keeping track, it is now the eighth amendment to the Higher Education Support Act. As I commented in my earlier speech today, we dealt with the seventh radical change. I do not want to reflect on a decision of the Senate, but radical changes to workplace relations were passed earlier in this day.
This legislation deals with accountability requirements for the non-table-A providers and makes a number of technical changes to the act—technical changes that I will not seek to address in my remarks at this stage. The bill specifically, as senators may be aware, inserts a provision into division 19 of the act, which deals with quality and accountability requirements for higher education providers. It allows the minister to require non-table-A providers ‘to be audited as to compliance with any one or more of the following requirements’. They include: financial viability, fairness, compliance, contribution and fee requirements. Audits are to be conducted ‘by a body determined in writing by the minister’, and, without any amendment at this stage, this occurs at ministerial discretion. I say without amendment because I have moved an amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats that would rectify one of the difficulties—in fact, the difficulty—we see with the legislation before us, and that is, yet again, an unprecedented level of ministerial interference.
It is a very tight amendment, one that goes to the issue of removing that ministerial discretion and ensuring that providers are audited on a regular basis—that is, the audits that would apply to non-table-A providers would be conducted on a cyclical basis aligned with the Australian Universities Quality Agency audit cycles. That is instead of what is currently occurring—certainly in this legislation—which is that they happen at such times and in such manner as the minister requires. That is the terminology the government is happy with; we are not happy with it. We think the audits should be undertaken on a cyclical basis, not just when the minister decides, ‘Yep, it’d be good to do it now.’ This is discretion that he otherwise should not have, and we are seeking to amend that.
I note, just in case anyone from the government side wants to remind me, that I am aware that audits of table A providers are currently conducted by the AUQA every five years. The reason I have not stipulated a five-year cyclical basis is obvious—in case those time frames change. What I have done is make it very clear it should be cyclical—that is, regular—and that it should also happen at the same time as that quality framework allows. There is no reason for this inoffensive but constructive amendment not to be accepted by the chamber and, specifically, by the government. We think it removes that level of ministerial discretion—ministerial discretion, I might say, that is coming to characterise our higher education regulatory system and specifically the Higher Education Support Act.
I looked at the Bills Digest, and I am sure honourable senators have also referred to it, on this bill, because like many others I have been wondering why this is just dealing with non-table-A providers. The Bills Digest surmises:
Presumably, Table A providers have been excluded from this provision because they are statutory bodies which already have extensive reporting and auditing requirements. In addition, Table A basically comprises those institutions which agreed to become part of the Unified National System in 1989 and which accepted the Commonwealth Government’s role in monitoring the sector. Since then they have been providing the Commonwealth with extensive statistical and other information to ensure that Commonwealth policies are administered appropriately. It would be difficult to justify the imposition of another auditing requirement upon the public universities when they have a long history of compliance and accountability with Commonwealth procedures.
I emphasise this last part of the quote from the Bills Digest:
The non Table A institutions do not have this history and it is not unreasonable for the Commonwealth Government to introduce this auditing requirement to ensure accountability.
The National Tertiary Education Union have pointed out that table B providers are in receipt of public funding, obviously through the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, if grants relate to the national priorities or for research and training of research students. So there is a level of accountability that the community would expect. That ministerial discretion, particularly in relation to the time of the auditing, is something that I think should be fixed up, and that is what I seek to do with the amendment before us.
In conclusion: I made the point earlier that this is the eighth bill, that we are dealing with a raft of changes and that they are not positive changes. There may be some technical changes, some fix-up measures, some of which may seem a little inoffensive. But we have yet to deal with some positive total reinvestment in the sector and we have failed completely to grapple with fundamental issues like indexation of the sector. As I pointed out this morning and the other day, $911 million, up to $988 million, is required over the next four years to ensure adequate indexation and to make up for that $500 million that has been lost over the last decade or certainly since this government came to power.
Again, we have not had any legislation that deals with the issues of income support—removing barriers for students, injecting more money into scholarships or reducing fees and charges—the postgraduate sector, research or training and development. We are not debating the issues in any of these areas, and I do not suggest that we are about to do it now. The Democrats have put forward an amendment that I think deals with the vexed issue of ministerial discretion, which is becoming a quite ubiquitous thread in legislation that we are dealing with in the sector and which I would seek to curtail or at least put some constraint on, if not abolish completely—I certainly would in this case. I commend the amendment to the Senate. We will move it during the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005 and present the Labor Party’s position on this bill. The bill, as we know, provides yet further amendments to the Howard government’s flawed principal higher education act. Many of these changes are relatively inconsequential. The bill seeks to: clarify the definition of student load, ensure that the guidelines for incidental fees in relation to overseas students are specified in the higher education provider guidelines rather than in the Commonwealth Grants Scheme guidelines and establish the requirements that must be satisfied in order that a person will be regarded as a Commonwealth supported student. The bill also removes an obsolete provision of the Australian National University Act 1991 and corrects a minor drafting error contained in the Higher Education Support Act 2003.
The change of the name of the organisation formerly known as Open Learning Australia to its new incarnation, Open Universities Australia, is an additional component of this bill. The opposition supports this particular amendment and notes that the creation of Open Learning Australia, OLA—or Open Universities Australia, as it is now known—was a very positive policy initiative of the last federal Labor government. Indeed, the creation of Open Learning Australia is an example of what distinguishes the approach of federal Labor to education and training from the incoherent and reactive policy framework of the present government.
The former Open Learning Australia was established as part of an integrated and forward-looking public policy framework designed to foster non-traditional modes of delivery of higher education. Flexible delivery mechanisms were and are recognised by federal Labor as a vital and innovative response to the changing patterns of work force participation. The establishment of Open Learning Australia also responded to shifting patterns of life and work balance for many individuals and families. The opportunity provided through the flexible delivery of courses enabled workers and other individuals to study online, at night or in other ways that suited their lifestyles and time constraints. I am one of those people who benefited from that flexibility.
By contrast, the Howard government has been preoccupied with its massive hikes in HECS fees. Universities have been starved of resources following the savage cuts to operating grant funding imposed in the Howard government’s very first budget. The reduction of funding imposed by the Howard government of some $5 billion has been exacerbated by the stubborn refusal for nine years to introduce a fair and reasonable system of grant indexation—an issue that I spoke to in the chamber yesterday or the day before. This has been despite the fact that the coalition parties went to the 1996 election promising not to reduce Commonwealth funding of universities by one dollar.
There have been no serious policy initiatives from the Howard government on a par with the creation of Open Learning Australia. Contrast the establishment of Open Learning Australia with this government’s ideologically fuelled attacks on vulnerable students through the threatened withdrawal of support for essential university facilities, services and amenities. Nine long years of Howard government incompetence and underfunding are taking their toll on Australian universities. Massive fee hikes, a drop in the number of Australians attending our universities, chronic underfunding which is forcing institutions to increase fees, and threats to quality and standards are becoming the all-too-familiar hallmarks of the higher education sector under this government. This government is failing to promote policies that would allow a country with a dispersed population like Australia to provide its citizens with the opportunity for a high-quality tertiary education, no matter where they live.
The Howard government has spent the last nine years starving our universities into submission. Now it is being forced to contemplate radical restructures to survive—and we heard about that in a previous debate. The Howard government’s $100,000-plus full fee degrees benefit the oldest and most prestigious universities at the expense of newer universities. The plans for research are similar. Minister Nelson has even warned that some universities may end up without any research funding at all. The increased income from fees and extra research resources for the relatively asset-rich universities will increase their ability to pay a premium to attract the best staff from other institutions. At the same time, the Howard government’s unwarranted industrial relations agenda will encourage universities struggling to balance the books to drive down relative wages and become low-cost, high-volume institutions. The pattern is very clear. It will be a system of haves and have-nots, where the haves are struggling to keep up with international standards and the have-nots are struggling just to survive.
The Howard government likes to talk about diversity, but its policies have the exact opposite effect. We need look no further than the uniformity of university responses to HECS increases. Barely six months into so-called variable HECS and the variation is nowhere to be found. Only three universities have resisted HECS increases, and without proper Commonwealth funding it is only a matter of time before they too join the rush for desperately needed income, further burdening students and their families with higher fees. Rather than supporting all of our universities to continue to live up to their title, the minister is proposing to redefine and dilute what a university is. Watering down the definition of a university could open the door to fly-by-night providers and damage Australia’s outstanding international reputation, thereby jeopardising about $5 billion per annum in export earnings by the university sector alone. Defining the problem away by letting anyone who wants to to set up as a university is the easy and predictable response of a moribund government, but investing in the skills and innovation of Australians by supporting our higher education institutions to live up to their title is the right response. Against this backdrop, the bill before us is a do-nothing disgrace.
While the opposition does not intend to resist the various minor elements of this bill, it would be remiss not to mention two of the specific clauses that potentially are of some cause for concern. The bill provides for the clarification of quality and accountability requirements to ensure that higher education providers’ selection procedures are, in the words of the explanatory memorandum:
... based on merit in the providers’ ‘reasonable view’.
Taken at face value, this change would appear to be worth supporting, but we remain concerned that the amendment sought may lead to a softening of the fairness and transparency of selection procedures. The opposition serves notice on the government that it will monitor the impact of this element of the bill to ensure that transparency and fairness remain bedrock principles and practices in the selection and enrolment of students to courses of study in our higher education institutions.
The bill contains a provision for an audit to be conducted on the operation of so-called non-table-A higher education providers to determine their compliance with one or more of the requirements of the principal act. The opposition has consistently called for robust and efficient accountability mechanisms, including the capacity to undertake suitable audits of higher education providers from time to time. However, in amending the act to provide for audits in the manner set out in this bill, the opposition is mindful of the undesirability of excessive central regulation. The education minister is well known as someone who has exercised his ministerial prerogatives without due regard for the principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy. His breathtaking decision to prefer his judgment in relation to three Australian Research Council applications to that of an expert peer review process, together with his recently announced decision to axe the board of the ARC, are but two examples of a minister who does not understand what it is to regulate with a light touch.
While the audit provisions of the bill as presented will not immediately apply to table A higher education providers, one can only wonder how long it will be before the minister inevitably weakens in the face of temptation to apply such mechanisms to all such higher education providers. Such heavy-handedness would surely be consistent with the track record of this minister and this out-of-touch regime. In summary, despite these concerns federal Labor will support this bill, but we will watch the Minister for Education, Science and Training closely to ensure that he does not even further undermine quality and standards in Australian higher education.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-11-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
I point out to the Senate that early this morning I gave notice of this to both Senator Patterson’s office and Mr Abbott’s office, as he is the Minister for Health and Ageing. The staff from both those offices were advised that I would be requesting an explanation as to why these questions had not been answered, so I find it inadequate that the minister simply says she will draw this to Minister Abbott’s attention. Minister Abbott has become notorious, at least in my books, for not answering questions. This is not the first time that I have used this opportunity to ask for explanations and have been given none. The first of the questions was asked six months ago, on 11 May, in the middle of a debate about IVF and funding for IVF. The answer to that question still has not been provided.
I would argue that the questions have always been relevant to particular issues. Question No. 1031 asked about the most recent figures available for expenditure on the Medicare safety net. As you would be aware, Mr President, we have on the list of bills to be dealt with this week—obviously it will not now be dealt with until the next sitting week—legislation about the safety net and changes to the threshold. That information would have been very useful to us in that Medicare debate. I asked how many people had registered for the Medicare safety net in total and by electorate; I asked how many people have reached the safety net threshold in total and by electorate; I asked for information about when and by electorate the next Medicare safety net data will be publicly available; and so on. I also asked for national trends in suicide, which is one of the really serious health and social issues affecting this country. My question was about what those trends have been over the past 10 years, what changes were made in the late 1990s to the coding and classification of deaths in Australia and how those changes have affected the collection of data.
On 7 September I asked questions about ‘The quality in Australian health care study’ by Wilson et al in 1995 published in the Medical Journal of Australia, about admissions to hospitals. It was estimated that 470,000 admissions to hospitals occur annually in Australia because of medical mistakes. We in this chamber will be debating terrorism bills in a couple of weeks time. Terrorism has not actually killed anybody in this country, on our soil, and yet we have 18,000 deaths and 50,000 patients being permanently disabled to a greater or lesser extent as a result of medical mistakes.
I complain about the fact that we are not getting answers to questions from the Minister for Health and Ageing. Perhaps he holds the Senate in disrespect, as others appear to be doing recently, and perhaps he thinks those questions are not important. But I put it to you that they are. I put it to you that it is reasonable for the minister to get answers to those questions to senators—I am not the only one whose questions have been outstanding for very long periods—that it is his responsibility to answer those questions and that it is important for us to know those answers.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked today relating to workplace relations.
The industrial relations system has stood the test of time. Unlike what Senator Abetz has alleged about unfair dismissals being a recent phenomenon, one of the first things that the new federal parliament put in place after Federation in 1901 was legislation for the industrial relations system. The Australian Labor Party had been formed more than 10 years earlier to fight for that type of fairness for the workers and the common people of this great country. Today we see the Howard government’s extreme industrial relations legislation seeking to dismantle the basic fairness that has characterised this system since Federation.
The Howard government’s ideologically driven legislation abolishes the very structure that has safeguarded the rights and conditions of ordinary working people for 100-odd years. The government has misled the Australian people with its $55 million advertising campaign, which is full of spin and propaganda aimed at selling its extreme agenda on industrial relations. The ad campaign was in full swing before the Work Choices legislation had even entered parliament. The Howard government’s ideological industrial relations proposals are extreme, unfair and divisive and they undermine the principles of fairness that have underpinned the Australian industrial relations system for the past 100 years.
Under the Howard government’s extreme legislation, individual contracts will undermine the rights of Australian workers under collective agreements and awards. The changes will eliminate penalty rates, shift loadings, overtime and holiday pay as well as other award conditions. If the government think that will not happen, then they should hold their breath and, hopefully, they will turn blue. They will have to take a breath shortly after this extreme industrial relations legislation is put in place because they will be held out to have misled the Australian people about how unfair and divisive this legislation really is.
The changes will have a devastating effect on hundreds of thousands of Australian workers who rely on penalty rates to boost their wages, who rely on not only overtime and shift penalties but also other penalties and who rely on a wage structure that brings about an income that includes other allowances. Under the extreme industrial relations package that is going to be imposed on workers, those conditions will disappear. Employers will not bargain them away; they will rip them out of the agreements and the conditions that employees have had. They will ensure that the wage structures that have been built up since enterprise bargaining was put in place will be decimated. They will ensure that they reduce conditions to the lowest common denominator. They will not be able to help themselves under this package, because there will be no safety net. There will be no conditions to ensure fairness. If you call your five legislative minima a safety net, shame on you. It is not a safety net. The five legislative minima are full of holes, and you know it.
You can always tell when the government are in trouble because they have to wheel out not only the $55 million but also their employer organisations to try to support them as well. Look at some of the issues that get exposed. Last night on A Current Affair we saw that three young Telstra workers hired to sell the benefits of the government’s industrial relations changes were sacked after less than a month, even though they were told that their jobs would last for three months. It is extraordinary. This government is already trying to introduce its legislation by stealth. The observation on A Current Affair was that once the public started giving the hotline the cold shoulder these girls paid the price and were given the heave-ho. The government said that they did not need them anymore, and that is how the unfair dismissal laws will work. Employers will be allowed to rip away jobs from people without a fair hearing, without their being informed about how their employment conditions— (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-11-10,"—Senator Ludwig’s opening bat was that the current industrial relations system has stood the test of time and that because it is there it should be treated as a given. On that basis we would not have moved away from CB radios or LPs or horses. Just because something is still there does not mean that it is the best that we can do.
We have had two great pieces of news today. The first is the ABS labour force figures for October, which show that the trend unemployment rate is unchanged at 5.1 per cent. Also, there is fantastic news that the Work Choices package of bills has passed through the other place. They are two great pieces of news which go together. We are putting this package of measures through because we want to see unemployment as low as it can possibly be. Every workplace in Australia is different. Workplaces are changing and the needs of employers and employees are constantly changing. We need to have a workplace relations system that recognises those changes and that can be flexible and able to respond to the changes in the workplaces and in the economy.
We have to lay the foundations today for tomorrow’s economic growth and prosperity. We are enjoying great prosperity today because we have got the policy right over the past decade. Good policy today makes a huge difference to the strength of the Australian economy tomorrow. We can see that in real wages, which have increased over 14 per cent since 1996; in the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, with more than 1.7 million new jobs created and seven million Australians in full-time work; in the lowest levels of strikes ever; and in higher productivity and higher living standards. But Australian workplaces need to continually change so that we can continue to enjoy this sort of strength.
I would like to cite one instance of a workplace that was seeking to do just that—seeking to respond to its changed circumstances. I am referring to the firm Kemalex Plastics. Ken Phillips in the Canberra Times on Tuesday wrote:
Kemalex Plastics was based in Dandenong. It’s a family business running a struggling plant that needed improvements in work practices to survive. As part of the improvements the company had been using independent contractors for over two years. The National Union of Workers had agreed to this. But ... a new enterprise agreement had to be negotiated and the NUW—
the National Union of Workers—
said the independent contractors had to go. The owner said no.
The Colebatch family had been running this business for more than 50 years and had never experienced a strike. They did not know what was about to befall them: that they were going to face the full might, the full onslaught, of an ACTU-National Union of Workers organised industrial campaign. The campaign was for one simple purpose, and that was to use this particular business as an example to highlight what would supposedly happen increasingly under the new workplace relations laws being introduced by this government.
There was no great matter of principle at stake here. It was just an act of bastardry against an Australian business to make an example for a political purpose. After 10 weeks of violence, intimidation and media hype, the strike stopped. Why did it stop? Because the final public rally in relation to this particular industrial act had happened, that particular element of the ACTU campaign was over, so as a result the strike ended. The only problem was that it was too late. Mr Colebatch has since put the Dandenong plant into administration and the plant is broke for one simple reason: the strike cost that family business about $1 million as a result of legal fees, lost production, lost sales, plant and truck damage, excess transport fees and sabotage. That was the result.
This business was not a victim of cheap imports, corporate downsizing or globalisation; it was a victim of industrial bastardry. This was an Australian business that was simply trying to change its workplace relations to better reflect the needs of the business so it could continue to give jobs to workers, as it had done for 50 years. The changes that we are introducing, which have been passed in the other place and will come to this chamber, are designed to help businesses like this employ more Australians.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,19,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I also want to take note of the responses by Senator Abetz today in question time to questions asked of him about the workplace choices legislation or policy proposals. I say his ‘responses’ because no-one could judge what Senator Abetz said today in question time as coming remotely close to trying to answer the questions that were put to him. Senator Abetz said that there is a new regime in place. There certainly is when it comes down to answering questions in this chamber. It has been very evident over the past five months or so. The ministers either simply ignore the question entirely or have a rave about whatever rhetorical points of view they want to get across, and they do it with almost impunity as no-one is prepared to pull the ministers up on the relevance of their answers to the questions. We have seen that again today with Senator Abetz, and we are seeing it more and more with other ministers in this chamber.
Senator Abetz made some comments in relation to the questions asked of him. In one comment he said Work Choices was about genuine choice. It is certainly about choice. It is about the choice that the Prime Minister outlined the other day in the House of Representatives, and that choice to new workers coming into the work force is: take it or leave it. Take the offer or what? You do not even get the dole if you do not take the offer. You get dismissed off the dole, so you take whatever offer the employer gives you. When they talk about flexibility, what do they mean? They mean flexibility downwards. They mean the capacity of pushing wages down, because that is what the agenda of this government is. It has been exposed by Senator Troeth in the report of the agreement making and workplace agreements inquiry conducted by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee. Senator Troeth said, in part, ‘Government party senators take the view here that safety-net awards are probably too high ...’
In practice, let us look at the history of this government. The history of this government since 1996 is that, if its submissions to every national wage case, which is about the safety net and awards, had been adopted by the Industrial Relations Commission, workers in this country would be $50 a week worse off—that is, $2,600 a year less in workers’ pockets than is otherwise the case because of the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission. Why does the government want to set up the Fair Pay Commission? Is it because the Industrial Relations Commission is not independent? No. It is because the government can create a set of circumstances where it thinks it can get the results it wants.
That position of trying to force down wages was also reinforced not by a backbencher or a senator on a committee but by a senior member of the government, a minister in the cabinet, Mr Ian Macfarlane, who told the John Laws show—sorry, I mean he told the Alan Jones show; I should be more respectful to John Laws—that it was important to get wages in this country down to the same level as they were in New Zealand. What does that mean for every Australian worker? A 25 per cent cut in wages, because that is the difference between the two countries.
Let me dispel one myth perpetuated again today by Senator Abetz and Senator Fifield—that is, that wages have grown by 14 per cent. If you are in the top 10 per cent of wage earners in this country, your wages certainly have grown by 13.8 per cent. But, if you are in the lowest two percentiles, your wages growth over the same period of time is 1.2 per cent—and that is what people on the other side of this chamber describe as being a fair wages system. The only people to whom it is fair are the people at the top who are running the businesses in this country, because workers are the ones who are going to be—(Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2005-11-10,"—With six different workplace relations systems in Australia, 130 pieces of industrial relations law, 4,000 different awards and 30,000 different classifications, it is little wonder that the system needs reform. Workplace relations laws affect jobs, investment, productivity, competitiveness and economic activity, which in turn affect our living standards. Workplace relations reform is all about, for all of us, a stronger Australia for our businesses, our employees and our families. It is about people and for people—business people and working people. In the working relationship, these are the two important components.
Whilst past reforms have sought to make Australia’s workplaces more flexible and responsive to change, overly complex, operational, detailed and prescriptive awards and red tape associated with agreement making remain at the heart of Australian workplace relations. Work Choices will replace a rigid and outdated system that was designed over 100 years ago—a system designed to deal with the problems of the 1890s, certainly not a system geared for the challenges that Australia faces today.
Ten years ago, the union movement and the ALP predicted that the Workplace Relations Act would drive down wages, destroy working conditions and increase unemployment. How very wrong they were. Today, the mantra of opponents to further workplace relations reform is that it will erode fairness in Australia’s workplaces. They were wrong in 1996 and they are still wrong in 2005. The Australian people and the Australian economy have adapted well to change over the past two decades. Economic reform, including workplace relations changes, has produced benefits. The experience of the past 10 years is testament to this. Since 1996, Australia has achieved 1.7 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, real wage growth of 14.9 per cent compared to 1.2 per cent during 13 years of Labor government and the lowest levels of industrial dispute since records were first kept in 1913. For example, unemployment in the Illawarra, where my electorate office is located, has virtually halved since 1996. In the federal seat of Cunningham, it is down from 11 per cent to 6.7 per cent and in the federal seat of Throsby it is down from 12 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
The opposition does not have to take our word for it. Over the last few days we have heard from Minister Abetz. Today he quoted Bob Hawke when he was President of the ACTU. I refer the Senate to the remarks that the minister made on Monday, when he quoted former Prime Minister Paul Keating as saying:
Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals.
As Senator Abetz said, do they agree with that? Mr Keating was also quoted as saying:
It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net.
I could go on. One can look at other comments that have been made by Labor figures. Perhaps they ought to be paid a bit more attention. Mr Bob Carr, speaking in 1990, said:
In a nation of 17 million people struggling to modernise its economy, seven separate systems of industrial regulation are an absurd luxury.
Steve Bracks, in the Victorian parliamentary Hansard of 21 November 1996, said:
The Victorian ALP supports in principle the concept of a single national system of industrial relations, and it always has.
Simon Crean, when he was Senior Vice-President of the ACTU, said:
I think that there is a substantial view within the ACTU that there should be a movement towards the development of a national industrial relations system.
Bill Shorten, in an address to the National Press Club in 2002, said:
Variations in state laws are also time consuming and frustrating for employers. It is ridiculous that there are more than 130 pieces of state and federal legislation pertaining to industrial law.
I could go on. If the Labor Party do not take note of what we say, perhaps they ought to listen to what their own people have been saying about the need to reform industrial relations laws.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,19,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Abetz in relation to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. This bill attacks the standard of living of millions of Australian workers and their families. The government, in an attempt to convince Australian workers that they are being given choice about the changes to their employment conditions, is spending $55 million of taxpayers’ money on an advertising campaign about this bill. That $55 million could be better spent on skilling our young people, on education, on health, on providing more child-care places, or on addressing the problem of greenhouse pollution. There is no gain with the introduction of the government’s Work Choices bill—workers lose, and their families lose.
Consider what disappears under the bill. Unfair dismissal protection for workers employed by an organisation with 100 or fewer employees—gone. Job security—gone. You can be sacked without reason, and then the employer can employ someone else in your place under an Australian workplace agreement for less pay and inferior conditions. And there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Thirty-eight hours per week ordinary time—gone. The 38 hours per week ordinary time can be averaged over 12 months. This means you could work 20 hours one week and 60 hours the next. The government says you won’t have to work unreasonable additional hours, but you won’t know that you are working extra hours until you have met the annual limit.
What about the no disadvantage test which, when properly applied, currently ensures that you are to be no worse off under an AWA than you would be if you were under an award or enterprise agreement? The no disadvantage test—gone. The role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in handing down the minimum wage increase—gone. This role, currently carried out by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, will be handed to the Howard government’s Fair Pay Commission. Well, we already know how John Howard views increases in the minimum wage. We know what the government thinks of the current system. In October this year, in a report by government senators involved in the workplace agreements inquiry conducted by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee, they told us—and I quote:
It is likely that the legislation committee, looking at the proposed WorkChoices Bill, will be taking a closer look at awards and the no disadvantage test. Government party senators take the view here that safety net awards are probably too high—a matter to be addressed in the forthcoming legislation—and that this causes serious distortion in the wage structures, leading to discouragement of employment.
If the Howard government had their way, the minimum wage would be $50 a week lower than what it is currently. Australian families on the minimum wage would be down $2,600 a year on what they get paid currently. Since the Howard government has been in power, the cumulative difference between the Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s decisions and the Howard government’s position on the minimum wage is $50 per week. Had the Howard government’s submissions won out, the current minimum wage would be $434.40 instead of the $484.40 that it currently is—$50 per week less without the decision of the AIRC, which will no longer be part of the decision-making process.
In four of the years that this government has been in power, it proposed a minimum wage increase less than its own inflation forecast. Had it been successful, that would have resulted in a drop in the minimum wage in real terms on those occasions. Now, under the government’s new system of Work Choices, the next national minimum wage increase that will be determined by the so-named Fair Pay Commission will be at least six months later than normal. This means that Australia’s 1.7 million lowest paid employees will have to wait more than a year for a pay increase even to be contemplated.
Award security is gone, too. The government’s two-month award review task force to rationalise federal awards will result in employees’ conditions being slashed. There is no obligation as part of the review process to consult with stakeholders. Just in case the recommendations are not what the government expects, it is not obliged to implement the recommendations. Job security gone, wages reduced, conditions and entitlements slashed and safety nets removed. The estimated cost associated with the introduction of the government’s Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 is $489.6 million. It is not a happy new year for Australian workers, Prime Minister Howard. We know that the laws will hurt Australian families. That is why Australians from all walks of life will attend a national day of protest planned for 15 November. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the government’s response to the report Nursing: the patient profession.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Nurses have had to be very patient waiting for the government’s response to this report, Nursing: the patient profession, tabled in June 2002. Three years and four months later, that is 40 months later, the government finally has responded. A midwife could have delivered four babies to the same mother in the same time. It flies in the face of the last few sentences of the overview of the report:
It is time for the nursing profession to be recognised as an equal player in Australia’s health care system.
It is time for the voice of nurses to be heard.
The patient profession is running out of patience!
It is time for action.
Action is what the government has taken. It has taken 40 months for this government to respond to a very significant and important report that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee released in June 2002.
It is timely to see what has happened in nursing since this report was first tabled. In August 2005, the Productivity Commission’s draft report into the health work force emphasised that increasing the number of education and training places was critical for an effective work force into the future. If the baby boomer cohort of nurses leaves the work force at the same rate as previous generations, significant numbers will retire in the next 15 years. In 1986, 30 per cent of nurses were aged over 40 years. In 2000, it was 60 per cent.
In the 2004-05 federal budget the Australian government allocated an additional 400 nursing places annually to universities. However, the government’s own figures show that this is not nearly enough. In August 2004, the report by the Australian health work force advisory committee, The Australian nursing work force: an overview of work force planning 2001-04,said that for supply to meet demand, over 10,000 new graduate nurses were required to enter the work force in 2006 and even more in 2010. Currently, we have less than 5,000 nurses graduating each year. The compounding effect of being 5,000 nurses short annually is going to hit this community in such a way that I do not think this government has even contemplated. For there to be an adequate supply of nurses into the future we need additional undergraduate places of around 1,000 a year.
There are plenty of people wanting to undertake nursing but there are just not enough places for them. Figures from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee show that over 2,700 eligible nursing applicants missed out on an undergraduate place this year, representing about 20 per cent of applicants. The Senate Community Affairs Committee report Quality and equity in aged care, released in June this year, states categorically that there are not enough undergraduate nursing places and that the federal government needs to implement a mechanism to ensure that nurses working in aged care are paid the same as those working in the public sector.
Let us go to the question of nurses’ wages. In the 2002-03 budget, the Howard government increased residential aged care subsidies by ‘$211 million over four years to assist employers of aged care workers provide for increases in wages and improved work force conditions’. In 2002, the wages gap between nurses working in residential aged care and those working in the public sector was $84.48 per week. In the 2004-05 budget, Minister Bishop announced an extra $877.8 million over four years through the conditional adjustment payment to improve the financial position of aged care providers and allow them to pay more competitive wages to staff. The wages gap in 2005 is $191.83 per week. These are very important statistics. For a nurse in residential aged care compared to a nurse working in the public sector, in 2002 the wage disparity was $84.48 and in 2005 it is $191.83 per week. The government’s response has been absolutely inadequate to allow that disparity in wages to grow at the rate that it has.
We want to know what the minister is going to do to ensure pay equity for nurses in aged care so that those nurses currently working in aged care will be encouraged to remain there. The sector requires leadership from the Howard government in order to encourage providers to close the wage disparity gap. Ms Julie Bishop has been awfully quiet on the issue of wage parity. There has been an ongoing debate in the residential aged care sector about the capacity to bridge the wages gap. Professor Hogan, who conducted the inquiry into the funding of residential aged care, said in his report:
There is a secondary market in bed allocations. Its existence is evidence of the profitability of residential aged care and the willingness of some to bid for beds at prices reflecting net present values of expected future income streams.
Professor Hogan believed that there was a capacity to close the gap of nurses’ wages between the residential aged care sector and the public sector.
In 2001, the respected aged care commentator Professor Gray said the industry as a whole was fundamentally healthy and viable and able to achieve a 12 per cent return on investment, even if substantial rebuilding toward the 2008 certification standards was required. But, repeatedly, the sector says to me, and in many and various publications, that it is unable to afford lifting nurse wages to the acute care parity.
Ms Julie Bishop is the Minister for Health and Ageing. Why is she so timid to participate in this debate? She should, in my view, show some leadership and provide some clarity to the debate about the capacity of aged care providers to bring nurses’ wages into parity with those in the acute care sector. Before we lose more valuable aged care nurses, Ms Bishop should do what she is, in fact, paid to do and engage with the sector on this fundamental issue.
The Australian Nursing Federation, which represents 145,000 nurses, has condemned the Howard government’s industrial relations bill, saying it will have a negative effect on the working lives of nurses and their capacity to provide nursing care. The Federal Secretary, Ms Jill Iliffe, said that if the legislation were passed it would have a significant negative effect on nurses’ working conditions, career paths, wages and entitlements. Nurses face the potential loss of penalty rates for evening and night duty, weekends and public holidays, as well as the loss of classification based rates of pay and access to a meaningful career path. If the government think that these harsh industrial relations laws will do anything to relieve the shortage of nurses in this country, especially in aged care, they have rocks in their head. It is imperative that the community’s value of nursing is reflected in how we pay our nurses.
Having read through the government’s response to this significant report, the only thing I can say is that it is pathetic. So many of the recommendations by the committee have been responded to by saying, ‘That’s the responsibility of the states’. I have to say that our community is a bit sick and tired of hearing this government continually saying: ‘It’s not our job. Go and ask the states.’ Let us look at some collaborative effort, especially on the issue of wages for residential aged care nurses, and let us get on with the job. Our community is demanding it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I rise to take note of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and Australian Industrial Registry Report 2004‑05. This is a report that could almost be described as kryptonite to those senators opposite—kryptonite for a rampaging government that has put itself out as an industrial relations Superman, if I might put it that way. This is quite an interesting and informative document, as always. The commission has considered some very important cases during the year, and significant cases are outlined here. But there are important messages for the role of the Industrial Relations Commission that we need to make sure are understood, both by this parliament and by the government more broadly because, as you know, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—if this government manages to actually get its 1,252 pages of legislation through this parliament—will disappear under the new arrangements, to be replaced by the deceptively named Fair Pay Commission. The modus operandi of that Fair Pay Commission will be to drive down the minimum wage. We know that that is the case. We have been hearing about it all week. We have been analysing the legislation since we have, finally, seen it, and we understand now exactly what the role of the Fair Pay Commission will be.
This is a very important document for us to register, and it is important because the industrial relations reforms, that we are challenged with and confronted by in both houses of this parliament at the moment, are quite extraordinary and quite revolutionary. I have to say that the Australian public are not idiots. As recent public opinion polls have shown, they have seen through $55 million of brainwashing advertising trying to convince them that the laws are fair and balanced. They know that the reforms are the greatest threat that faces working Australians, and we all know that the government knows it too. They know that the purpose of the reforms is to tip the balance overwhelmingly in favour of the employer, and to strip the word ‘fair’ from Australian industrial relations.
The government knows this quite implicitly because there has been a series of local industrial relations forums around the country. In my home state of New South Wales the no-show list is something of a who’s who. The people who were not prepared to come and defend the government’s industrial relations reforms and the change from the Industrial Relations Commission to this new Fair Pay Commission include: Gary Nairn from Eden-Monaro; Alby Schultz from Hume; Sussan Ley; Kay Hull; John Cobb; Mark Vaile; Ian Causley; Senators Nash, Macdonald and Fierravanti-Wells; Louise Markus and Gary Hardgrave. And there are many, many more—people who were not prepared to go and defend the actions of this government, and the ideas that are to be presented in the Fair Pay Commission, to the constituents in their own electorates.
In some way, I understand why they would prefer the safety of their $55 million taxpayer funded campaign as opposed to the open scrutiny of a forum. Their absence was noted, I have to say. There is a plethora of local media detailing just how disappointed people were. There have been numerous letters. One, for example, from the Blacktown Sun noted the absence of their local member, Ms Markus, the member for Greenway. It said:
Meetings are organised by community members, and elected representatives should accommodate the community’s needs and not force them to accommodate your wants.
It just sounds like the mantra of this government. I am sure that Labor and minor party members and senators can attest that this is their experience as they have been attending the forums around the country. Whether it is guillotining or gagging or one-day inquiries, everything this government is doing is by force. I want to finish with a comment from page of 35 of this commission’s report, which says that while the Commonwealth had criticised the Commission’s past decisions because of their— (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-11-10,"—I also rise to take note of the document. It is an important document that is being discussed tonight in this debate in the Senate, because the AIRC has been a uniquely Australian institution. It is over 100 years old and it has served the Australian public very well. It is uniquely Australian and it has recognised the unique Australian trait of having a fair go all around, which is, of course, the underpinning policy position that the AIRC has always taken.
But, unfortunately, with the introduction of the new Work Choices legislation, we are, in effect, seeing the demise of this uniquely Australian institution. Why are we seeing its demise? Because, in effect, the government is replacing one of the major roles and functions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission with its so-called Fair Pay Commission. Why is it doing this? Because the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has taken its role very seriously. In fact, when determining the minimum wages for all Australians, it has considered those determinations in the context of being fair, in the context of living standards generally and in the context of inflation. It is instructive to note that the new so-called Fair Pay Commission has those words deleted from it.
The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has frustrated this government because, over the life of the Howard conservative government, which has always argued against any reasonable and fair minimum wage increase for Australian workers, the commission has applied what it has viewed to be a fair increase across the board. One only has to look at the figures. If the government had achieved what it had submitted in all the minimum wages cases through the life of this particular government, minimum wages would be $70 a week less than they are now. That, of course, has been a frustration for this government, whose intention is to drive down wages and conditions of Australian workers and to lower the minimum rate that workers need to be paid.
It is unfortunate that, because the government cannot get what it wants out of the AIRC, it effectively sends it into demise and gives it virtually no role under the new Work Choices legislation. This is not an uncommon position for the government. All critics of the government—all institutions or people who do not comply with what the government expects in its ideological approach to industrial relations—get attacked. In the case of the AIRC, it is simply effectively dismantled.
We saw an extraordinary attack by Senator Abetz in question time this week when Professor David Peetz, who happens to be the head of a department and professor of industrial relations at Griffith University, was attacked for merely presenting an academic paper that criticised the government’s reform agenda in the Work Choices legislation. He did so on the basis that there was no academic, economic or rational grounds for the Work Choices legislation actually delivering what the government wishes to achieve out of the legislation.
Instead of actually presenting an argument against the academic work of Professor David Peetz, Senator Abetz attacked him personally. He said that because, he had done research that had been sponsored by the ACTU, he could certainly not be considered to be independent in any way. It was quite a bizarre approach considering academics are often engaged by all sides of the political debate to do academic work to study the effects of different policy. The fact that people work for both sides from time to time does not discredit their academic work. He went on to accuse him of being a singer in a trade union choir. He accused him of writing poetry. What a terrible offence it must be. He accused him of writing ‘tasteless and infantile material’ and went on to accuse him of engaging in ‘moral equivocation about terrorism’. But not once did he challenge the academic work that Professor David Peetz submitted.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2005-11-10,"—Sadly, once again the Townsville City Council is being officially investigated by the authorities. Tonight I intend to expose unlawful behaviour at the highest level of the Townsville City Council. This is a matter that must be placed in the public domain, as the ratepayers of Townsville have a right to know how their mayor is running their city. Tonight I am making public the fact that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, are conducting an investigation into unlawful dealings between the Townsville City Council and NQ Water.
The ratepayers of Townsville have a right to know that the Mayor of Townsville, Councillor Tony Mooney, is currently the subject of an investigation by the ACCC into price fixing. Councillor Mooney asked NQ Water to artificially increase their bulk water price so as to make NQ Water’s price higher than the council’s price. Councillor Mooney wanted to sell water to Enertrade, a state government owned corporation who had, until recently, proposed to establish a new gas-fired power station in Townsville. The new gas-fired power station, if it were to go ahead, would require a large bulk water supply. In order for the Townsville City Council’s public-private partnership to be able to supply bulk water to the proposed new power station at a competitive price, NQ Water’s prices would need to go up.
Councillor Mooney apparently had no qualms about using a heavy-handed approach to some members of NQ Water. He sought to manipulate NQ Water’s pricing so that Enertrade would be forced to buy water from the Townsville City Council’s proposed public-private partnership plant at Cleveland Bay. The real rub for the Townsville community is that, if NQ Water lifted its prices, it would mean that all North Queensland industry and the ratepayers of Townsville would have to pay more for their water. Higher water prices would mean that Townsville would be a less attractive place for new industry to establish. What Tony Mooney was secretly doing was putting up the water charges in Townsville in order to make his own public-private project more viable. The mayor has gone so far down the track with this public-private partnership and invested so much political capital that he is prepared to sacrifice what is right for his community to serve his own base political ambitions.
This is price fixing and is illegal under the Trade Practices Act. Indeed, to aid, abet, counsel or procure a person to price fix or to conspire with others to price fix is an offence under the Trade Practices Act. Unfortunately, there are still people like Councillor Mooney who are prepared to break the rules—to collude with competitors and divide up markets so that they can stifle competition and inflate profits.
There are significant penalties for corrupt behaviour. Of course, such penalties only apply if you are caught. But anyone who has paid even the slightest attention to the media in recent months will now know that that is a very real risk. If the ACCC mounts a successful prosecution, the Townsville City Council faces fines of up to $10 million and Councillor Mooney faces personal penalties of $500,000. This is therefore a very serious matter.
Take George Weston Foods, for example, where a former divisional chief executive telephoned a competitor seeking to fix the wholesale price of flour. Even though the competitor did not agree to the scheme, the intent alone was enough to earn George Weston Foods a $1.5 million fine. The ACCC were alerted to this failed scheme by an anonymous tip-off, as they were in the case of the Townsville City Council. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission administers the Trade Practices Act, legislation that embodies competition law and continues to evolve to deal with evolving processes and practices of businesses, both good and bad. Local authorities and public utilities are not immune to the requirements of the act.
The ACCC has been undertaking an investigation into this matter for some months now. I understand that both the Townsville City Council and the Thuringowa City Council have been required to supply the ACCC with information concerning their involvement in NQ Water’s water pricing decisions. I can reveal here tonight that the Thuringowa City Council sought legal advice as to the legality of being involved in a decision to lift water prices and declined to have anything to do with it on the advice that they received from their lawyers, who said that the Thuringowa City Council’s two directors on NQ Water should not attend the meeting where this decision was proposed to take place. Lawyers correctly advised that what Tony Mooney and the Townsville City Council were suggesting was illegal. The mayor’s conduct threatens to cost the Townsville community millions of dollars in long-term benefits for very short-term political gain.
NQ Water is currently considering a request from Enertrade to sell bulk, raw water for Enertrade’s new power station. At the same time, NQ Water is conducting a review of its pricing structure. Not only is this price fixing but it is to the detriment of the city. Without cheap water, Townsville will never attract the industry needed to see it continue to grow. Councillor Mooney is so keen on ensuring that his water plant at Cleveland Bay stacks up so he is vindicated in his decision to commit so much money to it that he is prepared to sacrifice the long-term economic viability of the region. I am told that TCC’s price could be as much as double that of NQ Water’s price if this collusion is not highlighted and a spanner thrown in the works at this early stage.
NQ Water has the potential to produce water for industry that is competitive with Gladstone water board’s price. That means loss of jobs in the twin cities—jobs that Councillor Mooney is apparently prepared to sacrifice for his own political gain. NQ Water’s agenda and minutes also show that it was recommended to sell water to Enertrade last year, but this was not accepted at the board meeting. Instead, they are getting the AEC group, which is also doing the pricing report, to develop a report on the costs and relative advantages and disadvantages of the project. Tonight, I call on the mayor to justify to the ratepayers of Townsville why he has secretly attempted to lift their water charges and jeopardise jobs growth for the sake of a project that does not stack up.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Townsville City Council</title>,Adjournment,31,1
