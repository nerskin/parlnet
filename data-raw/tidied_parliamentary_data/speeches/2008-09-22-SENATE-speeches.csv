"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-09-22,"—I move:
That general business notice of motion No. 200, for the introduction of the Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Bill 2008, may be moved immediately and have precedence over all government business today till determined.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-09-22,"—by leave—The opposition is seeking, as we have just heard, to suspend all procedures until that bill is dealt with. The Australian Greens would amend that motion to first have the three revenue-raising bills, dealing with the luxury car tax, the Medicare levy alteration and the condensate tax, dealt with. We see the responsibility for dealing with the revenue raising as being equal with that for dealing with the expenditure. We believe all the bills can be dealt with this week, but we are of a mind to say to the opposition, ‘First, let’s deal with the revenue-raising legislation, and then let’s immediately deal with the expenditure on the increase in the pensions,’ which the Greens have, of course, initiated debate on in this place and want to see passed this week.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-22,"—by leave—I am not going to grandstand on the issue, but pensioners are doing it tough and for the Senate to delay a debate on the pension would be sending pensioners the wrong message. We call on both the major parties to look at a way of supporting a debate on the bill and maybe going through to the second reading pretty quickly so at least we can get to the issue. Frankly, if pensioners are listening to this debate and hearing that some people are wanting to stall and delay before we have a debate on the issue, that would be sending them all the wrong signals. Family First want to have this debate on pensions as quickly as possible.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-09-22,"—by leave—My position in relation to the opposition’s motion is this. I agree with Senator Brown that there is a link between a measure that will obviously cost more for taxpayers and tax-raising measures, but it is clear that there is a great deal of urgency and concern in the community about the issue of pension increases and how pensioners are doing it tough. My position is that there ought to be a debate up until the second reading stage of the opposition’s proposed bill. But, in relation to the third reading stage, given that Senator Fielding is moving a second reading amendment, I think the responsible thing to do is to look at the cost implications of the other measures that are being put and for the third reading stage to be delayed for further consideration in order that we can go through the process of looking at the ramifications of the bill and any amendments.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-09-22,"—by leave—The Labor government treat the issue of income and support for pensioners very seriously. That is why we are deeply depressed and disappointed by the opposition’s failure to treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves. We know that a week and a half ago the opposition said this was going to be their priority in parliament. A whole week went by when they fought among themselves over their internal machinations, and nothing occurred for pensioners other than two rather poor questions asked of me in the parliament. That was the extent of the effort. I take on board what Senators Brown, Fielding and Xenophon have said and indicate that it is not our intention to debate or delay decision making by debating a suspension. It seems to us that that does not assist the Senate. The government is focused on trying to get its budget measures through this parliament. The opposition have embarked on a schoolboy tactic of trying to talk out the second reading of the debate indefinitely so that we do not get to the substance of the issues, I think out of fear that they may not get what they want out of the committee stage of the bill. Their behaviour is unexplainable and inexcusable.
The government want to get on with government business; we want to get on with passing the budget at a time when Australia is under enormous external financial pressure and the instability of international markets is putting pressure on all economies. We want our budget passed, we want our surplus maintained and we want to have the capacity to provide the protections for Australians—families, pensioners and others—that are necessary. So, we will not delay the Senate by arguing the detail of suspension, although this is an unprecedented move by the opposition. Never before has there been a suspension moved by an opposition to bring on an appropriations bill. Our view is that it is clearly not constitutional. I know the Clerk has provided alternative advice; but we have advice from other sources. With all due respect to the Senate Clerk, he is not infallible. On occasions he may be wrong. On this occasion we argue that he is wrong. We all know that this bill, if passed by the Senate, will not be debated in the House of Representatives. We support the advice that for it to occur in that way is unconstitutional.
This is nothing but a stunt, but the issue at stake, support for pensioners, carers and those on disability and veterans pensions, is important. Look at the whole approach of the opposition here: first of all it was a bill only about pensioners, which ignored veterans, carers and those on disability pensions. Today they have thrown in veterans as a sort of afterthought. But this is clearly a stunt rather than a serious contribution to the issues that are at stake here. The government have outlined a serious piece of work to try to come to terms with the financial pressures pensioners are under. I indicate on behalf of the government that we are prepared to have the debate on the substantive issues rather than on suspension because we actually want to get on with real government business. The opposition ought to think about their position in seeking to delay budget bills. We have put a proposition that we will sit extra hours. We are keen to get on with it. We are already in late September and we are still debating budget bills. The opposition is still refusing to let us debate the questions that were contained in the May budget. This is not responsible.
—The luxury car bill has already been defeated. You will not accept the Senate result.
—Senator Minchin would well know that we are acting in total accordance with practice and procedure of the Senate. If there had been any problem with it Senator Minchin well knows he could have made that procedural argument. He knows that is not right. What we have is petulant behaviour by the opposition—absolute petulance—made worse, I suppose Senator Minchin, by your sacking from the defence portfolio, I understand. But that is not the point.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. Did the Senate give leave for a short statement or for a long argument and political speech by the leader?
—There is no point of order.
—I deliberately sought permission for a statement, Senator. You should listen.

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—I think it is an important issue. We are not seeking to delay the debate. I was not aware of the various positions the Independents and Greens were taking until just before or as they spoke. Our view is that if the opposition are to persist with this we would rather deal with it on its merits and put our case and move on. There is important government business that needs to be transacted. I appreciate the sentiments Senator Brown outlined. I think they are important. I have not gone to the detail of whether we adjourn at the second reading or the third reading. That is a question for the chamber. We will not be seeking to divide on the suspension if it is supported by a majority of the Senate. So if the opposition get support in the chamber for the suspension then we will look to debate the substance of the bill. But I do think that the opposition ought to think carefully about how they seek to use the time of this chamber and accept responsibility as an alternative government in relation to the budget. The Labor government will debate the substance of the issue rather than seek to delay the Senate by having a long debate about procedural issues.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-09-22,"—by leave—Let me make it clear that the opposition have said to the government that we will comply and cooperate with reasonable requests for extra time for the debate this week on those budget bills. The condensate bill has been on the Notice Paper before but it was put off. We have had previous bills where government senators have far outnumbered non-government senators. We have examples of that. We stand ready to cooperate with the government to get these budget bills through this week. In relation to this particular issue it was Senator Evans last week who criticised the coalition for not taking pensioner issues seriously and he himself said that it is important that this parliament do all it can to support pensioners. This is precisely what this is about.
In relation to the procedure at hand, I have sought to move a motion. I can agree to amend it to accommodate the concerns of Senator Xenophon and the canvassing of the second reading amendment by Senator Fielding. I will therefore be seeking leave to amend the motion to provide that general business notice of motion no. 200 for the introduction of the Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Bill 2008 be called on immediately and that the bill have precedence over all government business until it is read a second time.
That would accommodate Senator Xenophon’s concern in relation to the third reading of the bill. I impress upon Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding that this is a way of dealing with this issue and its urgency but also accommodating both Senator Fielding’s ability to put forward a second reading amendment and Senator Xenophon’s wish that it not proceed to a third reading at this stage. We would simply be moving that the bill have precedence but only up until the second reading vote is taken. That is what the coalition are now seeking to do.
I amend the motion to read as follows:
That general business notice of motion No. 200, for the introduction of the Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Bill 2008, may be moved immediately and have precedence over all government business today till the bill has been read a second time.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-09-22,"—As foreshadowed, I move on behalf of the Greens that the motion moved by Senator Ellison be amended as follows:
Omit “immediately”, substitute “immediately after the Senate has completed consideration of the orders of the day relating to the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 and three related bills, the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill 2008 and the Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill and related bill”.
I move this amendment because the Greens are firmly of the opinion that the bills should be dealt with in the order that we deal first with the bills which are to raise some $3.274 billion over four years and then proceed to the opposition bill to increase the single age and veterans pension by $30 a week. I can foreshadow that we will move to extend the single age and veterans pension increase to people who are on disability pensions as well.
There was a filibuster from the opposition at the end of last week, and we want to see these matters comprehensively, properly and seriously dealt with. Our proposal, particularly in view of the fact that we will be sitting longer hours this week, is to deal with the three government revenue-raising bills and to then bring up the expenditure bill. We can deal with all of those. If it is done in that order then the pensions bill can be taken through to determination later this week.
Of course, this does not at all interfere with the urgency of any of the matters, and I can tell senators from long experience in this place that if this course of action is supported and taken, we will get the same outcome but we will get a much more concentrated, pertinent and serious debate in the chamber in the coming few days. We have put forward this proposal seriously. It does not amend the outcome, but it does responsibly alter the trajectory to that outcome.
I would counsel the government to think again about not supporting this course of action. It is obviously in the interests of the government to get its revenue-raising legislation dealt with and determined, one way or another. The course of action that the Greens are putting forward will concentrate the minds of the Senate on that task because of the generally felt urgent nature of the Greens longstanding policy to have the pension increased by $30 a week in the way stated in the opposition legislation and which is now coalition policy, although it was not at this time last year.
I say to the government and to all members of the chamber: you ought to support the Greens amendment so that we can best get an outcome on all six pieces of legislation by the end of the week.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-22,"—This amendment may be well intentioned, but it is sending pensioners all the wrong signals—that we are willing to debate other issues before their needs. Frankly, I think we have taken so long to get to the point where we can actually have a decent debate on pensioners in this chamber that to delay it a minute longer would be foolish. I am making a short statement now, but I think we need to get to the issue. Family First will be moving a second reading amendment that we will need to get to about increases for disability pensioners; the parenting payment; carers, who are doing it tough; wife pensions; and all of those others. So we do not want to delay this at all. We want to make sure that pensioners get a fair go and a fair say in this chamber now rather than delaying it for other issues. The amendment put forward may be well intentioned, but it would stall the issue of the debate, which is giving real help to pensioners in need and giving them a fair go.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-09-22,"—I maintain my position that I believe that the appropriate thing to do is to deal with this motion. I cannot support Senator Brown’s amendment, but Senator Brown does make a good point in that if you want to give pensioners something more, the money has to come from somewhere, and there are $3.27 billion of revenue measures that are being debated in this chamber that I believe need to be dealt with sooner rather than later. My concern is this: I think we should send a signal to the community that the issue of pensions is an important one. It is a priority issue, and I note the work that Senator Brown, Senator Fielding and others have done in raising this as an issue.
I believe that the appropriate thing to do is deal with the age pensioners bill up to the second reading stage; but can I say, in terms of the matters implicit in Senator Brown’s amendment, that I think the people of Australia do want us to get on with legislation, get on with the luxury car tax, sooner rather than later and, whilst I respect the right of every senator to speak on every bill, I wonder whether some in the community would see this as a delaying tactic on the part of the coalition in respect of the luxury car tax measure. I hope we can deal with that sooner rather than later.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-09-22,"—I will place on record the reason for the coalition’s rejection of the Greens amendment. I can understand what Senator Brown is saying. But we are of the view that this is a matter of great urgency. In fact, members of the Greens have indicated how much they think this is important. We have heard statements made by the Greens that there should be a $30 increase for pensioners. We appreciate the concern that the Greens genuinely hold. We believe that this is therefore a matter which should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.
We certainly have other bills. We can deal with them during the course of the week. The tax bills will be dealt with this week; there is no question of that. But this is an issue which is important here and now. I agree with the comments made by Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon. We have to send a clear message to pensioners in Australia that we understand their plight. There is an urgent need for their plight to be addressed. This bill is a first step in that direction.
The tax bills have been moved around the Notice Paper. We have seen a great deal of fluidity there. As I said, the condensate bill was to be dealt with prior to the Western Australian election, but then was put off until afterwards. We believe that we have cooperated fully with the government’s legislative program. We will continue to do so and provide extra time. We think that Senator Xenophon’s suggestion that we go up until the second reading vote is taken is a good one. That also accommodates debate on Senator Fielding’s amendment, and we think that that is a reasonable situation.
For those reasons, we cannot agree with the Greens amendment, although we understand the reasons for Senator Brown moving it. We say with respect that this is a matter of great urgency. It needs to be dealt with now. We can still deal with those other bills during the course of the week.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-09-22,"—by leave—There have been a number of changes to the shadow ministry, announced at midday by the Leader of the Opposition, which of course affect the Senate. I draw the Senate’s attention to the fact that Senator Helen Coonan has been appointed the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, replacing the redoubtable Senator Ellison, who will be sadly missed from that position. I also congratulate all those senators who have been reappointed and who join our front bench. I note with great pleasure there is a very high level of representation of coalition senators on the shadow front bench—a record, I think—reflecting the talent that we have in the opposition in this place. I seek leave to have a list of the shadow ministry and parliamentary secretaries including Senate representational arrangements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-09-22,"—Could I indicate that, following a question from Senator Heffernan asked on Thursday, 18 September, I sought some further advice and have received that. I seek leave to have that advice incorporated in the Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Additional Information—Prime Minister’s Travel
During question time on the last sitting day (Thursday, 18 September 2008) Senator Heffernan asked me to confirm certain details relating to the Prime Minister’s official travel overseas.
I am advised as follows:
The Prime Minister spent 9 days overseas in 2007.
The Prime Minister has spent 43 days overseas in 2008.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Prime Minister</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,7,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-09-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by Senators Ferguson and Bushby today relating to the Prime Minister.
—It is with great despair, or increasing levels of despair, that once again I rise to talk about the government’s complete lack of empathy with or understanding of the deprivation and hardship that many of our age pensioners and those who are on fixed incomes and reliant on government support are facing. It is becoming a tired record when the coalition stands up here saying that we owe pensioners a better deal. We know that they are struggling with the cost of living. We know that they are struggling to feed themselves, to remain in adequate accommodation, with the cost of transport and just existing. Every time we raise this, every time we put a question to Senator Evans or someone else in the government, what do we get? They pass the buck.
It is a shame for pensioners, because, whilst the coalition’s priorities are about ensuring that people stand to gain from the bloated $22 billion surplus inherited by this government that they are not prepared to release to ease the cost-of-living pressures upon those who are amongst the most vulnerable in our society, what do we get from the Labor Party? Let me tell you, Mr Deputy President. Whilst pensioners are concerned with the price of petrol, the government says they cannot do anything anymore and they refuse to countenance or consider a reduction in the petrol tax or fuel excise. When pensioners are saying that the price of power means they cannot put on their heaters for more than a couple of hours a day, what do we get from the government? They say, ‘We’re going to put prices up through some of these cockamamie schemes that are going to increase prices for people who are really struggling in our society.’ When pensioners are saying they cannot afford to provide the sustenance that they require, what do we get from the Labor Party? We get complaints about the size of the stroganoff portions in the cafeteria. Where are their priorities? It is embarrassing. It is humiliating.
When we talk about and remind them of the unlivable pension, a fact that is acknowledged by the Labor Party—they know that people on pensions are struggling—what do we get? We have the unlimited travel of the Prime Minister. That is all it is. He does not care about pensioners. What he cares about is the 24-hour media spin cycle. He is talking about a global financial crisis while ignoring the financial crisis that our pensioners are finding themselves in today. He is talking about stopping short selling on the share market, but he will not talk about putting more food on the tables of pensioners. What more important thing is there, quite frankly, than helping someone to survive? According to this government, there is a whole lot more that is important. The price of stroganoff is more important down in the lower house than making sure a pensioner can get more than a loaf of bread and a jar of jam to feed themselves for a week.
Whilst the Prime Minister is in denial about these things and jets off into the sunset to talk in New York with bigwigs—including Missy Higgins, I understand—Ms Gillard and Mr Swan have acknowledged that the pension is not enough. We know Mr Rudd talks the good talk in the Labor Party because he promised pensioners:
… there is no way on God’s earth that I intend to leave them in the lurch.
Well, he has left them in the lurch. The government are lurching from one crisis to another and all the time they are focused on the 24-hour media spin cycle because that is what is truly important to them. The perception is out there: they really do not care about the impact on people on the ground. They pay homage to them and they pay lip-service to them. At the very first community cabinet they were asked, ‘Who can live on the single age pension?’ What was the response? There was no-one who could live on it. What have they done since? Nothing.
The Labor Party are going to say that they have enacted the coalition’s promises from before the election for utility services and things of that nature. They have done that—we accept that—but pensioners still cannot afford to live. When will the Labor Party get that through their thick skulls? Pensioners cannot afford to live and the government are doing nothing about it. That is why the coalition—together with some of the minor parties we hope—believe that pensioners are owed a better deal. We are striving to give them a better deal. Whilst the government are turning their back on pensioners and on the very real needs of some who have made the greatest contribution to our society over a long period of time, we are presenting a real alternative.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Prime Minister</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2008-09-22,"—As members would be aware, I am a new senator and this is the first occasion upon which I have spoken in a debate to take note of answers given during question time. One of the many joys of being in this place has been following the other side’s journey of exploration as they have rediscovered the socialist heart beating inside the Liberal Party. It has been Woodstock on the other side for quite a few days now. It is Puff, the Magic Dragon and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds over there. That party have in recent times rediscovered the power of the word ‘sorry’. They have rediscovered the republic. They have pronounced that this country does not need a surplus in its Commonwealth government budget. They have pronounced that they will abandon Work Choices. And they have discovered pensioners. We are now seeing the absurd situation where, after 12 years of doing nothing, the other side are trying to develop a heart with respect to pensioners.
The other side have discovered a new place on the left-right political spectrum and it is the confused place. Even the National Party are seeking to find the eject button. The new Leader of the Nationals in this place has declared that he wants to be a more independent voice, and no doubt that means a voice that seeks to no longer be heard alongside the confused voice of the Liberal Party. Under Mr Turnbull’s new leadership of the Liberal Party we see the same confused adherence to this notion of trying to find the bleeding socialist heart of the Liberal Party.
They complain about the fact that the Prime Minister of Australia is going overseas. What a nonsense this is. The Prime Minister has rushed straight to the front line. He has gone exactly where this country needs him. In support of that proposition, I bring to bear the weight of no less powerful an authority than Malcolm Turnbull himself, who said recently:
There is very great concern about the situation here in America and that’s really the reason I’m here. The security, the mortgages, the homes, the jobs of Australians depend in large measure on the international developments coming out of the United States of this credit crisis, so it was important for me as Shadow Treasurer to come here ...
I am sure in reading that I did not give proper weight to the pomposity with which it was originally said, but the intent is clear. Until recently, the other side understood that visiting the United States of America was critical in dealing with some of the challenges facing this country, not the least of which is the financial crisis.
What will Mr Rudd be doing when he is in the United States of America? There could not be a greater opportunity for our head of government to meet with the heads of state of other critical nations. In fact, 13 of the 15 heads of state of the biggest economies of the world will be in attendance at the United Nations General Assembly. Of course, 222 government heads of state are attending the assembly. But, of course, for the other side it is all a magical mystery tour.
—Try talking about pensioners.
—You might have tried talking about pensioners for the last 12 years, Senator Barnett, but you did not find your voice. The question has to be: what has changed? How is it that pensioners were entitled to nothing nine months ago and now suddenly the other side have decided that pensioners are deserving of a change?
This government has compassion and economic responsibility at its heart, both attributes completely absent from the other side both when they were in office and now that they are out of office. The Liberals are completely obsessed with their own internal politics, obsessed with the new purge of the Liberal Party by this ‘time of the moderates’. They are still adhering to this absurd idea that the Prime Minister should not be going overseas.
Pensions are presently to be subject to a holistic review. In this review this government is going to be looking at pensioners’ circumstances in a proper and considered manner and will be considering their entitlements in the context of both what is required and what is affordable. This review is not off the cuff or shooting from the hip. It is not simply a political stunt. It is not something that ignores 2.2 million beneficiaries, as the other side’s stunt bill does. The other side are presenting a false dawn. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Prime Minister</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-09-22,"—It is worth reminding those opposite that in debating the motion moved by Senator Bernardi we are talking about the plight of pensioners in this country. I wonder what the Australian pensioners listening to this broadcast today—and there would be quite a few of them, as we know—are thinking, with the sort of conversation that has gone on today in this place, about the priorities the parliament has with respect to their needs and the crisis they are facing with the cost of living.
Senator Feeney may be interested in hammering the issue of the Prime Minister’s overseas travel but that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about the fact that pensioners in Australia today are doing it tough. I would like to refer to the language used not by this side but by the now minister, Minister Macklin, when she introduced, in the second half of last year, the motion for an inquiry into the cost-of-living pressures facing older Australians. At that time she said that Australian pensioners were doing it tough and that they wanted action. They wanted something done about this issue. The inquiry was held. Members of this place were part of that inquiry and they found that there was a problem. They found that pensioners needed some reconsideration of the base level of payment of pensions in this country. We particularly, in that inquiry, drew attention to the problem of single pensioners vis-a-vis the amounts being paid to couple pensioners.
We are proposing today to do something about that, to make something change and to deal with that issue. We have put on the table a comprehensive and immediate response to that problem because we accept, as we did last year when this inquiry was moved and we agreed to it immediately, that we need to act on this question. Australian pensioners are doing it tough. The question is worth asking, ‘What has changed for those pensioners in the last 12 months?’ What has changed is that the government announced in their budget earlier this year that they were going to make certain payments or allowances available to pensioners—but, of course, that was simply to put on a different footing payments that had been made by the previous government. The question is perhaps more pertinently phrased, ‘What are they not doing?’ What is this government not doing about pensions and their adequacy in this country? What they are not doing is addressing the question of the rising costs of groceries. Nobody in this country who looks at the GROCERYchoice website would attain any benefit from looking at that site as to what they should do to bring down the cost of purchasing groceries each week.
The government are doing nothing about petrol. Even if the government’s deeply flawed Fuelwatch scheme were to be actually implemented by this place, we know that it would cut out those cheap Tuesdays. Who uses those cheap Tuesdays to get low-cost petrol in this country? Pensioners do. That is going out the window if your Fuelwatch scheme happens to get up and, of course, that is a very serious blow to those people who rely on those sorts of measures to get cheaper petrol. They are pushing inflation up through a range of measures in this budget and this is going to increase the cost of living for people across the board. They are also forcing hundreds of thousands of Australians—again, it is very likely primarily pensioners in that group—out of private health insurance by pushing up the cost of private health insurance premiums. Up to one million Australians could be leaving private health insurance as a result of the measures this government is taking. Pensioners will, no doubt, be foremost among that group.
I want to address this myth—this myth the Labor Party perpetuates—about the former government having done nothing to deal with the pensioners. Today the single age pension stands at $273.40 per week. If it had not been for the decision that the coalition made in 1997 to adjust pensions by reference to MTAWE—not just to the CPI—that rate would be only slightly above $200 per week. In other words, $72.80 of the $273 or so that pensioners receive today is attributable to our decision to adjust pensions by reference to MTAWE. That is what we did. What have you done, and what will you do? I suggest you look at the proposal put on the table by the coalition and you back it—because that is a real measure to make sure that pensioners in this country are able to take advantage of a real change to benefit their standard of living, and it is a real measure of action in this area.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Prime Minister</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2008-09-22,"—I do not know that I have heard so much interesting conversation for such a long time. It is just astounding to me that the other side have, all of a sudden, developed this social conscience. They had 12½ years to develop a social conscience and they could not do it. They could have, but they would not. They actually voted it down. But now they have become the saviours of the pensioners. I find that quite sickening and I am sure that the pensioners are not conned at all either, because they know that for 12½ years the other side did very, very little to help them.
—They supported our bill.
—That is not so, according to some things I have read, Senator Barnett. Over the coming months the Rudd government is fixing the whole system, root and branch, and fixing it for everyone. Today, all of a sudden, we saw just about everyone being included in the arguments. Last week it was such an important issue that there were only two questions on it in the whole of question time for the week. Did you all travel down the road to Damascus over the weekend? I do not quite know what has gone on on that side. Something heart-warming has happened over there—and I am pleased to see that it has finally happened. But it is 12½ years too late.
We are undertaking to fix the problems with the age pension and the payments for carers and for people with disabilities. We know that they are finding it hard to make ends meet and we are looking at the best way of providing some security for the long term. We are not offering them one-stop fixes that say, ‘Here we are coming up to an election; we will offer you an extra $500 and we think that you are all so silly that you will vote for us.’ Thankfully they were not so silly—I do not think they are silly at all—and thankfully they did not actually vote for you when it came to choosing who would win government.
Over the last 10 to 15 years—that is, under the Howard government—pensioners saw growth in their pensions of about two per cent, in real terms, above inflation. So, in regard to what Senator Humphries was saying, this growth was actually below average household disposable income growth. The pension review is looking at the frequency of payments, including the effectiveness of lump sum or bonus payments versus ongoing support. The previous government’s practice of paying one-off bonuses to carers and seniors when the budget allowed created uncertainty. Pensioners would hang out to see if they were actually going to get a bonus or not. We need some certainty and security for these Australians. They need to be able to know whether the money is going to be there and they need to be able to access it.
I am just amazed at the backflip the coalition have done. They could not come up with $30 a week last year, but today they want to offer the world and it is a complete joke. They are not really determined to fix their mistakes; they have left it to us to fix them and then they cry wolf over the fact that it might take us some time to do so because we choose to do it properly, not just to have a quick-fix approach. The Liberals will not support the government’s legislation on luxury car tax or the Medicare levy but all of a sudden they are happy to have us spend the money willy-nilly from the budget.
—You’ve got a $22 billion surplus.
—We are responsible over here. We acknowledge that there is a problem and people are doing it hard, but we also acknowledge that any fix needs to be done in a proper manner, making sure that there is security for these people. The Liberals’ economic irresponsibility beggars belief as far as I am concerned. This is a complex issue and I do not think the opposition are serious at all. I think you are just grandstanding for political media runs and that is just despicable. As I said, you only had two questions in regard to this issue in the whole of question time last week—
—Order! Senator Bilyk, I am loath to interrupt but you must address your remarks through the chair.
—Through you, Mr Deputy President, the opposition only had two questions in the whole of question time last week on this issue. If they were serious about this issue, they would have had a lot more questions. There was a lot of posturing going on last week. I could just about time every 3½ minutes when Senator Abetz would jump up on a point of order—it was a bit Pavlovian. The opposition have to be more serious about what they put their minds to. How do you think people feel? People are not silly, they do not think that just because— (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2008-09-22,"—I stand today to speak in support of the motion moved by Senator Bernardi to take note of answers from government ministers with respect to pensioners. Pensioners are doing it hard. The Rudd Labor government do not care about pensioners. That has been demonstrated not only today but in recent days through the government’s inaction in their lack of support for our opposition legislation to increase the base rate for the single age pension by $30 a week.
It is very disappointing indeed when they know full well that they can support this legislation, this initiative, and make a difference in the lives of pensioners across Australia. They know that since they were elected there has been upward pressure on prices with respect to groceries. They know there have been increases in petrol prices. It is very hard. I can quote Senator Bilyk when she said, ‘I know it is hard for pensioners to make ends meet.’ Too right; I am glad she knows that. I know that senators in this chamber are aware of that.
I had an incident only last week where a local pensioner in my home town of Launceston was expressing extreme concern about her ability to pay the bills: the heating bill and the power bill, and to pay for food. She was referring to one of her friends who had an extra cost of upgrading the bathroom for a new shower screen. These are real-life examples where pensioners need help. For some people in the government $30 a week may not sound like a lot, but it means a lot right now and pensioners need it now. The government have said, ‘Yes, let’s have a review.’ For goodness sake, they have 165-odd reviews going on at the moment. My understanding is that the review they are talking about will not report until early next year and then, of course, they are going to have to consider the report that is delivered and we probably will not see anything announced until the May budget next year. We are talking about September 2008; we are talking about now.
The fact is this government are big on smoke screens, big on symbolism and very, very short on action—doing and delivering. Actions speak louder than words; we all know that, and the government could get behind this coalition bill to make a difference in the lives of pensioners. We have seen the dilatory approach to the management of our economy by the Rudd Labor government. Sadly, as a result of the budget, with an increase in spending, we have seen the increase in taxes and of course we have had the increase in grocery prices, the increase in petrol prices and upward pressures all round.
That is particularly so in rural and regional parts of Australia, but in Tasmania for example, in the northern parts, petrol prices are up to 15c per litre higher than they are in the southern part of the state and indeed they are significantly higher than in Melbourne and Sydney. It is so much harder for pensioners in Tasmania than those in other parts of Australia. So $30 a week is important; we can deliver that and it would be a very good result.
We are all concerned for pensioners but we can deliver and make a difference in their lives. We all know that a fair whack of them would be eating blackberry jam—why is that? The reason is that it is the poor man’s strawberry jam. They would be eating blackberry jam because they do not have the money to pay for a decent amount of food and groceries each week. It is hard going for them. Let us make it very clear that this government should turn around—if you call it a backflip, we will welcome it. They have been saying: ‘No, no, no. Yes, pensioners are hurting, they need help.’ Then they say, ‘Let’s have a review that will report early next year’—that is, the Henry review. Mr Rudd has dudded the pensioners and he should do a backflip and support this immediate increase for pensioners. We have done the hard yards in government. We have delivered a strong economy. The Rudd Labor government have a $22 billion surplus. They can use some of that and they can use it wisely in supporting this legislation put forward by the coalition.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-09-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by Senators Ferguson and Bushby today relating to the Prime Minister.
—It is with great despair, or increasing levels of despair, that once again I rise to talk about the government’s complete lack of empathy with or understanding of the deprivation and hardship that many of our age pensioners and those who are on fixed incomes and reliant on government support are facing. It is becoming a tired record when the coalition stands up here saying that we owe pensioners a better deal. We know that they are struggling with the cost of living. We know that they are struggling to feed themselves, to remain in adequate accommodation, with the cost of transport and just existing. Every time we raise this, every time we put a question to Senator Evans or someone else in the government, what do we get? They pass the buck.
It is a shame for pensioners, because, whilst the coalition’s priorities are about ensuring that people stand to gain from the bloated $22 billion surplus inherited by this government that they are not prepared to release to ease the cost-of-living pressures upon those who are amongst the most vulnerable in our society, what do we get from the Labor Party? Let me tell you, Mr Deputy President. Whilst pensioners are concerned with the price of petrol, the government says they cannot do anything anymore and they refuse to countenance or consider a reduction in the petrol tax or fuel excise. When pensioners are saying that the price of power means they cannot put on their heaters for more than a couple of hours a day, what do we get from the government? They say, ‘We’re going to put prices up through some of these cockamamie schemes that are going to increase prices for people who are really struggling in our society.’ When pensioners are saying they cannot afford to provide the sustenance that they require, what do we get from the Labor Party? We get complaints about the size of the stroganoff portions in the cafeteria. Where are their priorities? It is embarrassing. It is humiliating.
When we talk about and remind them of the unlivable pension, a fact that is acknowledged by the Labor Party—they know that people on pensions are struggling—what do we get? We have the unlimited travel of the Prime Minister. That is all it is. He does not care about pensioners. What he cares about is the 24-hour media spin cycle. He is talking about a global financial crisis while ignoring the financial crisis that our pensioners are finding themselves in today. He is talking about stopping short selling on the share market, but he will not talk about putting more food on the tables of pensioners. What more important thing is there, quite frankly, than helping someone to survive? According to this government, there is a whole lot more that is important. The price of stroganoff is more important down in the lower house than making sure a pensioner can get more than a loaf of bread and a jar of jam to feed themselves for a week.
Whilst the Prime Minister is in denial about these things and jets off into the sunset to talk in New York with bigwigs—including Missy Higgins, I understand—Ms Gillard and Mr Swan have acknowledged that the pension is not enough. We know Mr Rudd talks the good talk in the Labor Party because he promised pensioners:
… there is no way on God’s earth that I intend to leave them in the lurch.
Well, he has left them in the lurch. The government are lurching from one crisis to another and all the time they are focused on the 24-hour media spin cycle because that is what is truly important to them. The perception is out there: they really do not care about the impact on people on the ground. They pay homage to them and they pay lip-service to them. At the very first community cabinet they were asked, ‘Who can live on the single age pension?’ What was the response? There was no-one who could live on it. What have they done since? Nothing.
The Labor Party are going to say that they have enacted the coalition’s promises from before the election for utility services and things of that nature. They have done that—we accept that—but pensioners still cannot afford to live. When will the Labor Party get that through their thick skulls? Pensioners cannot afford to live and the government are doing nothing about it. That is why the coalition—together with some of the minor parties we hope—believe that pensioners are owed a better deal. We are striving to give them a better deal. Whilst the government are turning their back on pensioners and on the very real needs of some who have made the greatest contribution to our society over a long period of time, we are presenting a real alternative.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,2
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2008-09-22,"—As members would be aware, I am a new senator and this is the first occasion upon which I have spoken in a debate to take note of answers given during question time. One of the many joys of being in this place has been following the other side’s journey of exploration as they have rediscovered the socialist heart beating inside the Liberal Party. It has been Woodstock on the other side for quite a few days now. It is Puff, the Magic Dragon and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds over there. That party have in recent times rediscovered the power of the word ‘sorry’. They have rediscovered the republic. They have pronounced that this country does not need a surplus in its Commonwealth government budget. They have pronounced that they will abandon Work Choices. And they have discovered pensioners. We are now seeing the absurd situation where, after 12 years of doing nothing, the other side are trying to develop a heart with respect to pensioners.
The other side have discovered a new place on the left-right political spectrum and it is the confused place. Even the National Party are seeking to find the eject button. The new Leader of the Nationals in this place has declared that he wants to be a more independent voice, and no doubt that means a voice that seeks to no longer be heard alongside the confused voice of the Liberal Party. Under Mr Turnbull’s new leadership of the Liberal Party we see the same confused adherence to this notion of trying to find the bleeding socialist heart of the Liberal Party.
They complain about the fact that the Prime Minister of Australia is going overseas. What a nonsense this is. The Prime Minister has rushed straight to the front line. He has gone exactly where this country needs him. In support of that proposition, I bring to bear the weight of no less powerful an authority than Malcolm Turnbull himself, who said recently:
There is very great concern about the situation here in America and that’s really the reason I’m here. The security, the mortgages, the homes, the jobs of Australians depend in large measure on the international developments coming out of the United States of this credit crisis, so it was important for me as Shadow Treasurer to come here ...
I am sure in reading that I did not give proper weight to the pomposity with which it was originally said, but the intent is clear. Until recently, the other side understood that visiting the United States of America was critical in dealing with some of the challenges facing this country, not the least of which is the financial crisis.
What will Mr Rudd be doing when he is in the United States of America? There could not be a greater opportunity for our head of government to meet with the heads of state of other critical nations. In fact, 13 of the 15 heads of state of the biggest economies of the world will be in attendance at the United Nations General Assembly. Of course, 222 government heads of state are attending the assembly. But, of course, for the other side it is all a magical mystery tour.
—Try talking about pensioners.
—You might have tried talking about pensioners for the last 12 years, Senator Barnett, but you did not find your voice. The question has to be: what has changed? How is it that pensioners were entitled to nothing nine months ago and now suddenly the other side have decided that pensioners are deserving of a change?
This government has compassion and economic responsibility at its heart, both attributes completely absent from the other side both when they were in office and now that they are out of office. The Liberals are completely obsessed with their own internal politics, obsessed with the new purge of the Liberal Party by this ‘time of the moderates’. They are still adhering to this absurd idea that the Prime Minister should not be going overseas.
Pensions are presently to be subject to a holistic review. In this review this government is going to be looking at pensioners’ circumstances in a proper and considered manner and will be considering their entitlements in the context of both what is required and what is affordable. This review is not off the cuff or shooting from the hip. It is not simply a political stunt. It is not something that ignores 2.2 million beneficiaries, as the other side’s stunt bill does. The other side are presenting a false dawn. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-09-22,"—It is worth reminding those opposite that in debating the motion moved by Senator Bernardi we are talking about the plight of pensioners in this country. I wonder what the Australian pensioners listening to this broadcast today—and there would be quite a few of them, as we know—are thinking, with the sort of conversation that has gone on today in this place, about the priorities the parliament has with respect to their needs and the crisis they are facing with the cost of living.
Senator Feeney may be interested in hammering the issue of the Prime Minister’s overseas travel but that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about the fact that pensioners in Australia today are doing it tough. I would like to refer to the language used not by this side but by the now minister, Minister Macklin, when she introduced, in the second half of last year, the motion for an inquiry into the cost-of-living pressures facing older Australians. At that time she said that Australian pensioners were doing it tough and that they wanted action. They wanted something done about this issue. The inquiry was held. Members of this place were part of that inquiry and they found that there was a problem. They found that pensioners needed some reconsideration of the base level of payment of pensions in this country. We particularly, in that inquiry, drew attention to the problem of single pensioners vis-a-vis the amounts being paid to couple pensioners.
We are proposing today to do something about that, to make something change and to deal with that issue. We have put on the table a comprehensive and immediate response to that problem because we accept, as we did last year when this inquiry was moved and we agreed to it immediately, that we need to act on this question. Australian pensioners are doing it tough. The question is worth asking, ‘What has changed for those pensioners in the last 12 months?’ What has changed is that the government announced in their budget earlier this year that they were going to make certain payments or allowances available to pensioners—but, of course, that was simply to put on a different footing payments that had been made by the previous government.

Dear Minister
The Committee’s function is to examine all legislative instruments subject to disallowance or disapproval by the Senate to ensure that they comply with broad principles of personal rights and parliamentary propriety.

The Committee has considered the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008 made under subsection 376-260(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and identified the following matter that may not comply with those principles.

Sub-rule 12(1) of this instrument permits the Minister to terminate the appointment of a Board member for ‘misbehaviour’. The scope of this term is not defined and the sub-rule thus appears to give the Minister a very broad discretion. Similarly, it is not clear what rights of review or appeal a Board member has against such a decision. The Committee therefore seeks your advice as to the intended operation of this provision.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 5 May 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Rules. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator


Thank you for your letter of 20 March 2008 concerning the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008 (the Rules). I appreciate your letter and regret the time it has taken to reply.


The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances (the Committee) raised the issue of the intended operation of sub-rule 12(1) of the Rules.


The issue specifically relates to “misbehaviour” as grounds for the Minister to terminate the appointment of a Board member and the rights of review or appeal should the Minister decide to terminate an appointment.


I am advised that the clause that the Committee has identified is identical to that which is included in a very large number of Acts including the 
Australia Council Act 1975, Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973, Australian National Maritime Act 1990, National Gallery Act 1975, National Library Act 1960, National Museum of Australia Act 1980, Screen Australia Act 2008
 and 
National Film and Sound Archive Act 2008.
 An identical clause is found in many pieces of delegated legislation, for example the Fuel Standards Regulations 2001, the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 and the Australian Radiation and Protection and Nuclear Safety Regulations 1999. I understand that the provision is used so widely that it could be regarded as a standard formulation.


The term ‘misbehaviour’ is not defined in the standard formulation on which sub-rule 12(1) is based. Because of the wide variety of circumstances in which misbehaviour may occur there would be considerable difficulty in formulating an adequate definition that covered all possible circumstances. General guidance on the meaning of misbehaviour is given by the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court (the Court) in 
Vanstone v Clark
 [2005] FCAFC 189. In that case the Court held that it was necessary to consider whether misbehaviour affected the capacity of a person to hold the particular office. The Court’s reasoning in that case would be relevant to any decision under sub-rule 12(1).


The decision to terminate an appointment under sub-rule 12(1) would be governed by the principles of procedural fairness. Procedural fairness would require that a Board member be given notice of a proposed decision to terminate his or her appointment, including the reasons for that decision and provided with a reasonable opportunity to respond. A final decision would need to take into account any response from the Board member.


I am advised that the decision to terminate an appointment would be a ‘decision of an administrative character’ taken under an enactment and would therefore be reviewable under the 
Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1975
 (ADJR Act). A Board member whose appointment had been terminated could apply for review of that decision to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court under the ADJR Act.


Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 22 July 2008 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008. The Committee appreciates your advice that members of the Board have a right of review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1975 of any decision to terminate their appointment.
In your response you advised that the provision dealing with a decision to terminate an appointment on the grounds of ‘misbehaviour’ is widely used and found in many Acts that establish Boards. The Committee appreciates your argument but is concerned that the fact that such a provision is widespread does not make it any less of a problem. You directed our attention to a decision by the Federal Court in which it was held that the word ‘misbehaviour’ should be read to mean ‘misbehaviour which affects the capacity of a person to hold a particular office’. Given this clarification of the term, we suggest that the Rules be amended to use the same language as that used by the Court.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 12 September 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Rules. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator


Thank you for your letter of 28 August 2008 concerning the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008 (the Rules) and specifically the operation of sub-rule 12(1) of the Rules which relates to “misbehaviour” as grounds for the Minister to terminate the appointment of a Board member.


I note that in response to my letter of 22 July 2008 explaining the operation of sub-rule 12(1), the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has suggested that the sub-rule be amended to use the phrase “misbehaviour which affects the capacity of a person to hold a particular office”.


The Film Certification Advisory Board (the Board) fulfils an important role in providing expert advice on film production budgets and administration of the Location and PDV Offsets. The government and the Australian public need to have confidence in the integrity of the Board members. Past experience shows that misbehaviour can arise in a wide variety of situations, both in and out of office. Unethical behaviour outside of office, which might be unrelated to a member’s technical capacity to perform his or her duties, nonetheless can raise serious questions which ultimately go to the integrity of the Board’s decision making.


I understand that the suggested amendment is based on the conclusion of the Federal Court in 
Vanstone v Clarke
 that misbehaviour is connected to a person’s capacity to hold a particular office. In that context the court was considering a reference to misbehaviour without any further qualifications such as you have suggested. Based on advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS), I understand that amending the Rules as suggested could have inadvertent and undesirable consequences. The amended provision could be given an unduly narrow interpretation by a court. In particular there would be a question as to my capacity to act in respect of “misbehaviour” that does not directly relate to a member’s capacity to provide expert advice on film production budgets and other related issues but which goes to broader considerations that could reasonably raise issues of general suitability to hold a particular office. These issues could include, for example, criminal conduct or fraud. Such conduct would undermine the credibility of the Board and its ability to effectively perform its functions.


As I have previously indicated, the form of words in sub-rule 12(1) is widely used and is generally regarded as a standard formulation for an extensive range of Commonwealth advisory and statutory boards. The standard formulation clearly applies to misbehaviour, both inside and outside of office, which would call into question the integrity of the member and the member’s continued suitability to hold the office. For this reason, and also for reasons of consistency, it is desirable that a regulation should be based on a model that has been extensively used in Commonwealth legislation. The standard formulation also provides a Minister with the capacity to act where appropriate, which is balanced by the principles of procedural fairness and other administrative law principles to protect a member’s rights. Legal advice to my Department from the AGS confirms this view.


The Government and the Australian public need to have confidence in the integrity of the Board members. I would hope never to have to take action in respect of sub-rule 12(1). However, in the event a member’s behaviour is such that it adversely impacts on that member’s ability to provide independent expert advice on relevant matters, or adversely affects the ability of the Board to effectively perform its functions, I would not wish to be constrained in my ability to terminate that member’s appointment.


Yours sincerely

The Hon Julia Gillard MP

Suite MG.41
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

I refer to the Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) Determination 2008 made under paragraph 35(1)(a) of the Student Assistance Act 1973.
Paragraph 10(c) of this Determination permits relevant information to be disclosed if it is necessary to brief a Minister in relation to issues that are, or will be, raised publicly by the person to whom the relevant information relates, so that the Minister can correct, amongst other things, “an incorrectly held opinion”. It is not clear what this expression means. Other expressions used in the same paragraph refer to correcting matters about which there can be an objective assessment, such as a ‘mistake of fact’ or a ‘misleading statement’. It is not clear how an opinion can be ‘incorrectly held’. The Committee therefore seeks clarification on the intended meaning of this term. The Committee also seeks your advice on whether any safeguards are available where information generally is disclosed or becomes public (for example, is the person affected informed that disclosure has taken place?)
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 18 August 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Wortley


Thank you for your letter of 19 June 2008 concerning the 
Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines (the Guidelines)) Determination 2008,
 made under paragraph 35(1)(a) of the 
Student Assistant Act 1973.


In your letter you refer to Paragraphs 10 and 11(c) of this Determination and seek clarification of the wording in the Guidelines of the phrase ‘an incorrectly held opinion’—specifically the intended meaning of this term and the safeguards around the disclosure of personal information.


The relevant provision the Senate Committee has raised was replicated in the 
Social Security (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (DEEWR) Determination 2008
 from previous instruments. The provision has been included in the former Departments of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), Education, Science and Training (DEST) and Family and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaCSIA) instruments since 2006 and is currently contained in the following determinations:

Social Security (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (DEEWR) Determination 2008
Social Security (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (FaHCSIA) Determination 2008
Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) Determination 2008
Family Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (FaHCSIA) Determination 2008
The provision was originally included in the social security guidelines as the result of a request from Department of Human Services (DHS) seeking the capacity to disclose protected information should it be necessary to brief the Minister for Human Services on matters that arise in the public arena in relation to social security payments which may require clarification.
The intention of this provision is to capture the situation where an opinion in the public arena is based on misinformation or lack of information, or a misunderstanding of a situation, and it is considered that the opinion is therefore incorrectly formed and held because it has been formed on a false or incorrect premise. Where this occurs it is appropriate that the Minister be briefed to ensure he or she can properly respond to the incorrectly held opinion that may impact negatively on the integrity of the social security system.
In relation to safeguards for the disclosure of information, information will not be disclosed unless it is certified by the Secretary (or the delegate where appropriate) that the disclosure is in the public interest in accordance with the Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) Determination 2008. In each circumstance the Secretary (or delegate) will have regard to the circumstances and the information that is to be disclosed.
The clarification for the disclosure of information is provided in the Guidelines, specifically under Sections 10 Mistake of fact and under Section 11 Ministerial briefing.
I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 29 July 2008 responding to the Committee’s concern with the Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) Determination 2008.
In your response you advise that the provision ‘an incorrectly held opinion’ is intended to refer to the situation where opinions are formed on the basis of incorrect information. Given this explanation, the Committee considers that the Guidelines should make this clear by referring to ‘opinions formed on the basis of incorrect information’ rather than ‘incorrectly held opinions’.
The Committee has also written to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs making the same comment in relation to similar instruments that contain the same provision.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 2 September 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. If the matter cannot be resolved by this date, the Committee will give a notice of motion to disallow these Guidelines to allow further time to resolve the matter.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter of 28 August 2008 concerning the Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) Determination 2008.
In your letter, you note that the Guidelines should be clearer on the point that an incorrectly held opinion is an opinion formed on the basis of incorrect information. I have reviewed paragraph 10(c) of the Guidelines and am of the view that the words ‘or an incorrectly held opinion’ should be removed. The words ‘correcting a mistake of fact, a misleading perception or impression, [or] a misleading statement’ will cover the circumstance that an opinion is held on the basis of incorrect information.
Similarly, I propose to remove those words from similar guidelines made by me under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999. I will amend paragraph 10(c) of the Guidelines and the equivalent paragraphs of the other instruments at the next available opportunity.
I note you have written to the Hon Jenny Macklin MP, Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and Senator the Hon Joe Ludwig, Minister for Human Services, and I have copied this letter to them for information.

I refer to the following instruments that provide for public interest certificate guidelines under the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999:
Family Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (FaHCSIA) Determination 2008
Social Security (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (FaHCSIA) Determination 2008.
Each of these Determinations specifies guidelines for the exercise of the power of the Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to disclose information when it is in the public interest to do so. Section 11 in each instrument states that information may be disclosed for the purposes of Ministerial briefings. Subsection 11(c) in each instrument states that this is permissible in relation to issues raised, or proposed to be raised, publicly by or on behalf of the person to whom the information relates, so that the Minister can respond by correcting, amongst other things, “an incorrectly held opinion”. It is not clear what this expression means. Other expressions used in the same paragraph refer to correcting matters about which there can be an objective assessment, such as a ‘mistake of fact’ or a ‘misleading statement’. It is not clear how an opinion can be ‘incorrectly held’. The Committee would appreciate clarification on the intended operation of this term.

Thank you for your letter of 26 June 2008 about the 
Family Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (FaHCSIA) Determination 2008
 and the 
Social Security (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (FaHCSIA) Determination 2008.


Section 11 of the above Determinations provide for circumstances when the Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs may disclose information to brief a Minister. Subsection 11(c) of both Determinations provides that information may be disclosed if it is necessary to brief a Minister in relation to issues raised or proposed to be raised publicly, so that the Minister can respond by correcting an ‘incorrectly held opinion’, amongst other things. The Committee asked for clarification on the intended operation of the expression ‘incorrectly held opinion’.


The intention of this provision is to capture the situation where opinion that is in the public arena, is based or formed taking into account incorrect facts, evidence, lack of information, or misleading information and it is therefore considered that because of this, the opinion is incorrectly held. That is, the opinion is incorrectly formed and held because the opinion has been formed on an incorrect premise.


Thank you again for writing. I hope that this information clarifies the matter for the Committee.

—I also seek leave to make a short statement about a matter that arose during the committee’s consideration of the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules.
Leave granted.
—On 24 June this year the Regulations and Ordinances Committee gave notice of a motion to disallow the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008. One of the provisions in this instrument permitted the minister to terminate the appointment of a board member for misbehaviour. The scope of this term was not defined and seemed to give the minister a very broad discretion to dismiss. The committee sought advice on this issue as well on the availability of review rights.
The minister responded that this provision was, essentially, a standard term used throughout much Commonwealth legislation. However, some general guidance on its interpretation could be found in the Federal Court decision in Vanstone v Clark. In that case, the court held that it was necessary to consider whether the misbehaviour affected the capacity of the person to hold the particular office. Given this clarification, the committee thought that it would be helpful if these rules were amended to use the same language as that used by the court. In other words, the minister would have a discretion to terminate an appointment for misbehaviour which affects the capacity of a board member to hold office. The minister responded that advice from the Australian Government Solicitor suggested that such an amendment could have ‘inadvertent and undesirable consequences’. For example, it could be given an unduly narrow interpretation by the courts.
The time for resolving this disallowance notice has run out, and the committee has today given notice of its intention to remove the notice. It is decided to remove it because what we face is a general issue of legislative drafting rather than a problem with a specific provision. In addition, to disallow this provision would simply remove the minister’s right to terminate an appointment, which is not a desirable consequence. However, because the issue is a general one, an issue of consistency in legislative drafting, the committee will seek the advice of the Attorney-General, the Australian Government Solicitor and the legislative drafters to see whether the use of a term such as ‘misbehaviour’ is adequate or should be changed. I thank the Senate.

That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Senate approves the proposal by the National Capital Authority for capital works within the Parliamentary Zone, being the National Portrait Gallery forecourt sculpture.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Proposal for Works</title>,Parliamentary Zone,14,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-09-22,"—I believe I was talking about the Senate inquiry into the cost of living pressures on older Australians and the diminishing quality of life that older Australians on the pension were facing. The report also says:
Unmet needs and insufficient services for facilitating in-home care have further constrained the ability of many older people to participate in the community and is increasing the potential for deterioration of health and well-being that could have negative implications for public and personal health costs.
The report also noted:
Income levels, even at a safety net basis, must sufficiently accommodate the need of older people to participate in social and community activities.
It goes on to say, and this is a particularly important point:
Further, supporting the health and well-being of older Australians will have the corollary benefit of reducing the burden on governments for health care costs, aged services and community service provision.
So in other words: from a moral, ethical or rights point of view, even if we did not care about providing an increase in pensions from the perspective of giving pensioners a decent quality of life, the economic rationalists would think that the better approach would be to provide for an increase in the base pension rate so that we can meet pensioners’ basic health and wellbeing requirements because that will reduce the cost of the so-called burdens on the health system. When they do not have a sufficient quality of life, obviously their health outcomes become poorer. As I said, I think even economic rationalists can see that argument: you are better off investing a dollar now than two or three dollars later.
In its conclusion, the report also pointed out a number of very important points. It said:
Whilst we may have seen an increase in the real value of the pension, the committee remains unconvinced that this level is sufficient to maintain a basic, decent standard of living.
Here we are talking of ‘a basic, decent standard of living’. It goes on to say:
Further, other factors, such as the decline in the value of concessions and the trend to user-pays systems, appear to have eroded the purchasing power of the pension and shifted costs on to individuals, including those who may not necessarily have a capacity to pay.
So not only have we seen the increasing cost of fuel but the cost of groceries, transport et cetera has also gone up. Because the value of concessions is going down, this is putting extra costs on the capacity of pensioners to pay. The committee heard many, many harrowing stories of pensioners not being able to make ends meet: not calling out for help as early as they should do; not being able to afford to heat their homes; not being able to afford to buy their grandchildren presents, which greatly upset many people that they were not actively able to participate—they felt they could not actively participate in their family life because they did not have the financial resources to do so. They also talked of shame. They felt very strongly that they felt very strong shame that they were not able to afford things and that they had to ask—they thought—for handouts. As I view it, the community has a responsibility to provide a decent quality of living for these people who have literally helped to build this country.
The committee also noted that one-off payments had been provided, and the government have pointed out at length that they have provided some one-off payments. However, the committee also said that they were conscious that one-off payments signal a problem without providing a long-term solution to address that problem. We have heard that many times from pensioners, that these one-off payments have not been sufficient to deal with the ongoing issues.
The report also pointed out that those most at risk are single pensioners, and especially women, who receive the maximum age pension and those that are in private rental accommodation. They also pointed out that other groups in financial stress in the face of the increased cost of living are those with severe disabilities or chronic illnesses and those in residential aged care. Similarly, older people who have been receiving pensions for some period, especially those over 85, struggle because certain costs that have been deferred become necessities, such as house maintenance, appliance replacement costs and increasing medical bills. So you have got increasing pressure on pensioners who have no other way of being able to provide for these services. Again the committee heard of people whose houses were literally falling apart because they had not been able to maintain them. We also heard stories of people who had become widowers or widows going from a married rate and having to survive on the single pension and being unable to do so because they are still meeting the costs of a family home or shared expenses are now being met on the single pension.
There is absolutely no doubt that these people are struggling. We have also heard that the government accepts that there is a problem. The government accepts there is a problem, but, ‘It’s okay, you guys, you can wait till we have had our review, till we have worked out just how much you’re in poverty, and then we’ll think about maybe putting up the base rate of the single pension. But you sit there and wait.’ When I was growing up I heard of the never-never. That is when you used to buy things on hire-purchase. My mum used to call it putting things on the never-never. I sort of feel it is the same thing here. ‘You are never, never going to get the pay rise. We are putting you on the never-never. Just keep waiting and you may someday get a review of the pension.’ But by then these pensioners—real, living human beings—would have been struggling in straitened circumstances for a very long time. That is not to say that they have only been struggling over the last nine months, because, believe me, the evidence the committee took was largely under the previous government and coming out of the previous government, so these people have been struggling for a long time. Now what we are hearing is that pensioners are being told, ‘Wait until we have done the review and then you will get your increase in the pension.’ No, that will not happen straightaway, because the government will need time to consider the review, and that is going to take a considerable period of time. So they will be on the never-never even longer.
If we had not had the $31 billion tax cuts, the government could have chosen to invest that in our social infrastructure in Australia, in their programs of social inclusion. I would have thought that making sure pensioners have a decent quality of life would have been one of the key tenets of the social inclusion agenda. As I was saying, the committee found that, in order for people to be able to have a decent quality of life and be able to meet their basic living costs, it is essential for them to be able to participate in the community and in its social life. So what would you have thought the government would have been investing in? You would have thought they would have been investing in social inclusion for pensioners, for people who actively need to be facilitated into our community. You would have thought that they would have invested the $31 billion tax cuts in something like that. But before you run away with that idea, we also have to remember that the coalition promised $36 billion, I think it was, in tax cuts, so they were not exactly thinking of investing in the pensioners’ futures and pensioners’ pay rise at that time during the federal election, were they? Who were the only people talking about it then? It was the Greens who have been talking about this for over a year.
The Greens will be moving and have circulated amendments to include in the pay rise for pensioners disability pensioners and carers, because these people are also struggling. It should be noted that disability pensioners did not get the bonus payment. They are getting extra utility payments the same as age pensioners but they did not get a bonus payment, so they are struggling as well. Again I have had a large number of emails to my office outlining the difficulties that people on disability pensions face. So we are moving to increase the base rate for single disability pensioners as well, of whom there are 464,230 in this country, as we understand it from the latest figures. We will also be moving to increase the base rate for single carers, of whom I understand there are 51,304 in this country on the latest figures. We believe this will relieve a small part of the burden that these people face. But $30 a week is a very important fillip to help them start meeting the cost of living and start addressing what we believe is a decent quality of life.
I have not heard one person in this place say that we should not be aiming for a decent quality of life for people who are struggling to make ends meet. We need to remember that many of the people we are talking about are in the lowest part of the social wellbeing index, particularly carers. They are consistently in the lowest stratum for the social wellbeing index because of the stresses that they face caring for their loved ones but also because of their lack of income. They are struggling to make ends meet as well as trying to care for their loved ones, as are those on disability pensions struggling to deal with their disability, struggling to make ends meet and also struggling to pay for their equipment and for their accommodation. More often than not they cannot get adequate accommodation, adequate support for finding a job or adequate support to stay in a job. Again, you could not say that these people are very high up on the wellbeing index. They are struggling to make ends meet on pensions that have not been significantly increased or indexed to meet the cost of living.
One hopes that the government will see reason and see that this increase is the least they can do to help people who have been struggling for years to try and make ends meet and who have now reached crunch point. It has come to the point where they will come out and they will voice their concerns. As I said earlier, these are a generation of people who have not wanted to tell others of their hardships and have not wanted to complain. So it says a lot that they are now having to come out and complain and lobby so hard for what is a very modest increase, when you consider the costs of living that they are bearing, the above normal increase in the cost of living that they are facing and the fact that they have not had a significant real increase for many years.
We support, and in fact the Greens initiated this campaign in this place, a $30 a week increase for pensioners, but we will be moving an amendment to ensure that this increase covers those receiving the single disability pension and those receiving the single carers pension. We commend our amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2008-09-22,"—I rise today to support an increase in pensions of $30 a week. I will start by reflecting on who the pensioners we are talking about are. This is the most generous generation of Australians being treated in a miserly way by one of the most self-serving generations of Australians. Let’s go back. These are the frail aged, who were born in the 1920s, post the First World War. They lived through, in their youth, the Great Depression and then they saw service again in their families in the Second World War. Our most recent pensioners, who reached the age of 65 recently, were born towards the end of the Second World War.
These were people who did not have the money to go off to university in most cases. Yet did they complain when we decided that it was important to put the next generation of young people through university? No, they did not; they encouraged that to happen. These were not a generation of people who had a government put aside money for them for their superannuation for their retirement years. These were people who were brought up in hard times, served this country twice through two world wars and lived through the Depression, as I said.
In the case of women in particular, they were entering the workforce, if they indeed ever did enter the paid workforce, at a time when it was customary in Australia not to employ married women. Many people in this parliament will recall that women did not get equal pay in Australia until the seventies. So there were women who, for example, trained to be teachers or nurses and who went to go back to work and of course were not able to because people did not employ married women at that time. Equally, across most of Australia women were encouraged to be at home, to be the homemakers, and there was no idea of paid maternity leave, paternity leave or any of that. It was expected that women in that generation would manage the household and help to bring up the children. They paid their taxes as PAYE earners for most of their lives for the most part.
Now, in return, what do they get from this nation, which has never had such a great surplus and such wealth as we have now? They get a generation of politicians—and I am going to talk about the Howard years—who say that they want to cut the corporate tax rate so that it is as low as possible to maximise company profits as greatly as possible. There are CEOs retiring from companies on a handshake of $33 million, more than most of these people or anyone they knew earned in their entire lives. We are seeing a generation which says, ‘We need to cut taxes for the highest level of income earners,’ and this occurred throughout the Howard years and was kept on by the Rudd government in this year’s budget—$31 billion worth of tax cuts, a large number of those to the rich.
The Greens were the only people in this parliament to say we should not be cutting taxes for the rich and we should be using that tax money to invest in infrastructure, to improve pensions and to improve the lot of health and education in this country. But of course that did not get up; that did not suit the mood. All we saw during the Howard years was the base rate of the age pension get left behind in terms of average weekly ordinary time earnings or the consumer price index—indeed, any way you wish to look at it the pension got left behind.
I would like to reiterate the point that my colleague Senator Siewert just mentioned that it is women who are living longer. It is in many cases frail and aged women who are then left as widows to try and manage a household where previously there were two pensions coming in, including the married couple pension, and where one, often the wife, is left to manage with exactly the same fixed costs as previously but only the single pension on which to manage. It is because they cannot manage that many of them go prematurely into aged care. That is a downward spiral for many people because it is an emotional wrench that often leads to physical difficulties and emotional stress, which then lead to the downward spiral for many of our older women.
These are also the women who for a large part of their lives did not manage the books in the family—often it was their husbands who managed all the income side of things. Many of them are left with a history of never having gotten their driver’s licence, for example. It is time, as a nation, to actually put some thought into what this generation we are talking about gave of their lives and their health—their health during the wars and the Depression and their commitment to building this country. Now they are frail and aged and do not have superannuation. They did not have the same opportunities that they sacrificed a great deal for so that we could have those opportunities. Then we turn around and say to them: ‘Oh well, we don’t think we can afford it. We can actually put it off and look at it through the Henry tax review and we will maybe review it next year and you might get something in next year’s May budget, if you are lucky.’
We are running a $22 billion surplus and we are talking about no more than $1 billion, from what I understand from the figures, that would go into supporting an increase of this kind for single age pensioners and for people on disability pensions. Running a budget surplus of $22 billion, if we cannot put $1 billion towards helping people who are living in poverty, whose self-respect and dignity is being undermined by the fact that they cannot manage no matter how hard they try, then it does not say much about this country—it does not say much about us being a caring country, a compassionate country. It does not say anything about our sense of justice. If ever you wanted to talk about social justice in this parliament, this is a social justice issue. Around the world people are looking at this issue of intergenerational equity. We see intergenerational equity as what we might pass on to our children. But I would also like to think about intergenerational equity in terms of how we look after our aged community, because that is also about how we see fairness and how we see justice and how we try to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.
We have pensioners in Australia who are going to bed early in the evening because they cannot afford heating; people not eating fresh fruit and vegetables to maintain their health, because it is too expensive; and people who are reducing the amount that they eat in order that they can give their families something for Christmas. This is the reality of the people we are talking about. Can you imagine the stress on an older person who has prided themselves throughout their lives on developing and keeping family bonds getting to the point where they feel like they cannot extend any generosity to their families in the seasons of Christmas or Easter and also who then feel like they have become charity cases? There is a lot to this. It is not just about the money in terms of the $30—and, frankly, $30 is going to go nowhere, but it is a start—it is not just about goods; it is about dignity and it is about fairness and it is about justice.
While I am on that I also want to address this issue of equity in climate change, because we know that under an emissions trading system power prices are going to go up and we know that, because of the underlying increase in the price of oil, petrol is going to go up. The people who have fixed costs and no capacity to increase their income in most cases are these pensioners that we are talking about here. We should be looking at what the Greens have put forward: we need to go out and retrofit the nation’s homes to give people full insulation, solar hot water and permanently reduce their energy costs.
I am aware that, under Prime Minister Howard, instead of introducing an increase in the pension he gave a cheque for a utilities allowance, which worked out to about $8 per pensioner per week. So it was nothing like the $30 that we are talking about now. But, if on top of a rise in the pension we went out and put solar hot water systems on the nation’s houses and started to put them out on the houses of the most vulnerable first, we would make a permanent saving. One-third of people’s power bills is hot water. So to actually take away that cost for people would be a tremendous contribution to them. But if we put in full insulation, then it would also take the edge off what they are going to have to try to do to keep themselves warm or keep themselves cool. Who are the most vulnerable when Australia experiences extreme heat waves? It is the young and the old. We have already seen an increase in the number of deaths due to heat exhaustion as a result of climbing temperatures, and that is going to continue.
We have a situation where we do not have adequate public transport so that people who can no longer drive can move around in Australia’s cities. So we need to do a whole package of things. This should not just be seen as, ‘Oh well, we’ll try and give them $30 and then forget about it.’ We need to actually think about this constructively, because if we retrofitted the nation’s houses with solar hot water and full insulation, we would be creating a huge number of jobs. We would be rebuilding the manufacturing sector in Australia, because you would need to build plants to roll out the solar hot water technology on a scale unprecedented in Australia. I note today with great pleasure that we have the ACTU coming out with several of the NGOs and agreeing that what Australia should do to embrace the green revolution in technology and to deal with climate change is to retrofit the nation’s 7.4 million homes, as the Greens have been suggesting.
So this can be a win-win situation all round. We can actually do something to make life more comfortable and cheaper, and start with the most vulnerable first, and at the same time create job opportunities and boost our manufacturing sector. So I think this debate is important. It is something that the Greens brought on here in the Senate last year. I note that when we put this motion last year it was not supported by the coalition. I heard earlier Senator Barnett from Tasmania talking about how worried he is about pensioners in Launceston. Well, he was not worried about pensioners in Launceston last year when he voted down the motion to increase the pension nor apparently when he was supporting the tax cuts for the rich but no increase of the pension for the poor. However, I am glad that that has changed and I am glad that this parliament seems to have had an insight into just how difficult it is and that the opposition will be supporting an increase in the pension to Australia’s most vulnerable, particularly those single age pensioners and our disability pensioners.
We should also be increasing what carers get paid around this country. There are so many vulnerable people, and it is hard to believe, in a country with the wealth that we have, that we cannot be more generous. I find that a matter of justice, as I said. It defies the Australian tradition of the fair go. It is almost, in my view, a lack of respect and appreciation for what this generation of Australians have done for this country so that we can be the free country that we are. Because a number of these pensioners, having also given war service, have suffered physical ailments and mental problems as a result of that war service—and their families have suffered in the course of trying to cope with that as well. So I would like this parliament to reflect on the idea that the people who have been most generous to us through the sacrifices they have made are the people to whom we as a parliament have been the meanest. Let us hope that this changes as a result of this move initiated by the Greens, campaigned for by the Greens, now supported by the coalition—and hopefully supported by the government. At last we might see this beginning. It should only be a beginning because an increase of $30 a week is a long way behind where it needs to go.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Coonan, Senator Helen",LP,2008-09-22,"—I am very pleased to sum up the debate on the coalition’s Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Bill 2008. I think what is clear from the contributions that we have heard in the Senate today is that there is not much room for dispute that Australia’s single age pensioners are finding it virtually impossible to live on the basic pension of $273.40 per week as indexed. I think it is also a fair summation to say that everyone agrees that $30 a week, whilst not in itself a panacea, would certainly give a helping hand to some of the most vulnerable pensioners that this country needs to make provision for.
I just want to say at the outset that it was interesting to hear the comments of Senator Xenophon from South Australia, who agreed with the coalition that it is clear that there is a great deal of urgency and concern in the community about the issue of pension increases and how pensioners are doing it tough. I thank the senator for his thoughtful contribution to the debate. Similarly, there was Senator Fielding, with his opening comments that pensioners are doing it tough and that for the Senate to delay or wait further to have a debate on the pension would be sending pensioners the wrong message. So I thank also Senator Fielding for his thoughtful contribution.
I have listened very carefully to what the Greens have had to say. If you strip away some of the criticisms, I do think it is very important to point out that there appears to be a fundamental failure to recognise that there was a Senate inquiry into the cost-of-living pressures for older Australians, which reported in March this year. So I do not think it is fair to say that we have not had a Senate committee inquiry into this bill. There has been a very extensive one. It is certain that the report called on the government to listen to older Australians’ concerns. When it comes to Senator Evans’s contribution, it was very interesting because he made a number of complaints about the coalition but really did not address with any particularity what it is that the government is going to do as a matter of urgency to help the most needy and vulnerable pensioners. Instead we had a fairly longwinded discussion about how there was need for serious thought, balance and all of the usual things that Labor are saying these days as they conduct committee after committee—but we never see any action for it.
I think it is also fair to say that what is extraordinary, when we are having this debate about whether the most vulnerable Australians should be receiving an additional payment of $30 a week, is the spectacle today of the globetrotting Prime Minister off to New York, leaving in his wake this serious, unresolved problem of justice for single age pensioners. I think it is also fair to say that the government’s contempt for pensioners is clear. (Quorum formed)

I was talking about the PM jetting off to New York, leaving in his wake this serious unresolved problem. It does seem that, while he has a plan for the UN, he does not have a plan at all for Australia’s pensioners. The government’s contempt, I think, for pensioners is shown by the procession of ministers—shall I say a conga line of senior government ministers, to quote an expression of a former Labor leader—who have solemnly assured us that they could not live on the single pension. Indeed, this is a serious failure of leadership when you have the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and other senior ministers who say that they cannot live on the single pension and admit that there is a problem but have comprehensively failed to address it. What sort of government is it that actually admits there is a problem but does absolutely nothing to address an urgent need?
It is difficult, I think, to believe that the government is sincere. I would not level that at Senator Evans—he is a sincere man—but he came in here feigning some concern. He, of course, sat at the cabinet table and accused me and other senators on this side of sitting around the cabinet table looking at this, but when the Rudd government considered an 83-page report by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and an 11-page Treasury report in April this year, it somehow or other could not quite bring itself to give the plight of pensioners a proper consideration in the budget. I think it is patently clear that the government is intent on ignoring pensioners and the plight that they face.
There is a report in the Sunday Tasmanian that, no doubt, would not have escaped Senator Brown’s notice, where a lifetime member of the Labor Party asked for pensioners to be given a fair go. She appealed directly to the Prime Minister, and she said that he ‘all but ignored’ her. The chairman of the Australian Catholic Social Justice Council, Bishop Christopher Saunders, in response to a question on ABC Radio on 17 September about the urgent plight of pensioners and whether the government should act now, said:
It seems to me that, if someone is at your door and they’re in dire straits and they need help, it is better to help them there and then rather than say, ‘Listen, come back next week when I’ve had time to write a letter about it’.
—Come back in 10 years!
—It seems to me to be urgent. Of course, we have had a report—although from the interjections opposite I am not quite sure whether or not it is a correct report—in the Australian Financial Review that, in fact, government backbenchers are getting increasingly concerned about the government’s failure to act to do anything for pensioners and have endorsed the push for extra financial assistance to aged pensioners.
Before I go on, Senator Evans also complained about the number of questions, which focused on pensions, that were asked of him in his capacity as the minister. That prompted me, over the time I was out of the chamber—which was only a few minutes—to look at how many questions Mr Rudd asked on pensions in question time when he was Leader of the Opposition. The grand total of that is two. I also looked at how many questions the opposition spokesperson on seniors, Ms Macklin, the member for Jagajaga, asked on pensions in question time. That was none. Compare this with the performance in the House of Mr Abbott, the member for Warringah, in just nine months of opposition, when he raised the issue of seniors with the government eight times in question time. This sort of counting of questions, I think, may not go all that far but certainly does answer the claim made by Senator Evans that, somehow or other, this indicates either interest or lack of interest; the coalition wins hands down.
Various speakers have attempted to accuse the coalition of failing to act to assist pensioners when we were in government. I utterly reject this claim, and I want to come to the various things that we did when we were in government. It is quite an interesting list. First of all, the decision taken by the coalition government in 1997 to link the age pension to growing incomes—25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings—rather than the cost-of-living increases, the CPI, means that pensioners now directly share in the benefits of a stronger economy and in the significant increases in wages since the coalition came into government. In 1997—this was a terribly important step—the coalition government legislated that the age pension be set to at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings or increased by the CPI, whichever was the greater, and the coalition government increased pensions at two per cent a year above the rate of inflation. It was our government, of course, that introduced the utilities allowance to assist pensioners with the cost of utilities such as gas and electricity. The first payment was made in March 2005. Of course, to further encourage workforce participation—which I assume everyone in this chamber would support—the coalition government increased the amount of the age pension that a part-rate pensioner can receive above the income-test-free area by reducing the pension income test withdrawal rate from 50c in the dollar to 40c in July 2000. We also passed legislation to halve the assets test taper rate. From 20 September 2007, pensions are only reduced by $1.50 instead of the previous $3 per fortnight for each $1,000 worth of assets above the allowable assets limit. These achievements, of course, meant that we had consistently addressed these issues and had a very strong record in government.
Moreover, what is important, since we lost office, is the rise in the cost of living. The overall cost of living has increased by 4.5 per cent in the 12 months to June 2008. The last opportunity we had to do anything was in the last coalition budget; the setting of that budget is now close to two years ago. It is interesting that the overall cost of living has increased by 4.5 per cent in the 12 months to June 2008. Since the election of the Rudd government, I am sorry to say, the cost of milk has increased by 3.6 per cent; the cost of jam, honey and other spreads has increased by 3.62 per cent; and the cost of fuel has increased by 14.5 per cent. What all that tells us is that it is incumbent on the Labor government to address these increased cost-of-living pressures that have become manifest, increasingly so since they took office.
The increase in cost-of-living pressures makes the need for immediate relief even more compelling than at the end of 2007—with the last coalition budget in May of that year. During 2007 the now Prime Minister went around Australia promising to do something about the cost-of-living pressures. He led pensioners to believe he would do something about the cost of petrol and the cost of groceries. But, less than a year since the Rudd Labor government came to office, we are seeing the skyrocketing prices that I have detailed. Mr Rudd went to the election promising to ease the cost of living, but Australians are in fact worse off today than they were under the coalition government. If the Rudd government were serious about helping out people on pensions, they could fix it right now.
I want to deal with a couple of ill-founded criticisms that have been made in the course of this debate that may be based simply on not understanding what the bill does or not understanding its factual basis. The first is that Senator Evans suggested that this bill would add to the various pressures on the pension of the income tested rate. However, it is clear from an express provision in the bill that the bill will isolate the additional $30 per week from the income tested rate. The additional $30 per week is not added on for the rate used under the income test, and it is not used for other purposes—for example, setting the daily care fee in a nursing home. I think it is important to make that point.
The second criticism, also made by Senator Evans—and it has been a bit of a mantra for the government since they have had to come to terms with the fact that this coalition does not stand for increase taxes, particularly increased taxes that will be inefficient and for which we said the government had no mandate at the time of the election—was that the government, in effect, cannot afford to make this provision, this additional $30 payment for single age pensioners, and the coalition should not be seeking it, on fiscal grounds. What this ignores is that, due to the careful fiscal management of the former, Howard government, the Rudd government has inherited a massive surplus of some $94.4 billion over five years, with this year a surplus of $21.5 billion. The government, if it chose, could certainly reorder its priorities and responsibly allow this relief to single age pensioners now.
It will not affect the outcomes of either the Hamer review or the Henry review. There are certainly no budgetary constraints on making this immediate additional $30-per-week payment to affected pensioners—and we are calling upon the government to do so because this is a matter that deserves urgent consideration. As they have acknowledged that none of the higher echelon of the government—ministers, from the Prime Minister down—could live on what we are asking pensioners to live on, it requires urgent attention. The government cannot wait a couple of years—until the Harmer review wends its way to making its report and then the Henry review gets around to it—before, hopefully, making some provision in the 2010 budget.
In my view, Australians expect any competent government sitting on a large, inherited surplus to be able to walk and chew gum. They should be able to provide for pensioners. That is part of the brief when you are in government: you have to look after those who need to be looked after in circumstances where that need is demonstrably clear.
Finally, I want to deal with the suggestion that there are a lot of other pension recipients and classes of pension recipients who should be included. In answer to that, we acknowledge that there is always more that can be done but there does need to be a first step. I do understand and, to some degree, sympathise with the senators who have raised their desire to include in the coalition’s bill other categories of pensioners in addition to single age pensioners, the 928,834 pension recipients to whom this benefit is directed. But, at this stage, the coalition’s point of view is that we have to take the first step—and I do believe it is in the right direction—to assist the Australians who are the most vulnerable. We do recognise that there is a need for more support for carers and people with disabilities. This call for an increase in the single age pension is a step towards addressing the immediate needs of some of the most vulnerable people in our society, given that age pensioners are not eligible for some of the extra benefits that, for example, disability support pensioners currently receive. It is, I think, critical to understand that the single age pension, compared to OECD rates, has been relatively low. This increase would bring them to slightly above the OECD average when compared to the couple age pension.
The total of 928,834 pensioners includes 857,229 single age pensioners, 700 widow B pensioners and 70,907 single age service pensioners. It will provide a $30-per-week boost as an additional payment that is on top the income tested rate of the base pension. So the coalition calls on the government to expedite further consideration of the needs of all pensioners—let us not leave anyone out in what we are asking the government to do—who simply cannot wait until 2010 for a comprehensive and thorough response to their needs.
The government in my view needs to address the needs of close to one million Australians who the Prime Minister can help with this particular bill that supports single age pensioners. I believe they should do just that. It is, I believe, a national disgrace to have to admit that there is a problem as basic as meeting the essential needs of Australia’s most vulnerable aged people. The government must not dither and hide behind reviews any more while the most vulnerable are living under unbearable financial stress. This is not a matter for a committee and it is not a matter for a delay; it is a matter for leadership. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-09-22,"—I want to make a few remarks in conclusion. The amendment seeks to add a number of other category recipients to the bill. For the sake of clarity I should say that the number of pensioners who will be affected by the provisions of this bill is 928,834 Australians at a cost of $1.45 million. Senator Evans, in his comments, waxed lyrical about how difficult it was to make provision of the kind that we seek to make in this bill. But, clearly, it is a bit rich for Labor to complain about people who are being provided for in this bill when the Labor Party is not providing for anyone at all. It is very clear, and the chamber should be clear, that the Labor Party does not propose to provide for anyone at all. The coalition propose to provide for single age pensioners and, in my concluding remarks in the second reading debate, I set out the rationale for that. Having said that, it is very clear that we as the coalition agree that all pensioners deserve to have consideration of their position. We regard the additional payment of $30 per week as very much a first step to relieve single age pensioners, who are amongst the most vulnerable that we currently have of the people who are in receipt of pensions.
I also outlined the rationale in relation to not at this point including disability support pensioners. That is not to say that they are not worthy, but most of them are entitled to some additional payment. We think that, in all the circumstances, we need to have a comprehensive response, and we will continue to develop a comprehensive response to include all pensioners. We will keep this under urgent review, and we will continue to have regard to the ongoing needs of all categories of pension. I think there ought to be an acknowledgement in this chamber that all pensioners are certainly worthy of further attention by the government. We will be stepping into the breach as we develop a comprehensive policy after this, we think, very important first step to provide some relief for the most needy of single age pensioners.
I think it is also important to say, although it is in the explanatory memorandum, that the coalition takes a different view from the government as to the constitutional validity of the private bill. We have the view that there is no barrier to the introduction of this bill in the Senate. Section 53 of the Constitution provides in part that:
Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate.
But a bill to increase the rate of age pensions does not need to contain an appropriation of money—and this is where we part company with the government. Age pensions and other entitlements under the Social Security Act 1991 are automatically paid under a special appropriation of indefinite duration and unlimited amount in section 242 of the Social Securities Administration Act 1999. Any increase in pensions is paid for under that appropriation without any necessity for any further appropriation to be made.
If the government has advice that differs and takes issue with what we say is the constitutional validity of being able to introduce this bill under the standing appropriation of the parliament, please bring it forward. Is there any reason why the rest of us should not be enlightened on any difficulty of a legal kind that the government contends? If there is such advice, let us see it and let us have a discussion about it. That is my advice. Aided and abetted by my own background, I must say that it seems to me to be a sound basis upon which this bill has been introduced.
With those remarks I have to say that we will not be supporting the amendment, even though we do think that the sentiment behind it has merit. We think that the sensible way to proceed is to at least pick the category which we have. It has a rationale to it, and it will assist the most vulnerable and most needy of single age pensioners.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-09-22,"—I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 5596:
(1)    Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 24), after item 2, insert:
2A  Section 210
Omit “A person’s carer payment”, substitute “Subject to section 211, a person’s carer payment rate”.

 Increased carer payment rate

         (1)    If:
              (a)    a person is qualified for the carer payment under this Part; and
              (b)    the carer payment is payable to that person under this Part; and
              (c)    the person is not a member of a couple;
then, for the purpose of making payments under Division 4 of Part 3 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1991, the person’s carer payment rate is worked out by adding an amount equivalent to $30 per week to the person’s carer payment rate calculated under section 210.
         (2)    To avoid doubt, the carer payment rate determined under this section is not to be used for any other purpose, including for the calculation of any other benefit or fee under this Act or any other Act.
This relates to the same provisions to provide for carers so that the carers pension is increased. Carers, as I alluded to in my speech in the second reading debate, are one of the lowest groups on the social wellbeing index for a number of reasons—low income from the carers payment, the stress of their workload and the lack of support they are getting.
I would like to point out that the Greens campaigned very strongly during the federal election on the increase in payments for carers. Carers have been calling for a doubling of their payments because of the work they do and the stresses they face. They do not get superannuation for the caring that they do, so not only are they affected by low income during their actual caring years but in their own older age they are actually very poorly provided for because they have not been in the workforce because of their caring duties. They have also been calling for some time for those areas around superannuation to be looked at.
Several months ago there was deep concern that they were not going to get the bonus payment that they had been receiving for the last couple of years and there was acknowledgement that they had been having trouble making ends meet. I have already spoken about the drawbacks of the one-off payments and the fact that they are not meeting pensioners’ needs. Carers provide a critical role in our community.
The Access Economics report of several years ago—the figures will be much higher now—showed that they provide $31 billion worth of care. If those carers were not providing that, the government would be expected to provide it. So purely from an economic rational point of view—and I for one am not arguing that we should be taking an economic rationalist point of view—these people are providing that level of care. I would argue very strongly that it is in fact higher than that now because, as I said, that was several years ago. They also pointed out that during that time the cost of living had been going up. So not only are they providing that level of care but they are even less able to make ends meet than they were a couple of years ago.
These people are carrying a tremendous workload but their own health is suffering. Not only are they in the lowest wellbeing index but they are starting to suffer from depression and illnesses themselves because of the workload that they are carrying and because they are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. We believe that carers should also have their pension increased by $30, which is nowhere near what they have been campaigning for. But at least it is a start until a more appropriate approach is taken to setting the base rates for all of the pensions as we have been discussing today.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-22,"—Family First support the increase for carers and obviously support the increase for those on a disability pension. Of course there would be no surprise that we also support an increase for those on a couple pension and those 2.4 million other people on a pension that will miss out if all the amendments do not go through. As I said, we will be supporting it because we actually believe that all the people on a pension, the 3.4 million Australians on a pension, deserve an increase. They are all doing it tough and they need an increase.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-09-22,"—I reiterate my remarks about how the government does not believe this is the right process to address quite serious issues that affect pensioners, carers and people on a disability support pension. I think the inadequacies of the proposals have been shown up in the debate. The opposition are struggling to add a group and explain why other groups are not in et cetera, despite the fact that we all know they are linked in the social security system and the payment of the age pension actually impacts on a range of other payments including those we are discussing. I think it just shows that trying to do this sort of policy on the run does not work. It also is the case that they have not costed their propositions. We are spending billions of dollars by upping each other on who should get paid what. It is just a ludicrous situation.
I want to remind people that in the budget the government did for the first time pay the utilities allowance to carers. It had not been done before. We paid the utilities allowance, not at the old rate that had been paid under the Howard government but at the rate of $500. Not only did we increase the utilities allowance but carers for the first time got that payment. So the $500 they did not get before was paid to carers. They got the increase in the telephone allowance and, of course, they got the bonuses which had been paid previously over the last three or four years under the Howard government.
There was the carer payment bonus of $1,000 and those on the carer allowance got the $600 bonus. So most people who were carer payment recipients got a total bonus of $1,600. So there were measures in the budget. The myth has been created that pensioners and carers got nothing out of the budget when quite the reverse is true. As I said, a carer payment recipient might have got $1,600 in bonuses plus the $500 utility allowance for the first time. That is $2,100 on top of their normal carer payment. Not all of them got that but, as I say, those in receipt of the carer payment did receive the $1,000 bonus, the $600 bonus and the $500 utility allowance.
Some of those carers received $2,100 in addition to the base rate pension. That has to be factored into these discussions. People can shake their heads, but $2,100 is the equivalent of about $40 a week. So if you were to wipe out the bonuses for those people and pass the measure brought here, they would be on less. That is how crazy this debate is. Some of those people were to receive $2,100 in extra payments this year, and you are suggesting that they get $30 a week, which will give them less than they got out of the bonuses system. This is the exact point that the government is trying to make. There is fundamental reform needed in pension payments. There are complex issues at stake, including the payment system that grew up under the previous government and that was continued by us. We have said that that is not the way to go; you need longer term structural reform. The Howard government kept on doing the one-off pension bonuses on the basis that they thought the politics of it were pretty good. It was not reform; it was just, ‘We think we’ve got some spare cash so we’ll give you the bonus.’ They never put it in the out years; they never put it in the forward budget estimates. They created expectations it would continue, but they never budgeted for it. So when we came to government last year, there was no money in the budget for the bonuses we paid this year. They had not been budgeted for.
We say those bonuses have been useful—they have assisted pensioners, they have assisted carers—but they do not fundamentally reform the pension payment system. If you like, they paper over the cracks. We are saying we need to have a reform process, a major review of these issues, to see if we cannot find a better way than just using the payment of bonuses to paper over the cracks. We made a down payment in our first budget. We had very little time to prepare for a budget following taking office in early December. In terms of preparation for the May budget, we basically had to have it nailed down by very early in the New Year. So we made a down payment on these pensioners and carers by saying that we accepted they were struggling to make ends meet and that the standard of living that they were experiencing was perhaps not what they should enjoy, and we extended the bonus payments and added to them and said we would do a major review and that we would have that in time for the framing of the next year’s budget. We put on the record our bona fides and, as I say, the pensioners got the increase in the utilities allowance and they got the bonus, so they received $900 extra over and above the base rate pension and they have obviously received indexation. I am not saying that makes them well-off, that it is enough or that it is all you can do or all you should do, but it is the reality. When people talk about it, they have to realise that that $900 is worth about 17 bucks a week, so it is a major component of their income.
But in terms of the carer payment, as I say, here we are, saying on the run, ‘Let’s throw carers in,’ and Family First saying, ‘Let’s double it for couples,’ et cetera. But I point out to the chamber that in the budget, for the first time, those on carer payments got the $500 utilities allowance, so they were 500 bucks better off than they were the previous year. They got the increased telephone allowance and we continued the payments that have been made on a one-off basis—without being budgeted for in the out years by the previous government—of $1,000 for carer payment and $600 for carer allowance, so that some of the people in receipt of carer payments actually would have received $2,100 in bonuses. On my quick maths, that is about $40 a week. So factor that into the debate. Let us have a realistic debate rather than this one-upmanship of trying to outbid each other as if there are simple solutions to these things. There are enormous structural issues involved with changing the basis on which we calculate pensions. There are flow-on effects for tapers and for the tax rates when people work, and it impacts on the family payment system in some cases. This is complex stuff and those of us who have done this legislation in the past and have participated in the detail of legislative debates know how complex it is. Senator Harradine had a good grip on it and a couple of others in the chamber have. I have soldiered on manfully on a few occasions without pretending I have got across all of the detail. It is complex stuff. It is not quite as bad as the Migration Act, but it is getting there.
Let us pause and take a deep breath and admit that this is not the sort of stuff you do on the run. And, while the politics are easy, the public policy is hard. What we have set ourselves is the task of doing that hard public policy work. As I have indicated before, we will not be supporting the amendment and we will not be supporting the bill. By making this contribution, I just point out that people ought to factor in those payments that were made this year that were in excess of the base pension or base carer payments. In fact, if you remove the bonuses and pass the resolution, they would be worse off. That is how crazy this is.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-09-22,"—I think Senator Evans is in a difficult position of defending the indefensible. He is a good-hearted man, and he is putting the best spin that can be put on this from a government that has done very little at all for the lowest income people in Australia. He is talking about an extra $40 a week through $2,000 of extra payments; if you put them all together, those carers end up on less than $17,000 in income for the whole year. Let us try to live on less than $300 a week; let us try to make ends meet on that. We are having this debate because we are all getting feedback from people who, even with the bonuses—and they are very meagre bonuses that the good leader is talking about—cannot make ends meet, and it has not kept their heads above water as rentals, in particular, spiral.
Let me just home in on that one. There are 100,000 single pension getters in this country who, when you take out the more than 40 per cent they are paying on rentals, are living on $20 a day. That is $20 for food, for shelter—they are getting their rental paid, but you know how the costs add up when you have to look after a household—for clothing, for transport, for health, for hopefully being able to buy things occasionally for children and grandchildren, to be able to maybe go to bingo or to the pictures and get some entertainment, for heating and for the rest of it. They cannot make ends meet, and that is the problem. We submit that the $30 that is in this bill, which is aimed at single pension income earners, is not enough. We have never said this is going to fix things up but it gives some relief to the neediest. That is why we are a little concerned that Senator Fielding is now spreading it right across the field, because it loses sight of the fact that we did home in on the neediest. But we will support that because, right from the outset, the Greens have said that we believe that pensioners across the board should be getting a minimum $30 increase and it should be closer to $100.
I go back to this starting point, which is to do with economic responsibility. There has to be a budget brought in each year, but this year’s budget could not afford the $2.2 billion that these measures the Greens are bringing forward now would cost to alleviate the misery of more than a million pensioners and carers. It could not find that $2.2 billion per annum but it could find $31 billion for the tax cuts across the board, and not least the $5 billion-plus for high-income earners’ tax cuts. Treasury did not have any trouble working out how much that cost. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer had no trouble bringing that in in the budget. But I remind the Senate that there was no committee inquiry into that; there was no going out and asking high-income earners if they could make ends meet and how they were getting along. They were simply given this gift.
It is specious for the government to say, ‘Oh, it was too difficult to work out how we could give a small increase to people at the other end of the income scale which would have been a fraction of that which we found for high-income earners.’ It just does not figure. Good on the opposition for bringing this bill in because we are having this debate now and it is continuing to say to the government, ‘Well, you might ignore this bill and you might have the numbers in the House of Representatives to block it, but this is part of a pressure based on need which is not going to go away—not this week, not next week, not next month—until the government acts on it. It is just a fair go that it act on it early and not put it off until the last minute in the run to next year’s budget, because a lot of unnecessary hardship will be created in the meantime. I am not talking about hardship for the government but hardship for the pensioners, who deserve this lift.
Senator Evans has said that this is a Dutch auction. No, it is not. This is a serious move to try to get some money to the people who are in need. To say it is a Dutch auction is simply to say, ‘Ultimately none of them do and we are not prepared to draw a line anywhere. Because it is complicated and there are various claimants, we won’t give anything to anybody until sometime next year after we’ve had more prolonged inquiries to see how we can juggle that into the budget.’ I remind the Senate again that in the last two budgets more than $50 billion over four years has been given in tax cuts. That makes the amounts of money we are looking at here look very tiny indeed; they are a small percentage of that sum. The government would have been very wise and very fair had it simply said, ‘If we are not responding to this bill, we will give this rise in the coming short period of time, and here is how we are going to do it.’ After all, let us not forget that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Deputy Prime Minister have all said they could not live on the very amounts that the leader of the government in here was saying had been boosted—the boosted amounts that he was saying a while ago had gone to pensioners.
This amendment is important. The bill is more important. But the need for the government to act as a result of these deliberations tonight, and hopefully the passage of this bill, is all the more urgent if it says it cannot agree to this here and now. Do not leave it till next year; get on with this and make an announcement in the coming weeks. It is just not fair to those thousands of people out there who cannot make ends meet. It is easy for us to talk about their getting an extra $40 here and an extra $17 there, and they will get an extra $30 through this measure if we were to pass it. The fact is that it is very easy to overlook the straitened circumstances they are in, and we should not do that.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-09-22,"—I will very briefly address this amendment. Senator Evans referred to this being a ludicrous situation. I do not really know whether he meant to say that. I think that Senator Evans is a well-intentioned person and I would not want to attribute to him a meaning he did not intend. But he said that this was a ludicrous situation. It is clear to me that the 928,834 needy Australians who will be the immediate beneficiaries of this additional payment of $30 per week over and above the base pension certainly do not think that $30 a week is ludicrous. I am fortified in my view that people do not think it is ludicrous by a press release today from National Seniors Australia. National Seniors Australia Chief Executive Michael O’Neill said he welcomed the bill, despite claims about the speed with which it was introduced et cetera. He said:
Older Australians are pleased that by introducing this bill into the Senate the pension issue is finally firmly on the national agenda.
He continued:
Single age pensioners living off $281 a week are struggling to keep their heads above water as food, fuel, rental and medical costs soar.
And I would refer to the costs that have gone through the roof since the Rudd Labor government came into office, unaddressed by the government despite promises that they would keep a lid on cost of living increases. Mr O’Neill went on to say:
For these older Australians, an immediate increase represents more than a steak, rather than baked beans, for dinner.
He also said:
It’s very much a matter of social inclusion and providing older Australians with the support they need to live their old age productively.
Then he went on to say:
Despite declaring the single age pension inadequate only two weeks ago, Treasurer Wayne Swan has clearly stated a pension increase will only be made in the context of next year’s budget.
I actually agree with Senator Brown on this issue—how can that be fair? We can only assume the government are actually competent enough to manage a budget and to provide for the most needy Australians—let’s make that assumption. So how can it be that they cannot even look at it or make any commitment without not one but two reviews? This government is addicted to reviews—absolutely paralysed by inaction and incapable of making a decision about anything. We have the Prime Minister absent, swanning around the world stage, and we have needy Australians here looking to the Rudd Labor government to do something about the plight they are in. And what sort of answer do we get tonight from Senator Evans, who is trying to defend the indefensible? ‘It’s complex. We need to look at it and do it properly.’ That is no excuse, I say.
We have to—all of us, collectively—do something for pensioners before two years elapse, which is what we are looking at. The Harmer review will not report until February next year. It is said that that will then feed into the Henry review on tax. So we are looking at something like 2010 before we actually get some serious comprehensive attention to the plight of pensioners. I do not think that is good enough. Quite frankly, it is a very good thing that we are debating the need to do something for these needy Australians and holding the government to account. We can talk here for hours on end rhetorically about who did what and when, but the point is that the government are now the Rudd Labor government. They are in the driving seat. They are sitting on an inherited surplus of $21.5 billion this year and $94-odd billion over the next five years. If they cannot manage their priorities to do something for the most needy Australians, they should not be in government.
It is important in the circumstances that we address this bill and that we bring this debate to a sensible conclusion. I say to Senator Evans, who is the minister representing Ms Macklin and who obviously has some input, history, capacity and ability: make a real change, get on with it, do it, do not talk about it, do not blame anyone else and just fix it.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-22,"—I appreciate the question. We costed it last year and it was about $3.5 billion in total for the whole lot—for all the 3.4 million pensioners, rather than just looking at one million pensioners. It has always been costed.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-09-22,"—I indicate to be helpful that the latest information I have to hand is that Senator Fielding is roughly right about the number of pensioners affected by the original Liberal proposition. About 913,000 pensioners would receive some benefit from the proposition. That leaves about 2.7 million people on pensions, carer payments et cetera with nothing as a result of that measure. So it is clear that it is not a fundamental reform; it is a political stunt that goes no way to addressing the vast majority of people who rely on these payments. It is providing something, yes, for 900,000 people if it were to be implemented, but it is doing nothing for the other 2.7 million. That makes the point that this is knee-jerk and populist but does not fundamentally deal with the serious public policy issues.
While I know that people argue that some groups are more in need than others—and I am sure that that is true, although the arguments about which groups and why and whether or not they are the people in public housing, in the private rental market et cetera, are not convincing—the reality is that those same base rates are being used to set all of these benefits and they flow from the original age pension. What we are doing is breaking from that long established position. If the Liberal proposition were to be supported, they would be saying ‘Well, these 900,000 will get the benefit, and for the other 2.7 million, tough luck, even though that linkage was accepted for the 12 years we were in government. Suddenly, after nine months in opposition, we have decided that’s not relevant anymore; it’s not important anymore; there’s no basis for that anymore. We’ve had this conversion on the road to Damascus.’ Senator Coonan says to me: ‘Well, just fix it. In nine months fix what we failed to deal with in 12 years. It’s all your problem; don’t blame us. You fix it.’
Well, that is easily said. It is much more complex than that. Anyway, we have had those debates. I do not want to labour the point, but we are talking about another 2.7 million people who would get nothing. The Greens are trying to pick up some of those concerns by adding in some other categories, and Senator Fielding, if you like, has doubled it by adding those who are in a partnership—double or nothing. On the latest information I have, if we support the package as amended by the Greens and Senator Fielding, I think we are adding something in the order of $5.7 billion a year. It is $5.7 billion a year, just like that, because they think it is a good idea, without any understanding of the ramifications throughout the aged-care sector, the housing sector, the tapers and the family payments allowance impacts—the thousand impacts that come from a change in the base rate of the pension. ‘Oh, and by the way, it is going to cost $5.7 billion a year.’ That is the sort of depth of consideration that has been given to these issues. ‘Throw in cuts to petrol prices and all those other things; it is very easy.’ Unfortunately the opposition has adopted this position of being all care and no responsibility very quickly. As someone who did 11 hard years in opposition, I say it does not work like that. You do not actually get any credit for it. You actually have to—
—You are certainly not going to get any credit for the way you are going.
—Well, you have to act like an alternative government. I know that when you first go into opposition there is a lot of hurt and a lot of pain, but the cheap, populist stuff does not work. I am sure you will come to that realisation, as we did. You might think it is winning you a few cheers now, but people understand it is complex and expensive and I think they know that the government is committed to trying to do something for those living on pension payments. But it is complex and requires a lot of good public policy work. The government is committed to doing that, having made a down payment, if you like, in its first budget. It was a reasonable question by Senator Brown—and I think Senator Fielding’s response was pretty close to the mark—but we are talking about billions of dollars being done on the run in the Senate chamber. The Liberal proposition was more modest, I suspect, because they knew how expensive this stuff was and they could not defend it publicly, because on the basis of their arguments you would give the payment to everybody. That is the logic of their position. There has been no argument advanced as to why one would exclude carers on the DSP et cetera. The opposition found that when they scrambled to throw vets in. They could not withstand the public pressure about ignoring the veterans, but they were still happy to ignore the carers and those on DSP.
Anyway, we all make our own choices, but the bottom line is that those figures do need to be on the table on the understanding that the costs involved are enormous. As I pointed out earlier, nobody has indicated yet whether they intend to discontinue the bonuses as part of their propositions. I have not heard anyone address that—I might have missed it. I would be interested, of course, in whether or not the bonuses are to continue under the Liberal proposition. If that is the case, I have got their costings wrong. I would be interested if, before this debate ends, Senator Coonan could inform the Senate as to whether or not the Liberal Party intend for the bonuses to be paid next year as well as the utilities allowance—whether these are on top of those payments or replacing those repayments, because obviously that will add enormously to the costs. As I said, with the carers, we have a $1,000 bonus and a $600 bonus. Some people get both. With the utilities allowance, some people will receive bonuses of up to $2,100, which actually puts them better off than with this proposition. I think it is important that we put that stuff on the table—that we hear from the minors and from the Liberal Party opposition whether or not their propositions are in addition to the bonuses and whether or not they have costed the bonuses into the figures they claim. We are just throwing cash around here willy-nilly. I think it is important that we understand what people are actually advocating here. In any event, as I say, on the basis of Senator Fielding extending with his amendments the increases to about 3,690,000 people, which is way above the figure of 900,000 who would benefit from the original Liberal proposition, we end up with a figure, on a rough calculation, of about $5.7 billion per annum or $22 billion to $23 billion over the budget cycle.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-09-22,"—I must say that an enduring image of the lead-up to the last budget was the sight of Labor scrambling to pay the carers bonus and the bonus for seniors, having refused to make any commitment, and then scrambling to provide the list of so-called benefits that I think Senator Evans has now outlined on four or five occasions. It does not actually get any better no matter how many times you say it; it is still meagre. What the coalition is proposing is to provide, in addition to those bonuses, a $30 payment. One of the things that appears to be confusing Minister Macklin—and she has infected Senator Evans with her lack of understanding—is the idea that this payment will actually affect the base rate. That is not the intention and the bill expressly provides that it will not have that effect. It is a payment in addition to the base rate pension. Ms Macklin was quoted as saying something which I think is quite extraordinary and which I will share with the chamber. She said:
Many of them are pleading with us to not just increase the base rate of the pension, because if that happens they will see a lot of the increase in the pension go in increased rents.
She obviously has not read the bill, because quite obviously the additional $30 per week is not added on for the rate used under the income test and is not used for other purposes—for example, like setting the daily care fee in a nursing home, which is currently 85 per cent of the single pension rate.
So, yes, it is complex, but rather than creating policy on the run we have actually thought this through and done it in such a way that this is calculated to actually give the intended recipient some benefit—rather than the endless empty rhetoric and promises we hear from the Labor Party. I must say I find it really peculiar logic that the Labor Party is engaged in in this debate—about the 928,834 people included in this measure—that, because not every pension recipient is included, those 928,834 people should miss out. That is quite extraordinary: to actually be advocating that if you do not have everybody in then nobody should get it. And then they are opposing an amendment of Senator Fielding because he wants to put them in. Go figure. You cannot have it every which way. This has to be a serious look at a rationale for looking after the most vulnerable, disadvantaged age pensioners. The rationale for that is clear—that is not something that is difficult to talk about or difficult to justify. Nobody says that carers do not deserve some urgent attention, and I certainly think that the government should be looking at them before there are two reviews and a couple of years of water under the bridge.
Recently the Rudd government presented the states and territories with a proposal that would actually transfer all disability services to the states’ responsibility. The Rudd government has clearly washed its hands of the aged, carers and people with a disability—just as it is attempting to do through its proposal to transfer control of disability services over to the states and territories. All that carers have got from the Labor government is uncertainty. It refused to rule out cutting the carers bonus. Reluctantly, kicking and screaming, the Rudd government backed down under pressure from the coalition and from constituents. We are currently looking at a comprehensive policy that will cover all pension recipients and do it in such a way that the most vulnerable in our society, including carers and people with disability, are assisted.
The rationale for our current bill, however, is that there is, as Senator Evans quite rightly points out, a lot of different rates and benefits. I am very pleased to see this, but age pensioners are not eligible for some of the extra benefits that disability support pensioners receive for their particular circumstances. That does, of course, make them particularly vulnerable because they do not get some of the extra benefits, say, that a single at-home under-18-year-old gets if they have a disability—$295.10 a fortnight. A single independent under 18 gets $456 per fortnight. A single at home aged 18 to 20 gets a different rate. A single independent aged 18 to 20 gets a different rate again. None of these is applicable to the age pension. A member of a couple gets $456 per fortnight, but that is not applicable to the age pension. A member of a couple with disabilities gets a different benefit not applicable to the age pension.
So there are different benefits that are available to different pension recipients. That is in no way to say that, across the board, pension recipients do not need some urgent attention, but the rationale for this bill is very clear. It has been thought through. It is anything other than policy on the run. The coalition is deadly serious that this is a group of people who need help. They need it now, and the Labor government should get on with it and deliver it.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-09-22,"—I just want to be sure that I do not misrepresent Senator Coonan. I take it that, in response to my earlier comments, she has confirmed that the Liberal-National Party coalition are committing to a $30 increase in the rate of the base pension for all single age pensioners and veterans—and that that is to be on top of maintenance of the $500 annual utility allowance, the maintenance of the $500 bonus, and the maintenance of the $1,000 carer and $600 carer payment bonuses. I just want to be certain, when I do the costings of these policies, that that is what the Liberal opposition are committing to.
—That’s what I said.
—I just want to be absolutely clear so that I do not then misrepresent you, because that is the first time I have heard that stated as Liberal Party policy. I do not want to be accused of misunderstanding. So you are committing to all of those payments on the same basis that they are currently paid and to the propositions contained in your bill.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-09-22,"—I will answer that, because that is not what I said. What I said was that we will be paying an additional $30 and that that is in addition to the pension; it is not part of the base rate of the pension. It is over and above the base rate pension. I am making absolutely no other commitment. The Rudd Labor government is in government, and it will be a matter for them as to what they do with any other arrangements and bonuses. We will, as part of looking at our overall comprehensive response, make our announcements about this in due course.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-09-22,"—I think it is important that I respond, because this is quite a revelation to me. Certainly Senator Coonan indicated earlier that the $30 would be additional to the bonuses. We now have the proposition that she will not guarantee the bonuses, so carers and others might be up to $40 a week worse off under the proposition she has just outlined, which I think will be of concern to those carers. But, if we take it that the average pensioner is currently receiving the $500 bonus and the $500 utility allowance, they are receiving $1,000 under the Rudd Labor government budget which the opposition spokesman will not guarantee—sorry, no longer the opposition spokesman; like former Minister Abbott, she seems not to want to retain an interest in these areas. It would seem to me that what the Liberal Party are now saying is that they are supporting a $30 a week increase for a small number of the pensioners—the 900,000 on the age and veterans affairs pensions—but are refusing to guarantee the equivalent of the $20-a-week rate that pensioners got from this government as a set of bonuses and through the payment of the utilities allowance. So, potentially, what we are hearing now is that the Liberal Party’s proposition is that we increase the base pension rate by $30 and take away the equivalent of $20 a week which we pay through the bonus system. Originally Senator Coonan indicated to the Senate that the $30-a-week pension increase was in addition to the payment of those allowances. In her last contribution Senator Coonan said that she could not guarantee that and that that was a question for review.
—No, they’re already paid.
—No, it is about future policy, Senator Coonan.
—That’s for you, not us.
—This is about how you suggest you would frame the budget. If it were about us, you would not be putting the bill up. You are attempting to set the social security policy of the nation.
—No, I’m not. I’m trying to save people.
—You are trying to move a new bill. I think pensioners listening tonight would want to know: are you offering them $30 a week and taking $20 away, so that you are offering them $10 net, or are you offering them $30 plus the $20? On the basis of what you just said, you are offering them $30 minus the $20 that you are not going to guarantee—the $1,000 worth of bonuses they received this year under the Rudd Labor government. So I think it is important. I have not heard from the minors on this question either.
If you are going to parade around the place saying that you are going to be the saviour of pensioners by making these promises that you never actually delivered in government, I think we need to be clear: what is the alternative government saying? Are you saying that you are supporting a $30 increase in the pension rate for single pensioners and veterans but that you are not going to guarantee the bonuses, or are you guaranteeing the bonuses and saying that the $30 is in addition to those bonus payments? It is a fairly simple question—it is something that we ought to know—but so far, Senator Coonan, you have given two different answers to the same question. I am sure pensioners and the Senate would like to know the answer.",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-09-22,"—I am quite sure that Senator Evans’s confected confusion is not genuine, because what I have clearly said, and what this bill clearly provides, is that we are paying an additional $30 per week over and above the base indexed pension rate. It is not an increase to the pension rate; it is a $30 payment over and above it. I do not think that that is a difficult proposition. That is what the bill says. If Senator Evans has read the bill, it must be obvious.
—Are you guaranteeing the bonuses or not?
—Well, are you? This is a question for the Labor government. Are you going to guarantee the bonuses in future? You scrambled; you had no idea whether you were going to pay anything at all this year before the budget. When I was referring to ‘over and above’ with the bonuses, I was talking about what is already being paid. We have under review our policies—
—Oh, you’re having a review.
—No, we are not having a review. We are not having your review. We are having a good and serious look at how we can have a comprehensive response across the board for our pensioners. I doubt it would take us two whole reviews—the Harmer review and the Henry review. It is very interesting when you look at the Labor government: if they really want to slug the Australian public, they do not bother to wait for a review to get the luxury car tax slug onto Australians; that is in here before there is any review. So, if it suits the Labor government to slug Australians, they just put up taxes. But it certainly does not wash when it comes to the most needy Australians. We are saying, and have said very clearly, what we are doing. You are the government, and the question for you is: are you going to guarantee the bonuses into the future?",SENATE,<title>URGENT RELIEF FOR SINGLE AGE PENSIONERS BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-09-22,"—I would like to put it on the record that, from a Greens perspective, this is on top of the bonuses. It is in addition to the bonuses.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-09-22,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 is a very important bill for the National Party. It is one that I do not believe that the government or the Independents have really thought hard about—what it is going to achieve. Senator Fielding has moved amendments that would exclude farmers and tourism operators from the increased tax, but he has overlooked the fact that there are many, many other people in rural Australia who find four-wheel drives not a luxury but an absolute necessity when living out in remote areas. I suggest to you, Senator Fielding, that some of the people you may have forgotten are people in Aboriginal communities, who always use four-wheel drives. If you ever go to the communities, you will be met at the airport by a Toyota or a Nissan or another four-wheel drive.
Over the weekend I received a letter from the boating industry, saying:
Like farmers and tourist operators, boat manufacturers and distributors rely on the use of large four-wheel drives in the course of their day-to-day operations in order to tow boats in accordance with the law on towing ratios—e.g. a 3.5-tonne boat must be towed by a Toyota LandCruiser or a vehicle of equal power. These vehicles cost in excess of $57,000. There are 1500 boating industry association members across the nation who will be affected by the luxury car tax …
They go on to say:
There are 850,000 registered boats in Australia that are towable.
All these people are going to be hit by the increased sales tax. Then, if you look at the caravan industry, there are similar problems there. Four-wheel drive vehicles are absolutely essential to carrying on the business of caravan and boat distributors. So, although I appreciate the exemption amendment that Senator Fielding has moved, it is not only farmers and tourism operators. There are many, many other people in the western areas that have to have a four-wheel drive to actually live in those areas.
Some time ago, when the Labor Party was previously in power, the National Party experienced a series of car accidents involving its members. Unfortunately, the wives of two National Party members were killed in car accidents in the west: Bruce Cowan’s wife and Noel Hicks’s wife. Tim Fischer, the former Deputy Prime Minister, had a car accident in which two people were killed. John Anderson’s wife rolled a car seven times and was very fortunate to be able to get out with their children. The then Labor Party realised that if you were going to travel out west and do great distances on poor roads then it was essential to be in a car of some substance. That is why the then Labor Party, to their credit, offered people with vast electorates a four-wheel-drive vehicle. They did it not because they thought it would be flash for members of parliament to drive four-wheel drives but because it was absolutely essential that those members had the type of car that would give them some protection.
I say to the Labor Party: if it was good enough for members of parliament to have this allowance for four-wheel drives over $57,000 then why isn’t it for doctors, nurses, stock and station agents, contractors and wheat harvesters, for example, who all use four-wheel drives to travel vast distances? Why are they excluded? Why are they excluded from a safety measure? Those people do not use these cars because they want to be flash or just to have a four-wheel-drive vehicle; they use them because there is no other way that they can safely travel such areas. So I cannot see why the Labor government, after making a declaration that some members of parliament needed four-wheel drives to get around their electorates, would exclude other people who need these four-wheel drives as much as those members of parliament.
There are so many people out there that do require these four-wheel drives for safety reasons—and we are going to exclude them with this bill. We are going to put a tax of 33 per cent on $57,000 cars. They are not flash cars, but once you have to add a bullbar and a few other extras to them they will come in at over $90,000. I just think it is essential that these people who live out in the western areas are not deprived of such vehicles. Their needs are as great as the farmers’; their needs are as great as the tourism industry’s.
For the life of me I cannot see why Senator Bob Brown cannot see that. I cannot see why he would persecute people in the western areas when he, in his amendments, has excluded Audis, Alfa Romeos, BMWs, Jaguars and Saabs. These are flash, expensive cars. They do not offer any protection for people who live in remote areas. How can the Greens, who are always appealing for pensioners and others who are in need, exclude Audis, Alfa Romeos, BMWs, Jaguars and Saabs? It sends out the absolute wrong message.
The Greens do not add the extra tax to those cars and yet they add a 33 per cent tax on the workhorse of Australia—the four-wheel drives used by people such as the kangaroo shooters, Aboriginal communities and other people out west who must have these cars. I suspect the Flying Doctor Service would have four-wheel drives—they certainly have four-wheel drives but I wonder if they too pay taxes on them. These are the people you are picking up. These are the needy people that you should be helping, not the BMW, Audi and Alfa Romeo drivers. I never see them out there. In towns like Longreach or Roma or west of that, Audis and BMWs are probably there but I do not recall ever seeing them. But lined up in the streets are the Nissan Patrols and the Toyotas—car after car—and they do not all belong to farmers or graziers. They belong to the people who live there, whether it be the local hardware store owner, the local stock and station agent or the butcher. They have got to have those cars. Why are we discriminating against those people? Why are the Greens discriminating against Aborigines, the Flying Doctor Service and the councils—although I do not think the councils pay tax, but I am not sure of that? All those people use those cars.
There is another reason why this increased tax should not be applied to the cars priced around $57,000. We read in the paper, time and time again, how the car industry in Australia is battling. It is being hit by cheap imports flooding into Australia. It has got to the stage now that the car industry is very, very shaky. And now we are going to increase the tax on 11,000—or 10 to 12 per cent—of the cars that are made in Australia. That will make them less competitive, it will make them harder to sell and it will cost jobs, particularly in the car industry. While we are losing jobs in the Australian car industry, we are giving a tick to the Alfa Romeos, the Audis, the Jaguars and the BMWs.
The Greens are not noted for their support for the big end of town. They say that they represent the people from the small end of town. I ask Senator Brown why he is protecting the big end of town—the millionaires who have $300,000 cars—when the people who make the Australian cars are holding on by their fingernails.
We are debating the 11,000 Australian-made cars that are going to have an increased tax on them. And I do not know why Senator Milne, who is also a battler for the smaller person, would support the millionaires with the Audis and Alfas. They drive cars worth $300,000, and you are supporting them, Senator Milne. But you are not supporting the people who are making Australian cars, who are being hit very hard by imports. I fail to understand why this is the case.
The National Party, through Senator Williams, is going to move an amendment for cars over $90,000, which is about where the average Land Rover or Nissan Patrol, with a few add-ons such as bull bars and things like that, is priced. We are not trying to protect multimillion dollar cars. We will vote against this legislation, but we are not trying to protect the cars that are very expensive. We are saying to the Senate, ‘For goodness sake, we have a problem with the car industry in Australia.’ We need an Australian car industry and the last thing we need is an increased tax on the Australian car industry, which employs so many workers in Adelaide and Victoria, with a flow-on effect to the accessory and parts manufacturers. This is crazy stuff. I do not know why the Labor Party would have done it. On one hand they try to do some social engineering on the car industry by giving grants to Toyota for a hybrid car and on the other hand they are trying to pull the rug out from under the car industry. They are giving with one hand and taking away with the other.
The result of that is that they are depriving rural and regional Australia of its workhorse. No-one seems to realise that. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to know by what rationale Senator Brown can reduce the tax on the millionaire type car but ping the battlers in rural and regional Australia. If he has any explanation, I would be very glad to hear it.
—Now?
—You will have your chance after, Senator Brown. If you can turn that pig’s ear into a silk purse, I will be very surprised. If you cannot explain your way out of it, no-one can explain their way out of it.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Boswell, please address your remarks through the chair.
—I am being challenged, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Baited.
—I am being baited and challenged. We all remember Senator George Campbell. He came down here breathing fire and brimstone—he was going to do everything. But he was not tough enough, as Senator Barnaby Joyce has said; he went soft. So they sent Senator Doug Cameron down, and wasn’t he going to play merry hell! Wasn’t he going to stir the Senate up! Wasn’t he going to come in here and protect the car workers! Well, he has been like a damp squib. He has not even raised his voice. I say to Senator Doug Cameron: the Senate will find you out. You cannot run; you cannot hide. In the end, the Senate finds you out—and it has not taken very long for the Senate to find Senator Doug Cameron out. I do not know whether he said anything in caucus; I do not know whether he stood up for the car industry, but he certainly has not stood up in this public place. He has been like a damp squib.
As Senator Joyce pointed out, Senator Cameron is on the Left. The Left do not get much of a say—they get a bit of a bone thrown at them on social issues, to do a bit of social engineering here and there. But the Right have command of all of the big issues. Senator Doug Cameron ought to think about either changing his faction or standing up in the Senate.
I cannot understand this. To me it is just a no-brainer. The government made a decision 10 or 12 years ago—probably 13 years ago—that four-wheel drives were essential for members of parliament. Every member of parliament with a big electorate drives one, because he has to, whether he be Labor, National Party or Liberal. So, if it is good enough for members of parliament, why isn’t it good enough for every other citizen? If we say members of parliament have to have four-wheel drives because it is dangerous without one and people are being killed, what is the difference? Why should we be a different class from the rest of the people who live out in rural and regional Australia?
If Senator Brown can explain to me why the Audis and the big end of town—the $300,000 cars—should have a reduced amount of sales tax and the workhorses should get pinged, I would be very interested to hear about it. I am sure the people in rural and regional Australia—and there are a few of them who vote out there; a few misguided teachers and so forth—
—This will put the taxes you’re defending into rural schools and hospitals. You’re not going to have the money for that.
—We will look after the rural schools and hospitals. Just let us protect the people’s lives and their families’ lives and their kids’ lives when they are driving to school on these rough roads. You are depriving those people of safety and I find it very difficult to understand. I find it difficult to understand the Labor Party’s position on this social issue—or on the economic issue.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-09-22,"—My colleagues have clearly explained why the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 should be thrown out. Senator Boswell has just very clearly argued all of the various reasons. So I will not repeat them. I am conscious that this is a budget bill and we want to get through the budget bills as quickly as possible. I am just going to make a very short contribution because, as I say, I know my colleagues have canvassed all of the issues.
I spoke when this bill was first before the chamber, on behalf of people in rural and regional Australia. I have just finished a 4,000-kilometre road trip through north-western Queensland, up in the Gulf Country, out to Mount Isa and back through all the country towns to Townsville.
—How many Audis did you see out there?
—Not many Audis; quite correct, Senator Boswell. I did see a hell of a lot of four-wheel drives. They are four-wheel drives with bullbars, spotlights and Shoo Roos. I should declare an interest: I drive a four-wheel drive with a bull bar, spotlights and a Shoo Roo which, I think, does not work.
—Better get it fixed.
—I am not sure that they are as good as they are made out to be. But if you add the extras together, a fairly ordinary four-wheel drive can become expensive. The mums who drive their kids the 40 or 50 kilometres to the nearest school need all those sorts of things. Up in the north-west it gets pretty hot around summertime, and air conditioning is not a luxury; it is an essentiality—it is a necessity. But under the Labor Party’s envy legislation all of those things are said to constitute a luxury car.
There are amendments flying around. I am not sure that I quite understand them. I am not sure whether they apply to the non-farm four-wheel drive that, as I said, I see a lot of mothers driving their children in—not just down to the train station or to the school half a kilometre away, as the lucky people in the cities do, but the 30, 40 or 50 kilometres a day to school and then picking them up in the afternoon and coming home at dusk, when the kangaroos are particularly bad. They are the sorts of people that will be impacted by this legislation. There are also the vets; the mechanics, who may have to drive 100 kilometres to get out to a farm to fix a tractor; the farming contractors; the shearers; and the helicopter pilots, so essential in the grazing industry these days, who have to get to their place of work in a four-wheel-drive vehicle—not a luxury vehicle but a four-wheel drive vehicle.
Up where I come from tourism is an enormously important industry. It is a bit difficult at the moment—there are real problems—but a lot of people in that industry make their living out of what, under this legislation, are luxury cars: the sorts of vehicles that international tourists expect will pick them up in Cairns and drive them the 80 kilometres up to Port Douglas. Those cars are also used by those who do adventure tourism, an essential part of the tourism experience in Northern Australia. They are the sorts of people that will be attacked by this legislation of envy by the Labor Party.
It is all done, as I understand it, in order to keep the budget in balance. For goodness sake, the Howard-Costello government left the incoming government a surplus of $22 billion. While the coalition, when it came into power, found that it had a $96 billion deficit to deal with, this government has inherited a $22 billion surplus. This legislation is supposed to maintain the surplus, but the surplus was already there. It was given to them through sound, wise economic management by Peter Costello, John Howard and Nick Minchin in days gone by. So the idea that this legislation, amended as it will be, will make much difference at all to the budget defies any logic. What it will do is put extra burdens onto those people who live in the areas remote from the capital cities. I know if you live in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Adelaide you do not really see much of what happens outside. But when you get out into these areas, the four-wheel drive is an essential means of conveyance: it is essential for the safety of all people who live in remote areas of the bush.
In concluding, because I do not want to hold up this debate—it is a budget measure, and I do want us to move forward with it—I plead to all those senators sitting opposite and on the cross-benches to spare a thought for people who live in remote Australia when dealing with legislation like this. This government—I do not think it is deliberate—does not have a lot of understanding or empathy with those who live in remote areas. I just ask all senators to consider that when thinking how they will vote on this legislation. I hope that, after considering those people, the impact on the industry and the little impact it will have on the overall budget surplus, others join with those on this side in voting this legislation down.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2008-09-22,"—I would like to support my colleagues on this side of the Senate in opposing the luxury car tax and make a few short contributions, because most of the arguments have been put very well, including by Senator Macdonald and Senator Boswell, the two previous speakers. I want to highlight the concerns I have, particularly for small businesspeople in and around Tasmania. This so-called luxury car tax will put up the tax and will put up the costs, which will make it harder for small businesses to operate and do well. We have some very rugged and rural parts in areas of Tasmania such as the central highlands, northern Midlands, west coast and east coast, where small businesspeople need four-wheel drive vehicles. I am thinking of the builders, tradesmen, electricians, plumbers, contractors and the like who operate in and around these rural and regional parts of Tasmania, and indeed in the cities and the towns of Tasmania. They are going to be under increased pressure as a result of this ridiculous proposal to increase the tax. You have the farmers and the farming communities who are going to be directly affected in an adverse way. Tourism has been mentioned. The tourism industry in Tasmania is particularly important not only in the capital cities but throughout the state. There is a whole range of people, and in particular small businesses, that are going to cop it in the neck.
Another contribution I wanted to make relates to the actual car dealers themselves who have not been referred to much during this debate. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries have put forward a lot of good information, including monthly figures on the number of vehicles sold in Australia and the like. The fact is that their members—and I am going to name the one that I know in Launceston, whom I have talked to about this: Bruce Stevenson Toyota—employ hard-working Launcestonians, hard-working Tasmanians. The tax will make it harder for them. It has ramifications across the board.
When this government wants to increase the tax, there are ramifications. As Senator Macdonald said, they have a $22 billion surplus. Why do they want to do it? Why do they want to increase this tax? As was noted in the Senate report brought down just last week, this tax would also be inflationary. These are the concerns that I have. It is not about BMWs, Porsches, Audis and those sorts of vehicles; this luxury car tax will hurt—and I am going to name it—the Toyota LandCruiser, the best-selling so-called luxury car. Other targeted vehicles include the Mitsubishi Pajero; the Nissan Patrol; the Chrysler Voyager; the Toyota Tarago, which is a people mover; and the Volkswagen Multivan. Those are a few, and most are working vehicles; they are family vehicles and hardly the choice of transport for the idle rich, which is exactly what this government is trying to paint the opposition into accepting. We will not accept that.
The tax will cost jobs; it will put up prices; and with the unemployment rate rising it could not come at a worse time. That is my contribution. I do not for one minute accept the government’s proposition. I stand with my colleague senators on this side of the chamber to oppose it wholeheartedly.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-22,"—I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 and related bills. The government has agreed to Family First’s common-sense demands to exempt farmers and tourism operators from the increased car tax. Last fortnight Family First was concerned that the car tax would unfairly hit farmers and tourism operators. We have now been able to get that exemption for those people, and that makes a lot of sense. Family First has been able to successfully negotiate with the government, and the government has agreed to concessions worth $40 million over four years. Vehicles purchased by farmers and tourism operators are tools of trade. Some other businesses already get full exemptions for their vehicles from the car tax, so farmers and tourism operators should also not be slugged with the extra tax. They are already struggling with high petrol prices, the impact of the drought and the strong Australian dollar. Farmers and tourism operators can only claim depreciation and GST input tax credits up to the $57,180 car tax threshold. These tax breaks do not cover the extra tax.
The amendments negotiated with the government provide refunds to farmers and tourism operators so they can claim back the extra eight per cent car tax from the Australian Taxation Office once they have purchased their four-wheel-drive vehicle. The amendments allow claims of up to $3,000 per year for primary producers and $3,000 per year for tourism operators. The tourism industry is heavily dependent on the eight-seater Toyota LandCruiser and similar four-wheel-drive vehicles. The extra tax would have unfairly hit small tourism operators in regional Australia as they need their four-wheel-drive vehicles. Farmers are also dependent on heavy-duty four-wheel-drive vehicles, like the LandCruiser, which offer reliability and safety in regional and remote areas, especially on poorly maintained roads. Family First has had a lot of emails and phone calls from farmers and tourism operators to support this initiative. The Australian Tourism Export Council pointed out:
... that the tourism industry basically runs on the eight-seater diesel LandCruiser.
The council also said:
The cost impact is hitting a range of small businesses in regional Australia such as four-wheel-drive tour operators in rural Australia.
The majority of tourism businesses in Australia are small family operated concerns. One regional tour operator made a special trip to my office in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago to tell my staff how important his four-wheel-drive was to his business. He does outback tourism and he said that he needs a reliable car to make sure he does not break down in the middle of nowhere; it is essential as a tool for his work. Another regional tour operator wrote to me saying how important his four-wheel-drive is to his business. He said:
We have exceptional working relationships with all the property owners, in South Australia, who have 4WD tracks on their properties. They have taken the decision to encourage tourism based on the drought and continuing poor returns from what was once their core business, farming.
All of us also tend to travel at least twice the average 14000 kms that city folk do and most of that is on dirt roads and/or over quite long distances.
The Victorian Farmers Federation President, Simon Ramsay, supports the amendments as common sense. He said:
... our industry there is a dependence on transport and obviously given the localities and isolated areas not only within the state of Victoria, but nationwide, is dependent on large robust vehicles …
In Queensland AgForce Chief Executive, Brett de Hyer, said that four-wheel-drives are not a luxury item for farmers. He said:
Many farmers in Queensland (particularly in far western and northern areas) regularly travel hundreds of kilometres to their nearest town for essential supplies, health care and children’s schooling, and they need a vehicle that can handle those conditions—it is a necessity, not a luxury.
The South Australian Farmers Federation has also given its endorsement, with spokesman Peter White saying that he is happy with the changes ‘now that farmers are being looked after’. Last Wednesday I had an email from a farmer in Western Australia who said:
We are one of those farmers you were talking about. Farming in almost any area of the country is under siege. Right from the central midlands of Tasmania to here in the wheatbelt of WA markets, price squeeze, inputs, no infrastructure all take their toll. We do need a 4WD just for safe driving out here.
They are an essential item in our toolkit both on the farm to get about and to drive the vast distances we need to, to do any tasks at all.
Family First is not here to frustrate the government of the day, whether it is this one or the previous one. We are not elected to government but we are elected to vote and to look at issues on their merits. We have put forward constructive concerns to the government to take care of unintended consequences—I do not think they have ever set out to hit farmers and tourism operators—and that is what we have done. I urge all senators to back Family First’s amendments.
Question put:
That these bills be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-09-22,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 is a very important bill for the National Party. It is one that I do not believe that the government or the Independents have really thought hard about—what it is going to achieve. Senator Fielding has moved amendments that would exclude farmers and tourism operators from the increased tax, but he has overlooked the fact that there are many, many other people in rural Australia who find four-wheel drives not a luxury but an absolute necessity when living out in remote areas. I suggest to you, Senator Fielding, that some of the people you may have forgotten are people in Aboriginal communities, who always use four-wheel drives. If you ever go to the communities, you will be met at the airport by a Toyota or a Nissan or another four-wheel drive.
Over the weekend I received a letter from the boating industry, saying:
Like farmers and tourist operators, boat manufacturers and distributors rely on the use of large four-wheel drives in the course of their day-to-day operations in order to tow boats in accordance with the law on towing ratios—e.g. a 3.5-tonne boat must be towed by a Toyota LandCruiser or a vehicle of equal power. These vehicles cost in excess of $57,000. There are 1500 boating industry association members across the nation who will be affected by the luxury car tax …
They go on to say:
There are 850,000 registered boats in Australia that are towable.
All these people are going to be hit by the increased sales tax. Then, if you look at the caravan industry, there are similar problems there. Four-wheel drive vehicles are absolutely essential to carrying on the business of caravan and boat distributors. So, although I appreciate the exemption amendment that Senator Fielding has moved, it is not only farmers and tourism operators. There are many, many other people in the western areas that have to have a four-wheel drive to actually live in those areas.
Some time ago, when the Labor Party was previously in power, the National Party experienced a series of car accidents involving its members. Unfortunately, the wives of two National Party members were killed in car accidents in the west: Bruce Cowan’s wife and Noel Hicks’s wife. Tim Fischer, the former Deputy Prime Minister, had a car accident in which two people were killed. John Anderson’s wife rolled a car seven times and was very fortunate to be able to get out with their children. The then Labor Party realised that if you were going to travel out west and do great distances on poor roads then it was essential to be in a car of some substance. That is why the then Labor Party, to their credit, offered people with vast electorates a four-wheel-drive vehicle. They did it not because they thought it would be flash for members of parliament to drive four-wheel drives but because it was absolutely essential that those members had the type of car that would give them some protection.
I say to the Labor Party: if it was good enough for members of parliament to have this allowance for four-wheel drives over $57,000 then why isn’t it for doctors, nurses, stock and station agents, contractors and wheat harvesters, for example, who all use four-wheel drives to travel vast distances? Why are they excluded? Why are they excluded from a safety measure? Those people do not use these cars because they want to be flash or just to have a four-wheel-drive vehicle; they use them because there is no other way that they can safely travel such areas. So I cannot see why the Labor government, after making a declaration that some members of parliament needed four-wheel drives to get around their electorates, would exclude other people who need these four-wheel drives as much as those members of parliament.
There are so many people out there that do require these four-wheel drives for safety reasons—and we are going to exclude them with this bill. We are going to put a tax of 33 per cent on $57,000 cars. They are not flash cars, but once you have to add a bullbar and a few other extras to them they will come in at over $90,000. I just think it is essential that these people who live out in the western areas are not deprived of such vehicles. Their needs are as great as the farmers’; their needs are as great as the tourism industry’s.
For the life of me I cannot see why Senator Bob Brown cannot see that. I cannot see why he would persecute people in the western areas when he, in his amendments, has excluded Audis, Alfa Romeos, BMWs, Jaguars and Saabs. These are flash, expensive cars. They do not offer any protection for people who live in remote areas. How can the Greens, who are always appealing for pensioners and others who are in need, exclude Audis, Alfa Romeos, BMWs, Jaguars and Saabs? It sends out the absolute wrong message.
The Greens do not add the extra tax to those cars and yet they add a 33 per cent tax on the workhorse of Australia—the four-wheel drives used by people such as the kangaroo shooters, Aboriginal communities and other people out west who must have these cars. I suspect the Flying Doctor Service would have four-wheel drives—they certainly have four-wheel drives but I wonder if they too pay taxes on them. These are the people you are picking up. These are the needy people that you should be helping, not the BMW, Audi and Alfa Romeo drivers. I never see them out there. In towns like Longreach or Roma or west of that, Audis and BMWs are probably there but I do not recall ever seeing them. But lined up in the streets are the Nissan Patrols and the Toyotas—car after car—and they do not all belong to farmers or graziers. They belong to the people who live there, whether it be the local hardware store owner, the local stock and station agent or the butcher. They have got to have those cars. Why are we discriminating against those people? Why are the Greens discriminating against Aborigines, the Flying Doctor Service and the councils—although I do not think the councils pay tax, but I am not sure of that? All those people use those cars.
There is another reason why this increased tax should not be applied to the cars priced around $57,000. We read in the paper, time and time again, how the car industry in Australia is battling. It is being hit by cheap imports flooding into Australia. It has got to the stage now that the car industry is very, very shaky. And now we are going to increase the tax on 11,000—or 10 to 12 per cent—of the cars that are made in Australia. That will make them less competitive, it will make them harder to sell and it will cost jobs, particularly in the car industry. While we are losing jobs in the Australian car industry, we are giving a tick to the Alfa Romeos, the Audis, the Jaguars and the BMWs.
The Greens are not noted for their support for the big end of town. They say that they represent the people from the small end of town. I ask Senator Brown why he is protecting the big end of town—the millionaires who have $300,000 cars—when the people who make the Australian cars are holding on by their fingernails.
We are debating the 11,000 Australian-made cars that are going to have an increased tax on them. And I do not know why Senator Milne, who is also a battler for the smaller person, would support the millionaires with the Audis and Alfas. They drive cars worth $300,000, and you are supporting them, Senator Milne. But you are not supporting the people who are making Australian cars, who are being hit very hard by imports. I fail to understand why this is the case.
The National Party, through Senator Williams, is going to move an amendment for cars over $90,000, which is about where the average Land Rover or Nissan Patrol, with a few add-ons such as bull bars and things like that, is priced. We are not trying to protect multimillion dollar cars. We will vote against this legislation, but we are not trying to protect the cars that are very expensive. We are saying to the Senate, ‘For goodness sake, we have a problem with the car industry in Australia.’ We need an Australian car industry and the last thing we need is an increased tax on the Australian car industry, which employs so many workers in Adelaide and Victoria, with a flow-on effect to the accessory and parts manufacturers. This is crazy stuff. I do not know why the Labor Party would have done it. On one hand they try to do some social engineering on the car industry by giving grants to Toyota for a hybrid car and on the other hand they are trying to pull the rug out from under the car industry. They are giving with one hand and taking away with the other.
The result of that is that they are depriving rural and regional Australia of its workhorse. No-one seems to realise that. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to know by what rationale Senator Brown can reduce the tax on the millionaire type car but ping the battlers in rural and regional Australia. If he has any explanation, I would be very glad to hear it.
—Now?
—You will have your chance after, Senator Brown. If you can turn that pig’s ear into a silk purse, I will be very surprised. If you cannot explain your way out of it, no-one can explain their way out of it.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Boswell, please address your remarks through the chair.
—I am being challenged, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Baited.
—I am being baited and challenged. We all remember Senator George Campbell. He came down here breathing fire and brimstone—he was going to do everything. But he was not tough enough, as Senator Barnaby Joyce has said; he went soft. So they sent Senator Doug Cameron down, and wasn’t he going to play merry hell! Wasn’t he going to stir the Senate up! Wasn’t he going to come in here and protect the car workers! Well, he has been like a damp squib. He has not even raised his voice. I say to Senator Doug Cameron: the Senate will find you out. You cannot run; you cannot hide. In the end, the Senate finds you out—and it has not taken very long for the Senate to find Senator Doug Cameron out. I do not know whether he said anything in caucus; I do not know whether he stood up for the car industry, but he certainly has not stood up in this public place. He has been like a damp squib.
As Senator Joyce pointed out, Senator Cameron is on the Left. The Left do not get much of a say—they get a bit of a bone thrown at them on social issues, to do a bit of social engineering here and there. But the Right have command of all of the big issues. Senator Doug Cameron ought to think about either changing his faction or standing up in the Senate.

The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries have put forward a lot of good information, including monthly figures on the number of vehicles sold in Australia and the like. The fact is that their members—and I am going to name the one that I know in Launceston, whom I have talked to about this: Bruce Stevenson Toyota—employ hard-working Launcestonians, hard-working Tasmanians. The tax will make it harder for them. It has ramifications across the board.
When this government wants to increase the tax, there are ramifications. As Senator Macdonald said, they have a $22 billion surplus. Why do they want to do it? Why do they want to increase this tax? As was noted in the Senate report brought down just last week, this tax would also be inflationary. These are the concerns that I have. It is not about BMWs, Porsches, Audis and those sorts of vehicles; this luxury car tax will hurt—and I am going to name it—the Toyota LandCruiser, the best-selling so-called luxury car. Other targeted vehicles include the Mitsubishi Pajero; the Nissan Patrol; the Chrysler Voyager; the Toyota Tarago, which is a people mover; and the Volkswagen Multivan. Those are a few, and most are working vehicles; they are family vehicles and hardly the choice of transport for the idle rich, which is exactly what this government is trying to paint the opposition into accepting. We will not accept that.
The tax will cost jobs; it will put up prices; and with the unemployment rate rising it could not come at a worse time. That is my contribution. I do not for one minute accept the government’s proposition. I stand with my colleague senators on this side of the chamber to oppose it wholeheartedly.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,20,2
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-22,"—I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 and related bills. The government has agreed to Family First’s common-sense demands to exempt farmers and tourism operators from the increased car tax. Last fortnight Family First was concerned that the car tax would unfairly hit farmers and tourism operators. We have now been able to get that exemption for those people, and that makes a lot of sense. Family First has been able to successfully negotiate with the government, and the government has agreed to concessions worth $40 million over four years. Vehicles purchased by farmers and tourism operators are tools of trade. Some other businesses already get full exemptions for their vehicles from the car tax, so farmers and tourism operators should also not be slugged with the extra tax. They are already struggling with high petrol prices, the impact of the drought and the strong Australian dollar. Farmers and tourism operators can only claim depreciation and GST input tax credits up to the $57,180 car tax threshold. These tax breaks do not cover the extra tax.
The amendments negotiated with the government provide refunds to farmers and tourism operators so they can claim back the extra eight per cent car tax from the Australian Taxation Office once they have purchased their four-wheel-drive vehicle. The amendments allow claims of up to $3,000 per year for primary producers and $3,000 per year for tourism operators. The tourism industry is heavily dependent on the eight-seater Toyota LandCruiser and similar four-wheel-drive vehicles. The extra tax would have unfairly hit small tourism operators in regional Australia as they need their four-wheel-drive vehicles. Farmers are also dependent on heavy-duty four-wheel-drive vehicles, like the LandCruiser, which offer reliability and safety in regional and remote areas, especially on poorly maintained roads. Family First has had a lot of emails and phone calls from farmers and tourism operators to support this initiative. The Australian Tourism Export Council pointed out:
... that the tourism industry basically runs on the eight-seater diesel LandCruiser.
The council also said:
The cost impact is hitting a range of small businesses in regional Australia such as four-wheel-drive tour operators in rural Australia.
The majority of tourism businesses in Australia are small family operated concerns. One regional tour operator made a special trip to my office in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago to tell my staff how important his four-wheel-drive was to his business. He does outback tourism and he said that he needs a reliable car to make sure he does not break down in the middle of nowhere; it is essential as a tool for his work. Another regional tour operator wrote to me saying how important his four-wheel-drive is to his business. He said:
We have exceptional working relationships with all the property owners, in South Australia, who have 4WD tracks on their properties. They have taken the decision to encourage tourism based on the drought and continuing poor returns from what was once their core business, farming.
All of us also tend to travel at least twice the average 14000 kms that city folk do and most of that is on dirt roads and/or over quite long distances.
The Victorian Farmers Federation President, Simon Ramsay, supports the amendments as common sense. He said:
... our industry there is a dependence on transport and obviously given the localities and isolated areas not only within the state of Victoria, but nationwide, is dependent on large robust vehicles …
In Queensland AgForce Chief Executive, Brett de Hyer, said that four-wheel-drives are not a luxury item for farmers. He said:
Many farmers in Queensland (particularly in far western and northern areas) regularly travel hundreds of kilometres to their nearest town for essential supplies, health care and children’s schooling, and they need a vehicle that can handle those conditions—it is a necessity, not a luxury.
The South Australian Farmers Federation has also given its endorsement, with spokesman Peter White saying that he is happy with the changes ‘now that farmers are being looked after’. Last Wednesday I had an email from a farmer in Western Australia who said:
We are one of those farmers you were talking about. Farming in almost any area of the country is under siege. Right from the central midlands of Tasmania to here in the wheatbelt of WA markets, price squeeze, inputs, no infrastructure all take their toll. We do need a 4WD just for safe driving out here.
They are an essential item in our toolkit both on the farm to get about and to drive the vast distances we need to, to do any tasks at all.
Family First is not here to frustrate the government of the day, whether it is this one or the previous one. We are not elected to government but we are elected to vote and to look at issues on their merits. We have put forward constructive concerns to the government to take care of unintended consequences—I do not think they have ever set out to hit farmers and tourism operators—and that is what we have done. I urge all senators to back Family First’s amendments.
Question put:
That these bills be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,20,2
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2008-09-22,"—I rise tonight to talk briefly about an honour that was bestowed upon me between 12 and 19 July this year when I, as the patron for the Darling Range Sports College in Western Australia, which used to be the Forestfield Senior High School, had the honour and privilege of taking nine students through the East Kimberley on a trek. For those opposite who may not have had the pleasure of seeing the East Kimberley region, we ventured out of Kununurra at the top end of WA on a 40-minute flight south-west to a place called Kachana Station. I have to tell you that 16 years travelling as a truckie through that part of the world was pretty tough from inside an air-conditioned cab looking out of the windscreen but to actually get out there, walk the country, live on it and live off it, really did open my eyes.
As I said, I took nine students out there with the help and support of some very decent people—some of whom I would like to mention. One of them is Mr Greg Maynard, who is the director of the sports college. I would also like to mention his fellow assistant teacher Ms Amanda Fleming. I was also joined on that trip by some supporters—namely, Mr George Takla and his son Medhat. Mr and Mrs Takla are in the gallery today and I welcome them here to Canberra. It is great to see them. George was absolutely fantastic in more ways than one in supporting us.
But, as we travelled through, there is one person I really must congratulate and thank. He is a great friend of mine, one Mr John Davis, affectionately known as JD. JD and I have been mates for a long, long time; we came through the trucking industry together. It all started when JD said to me that his granddaughter goes to a state school and suggested that we should visit and have a look at this state school because it is something out of the ordinary. I did that, and I must say that it is a special school.
But I have more to say on the trek. What happened was that we were taken by two Cessna Caravans to Kachana Station—as I said, about 40 minutes south-west of Kununurra—and were dumped on a remote airstrip. I have to tell you that it looked lovely from the air. Once we hit the ground, we were at the Chamberlain River, if I remember rightly, where we had a very enjoyable lunch while we put our 18-kilogram backpacks on. I think that was the last enjoyable lunch till the Saturday seven or eight days later.
The students learnt orienteering and how to survive out there on their own. They learnt leadership skills. We had a group that took us out there called Adventure Out. Adventure Out had some very fine scouts, assistants or whatever they are called—I am sorry; I do not know the proper word. They told us that this was the last bastion. They said, ‘It’s pretty easy.’ They said, ‘If you want to have a good trek and enjoy some hardness and hardship, do Kokoda; if you want to get the living daylights flogged out of you for the next seven days and really question your place in this world, then you do the Kimberley.’ They also told us that there would be no porters and that we would be carrying everything ourselves. As I said, 18-kilogram backpacks are not bad for the first hour, but it is different when you are traipsing across some of the harshest country in this fine continent of ours. With just about every step we took we did not know what was under our feet. I have never walked on so many rocks in my life, let alone through spinifex and through creeks, and it was absolutely amazing.
All our water was collected as we walked. We did not have Powerade, Coca-Cola or choc milk at every turn. Everything was collected as we went. The food we ate was dehydrated. I must say, Mr President—you know me well enough—that I am proud to say that I lost four kilograms that week; that is how harsh it was. So I can recommend it to a lot of senators if they really want a challenge. Join me next year; put your hand in your pocket, fund one of the kids whom we are taking and join us. It is there for the taking.
To talk a little bit about how the kids conducted themselves, these students—make no mistake—earned their right. It was not decided by names drawn out of a hat. These students—these young Australians, 17-year-olds—actually had to apply to do the trek. I tell you what: what a fantastic bunch! We had three boys and six girls. It is just amazing how they left us oldies—I do not think my good friend George up there would mind my calling us oldies—for dead. I tell you what: they were an inspiration to us; they really were. They carried us through—some of the older ones, who found each day a little bit harder.

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—I look at you, Senator Heffernan, and I will drop the ‘oldie’ comment. As I said, these students took a lot out of that. There were seven days of sleeping rough. I say ‘sleeping rough’, because what we actually slept on—and I am not kidding you—was about three centimetres of foam on a black groundsheet. I said to my daughter, who accompanied us, at the time, ‘Look, babe, I cannot wait till we get home; I’m going to put a rock garden in the front because you and I will have nowhere to sleep when we get home.’ It is absolutely amazing what the human body can do. There were not the comforts of the fridge, TV or a nice hot shower every night, but where you pulled up was where you slept, and I tell you that you slept really well until four o’clock in the morning, when it was time to get up, pack your tent up, get your gear together, have your powdered milk and your Nutri-Grain and go off for another 12 or 13 hours of trekking.
As the trekking guides—that was the word I was looking for: the guides—had never done that trek before, they had warned us that there could be some interesting species of animal on the way. I have to tell you quite simply that there was no shortage of crocodiles. So as not to put the living fear up the children’s parents if they happen to read the Hansard, let me tell you that they were freshwater crocodiles, but we were told that there was a fishing hole where the guides had heard that we could not go into the water. It might only have been a three-foot freshie, but it soon put a shiver up your spine and we learnt to go without a tub that night if we had not bathed in the day.
Also, we were confronted by rogue bulls at Kachana Station. For 16 years, proudly running up and down that highway, I had never heard of Kachana because there is not a road into Kachana Station. You can imagine that, if you want to go into Kachana, you go in and come out by aeroplane. There is no livestock being traded; they are rogue bulls. Even at this fine hour of night, I look across the chamber and, as soon as I mention a rogue bull, I have Senator Heffernan looking at me! I have to tell you, Mr President, that I would rather confront him at 10 o’clock in the chamber than what we had to confront out there! But we were not alone. The kids were absolutely brilliant; they were fantastic. I commend the school and the students.
So that I do not run out of time—and I could talk about it all night—in the short time I have left I would like to thank, firstly, the students: Taryn Friend, Denise Shepley, Teagan Trainor, Nadia Murcha, Lyndal Evans, Joshua Martens, Jordan Hayden, Shaun Hawkes and Jonna Davis. What a fine, outstanding bunch of young Australians! I am sure they did their parents proud. Their parents should be proud of how they conducted themselves, getting us oldies through there as well.
But it could not have happened without the financial and professional support of some fine Western Australian businesspeople, who I would like to take this opportunity to name and thank. I cannot thank them enough. Once again, I thank Messrs George and Medhat Takla. Thanks, mates. I tell you what: you are coming back next year! While I am at it, my good mate JD said that we were not going and that no-one was going again, but he found that George was one year older than him, so JD thought to himself, ‘I’ve got to beat George!’ And George has just told me tonight that JD is not going to beat him because George is going to be back on the trek next year. I would like to thank Mr Ian King and Mr Derek Nathan from the Transport Forum WA, two very fine gentlemen in the transport industry—and that is coming from me; I do have friends on the other side in the transport industry. I would like to thank Mr Malcolm Bradshaw and Mr Brad Geatches from the Westralia Airports Corporation; and Mr Jack Diamond and Mr Paul Kelly from Members Equity—fantastic help, guys; thank you. I thank another good friend of mine on the other side of the transport fence, Mr Marc Cardaci from CFC Holdings; Mr Mario Strazzerri of WA Freight Group; Mr Nick D’Adamo—you see, they all have the similar names to mine; we have a lot of things in common, and they are fine transport people—from Keys Bros Removals; Frank Ferrari from Subiaco Print; and Hugh Davin from Skywest.
To those businesses and individuals, thank you very much. I will come back knocking on your door next year, because I am told that the nine students who did this trek this year have all put in to come back next year. Sadly, they will not be at the school, and there will no room for them, but I believe they have gone back to their school and done nothing but talk about that fantastic adventure that they had through the Kimberley. As I said, everyone talks about Kokoda, and Kokoda is very close to our hearts and always should be—it is a very proud part of our history—but there is also a fantastic part of the world within our own shores, and for other reasons.
I would encourage any Australian to go. I am not looking at Senator McEwen, but I am throwing the message over to my good friend Senator McEwen, who is a well-known trekker and walker: come over, mate; we will take you up there and show you what it is like in the Top End. Once again, to all those supporters, to those students, to the school, I wish them all the very best. I look forward to conducting the same trek next year. This year I am in the gym and I am getting ready.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Darling Range Sports College</title>,Adjournment,21,1
