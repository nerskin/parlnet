"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-25,"— A couple of days ago Senator Harradine asked me about air services to Tasmania, and he asked me particularly to talk about Hobart and Devonport later on. I inform Senator Harradine that the government has announced today that it will provide the administrator of Kendell with a $3.5 million loan to help the airline fly again. The loan will enable Kendell to resume services in South Australia and some flights between Melbourne and Tasmania. The airline will operate after 27 September from Melbourne to Burnie and Devonport and King Island. The loan that we are giving will be drawn from the rapid route recovery scheme, which Mr Anderson announced last week. That scheme is helping airlines restart services on routes that were served only by Ansett or its subsidiaries. 
I would inform Senator Harradine as well that since Ansett's collapse Qantas has been operating additional services between Hobart and Melbourne and will continue to operate an extra flight every day of this week. It has been deploying aircraft from the former Impulse fleet to operate in this supplementary capacity. While loads on the Hobart-Melbourne leg were light last week due, no doubt, to the school holidays coming to an end, bookings and loadings on all other sectors last week and this week have been heavy. In relation to Devonport, I am advised that Qantas continues to operate up to three flights per day from Melbourne to Devonport through its subsidiary, Southern Australian Airlines.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ansett Australia</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-25,"—Pursuant to standing order 74(5)(a), I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services for an explanation as to why answers have not been provided to questions on notice Nos 3682 through to 3689. The questions were lodged on 3 July this year and have remained unanswered for 83 days, well outside the period provided by the standing orders.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-25,"—I thank Senator O'Brien for giving me notice that he was going to ask that question. The questions were Nos 3682 to 3689. I am advised that Senator O'Brien was seeking specific details on when the proposal was first raised and what contact was made with the various organisations about the proposal dealing with the Moree bypass. I am advised by the department that, in order to respond to several of the issues raised in the questions on notice, it was necessary to obtain advice from the Roads and Traffic Authority part of the New South Wales government bureaucracy. This material has taken some time to gather and as recently as last Friday, 21 September 2001, information requested was received by my department from the Roads and Traffic Authority. Some of the questions also relate to material which dates back a number of years. Specific files had to be obtained from archives and information relevant to the questions assembled and thoroughly checked. I am told that a response is being prepared and will be provided as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Questions Nos 3682-3689</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister's explanation.
There are in fact a large number of questions to Mr Anderson that remain unanswered, and I will pursue those answers at a later time. I have sought an explanation as to why answers have not been forthcoming to these questions because the questions go to an important matter, and that is the integrity of the government's road funding programs as administered by Mr Anderson. It is important that the allocation of funding for roads—whether that funding be part of the national highway, roads of national importance or the black spots programs—is based on the merit of the project. Funding should not be allocated to meet the political need of the minister or one of his colleagues.
I put these questions on notice because it has been suggested to me that in relation to the possible construction of a bypass around Moree a political imperative might have outweighed the merit of the project. Perhaps the minister might be able to throw some light on exactly what happened in relation to the proposed Moree bypass. Firstly, when was the proposal for a bypass around Moree first brought to Mr Anderson's attention or to the attention of his staff? Who raised the Moree bypass proposal with the minister or his staff and how was the proposal first raised? When the proposal for a Moree bypass was first raised with the Department of Transport and Regional Services, who raised the proposal, and how was it first raised with the department? I understand that Mr Anderson or his staff contacted the Moree Plains Council about the proposed Moree bypass. If that is correct, when was that contact made and who initiated the contact? I have also been advised that Mr Anderson or his staff contacted the Moree Chamber of Commerce about the proposed Moree bypass. If that is also correct, when was that contact made and who initiated the contact?
Madam Deputy President, as you are aware, I have also taken a great deal of interest in the selection process for the Albury bypass, and I continue to take a close interest in the selection process currently under way for a bypass around the township of Murrumbateman. I now have a very keen interest in the route selection process for a possible bypass around Moree. I want to know about the assessment process, particularly how it has been undertaken to date, of the route selection for the proposed Moree bypass, and what role the Department of Transport and Regional Services has played, or will play, in this route selection process. It has certainly played a very active, if informal, role in the Murrumbateman bypass selection process. I am interested to get advice from Mr Anderson as to his role or that of his staff in the Moree route selection process. In the case of the Murrumbateman bypass, the former minister Mr Sharp had a very active interest so I am seeking advice from Mr Anderson as to who initiated the route selection process and what the cost has been to date. 
I want to know what public consultative process has been followed in relation to the above route selection process, who is managing that process and the outcome of it. In particular, I am interested to know how many routes are currently under consideration. The route selection process for both Albury and Murrumbateman has been nothing short of a disaster. In relation to Albury, the process was clearly flawed from the beginning and wasted millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, and Mr Anderson managed to stand by and watch all that happen. It is a tragedy that the minister applied the same approach to the collapse of Ansett Australia, but the cost of this latest Anderson disaster will not be a few million dollars of taxpayers' money but around 1½ per cent of gross domestic product. Not only is Mr Anderson blocking access to important information relating to Moree—a key rural centre in his electorate—he has blocked access to important information relating to a grant made under the black spots program for a project on the Delegate to Delegate River Road in New South Wales. In fact he refused to comply with the terms of a return to order for the production of documents relating to the integrity of the assessment for the funding of this project.
As with the Moree bypass, the issue at hand is the very integrity of the government's federal roads program. Organisations seeking funding through the black spots program are required to meet the terms of the eligibility criteria detailed on the Department of Transport and Regional Services web site. As you would expect, those criteria go directly to the issue of road safety and how safety can be enhanced, or safety hazards removed, through this capital works program. It is essential that people who seek funds through the black spots program can be confident that their application will be properly assessed against the criteria. It is essential that the projects meet these criteria and that priority is given to funding the worst trouble spots. The black spots program should be a program with very little flexibility and even less ministerial direction and discretion. It should not be a pot of money to meet the short-term political needs of the transport minister or his office; it should be a pot of money to address the high risk points in the national road system, and it should be aimed at saving lives.
The reason I am still seeking access to that material is that I am concerned that in relation to this black spots project—project N00752—very few, if any, of the criteria were met. I have also placed a number of questions on notice in relation to black spots, selection criteria and the extent to which this project met those criteria. Those questions are numbered 3672 through to 3681. I now have the answers to those questions, and they are very enlightening indeed. As I told the Senate, I have been advised that the recommendation that went to the then minister, Mr Vaile, was that this application for funding not be approved. I have been advised that the application progressed only because the department was pressured by the then minister's land transport adviser. 
I have been advised that Mr Vaile ignored that departmental advice and approved the project despite the fact that it did not qualify for funding—and I want go to those answers. I asked when it was that Minister Vaile or his department was first contacted about possible funding for this black spots project which happened to be in the very marginal seat of Eden-Monaro. I am told that the department was first contacted on the 23 July 1997, and that that first contact was by—you guessed it—the former minister's land transport adviser. I am told that a formal application for funding for the projects—
—I raise a point of order, Madam Deputy President. This is all very interesting and obviously grounds for a good debate at some time, but Senator O'Brien is taking note of my reasons on why answers to questions dealing with the Moree bypass have not been tabled within time. I gave the explanation as to why those answers were not tabled on time and I indicated that an answer would be coming. Senator O'Brien, quite rightly, has moved that the Senate take note of my answer. One might then think, reasonably, that his comments in the debate should address my answer to the questions relating to the Moree bypass.  
Senator O'Brien is now talking, and has been for some time—I did not want to interrupt him; I thought he was getting to a conclusion—about a range of road projects that have nothing to do with the Moree bypass. He is talking about Roads to Recovery, black spots and a whole range of issues hundreds of kilometres from Moree. As I say, it is a good issue on which to have a debate at some time, but surely we have some rules in the Senate that the debate must be relevant to the motion moved.
—Madam Deputy President, on the point of order: this debate is about the non-answering of questions which relate to the government's road funding programs. There have been a number of occasions when we have been advised by Minister Macdonald—and I have not been critical of him in the past on this count—that answers would be forthcoming, as he did today, only to find that up to two months later no such answers have been given. This is in all probability the last week that this Senate will have the opportunity to receive the answers before the election. For him to say, `We are having some difficulty getting some material and we might give you the answers sometime in the future,' is in fact almost a guarantee that we are not going to get the answers. In relation to that, I think I am entitled in this debate to raise other occasions when this minister, or the minister that this minister represents, has chosen to use various devices to avoid giving answers to questions. In that context, what has occurred with respect to another example of just such behaviour by the minister is relevant to this debate.
—There is no point of order, Senator Macdonald.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. As I was saying, that formal application was in fact lodged by Mr Vaile's land transport adviser in Mr Vaile's office. The application came with a note—and I will quote it again—that said:
Dear Lochie—
that is the name of the land transport adviser—
Could you please fill in the details for items 10, 11, 12 and 13 on our behalf. We do not have a copy of the quote from the local road contractor that we left with you.
I also asked in my questions for details of the composition of the New South Wales black spots consultative panel that would have considered this application. I asked the minister whether that panel had formally endorsed the application. I have now been told that the panel did not formally endorse the application. The reason given for that was as follows:
... the nomination was received after the panel meeting was conducted.
Should we conclude from this answer that this panel met only once or should we conclude from this answer that the application for funding did not fit the criteria, would not have been accepted by the panel for that reason and was processed through a different assessment regime—the then minister's land transport adviser?
—Madam President, I would have appreciated some reasons for your last ruling against my point of order, but can I raise a different point of order. I know that we have got a lot of important things to discuss in the Senate over the next few days, but Senator O'Brien has quite clearly read every single word that he has spoken in this debate. I draw your attention to standing order 187, which deals with that issue.
—Do your colleagues know that you are doing this?
—Order, Senator McKiernan!
—Don't worry about it, Senator McKiernan; I'm raising this particular standing order at this particular time.
—Madam President, on the point of order: I believe that I am entitled to observe my notes as I speak, and that is what I am doing.
—There is no point of order, Senator Macdonald. Senator O'Brien is entitled to read from his copious notes and to quote directly. 
—In those questions I asked the minister whether these submissions for funding included:
... a commitment to provide funding, labour or materials from other government or community and/or industry sources.
The reason I asked that question is that a contribution in the form of money is a key selection criterion under this program. It does not seem unreasonable to me to ask just how much support for a particular project there is and what form that support might take. The answer to that question, unfortunately, was no—that is, there was no financial or material backing for the application. So I asked the minister whether any conditions were imposed on this black spot funding approval and who imposed those conditions. The answer was that, yes, conditions were imposed and that they were in fact imposed by—yes, you guessed it—the minister's land transport adviser; not the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services and not even the then minister but the land transport adviser himself.
The first condition was that the contract be let by way of reverse tender. This is a vital condition if there is no actual black spot identified in the application but just a 12-kilometre stretch of road. The second condition was that tenders be advertised in the local newspapers, and that is also a very important condition if you want to gain the maximum political advantage from this sort of exercise. The final condition was that no money be paid out unless it was approved by the minister's office—and, yes, that is again by the minister's land transport adviser. That seems to me a highly irregular approach to financial control in relation to a program funded by the Commonwealth and administered by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority.
I want to go back to the black spot criteria and how this project measured up. According to the guidelines proposed, projects must be able to demonstrate a benefit cost ratio of at least two. But in relation to this project the minister advised me that, while there would have been a benefit cost ratio calculated by the RTA, he was unable to say what it was and was unable to get that advice from the New South Wales authority. That sounds similar to the advice that the minister told us he had from Minister Anderson about the matter I raised today. How could the transport department assess this submission and how could the minister approve this application without knowing the benefit cost ratio?
A second key black spot criterion relates to casualty rates on the section of road. The minimum eligibility criterion is an average of 0.2 casualty crashes per kilometre per annum over five years. The five-year average for this section of road was 0.137. If that test is not met, a project will be considered if it is a top-10 crash road in the state. But the minister advised that there was no comparison made in relation to this section of road with others in the region and therefore, I assume, with others in the state.
According to the guidelines for the program, up to 20 per cent of funds is available for sites that do not meet the above criteria but have been recommended on the basis of an official road safety audit report. There was no such audit report done on this project. So, Madam Deputy President, it is important that not only the terms of the return to order in relation to the Delegate to Delegate River Road black spots are met but also the minister answer the series of questions asked in relation to the Moree Bypass so that we can determine whether or not the same political fix has been put in on this project as was put in on the Delegate to Delegate River Road.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Questions Nos 3682-3689</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-25,"—I have to say that it is unlike Senator O'Brien to use a series of innuendos and suggestions to try to make a political point against a minister in the government. Some outrageous suggestions were made, Madam Deputy President, which I could have taken a point of order on. I had hoped that perhaps you might have of your own accord stopped Senator O'Brien, but that was not to be. He has made allegations and raised innuendos without one skerrick of evidence in support of them.
—Not a scintilla—thank you, Senator Chapman—of support for those particular allegations. The Senate is again being used in the weeks before an election by Senator O'Brien to try to make a very cheap political point when the minister is not here to answer, a point which I happen to know is completely without foundation. Senator O'Brien alleges, quite wrongly, that Mr Anderson is blocking access to information—an absolutely outrageous suggestion. Senator O'Brien indicated that he has got the information for the last series of questions that he raised.
Senator O'Brien spoke at length about black spots. He mentioned that the Federal Road Safety Black Spot Program is a very good program, and I certainly agree. If Senator O'Brien agrees with that, and I think he does, I would have preferred him to have spent some of his time in his speech explaining why the Australian Labor Party actually cancelled that program when it was in government. It was a good program and the Labor Party cancelled it. Perhaps the Senate and those people who might be listening to this debate would have been better served had Senator O'Brien explained why the Labor Party cancelled—got rid of—the black spots program.
Fortunately, when the Howard government was elected in 1996 the black spots program was reintroduced. It has been a great program. It has saved a lot of lives. It has been universally supported around the countryside and around Australia generally. Senator O'Brien is pinpricking and nitpicking about a particular incident. I am not aware of it, and I do not think anyone else is. Senator O'Brien, go and ask the residents in the area that you are talking about—was it at Tumut or Cooma?—whether or not this was a good program. I am sure you would get an overwhelming yes vote from those people.
It would be interesting to ask the Labor Party candidate in that area—I think it was in the electorate of Eden-Monaro—whether he supports the black spot road funding there. We can tell the Labor Party candidate and certainly all of the people there that Senator O'Brien does not support it, and I assume that means that the federal parliamentary Labor Party do not support it. But it would be interesting to ask the candidate whether he supports it. I might suggest that we will find out—I will look at the Hansard—where this particular black spot is and arrange for the Labor candidate to be asked the questions: `Do you believe in black spots? Do you like this program? `Is it saving lives?' That should be an interesting exercise.
Madam Deputy President, back to the debate in hand: you have ruled that the debate can be about anything. I do not agree with that, so I will confine my final remarks to the issue before us—that is, the reason we have been unable to answer these questions. For those that might be interested—and I suspect there are not too many—to get this information required a great deal of research. We had to go back a number of years and get files out of archives. We also had to get some assistance from the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority.
Madam Deputy President, as a New South Wales senator, you will know that the Roads and Traffic Authority is an authority of the New South Wales government. You would also be aware that the New South Wales government currently is controlled by the Australian Labor Party—that is, one of Senator O'Brien's colleagues in the state sphere. I am informed that one of the reasons we have not been able to answer questions is that the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority have taken some time to gather material. Even last Friday—just a few days ago—we were still getting material from the Roads and Traffic Authority. So, as I have indicated, we will work on that. A response is being prepared.
Madam Deputy President, you are aware that the Department of Transport and Regional Services is a very efficient department, well run and organised. But it has so many questions of the sort—without being too personal, Senator O'Brien—
—You don't like questions, do you? You don't like information.
—They are written by a very good adviser to Senator O'Brien but they are voluminous, they go on forever—like Senator O'Brien's speech: written by a very good adviser but goes on forever. All of these questions go nowhere and mean nothing. For all of the work the department goes through to give the answers, I would almost love it if you got here in this chamber, Senator Forshaw, and used that information — 
—Address the chair, please, Senator Macdonald.
—to bring down the government! At least you would think that it was a worthwhile exercise of the whole process. We get these enormous numbers of questions, and my department—
—Order! Senator Forshaw, would you please cease your interjections. Senator Macdonald, address the chair, thank you.
—The department is a very efficient one, but under the weight of the questions that are put on notice by Senator O'Brien it might take longer than other departments to get these things answered. I might also mention, while I am on the subject, that, as Senator O'Brien would well know, the whole department, particularly the transport section of the department, has been working diligently seven days a week—I would hazard a guess, and I think I would not be proved wrong, that it has been working almost 20 hours a day, seven days a week—in the last two or three weeks on the issue that is of major importance to the people of Australia, and that is the collapse of Ansett Australia. 
We have been trying to get people back to their places of origin. We have been trying to get passengers in the air. We have been trying to ensure that country services are operating. They are certainly not operating to the extent that we would want, but in a short period of time the department, at Mr Anderson's direction, has been doing a fabulous job in conjunction with the administrator. Mr Anderson is a very efficient and capable minister, and one who has really taken on transport issues with an enthusiasm and energy that has not always been seen in that area. He is doing a great job. The response to Senator O'Brien's questions is in the course of preparation. As soon as possible, we will get it to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Questions Nos 3682-3689</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to a question without notice asked by Senator O'Brien today relating to the goods and services tax paid on tickets for flights on Ansett Airlines.
Isn't it interesting that this government is trying to portray itself as the champion of the victims of Ansett when in fact all it is doing, as has been proven by the Assistant Treasurer in his answer today, is finding a way that it can get some sort of financial advantage out of what has taken place. There is no other conclusion that could be drawn from the answers today but that there are people who have paid GST on airline tickets which are worthless because of the insolvency of Ansett and that the government is going to keep that money. That is the import of the comments of the Treasurer and that is the import of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer in question time today.
In question time, I put to the Assistant Treasurer a quote from an AAP wire story as at 10.35 this morning, quoting Mr Costello on the issue about whether people were going to get back their ticket price money, including GST. Mr Costello said:
What if you are an unsecured creditor in a winding-up? Will you get the full face value of the ticket? That is another question, an insolvency question.
But who are the beneficiaries in that circumstance? Has the government got the GST for many prepaid tickets? The answer is yes. Will businesses and banks that have claimed the money, passed it on and had it passed on to the government be able to pay it back? The answer is no, unless the government is going to be forthcoming and volunteer to pay it back. Did we hear that being volunteered by the minister, Senator Kemp, today? No. And what about the example that I put to him today—an example he had no comment on, significantly. That concerned Mr Kevin Archer from Tasmania, whose family paid $2,535 for now useless tickets. I remind the Senate that, if you had tickets for which you had not commenced travel, Ansett was not providing that travel; it was only getting people home. These were truly worthless tickets and they included some $230-plus in GST. Is the government proposing to pay that back? The answer, quite clearly, from the remarks of the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer, is no. 
Whilst they wring their hands about the shocking impact on the community of this collapse of Ansett, in which they played a part, the government are content to take an advantage out of the GST payments which have been made on the now worthless tickets. That is not surprising. This government have been saying how terrible this is, but they are prepared to do almost nothing to get Ansett back in the air. They have provided some financial assistance in the form of loans for some regional carriers, because even their position was looking completely untenable to regional Australia. I want to note the comments of Senator Ian Macdonald today when he was answering a question by Senator Harradine about Kendell—that only part of the Kendell operation is going to be resumed and that is the regional operation in South Australia and into the regional ports of Burnie and Devonport. I was not sure if that was also going to include King Island.
—It is King Island.
—I am told it included King Island. But it is not going into Launceston or Hobart. There are very significant losses of transport opportunities into those places. There is no such assistance there. Obviously the Canadair jets are not going to resume into those ports, and the government are going to do nothing about it. We now see the situation where airports are financially at risk because of this matter. The tourism industry is at financial risk because of this matter. The Labor Party has come up with a proposal to try to get Ansett back flying. The government are content to see the clock run out and the aircraft resumed. There is no possibility of Ansett getting up and going again, because apparently the government are content to sit there with their arms folded, say it is all terrible but watching it all happen.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Ansett Tickets</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2001-09-25,"—The remarks we have heard today from Senator O'Brien are just another variation on the Labor Party's continual theme of attacking the government's tax reform, attacking in particular the introduction of the goods and services tax. The reality is that the Labor Party are going to do nothing about this in relation to the abolition of this tax. They have made that very clear. They attack the new tax system day in, day out in this chamber and elsewhere and yet they do not have the fortitude to put down a policy whereby they say they will abolish it. If they really thought that the GST, either in regard to this particular issue that they are addressing today or in general terms, was as damaging to Australian business and the Australian economy as they falsely claim it is, that is the commitment they would make: a specific policy commitment that they are going to abolish the goods and services tax.
But of course they will not do that, because they know the alternative to the present reformed tax system, which this government showed the leadership and intestinal fortitude to introduce, is to go back to the old, outdated, outworn system that this country suffered for 60 or 70 years—a system that was based on the structure of the Australian economy and the structure of people's consumption patterns of the 1930s, a tax system that was quite inappropriate for the 21st century. 
They know that if they are going to abolish the goods and services tax they are going to have to increase income tax to the more punitive levels that applied under their previous government and abolish those $12 billion of income tax cut benefits that this government has given to Australians. They know they are going to have to re-establish the wholesale sales tax as the central plank of an indirect tax structure. The wholesale sales tax again is an inefficient, outdated tax that taxes only the consumption of goods and completely ignores the consumption of services, and therefore not only results in a shortfall in revenue over the longer term, as was demonstrated in the debate leading up to the tax reform process, but is a most unfair tax because it taxes only one segment—and indeed a proportionally declining segment—of consumption. It taxes only goods.  
As I said in a similar debate a few days ago, that is particularly regressive, detrimental and unfair to my state of South Australia, which is heavily dependent on manufacturing industry, and car manufacturing in particular. It is the car industry perhaps above all that suffered most under the old, outdated indirect tax system where the wholesale sales tax applied, because of the rate at which that tax applied to motor vehicles. We need only to look at what has happened to the car industry since the introduction of the new tax system to see the benefits of the new structure that this government has had the courage to introduce. The goods and services tax of course applies at a lower level to motor vehicles and to many manufactured goods than did the wholesale sales tax to those same goods, and that has resulted in a dramatic increase in people's expenditure on those goods, a dramatic increase in consumption of those goods, with the effective result that the car industry in particular is enjoying boom times. 
That is not the only industry that is enjoying boom times as a result not only of the fact that this government had the courage to introduce a completely new tax system but also of our general sound management of the Australian economy. The Australian economy is performing better than any other economy in the developed world and maintains, in the face of falling rates of growth in other parts of the world, a very strong rate of economic growth. As I said, that is as a result of the sound management of this government in general, but another important factor in that has been the courage we have had to introduce tax reform. As I said, the present opposition rails against the goods and services tax but offers no alternative because it knows that that tax reform was essential. It knows that there is no alternative to the changes that we have made.
We have heard the opposition talk about roll-back, or roll backwards, as their approach to tax reform and to the indirect tax system but we really do not know what that means. We have had no details of their supposed roll-back spelt out. Does it mean that they are going to remove the tax from certain items to which it currently applies or does it mean they are going to reduce the rate of tax on all items across the board? Whatever it means, it certainly is going to be detrimental to small business in particular, because it will increase the complexity of compliance if you have more items exempt from the tax.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-09-25,"—I do not think today is necessarily the best day for members of the government to come into the Senate and eulogise the goods and services tax, since it is the very day that we have seen massive redundancies in Coles Myer and an indication that Daimaru is about to withdraw from Australia. As was indicated today in question time, both of these corporate entities are citing the GST as a factor in the downfall. 
One of the people we are talking about here in relation to Coles Myer is none other than Mr Stan Wallis, who was a key supporter of and a key contributor to the goods and services tax. You can always tell when the current government is up in the polls, because they start going back and eulogising and pushing policies that those of us who live in rural and regional Australia know are not popular. I notice that Senator Alston—for the first time in a very long time—the other day got a coalition dorothy dixer on the sale of Telstra and how terrific that was. You and I both know that the goods and services tax is not popular in rural and regional Australia, that people in rural and regional Australia have suffered unnecessarily and that they do not want the remainder of Telstra sold. I find it quite extraordinary that on this sad day when we have major redundancies being faced in Coles Myer, and an indication that Daimaru is about to pull out of this country, citing the GST as one of the critical factors, members of the coalition come in here in tell us what a terrific thing it is and how brave they were for introducing it. I can tell you that out there where we are in rural and regional Australia they are not very happy about it at all. 
Today is also the day that in the House of Representatives Mr Anderson has confirmed that the deal with Qantas and the administrator on wet leasing Ansett planes has fallen through. He confirmed that today in question time. I understand that a formal announcement will be made at 4 o'clock today. This is one day after the Prime Minister's exhortation for the administrator of Qantas to get on with it, get these planes wet leased and get the show on the road. Twenty-four hours later, negotiations have fallen through. 
Is this as much as the government can do—just say to the administrator, `Hurry up'? Twenty-four hours later, that has gone. I also noticed that when the Labor Party made a suggestion that $150 to $200 million be put up, either to be used as an equity injection or as a loan in relation to Ansett, it was completely dismissed by the government. This is the same government that has just given $3 million to Hazelton, which I applaud, in relation to getting the planes up and running there. This is the same minister who characterised Ansett over the weekend as a `carcass'. I think that is an absolute insult to every single person who works, or worked, for Ansett, every single person who is seeking their due entitlements and also those in rural and regional Australia who cannot get planes. They have not got time to wait for this government to get on the road and do something in relation to it.
Let us look at our counterparts overseas. The President of the United States, George W. Bush, a Republican—the Republicans are not noted for their views on government intervention or large government; they are the small government party—has allocated $20 billion to American airlines in order to assist them with the crisis they are going through, yet Labor's suggestion of $150 million to $200 million based on a projected sale of KSA is dismissed as bizarre by the government. I ask the government to look at what its fraternal colleagues in the United States are doing in the face of what is a major crisis. They are acting; this government is doing nothing here.
When Minister Anderson was confronted with this in question time today his response was: `We are trying really hard. We are attempting to get things back on the rails.' But the reality is that the government are doing nothing. Rural and regional Australia is desperate for action to be taken. At the same time, we have major indications from the tourism industry, particularly in Queensland, that things are going very badly and we have requests for money. This is a government that can find $20 billion to backflip in the last six months on everything it did in the last three years, but it cannot find $150 million to $250 million to try to get this crisis over and done with. We have the Minister for Transport and Regional Services simply washing his hands of this and regarding Ansett as a carcass—which is an insult to every Australian, particularly the people who work for Ansett and those who live in rural and regional Australia. For goodness sake, it is only $150 million to $200 million. Why don't you try to do something.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2001-09-25,"—This is the strangest taking note of answers that I have ever experienced in the time that I have been in the Senate. We have had talk about the GST on tickets not being refunded.
—That, I would remind you, Senator Eggleston, was what the answer to the question was about. 
—Indeed. We have gone from that to Ansett and regional Australia, support for Ansett, Coles Myer, the GST, the sale of Telstra and regional areas—and on and on it has gone. It is all over the place. It is very strange indeed. It is a bit like ALP policy—a grab bag, like a dog's breakfast, of all sorts of little issues with no overall plan or consistency. It is just like things scattered on a board. There is nothing clean, simple and straightforward about it. I think this is the lesson to draw from what has been said in the Senate this afternoon: the ALP does not have a clear view about what should be done to manage the issues that face Australia today.
Senator Mackay got up and said, `Why doesn't the government put up $200 million and save Ansett?' That is $200 million for an airline that is something like $3 billion in debt. Who is going to meet the debt, Senator Mackay? Who is going to meet the cost of re-equipping an airline which was so utterly and badly managed? It had no less than nine different kinds of aircraft. Sir Peter Abeles thought the airline was a toy to play with and he would get a few different kinds of aircraft, forgetting about the cost of maintenance and running an airline with such a wide number of different aircraft in its fleet. Paying $200 million is a drop in the bucket and it will not do anything to get Ansett back in the air. Ansett has a lot of problems. One of them, sad to say, is that it was grossly overstaffed. Qantas has a lot fewer staff, and its costs per air mile flown are about 30 per cent lower. That tells a story in itself. Ansett failed because of mismanagement. It failed not just because Air New Zealand took it over and sucked it dry and transferred all the parts and equipment in recent weeks to New Zealand but because the airline itself was mismanaged. A lot of that probably comes back to union demands.  
I agree that the failure of Ansett is a national tragedy, but it is quite wrong of Senator Mackay to imply that this government is not concerned about it and, in particular, that this government has not sought to restore services to the regions. In New South Wales, Hazelton are back in the air and from my point of view most importantly we have Skywest back in the air. The interesting thing is that Skywest only needed a guarantee of about $3.5 million to get it back into the air. The Skywest management group running this airline approached the Western Australian ALP government run by Dr Gallop and that government declined to provide the money to get Skywest back in the air. But the federal government provided the guarantee. The federal government, Mr John Anderson and Mr Howard have been responsible for restoring full Skywest services to the eastern goldfields and the south of Western Australia. So you cannot say with any kind of credibility that this government is not seeking to overcome the deficits in the regions caused by the closure of Ansett. On the broader picture, the government is doing its best to find a solution. I believe there are no fewer than five bidders, including airlines like Lufthansa and Singapore, as well as a union group and other groups interested in buying and seeking to restore Ansett.
The general issue of this debate is the GST. The GST has been a great success. It is one of the greatest tax reforms this country has ever seen. Australia, almost alone among the OECD countries, did not have an indirect tax system. We needed to transfer from a direct to an indirect tax system, and John Howard, to his great credit, was brave enough to do it. He introduced a new tax system which brought great benefit to Australia.
—He showed some leadership; that is what he did.
—He showed leadership. That is what the ALP leader, Mr Beazley, certainly does not show. He moves backwards and forwards, flip-flops, in a very uncoordinated way.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-09-25,"—During question time, as I am sure persons out there who were listening will recall, rather than answer the questions that he was asked—particularly the question from Senator O'Brien on the GST—Senator Kemp invited a debate on the government's tax system. What we have happening in the chamber right at the moment is a debate on the impact of the GST, specifically its impact on those persons who paid for tickets with Ansett and who now find not only that they will not get a refund on their ticket but also they will not even get the GST back. We also have the opportunity—as Senator Eggleston and Senator Chapman have taken—to range widely on GST issues. Yet, unfortunately, Minister Kemp is not in the chamber at the moment. He is the person on the government side who continues to want to debate the GST in the chamber but, when the opportunities arise, he runs away. He has done it today; he did it yesterday; and he does it every other day. 
Senator Kemp knows that, despite this government's protestations about how great the GST has been for the economy, the opposite is the truth. We are seeing evidence of that day after day. As has been pointed out, Stan Wallis, head of Coles-Myer—Australia's leading company—has announced that there will be massive redundancies in that company. He has put the blame on the GST, saying that it has been a major factor in the turnaround of the company's business. Coles-Myer is a leading company in this country. It is the largest single employer of people in this country. It is an institution in the history of Australian retailing.  
Similarly, Ansett was the great, privately owned Australian airline—the company that, for years and years and years, prime ministers such as Bob Menzies and Harold Holt and John Gorton and Malcolm Fraser and now John Howard always held up as the shining light of private enterprise in this country. Where is Ansett today? It doesn't exist. Overnight, 17,000 people and their families were put on the economic scrap heap in this country. I cannot recall a financial collapse of that magnitude. And I do not think any other Australian can, unless they can go back to the years of the Depression. One of the two major airline companies in this country has overnight stopped flying and will most likely never fly again—certainly if this government's inaction continues. Thousands and thousands of jobs have been lost and families have been affected. Businesses right across the country are wondering whether or not they are going to survive. One hundred and five towns and cities in rural and regional Australia can no longer rely upon a domestic air service because Ansett or its subsidiary has folded. Yet what did we see? 
Last week people were at the airports or on the phone, desperately trying to find out whether they could get a flight home or whether they could take that holiday that they had paid for after saving up all year and paying for their tickets. Those people have now been told by the Treasurer of this country, `You cannot even get the GST back on the tickets that you paid for by cash.' How insensitive. Words cannot describe how mean and miserable this government is. But, of course, the President of the Liberal Party is on the record as noting some months ago that this government is mean and that it is miserable and that it is tricky. We are seeing once again those same characteristics of this government in operation when it will not even refund the GST on those worthless Ansett airline tickets. (Time expired)

I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—
ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY AGE RETIREMENT (STATUTORY OFFICEHOLDERS) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill 
The Abolition of Compulsory Age Retirement (Statutory Officeholders) Bill 2001 seeks to abolish compulsory age retirement limits in a wide range of statutory appointments.  It complements the removal of compulsory age retirement limits for Commonwealth public servants.  Suitable exceptions are provided for judges, defence force personnel and tenured positions.  
Reasons for Introduction and Passage 
The Bill makes it clear that it will only apply to future appointments made after it commences.  It does not affect the terms of any office holders who are appointed before the commencement of the Bill (see Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Bill).  
The Bill will widen the range of potential appointees and remove archaic and artificial boundaries between work and retirement.  Implementing the Bill earlier rather than later will allow a wider pool of people (ie those who are close to or over the age of 65 years) to be considered for appointments than is currently possible. This will be of immediate and significant benefit to those people who are close to or over the age limit in that it will allow them to be considered for appointment. 
Should the Bill not be passed by the Parliament, older potential appointees to any statutory office which will be considered in coming months will be disadvantaged because of the maintenance of age retirement limits.  People may be deterred from applying or expressing their interest in a vacant position in the near future because it currently has an age retirement limit.  It is desirable that this outmoded limitation on statutory appointments be removed as quickly as possible, so that all future appointments can be made on merit, without being inappropriately and arbitrarily affected by statutory age limits.

AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001
AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bills 
The Bills will introduce a levy to meet the costs associated with the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett group employees.
Reasons for Urgency
The Government has undertaken to ensure that former Ansett employees have access to their entitlements.
While the Government will be taking action to force the Air New Zealand group to pay the entitlements, to reduce the uncertainty for Ansett employees about access to their entitlements for wages, annual and long service leave, pay in lieu of notice and redundancy pay to the community standard of 8 weeks, the Government is establishing a Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett group employees, funded by an air passenger ticket levy. 
The passage of the Bill is required by the end of this period of sittings in order to have the Scheme in place to meet the immediate needs of former Ansett employees.

—————
BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001 
BANKRUPTCY (ESTATE CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 2001 
Purpose of the Bills
The Bills will make a number of significant changes to bankruptcy law.  The changes address concerns that the bankruptcy system is biased towards the debtor and that debtors are not encouraged to think seriously about the decision to declare themselves bankrupt.  The changes also address unfairness and anomalies, particularly in relation to the operation of the early discharge arrangements and the lack of effective sanctions on unco-operative bankrupts.  The changes will streamline the administration of bankruptcies by trustees.
Reasons for Introduction and Passage
The proposed bankruptcy reforms will promote confidence in the integrity of the bankruptcy system.  The proposed amendments are the product of more than 2 years of consultation and there is a significant expectation among stakeholders of the reforms being implemented.
The Bills were introduced into the House of Representatives during the 2001 Winter sittings and were expected to be introduced in the Senate within the first two-thirds of the 2001 Spring sittings.  However, a change in sitting dates in October has resulted in a cut-off date occurring on 18 September. The Bills will be introduced into the Senate after this cut-off, and the Senate is requested to agree to debate them during the current sittings.

—————
CYBERCRIME BILL 2001 
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill addresses the significant threat posed by cybercrime activities such as hacking, computer virus propagation, denial of service attacks and website vandalism, and ensures that authorities are able to effectively detect, investigate and prosecute cybercrime.  
It is proposed to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to introduce new computer offences to replace the existing outdated computer offences, and amend the Crimes Act 1914 and the Customs Act 1901 to enhance the operation of investigation powers relating to electronically stored data.  The new computer offences will be based on those in the Model Criminal Code developed in cooperation with the States and Territories through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.  The proposed offences will apply to computer crime activities which impair the security, integrity and reliability of computer systems.  Criminal investigation powers will be improved to enable the more effective search and seizure of electronically stored data.   
Reasons for Introduction and Passage
Cybercrime is growing rapidly.  According to recent estimates by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, cybercrime is costing companies worldwide approximately 3 trillion dollars a year.  Many Australian companies suffered heavy losses as a result of infection by the “Love Bug” and “Anna Kournikova” viruses and a number of government and commercial websites were vandalised earlier this year.  Australian on-line companies and retailers could be the subject of denial of service attacks similar to those that shut down the on-line operations of Amazon.com earlier this year.  Such cybercrime activities have the potential to cause enormous economic harm. 
Legislation must be enacted at the earliest possible opportunity to ensure that the criminal impairment and misuse of computer technology can be prosecuted and to provide law enforcement authorities with the necessary tools to effectively detect and investigate crime involving computers.
The Cybercrime Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives during the 2001 Winter sittings and was expected to be introduced in the Senate within the first two-thirds of the 2001 Spring sittings.  However, a change in sitting dates in October has resulted in a cut-off date occurring on 18 September.  The Bill will be introduced in the Senate after this cut-off, and the Senate is requested to agree to debate it during the current sittings.

CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 2001 
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 by incorporating changes contained in Tariff Proposals Nos 1, 4 and 5 (2001).  It also introduces amendments to concessional items relating to the Policy and Project By-Law Scheme.  
Reasons for Introduction and Passage
Alterations contained in Customs Tariff Proposals must be enacted within twelve months of being tabled.  Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2001) was tabled on 28 February 2001 and requires Royal Assent by 27 February 2002.  It relates to cessation of the `Administrative Arrangements to the Year 2000 for the Automotive Industry' and effectively closes concessional entry provisions under the export facilitation and passenger motor vehicle producer 15 per cent entitlement schemes.  These schemes ceased operation on 31 December 2000.  Failure to pass the proposed amendments could potentially allow export facilitation scheme credits to be used for concessional entry of automotive items beyond 31 December 2001 with implications for the post-2000 automotive arrangements.  
Tariff Proposal No. 4 (2001) relates to SPARTECA TCF, which assists Fiji's textiles, clothing and footwear industries to adjust to the cessation of the Import Credit Scheme and delivers undertakings made in the context of encouraging Fiji to return to democratic rule and hold elections (now held).
The Bill gives effect to a key provision of the Australia-Russia Space Cooperation Agreement signed on 23 May 2001 (Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2001)).  That Agreement is critical to progressing the Asia Pacific Space Centre spaceport on Christmas Island.  Any delay in the Bill may compromise the commercial schedule of that project.  
The Bill also includes new items 70 and 71, which will provide industry with certainty and the opportunity to comply with significant changes ahead of implementation on 1 July 2002 of the new Policy and Project By-Law Scheme which was announced as part of the 2001-2002 Budget.
The Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives during the 2001 Winter sittings and was expected to be introduced in the Senate within the first two-thirds of the 2001 Spring sittings.  However, a change in sitting dates in October has resulted in a cut-off date occurring on 18 September.  The Bill will be introduced in the Senate after this cut-off, and the Senate is requested to agree to debate it during the current sittings.

—————
DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill 
Offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and various pieces of defence legislation are interpreted in the light of common law principles of criminal responsibility (guided by the requirements of military discipline).  The Criminal Code Act 1995 codifies the principles of criminal responsibility and the imposition of criminal liability.  The purpose of the proposed amendments is to harmonise defence legislation offences with the criminal responsibility provisions in the Criminal Code. 
Reasons for Urgency
The provisions of the Criminal Code will automatically apply to offences after 15 December 2001, by which time all consequential or harmonising legislation must be in place.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Defence)
—————
EMPLOYMENT, WORKPLACE RELATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill will adjust offence provisions in legislation in the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business portfolio to ensure they operate as intended when the Criminal Code applies to them from 15 December 2001.
Reasons for Urgency
When the Criminal Code commences on 15 December 2001, the provisions contained in the Code will govern the interpretation of all Commonwealth offence provisions.  It is therefore essential for offence provisions in the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business portfolio to be updated by that time, so that they are in line with the Code.

FUEL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GRANT AND REBATE SCHEMES) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will extend the sunset clauses of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme from June 2002 to June 2003.
Reasons for Urgency
Passage in Spring sittings ensures changes can apply from 1 July 2002.

INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2001 
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill will expand the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to include the capacity to fund partnerships between communities, industry and education providers and business support for vocational learning for Indigenous secondary school students.
Reasons for Introduction and Passage
Passage of the Bill will allow implementation of the consultation and development phase of partnerships in 2001-02. 
In addition, the Bill, when enacted, will reflect changes already made to the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986.
The Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives during the 2001 Winter sittings and was expected to be introduced in the Senate within the first two-thirds of the 2001 Spring sittings.  However, a change in sitting dates in October has resulted in a cut-off date occurring on 18 September.  The Bill will be introduced in the Senate after this cut-off, and the Senate is requested to agree to debate it during the current sittings.

INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BILL 2001 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2001 
Purpose of the Bills
The principal purposes of the Bills is to:
·	detail the functions of ASIS and DSD;
·	place ASIS on a statutory footing;
·	enhance the accountability and oversight mechanisms of ASIS, including through the establishment of a Parliamentary Joint Committee to provide oversight to both ASIS and ASIO;
·	provide limited legal immunities for ASIS and DSD in respect of aspects of the proper conduct of their functions;  and
·	preserve the privacy of Australians.
Reasons for Urgency
The Bills were introduced in the House of Representatives during the 2001 Winter sittings and were expected to be introduced in the Senate within the first two-thirds of the 2001 Spring sittings.  However, a change in the sitting dates in October has resulted in a cut-off date occurring on 18 September.  The Bills will be introduced in the Senate after this cut-off, and the Senate is requested to agree to debate them during the current sittings.
The services provided by ASIS and DSD are vital to the interests of the country.  In the conduct of their activities focused outside Australia as directed by the Government, ASIS and DSD may be inhibited by the unintended consequences of Australian laws.  The Bills seek to resolve these difficulties by providing limited immunities for both ASIS and DSD in respect of aspects of the proper conduct of their functions.  The Bills find the appropriate balance between the ability of ASIS and DSD to satisfy Government requirements and the need for accountability and Parliamentary oversight. 
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Foreign Affairs)
—————
JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES SERVICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill will amend certain legislation to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Service (FMS) in migration matters.  This jurisdiction would be concurrent with the Federal Court's.  This will give the FMS a broader jurisdiction in general federal law matters.  
Specifically, the Bill will:  
·	amend Part 8 of the Migration Act 1958 to include a provision that the FMS has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court in matters under Part 8; and  
·	amend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to remove the limitation on the FMS exercising jurisdiction in relation to other matters under immigration portfolio legislation.
Reasons for Urgency
Many migration matters are of a routine nature and would be suitable for the FMS.  One of the main benefits of giving the FMS jurisdiction would be quicker processing of these routine cases.  The FMS aims to resolve all matters in six months.
There is provision in the FMS legislation to allow for matters to be transferred to the Federal Court (or Family Court where appropriate).  This means that more complex matters filed in the FMS can be transferred to the Federal Court.  Similarly, there are provisions for transfer from the Federal Court to the FMS of less complex matters with the FMS's jurisdiction.

—————
MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2001 
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill makes changes to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 to allow the implementation of new arrangements to administer the importation of used vehicles, including a registered automotive workshop scheme. 
Reasons for Introduction and Passage
The new scheme for the importation and supply of used vehicles through registered automotive workshops cannot commence until the legislation is in place.  Any delay will result in the continued supply of significant numbers of imported used vehicles which are not considered to be specialist and enthusiast vehicles.  There is also an expectation that the new scheme will be fully operational as soon as possible so that interested businesses can take advantage of the increased number of vehicles allowed to be supplied by a workshop.
The Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives during the 2001 Winter sittings and was expected to be introduced in the Senate within the first two-thirds of the 2001 Spring sittings.  However, a change in sitting dates in October has resulted in a cut-off date occurring on 18 September.  The Bill will be introduced in the Senate after this cut-off, and the Senate is requested to agree to debate it during the current sittings.

OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill 
To amend the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 (OIP Act) to give the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) protection for the words `Olympic Games', `Olympic' and `Olympiad' (Olympic words) against unauthorised commercial use for advertising or promotional purposes.
Reasons for Urgency
Introduction and passage in the Spring sittings is required to ensure the protection of the Olympic words comes into effect as soon as possible.  The AOC is expected to take on an increased responsibility for developing, funding and maintaining Olympic sport.  The AOC is in a unique position to raise significant funds for Australian sport through sponsorship and licensing arrangements due to its ability to raise funds on behalf of all Olympic sports.
For the AOC to deliver its proposed programs it is reliant on the ability to achieve its forecasted potential income projection, specifically by maximising sponsorship opportunities.  The AOC is currently re-negotiating contracts with existing sponsors and seeking to attract new sponsors for the next four years with a view to securing its revenue streams for that period.  The value of the sponsorship and licensing arrangements it is able to secure will be directly influenced by the level of certainty the AOC can give to prospective sponsors about the exclusive nature of these arrangements.  The proposed amendments to the OIP Act will increase this level of certainty by providing greater protection against ambush marketing.   
While the restriction on the use of the words for commercial purposes will help to protect the AOC's plans for financing athlete preparation for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games and the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, it would not however adversely impact on the ability of elite athletes to generate sponsorship revenue, or impede support organisations from raising extra funds by promoting their Olympians.  Athletes, teams and support organisations will be able to use the Olympic words as part of factual historical statements in a commercial sense with third party sponsors.  In addition, any other words (eg, `Olympian', `gold medallist', `Sydney 2000') and images will not be protected and their use will be freely available in any context, subject to legal remedies already available to the AOC under the Trade Practices Act or arising out of contractual obligations.
Delays in enacting amendments to the OIP Act would adversely affect the AOC's ability to maximise the value of sponsorship and licensing contracts.  Funding shortfalls will have a direct impact on the degree to which the AOC can fully implement its 2004 Medal Plan, and so compromise the legacy of the Sydney Games and Australia's high standing in the international sport arena.

REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2001 
Purpose of the Bill 
The purpose of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 is to provide legislative commitment and support for the outcomes of the Regional Forest Agreements and for ongoing action to implement the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council.
Reasons for Urgency
Ten Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) between the Commonwealth and three State Governments have now been concluded since the agreement between governments to implement RFAs in 1995.  Some State Governments have challenged aspects of the outcomes of these agreements, introducing uncertainty about continuing Government commitment to the RFAs.
The substance of the Bill has been extensively debated in the Parliament.  This Bill honours a commitment to regional communities, industry and some State Governments.  It will commit the Commonwealth unequivocally to the outcomes achieved in the RFA process and increase the certainty essential to RFAs being effective.  Failure to pass the Bill in this session potentially means there would be a long period of uncertainty about the future of the RFAs.
This could undermine the work of successive Commonwealth and State Governments, since the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992, to improve inter-governmental institutions and decision processes to support comprehensive forward planning of forest use.  Passage of the Bill would also underpin ongoing action under the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council.

TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 2001
Purpose of the bill
The bill contains amendments to tax laws to:
·	clarify the treatment of religious practitioners under the new tax system;
·	change the tax status of constitutionally protected superannuation funds;
·	turn off cost base adjustments for certain distributions;
·	include a number of new organisations in the tables that provide gift deductibility status; 
·	ensure that non-profit societies and associations established to develop Australian information and communications technology resources are exempt from income tax and also qualify for a fringe benefits rebate; and
·	provide a fringe benefits tax rebate to employers who are a non-profit society or association that has been established to develop Australian aquaculture and fishing resources.
Reasons for Urgency
Introduction of most of these measures into Parliament was delayed by a heavy tax reform legislative program, but in order to provide certainty for taxpayers, they are now being legislated as a matter of urgency.

TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 6) 2001
Purpose of the bill
The bill contains amendments to tax laws to:
·	provide clear methodology to determine a Gas Transfer Price for applying Petroleum Rent Resource Tax (PRRT) to integrated gas to liquid projects;
·	amend the expenditure provisions contained in the PRRT Act so that the reference for the 5 year rule is the date a person has provided all necessary material for a production license; 
·	exempt local government business from income tax;
·	allow self-managed superannuation funds to retain their residency status when members temporarily go overseas;
·	provide shareholders in listed investment companies with access to the CGT discount so they receive comparable tax treatment to investors in managed funds;
·	ensure that transactions occurring as a result of either the Commonwealth's or the States and Territories' HIH rescue schemes do not incur tax where they would not have incurred tax had they been the result of claims by policyholders against HIH; and
·	give effect to the Government's announced changes to the alienation of personal services income provisions.
Reasons for Urgency
The legislation requires passage so that taxpayers and investors can have certainty regarding their taxation requirements. A number of these measures have benefited from extensive consultation with industry, following their announcement by the Government. The measures in this bill are beneficial to taxpayers.

TRANSPORT AND REGIONAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Criminal Code Amendment (Application) Act 2000 will apply the Criminal Code to all offences under Commonwealth law.  This will happen from 15 December 2001.
The Code will impact on criminal offence provisions administered by the Transport and Regional Services portfolio.  The Bill will ensure that the offence provisions continue to operate as originally intended once the Code applies.
Reasons for Urgency
It is essential that the Transport and Regional Services portfolio bill be introduced and passed in the Spring sittings to ensure that offence provisions continue to operate as intended.

WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (MINIMUM ENTITLEMENTS FOR VICTORIAN WORKERS) BILL 2001 
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to improve the minimum entitlements of Victorian workers not covered by a Federal award or agreement and contract outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry in Victoria.
Reasons for Urgency
Victorian workers not covered by a Federal award or agreement (`Schedule 1A employees') are covered by a safety net of five minimum conditions contained in Part XV of and Schedule 1A to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the WR Act).  There is a widespread perception in Victoria that these minimum conditions are inadequate.  There is also a perception that outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry in Victoria are disadvantaged by the current arrangements.
Recently, the Victorian Government unsuccessfully attempted to secure passage of the Fair Employment Bill 2000 (Vic.).  If passed, that bill would have partially reintroduced a State system of industrial relations, ostensibly to improve the conditions of Schedule 1A employees and of outworkers.  
In this Government's view, the Victorian bill went much further than was necessary, and would have led to increases in the cost of employment in Victoria.  On some estimates, the passage of the bill would have led to substantial job losses.  Victoria is Australia's second largest State, with a major manufacturing and service industry focus.  Job losses in Victoria arising from ill considered State based re-regulation would have a negative economic and social impact. 
The Government wants to move quickly to implement arrangements which improve, in a cost-effective way, the safety net of conditions under which Schedule 1A employees and TCF contract outworkers work, thus removing the need for the Victorian Government to pursue its own more costly agenda.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2001-09-25,"—On behalf of Senator Coonan and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, I shall move that the Quarantine Service Fees Determinations 2001 (No.1 of 2001), made under section 86E of the Quarantine Act 1908, be disallowed. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the committee's concerns with this instrument.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Quarantine Service Fees Determinations 2001 (No.1 of 2001), made under section 86E of the Quarantine Act 1908
The Determination increases the fee rates for the Import Clearance and Seaports Programs and introduces a new Customs Compile fee for importers of High Volume Low Value air cargo consignments. 
Determination 7, headed Late Payment Fees, specifies a penalty fee at the rate of 20% per annum for late payment of a prescribed fee after the due date for payment.  Section 86E(2C) of the Quarantine Act 1908 provides that:
A late payment fee may be either or both of the following: 
(a)	a fee of a stated amount; 
(b)	a fee of a stated amount in respect of each day after the payment day and before the day on which the basic fee is paid. 
The Committee has sought an assurance that a penalty fee which is specified to be a rate per annum is permitted by section 86E(2C) of the Act. The Committee has also sought advice on whether the imposition of a late payment fee is subject to review.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,6,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-25,"—I do agree to that motion. However, I would point out that this bill is being put with undue haste through the parliament. The committee that is dealing with the regional forest agreements—and the enormous consequences for Australia's native forests and wildlife—has not had adequate time to consider the representations I have received from a wide range of the community who are entitled to have a say. In fact, there are many angry Australians out there who believe that this bill is being railroaded through the Senate and that the committee, which met last night, has not travelled to the places where it really matters so that, although the logging community gets the opportunity to have maximum input, the community is affected by this destructive loss of native forest under the regional forest agreement of Mr Howard, backed by Mr Beazley, without any representations. I object to that process. 
This bill has been sitting on the shelf for three years. It ought to have been brought up long before this so that the community could be involved. Once again, we are seeing the forms of democracy thrown out of the window because a big lobby group—the woodchipping organisations—wants to get this legislation through. And I will tell you why: because there is a compensation clause in there concerning the future protection of forests in our nation which are currently targeted by the woodchip industry. The industry is cutting down and destroying Tasmania's forests at the greatest rate in history, for the smallest price in history, for the fewest jobs in history, despite Mr Howard's promise that a thousand jobs would be created. Almost that many jobs have been destroyed, even though the industry is cutting faster since 1997, when Mr Howard signed the death warrant on these forests. Here we have, in the dying days of this parliament, this railroading by Labor and Liberal of this destructive process through the parliament. I object.

I am not going to agree to that process without standing up for the community that I represent on this major issue. The process is tawdry, truncated and undemocratic and it flies in the face of the 70 to 80 per cent of Tasmanians and Australians who do not want to see this massive forest destruction, in the interests of a few friends in the major parties who, no doubt, are lining up right now to sign cheques for the election campaign. That is where we are at with this process. Pretty unseemly, isn't it? It is pretty nasty.

Introduction
On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I would like to make some brief comments on the three reports I have just tabled. They are:
·	the Committee's Eleventh Report of 2001 titled, New Freight and Passenger Facilities at Rumah Baru on West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands; 
·	the Committee's Twelfth Report of 2001 titled, Redevelopment of Residential Areas at Royal Military College, Duntroon, and
·	the Committee's Thirteenth Report of 2001 titled, Defence Intelligence Training Centre at Canungra, Queensland. 
Freight and passenger facilities at Rumah Baru
The first report I have tabled relates to the construction of new freight and passenger facilities at Rumah Baru on West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands. 
Problems
Historically, freight handling and passenger transfer on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have been characterised by many logistical and environmental problems.
While West Island-bound containers are more numerous than those for Home Island, the direct transfer of containers to West Island is not possible due to the lack of suitable freight facilities. 
In addition, containers need to be partially unloaded on Home Island to reduce container loads.  This is because there is insufficient capacity on the barge to transport containers one at a time across the lagoon to West Island.
The existing passenger jetty is located at the north-eastern end of West Island and is in a very exposed position.  This results in unsafe passenger transfers during high wind and heavy swell conditions.
Preferred solution
The preferred solution proposed by the Department of Transport and Regional Services is to construct an offshore island at Rumah Baru on the eastern side of West Island, which would be connected to the shore by an access bridge. The island would be linked to deeper water in the lagoon by a dredged channel of approximately 400 metres in length.
Benefits
The works in this proposal will allow freight containers to be towed directly from a supply ship to the offshore island at West Island without the need for containers to be reduced in weight. 
The proposal will also improve:
·	the safety;
·	efficiency; and
·	reliability of freight and passenger facilities. 
During its inspections, the Committee was able to observe, at first hand, the hazardous nature of freight and passenger handling operations and procedures.
Recommendation
The Committee has formed the view that there is an urgent need for the provision of new freight and passenger facilities on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.  Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the works proceed as a single stage project at a cost of $16 million.
Royal Military College, Duntroon, ACT
The second report I have tabled today relates to the development of residential areas at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. 
The Defence Housing Authority (or DHA as it is more commonly known) is proposing to construct 100 on-base residences at Royal Military College for married accompanied Defence staff.
Committee caution
I note that the Committee views DHA's proposals for on-base accommodation for Defence personnel with some caution, even though dwellings are more cost-effective because they are constructed on Defence land.
The Committee's cautionary view comes from its experience with similar projects.  An example is dwellings built at RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine (in the Northern Territory) in the early 1980s.  They became surplus to Defence's requirements because improved technology resulted in a decrease in staff numbers.
Added to this, the Committee continues to have doubts about the numbers of Defence personnel and their families who wish to live on-base. To this end the Committee has recommended that surveys of the views of personnel and their families be undertaken together with the future viability of the Base in question.
However, in the specific case of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, the Committee took into account its long history and role as a recognised unique training centre for Australian Army officers as well as military officers from other countries.
Energy management
I turn now to the question of energy management. 
In keeping with Government policy, the Committee expects that Commonwealth departments and agencies should lead the way in effecting change in how energy is managed in the community.
The Committee has therefore recommended that Commonwealth departments and agencies provide detailed comparative cost analyses between the various forms of energy, including solar energy, with any works proposals presented to the Public Works Committee. 
Greenhouse emissions
Related to this is the minimisation of greenhouse emissions.  In this area the Committee is increasingly interested to assess Commonwealth departments and agencies in terms of their commitment to the aims of the Australian Greenhouse Office. 
The Committee has therefore recommended that Commonwealth departments and agencies ensure that consultations take place with the Australian Greenhouse Office about the most appropriate and effective methods of minimising energy for proposed public works.
National Estate issues
A number of heritage buildings are located within the Royal Military College Duntroon area and are entered on the Register of the National Estate.  Any new buildings constructed in the heritage area should be sympathetic to their surround. 
Heritage issues
The Committee has recommended that close consultation be maintained with the Australian Heritage Commission, particularly in relation to final design drawings. 
The Committee has also recommended the establishment of a monitoring process during trenching or excavation of all sub-surface works and that this be monitored by an archaeologist.
Recommendation
Despite these various recommendations, the Committee supports the proposed works and has recommended the redevelopment proceed at the cost of $23 million.
Defence Intelligence Centre, Canungra, QLD
The third report I have tabled today relates to the redevelopment of facilities for the Defence Intelligence Training Centre at Canungra, Queensland. 
History
Following a review of defence intelligence matters, the separate Defence intelligence training organisations were amalgamated in 1994 to form the Defence Intelligence Training Wing. 
In 1997 this organisation was amalgamated with the School of Military Intelligence to form the Defence Intelligence Training Centre.
Main factors
In recommending that this work proceed at an estimated cost of $17.745 million, the Committee has based its decision on three main factors. They are: 
1.	First, the recognition in the White Paper on Defence 2000 that the implementation of Australia's strategic policy requires the development of an intelligence capability through the enhancement of analytical and assessment expertise in military and strategic intelligence;
2.	Secondly, the inadequacies of the existing facilities of the Defence Intelligence Training Centre in terms of:
·	size; 
·	security; and 
·	occupational health and safety issues; and
3.	Thirdly, the Strategic Plan for the Defence Estate has confirmed that Canungra should be retained a significant Defence training base.
Heritage issues
The Committee has recommended that Defence consult with the Australian Heritage Commission to ensure the protection of sites of both cultural and ecological significance.
Australian Greenhouse Office
The Committee has also recommended that Defence consult with the Australian Greenhouse Office in relation to the application of the Commonwealth's energy policy to Defence capital works projects.
Local environment issues
Finally, the Committee has recommended that, as a matter of urgency, Defence establish an environmental advisory committee for the Canungra Close Training Area to provide a forum at which local environmental issues can be discussed.
This is an importance recommendation and I hasten to add that the Committee was impressed by evidence from community groups regarding the importance of the area to the local community.
I commend to the Senate each of the reports that I have tabled.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-25,"—I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on methods of appointment to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's board, entitled Above Board?, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee, and move that the report be printed. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On 27 June this year, the Senate referred the following matter to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by 25 September 2001: 
The development and implementation of options for methods of appointment to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that would enhance public confidence in the independence and representativeness of the ABC as the national broadcaster. 
The committee advertised the inquiry in national newspapers on 7 and 8 July 2001, on the committee's home page on the Internet and by letters to organisations and individuals with an interest in the inquiry. The committee received 720 written submissions. The committee also held a public hearing in Parliament House on Monday, 20 August. Three conclusions emerged from the inquiry. First, since the inception of the ABC the party in government has appointed people to the board who are sympathetic to the views of the governing party—although this is not to say that appointees to the board have been either incompetent or ineffective in serving the interests of the ABC or the public. Second, it is abundantly clear from the large number of submissions that there is a strong public perception that the board is not independent. Third, it is vital to the credibility of the ABC as the national public broadcaster that both the board and the corporation be independent in fact and perception. The ABC is a key element in effective democracy in Australia and in its role of independent commentator every effort must be made to strengthen its independence.
In the light of these conclusions, the report recommends introducing a system characterised by the principles of transparency and merit. To give effect to these principles, the chair's report recommends a model of board appointments along the following lines:
1.	An ad-hoc Independent Selection Committee ... be brought together for the purposes of selecting a member ... and recommend a short list ... for the Minister to consider.
2.	Selection criteria ... be drafted by the Merit Protection Commissioner.
3.	The Merit Protection Commissioner be an ex-officio member of the Committee, to provide expertise and advice to the Committee in its deliberations.
4.	The ABC Board vacancy be advertised in the national press and via ABC services ... inviting applications from interested persons.
5.	Those wishing to be considered for appointment to the ABC Board must provide a written application addressing the selection criteria, and a statement disclosing political affiliation. Candidates shall be made aware that their applications will be made public.
	...	...	...
7.	The Minister retains the responsibility for appointments to the ABC Board and is not obliged to choose any of the candidates recommended by the Committee. However, the Minister must not select a candidate who has not first been scrutinised by the Committee.
The chair's report also makes several recommendations designed to enhance the transparency and responsiveness of the ABC board, as follows:
1.	... the Board shall elect a Chair and Deputy Chair.
2.	the ABC Board shall hold a public Annual General Meeting ...
3.	The ABC Board should appoint a member to be a formal liaison officer to the National Advisory Council.
4.	The ABC National Advisory Council shall meet four times per year, at times to coincide with the meetings of the ABC Board.
5.	The ABC Board shall publish information about their activities and decisions, including summaries of minutes to Board meetings.
I note that the government and ALP reports disagree with those recommendations, but I draw the attention of these parties to the widespread unease which gave rise to so many submissions and suggest that the problems which led to this inquiry will not go away. I urge whoever is in government after the next election to seriously revisit this matter. I seek leave to incorporate the speaking notes of my colleague Senator Vicky Bourne. I understand there is agreement with the whips to do this. 
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
This Senate inquiry commenced as an indirect result of my private senator's bill on appointments to the ABC Board.  
Since I introduced that Bill in March 1999, the issue of ABC Board appointments has been placed firmly on the political agenda.  
At the many, many rallies, forums and other discussion groups I have attended in the last year in particular, I have noticed the increased degree of concern that Board appointments are not based on merit.  The issue of the ABC Board is now mentioned as often as funding.  
ABC audiences, the very people who attended these meetings, are very concerned about the way in which the Board is appointed.  This is because they have a very strong feeling that the Board has not acted in the best interests of the ABC.  
This perception goes further.  ABC audiences are also extremely concerned that the ABC Board is too close to government - both by ideology and by personal acquaintance.  
Whether this perception is real or otherwise - it is very strong. So strong in fact, that over 700 people wrote to the Committee to express their concern about the Board.  They also expressed a very strong desire that a parliamentary committee should have the responsibility for making those appointments - or at least providing the minister with advice on whom to appoint, even if the Minister retains the final approval. 
As we would all be aware, the issue of Board appointments was raised by the Senate in its inquiry into the management and operations of the ABC in 1994, 1995.  That inquiry arose because of allegations at the time that the ABC was improperly using backdoor sponsorship as a way of boosting program budgets at a time of quite difficult financial constraints.  
At that time, the Senate inquiry had, as one of its terms of reference, “the controversy surrounding appointments to the Board of the ABC including concerns that individual merit and potential contribution to the policy direction, public standing and the political independence of the ABC are no longer the sole criteria for such appointments”.  
The Senate Select Committee then recommended that “before the appointment of a person to the Board, the proposed nominee should be required to appear before a joint parliamentary to enable the parliament to scrutinise the person's credentials.  The committee would not have a power of veto, but would be able to comment on the suitability of a nominee prior to appointment”. 
It is worth recalling that the Coalition chaired that Senate Select Committee and so presumably, upheld the views of the Committee.  We found that the ABC should retain the original public broadcasting ideals which bind the Corporation under the Charter.  I echo these sentiments and reaffirm the Democrats commitment to public sector broadcasting. 
We also found that the basic structure of the ABC was sound and the need for a quality national broadcaster more important than ever before.  In reading the submission to this inquiry, I know that the majority of Australian audiences think the same way.  They simply want the Government and the Opposition to share their concerns, and indicate their support for public sector broadcasting, and to the ABC in particular.
I can also recall the then government's position on this, which remains unchanged from what the ALP is stating today: that we cannot have a committee questioning applicants, because questioning candidates will lead to the creation of a star chamber.   Evidently the ALP does not believe that conducting an interview process is about transparency and accountability. 
I cannot think why anyone would think a parliamentary committee would lead to a star chamber, and it saddens me to think that other members of parliament consider that we would treat witnesses in other than an appropriate manner.  
I suspect that the opposition just needs to think about this issue a little harder, and are not using this as an excuse to stifle reform.  
Under the model recommended in this report, the proposed committee will only be able to question applicants on their application and questions must relate directly to the selection criteria.  The usual rules for parliamentary committee confidentiality would apply, so people's privacy would be upheld and respected.  
In the last decade, of course, the ABC's budget has been dramatically reduced.  But audience expectations have increased and the ABC now delivers more services than ever before.  While we acknowledge that program production is down, I am sure the ABC is doing everything it can to rectify the problem.   
The government recently provided an additional small increase to the ABC's budget but it is a minute amount of the funding it requires to make the necessary adjustments to digital television broadcasting, to commission new innovative high quality programs and to continue to produce these programs in-house. 
The two issues are related.  People are upset because they think the Board should have done more to protect the ABC from budget cuts and from incessant restructuring, from staff cuts and from program reductions.  Over 700 people were prompted to write to the Senate because they are so upset.  They assert, rightly, that the Board should be held responsible for the ABC.  This is at Section 8 of the ABC Act.  It is the Board who is empowered, and required, to make decisions in the interests of the Corporation, with particular reference to the Charter.  
Acting properly, the interests of audiences are upheld, and ultimately, the ABC is responsible to its audiences.  The ABC is required to broadcast programs that reflect our sense of national identity, reflect our cultural inheritance and multicultural nature.  They are to be of interest to specialist audiences and to broader audiences. Programs are required to be high quality, to inform, educate and entertain.  Importantly, too programs should advocate on behalf of those who are not able to speak for themselves.  
In recent weeks I immediately think of the way in which refugees and asylum seekers are portrayed in our media.  To counterbalance the exploitative messages of some parts of our media, or even some parts of government, the ABC should be the place where we can find a measured debate, where the refugees find a public advocate.  
This is the proper role of public broadcasting, and a proper role for the ABC in particular. 
Just as an aside to this, may I send a congratulatory note to the executive producer and staff of the Public Record, an ABC online service.  This service is a new ABC service - developed to provide Australian audiences with access to our important public institutions, including parliament.  It was a tremendous service during the recent coverage of the World Trade Centre disaster.  The very nature of this service should, and does typify the ABC. 
The Democrats believe that only an independent ABC Board can deliver exceptional services and programs to Australian audiences.  
Just as the definition of independence needs careful consideration so does the establishment of an independent method to screen applicants. 
The Committee reviewed the many submissions which discussed the term and meaning of independence.  Many took the view that being a member of a political party was enough to exclude them from holding a position on the ABC Board.  
The Democrats do not agree with this position.  Rather, we agree that people with knowledge of the political process would make reasonable applicants, given the kinds of issues the Board would need to deliberate over on occasion. 
We are also firmly of the view that more appropriate measures to select applicants for the ABC Board would mean that overtly political applicants need not ultimately be appointed to the Board.  This should be the case if the selection process involved members from all sides of politics, screening applications under an agreed selection criteria, itself to be developed by the Merit Protection Commissioner, or similar person. 
Obviously, the issue of appointments to the ABC Board is broader than just the ABC. 
My colleague Senator Andrew Murray has spoken at length about this process, and I am sure that the government and opposition are getting tired of voting against his amendments.  I do really find this very strange, because the opposition spokesperson for communications has made some very positive statements about needing an independent process for Board appointments.
The Democrats think the process recommended in the Committee report establishes a good way to proceed and captures the recommendations made by witnesses. 
No government, no matter how good its intentions, can deflect the public perception of such appointments as being rewards for party hacks or others who have assisted the Government to gain office. Further, this perception can damage the reputation of these bodies.  They are viewed by the public as being controlled by people who lack independence and merit.  Positions should not be awarded on the basis of political patronage, but solely on the basis of merit.  
This committee report has this issue of perception and process at its very centre. 
The Democrats are concerned to ensure that wherever appointments are made to public authorities - whether they be institutions established under law, independent statutory authorities or quasi-government agencies - the process by which these appointments are made is transparent, accountable, open and honest. 
Our electors need to have faith in these processes. 
The Democrats have consistently tabled amendments designed to require ministers to appoint on merit, and they have consistently been rejected by both Labor and the Coalition. We have based our amendments on the recommendations of the 1995 Nolan Committee in the United Kingdom, which reviewed the processes for making public appointments and set out key principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments. In Senator Murray's Charter of Political Honesty Bill, the Democrats do not commit the Commissioner to any one approach. We simply draw attention to the excellent work of the Nolan Committee in the hope that it will be taken into account in developing an appropriate code for Australia.
I was particularly pleased that this issue was raised by several witnesses during the course of the inquiry, indicating that there is a great deal of public concern about this issue, and a desire for real and lasting reform in this most important area. 
I will spend the remainder of my time speaking to the proposed model.  
It will be noted that the recommended model is for the establishment of a joint committee, with members drawn from both houses of parliament, to oversee the advertising, the application and the selection processes for potential ABC Board members. 
The model also requires that applicants disclose any political affiliation in order for a transparent application process.  We are firmly of the view that applicants with political affiliations would still make good members and should not be arbitrarily excluded from the process.   One of the most important criteria for selection is that applicants must demonstrate a commitment to the role and functions of public sector broadcasting.  
With the committee selecting applicants drawn from all parliamentary parties, political bias on the Board need not occur. 
 In closing I'd like to thank the secretariat for their work on this inquiry.  Handling over 700 submissions cannot be an easy task, but as usual the secretariat undertook their task well.  I would also like to thank the more than 700 dedicated ABC audience members who took the time to advise senators of the depth of their feelings about the ABC and what successive governments have done to undermine the ABC.  As always, the strength of the committee report is based on the strength of submissions.  
I look forward to passing the senate resolution which establishes the parliamentary committee to oversee the next appointment to the ABC Board - no matter who the minister may be who brings that matter to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-25,"—I concur with Senator Allison's remarks and want to highlight the huge public interest there is in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the enormous public concern there is for its welfare. I am not going to take long here at all, but I do not go along with the asseveration by the opposition, let alone by the government, that everything will be all right if you give the ABC extra money. It is undoubted that that is required. It needs to provide its services to Australia as the best producer of information for Australians about the news of the day, current affairs, Australian culture and, indeed, the identity of this nation. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation not only does a brilliant job but is the only organisation in the field that can do that job. Commercial broadcasting outlets simply cannot because of the very nature of their corporate enterprise.
That said, it is a pity that the big parties have once again determined to do nothing much at all here. The Labor Party, in particular, which is critical of the chair's report, has not come up with any strong alternative. Labor members simply say, `If you give enough money to the ABC, it does not matter much who is on there, they will do the right thing.' It is very important that the ABC board be seen to be at arm's length from politics—that it not just provide a balance of Labor and Liberal politics but be at full arm's length from politics. That is why this committee investigation and the more than 700 submissions that have come from the public, along with the heartfelt content of those submissions, are very important. We have got to break the lassitude of the big parties that say: `The ABC is okay. Kick it when you are in government; support it and complain about the way in which it is treated when you are in opposition.'
I support the recommendations of Senator Allison that the ultimate responsibility for appointments should reside with the minister—that was a common finding from people's submissions—that there should be advertising for board positions before a committee is set up to select members for those positions so that the widest cross-section of Australians can know that board positions are available and that expertise required on the board can be sought in any particular application for a vacant membership on board. 
However, I want to put it strongly that the British model, which involves an officer from the Commissioner of Public Appointments, used to appoint BBC board members is the best. That is at arm's length from politics and it is up and working. It is not just for the BBC but for a whole range of national boards serving the national interest in Britain. If they can do it there, we can do it here. So I think we should have had a response in this report to that British model—a more thoroughgoing look at it and a better appreciation of it so that we could be recommending it to the parliament as the model we should be using not only for the ABC board but also for other boards being appointed to serve in the national interest.
On behalf of the Greens, I have also recommended in my additional comments to this report that the chair of the board be elected by the board. That is pretty commonsense. It does mean that you get cohesion on the board and it does mean in the main that you will find that it will be somebody with experience on the board that gets elected from time to time to chair it—very important if you are going to have cohesion and therefore get the best results for the ABC out of its board.
I have made a recommendation that came from the staff. You, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman will know that there have been upheavals in the ABC since the Howard government came to office such as we have not seen before. We have seen them before, but I think this is unprecedented. The recommendation that there should be two, rather than one, staff of the ABC elected on a preferential Hare-Clark voting system by the staff of the ABC is a very strong one. I think that would add to the strength of the board of the ABC and would also improve enormously those fractured relationships which have arisen since the appointment of Mr Shier to his position and the consequent changes—rapid changes, very often without consultation—that have occurred within the staff and the hierarchy of the ABC.
I have also recommended on behalf of the Greens that the guidelines or criteria for selection of board members be drawn up in consultation with the board. It is much better if there is a consultation process there when a committee meets to select board members so that you can get exactly the qualities needed in a board member that is to be appointed to fill a vacancy—for example, expertise in technology, expertise in broadcasting itself, expertise in whatever area it may be that the board has become short on.
Finally, the failure of the current board to offer any submission or advice to this inquiry is unacceptable. It was more than remiss that the board itself failed to present a submission to this inquiry into the future of the board. One does not have to have a great deal of knowledge about how boards are working to say that that itself points to a shortcoming in the board—a defensiveness at best but more likely a political statement from the board saying that it is not going to cooperate with a Senate committee, it is not going to be positive about it, it is not going to feed into it, it does not believe in this sort of public process and it is going to pull up the drawbridge. That is not a positive attitude coming from the current board—or at least the majority of the current board—of the ABC. It is very remiss and a slight on the Senate that the board of the ABC failed to put in a submission and failed to make any points which could help the committee in coming to their findings.
There is a general failure here from the big parties and from the board to be constructive in coming up with a way forward which is going to give the public the confidence in the ABC that it so freely is willing to give, that it wants to give but under current circumstances feels that it does not have, simply because the ABC has not been run as well as it should be. The ABC has been put under extreme political pressure. It has not been funded properly. Appearances are very important in this. There has been an appearance of great instability and dissatisfaction not only within the ABC but within the public that subscribes to it, that upholds it and that holds it in enormous kudos as an important part of the fabric of this nation.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-25,"—One of the difficulties with appointments is trying to distinguish a different process for the ABC board and every other part of government. That is where the larger political parties part ways with the minors.
—The ABC is not a part of government.
—It should not be. Senator Brown interpolates that the ABC is not part of government. A lot of things are not part of government, but that is part of the tradition of executive government. But I do acknowledge the problems that exist in the ABC, the ABC board and the ABC management, all of which over the last 10 to 20 years can be attributed to inadequate appointments to the ABC board over that time. The current board is weighted heavily in a political way.
I said when Mr Michael Kroger was appointed to the ABC board that I welcomed his appointment. I did so because I think having one partisan political heavy on the board is no problem, because that person is often the one designated to go off and talk to government on behalf of the ABC board. So having one like that is fine. It is when you put a whole range of other toadies on the board that there is no drive in the ABC. They then go out and pick a sleeper as ABC manager—and what happens? We have seen what happens: the ratings are going through the floor. No-one is saying that the ABC should just be ratings driven, but it is one indicator, and it is an indicator that they themselves have adopted.
But what do we get? They get the opportunity, for instance—and I am sure that Mr Acting Deputy President will agree with me on this—to telecast the cricket from England for a couple of hours a night—and what do we see? We see the 55th re-run of Fawlty Towers instead. When you look at ABC Radio's football coverage on Friday and Saturday nights during the cricket season you see their overall ratings got the big boost. All of the cricket fans had to listen to the radio, so both their football and their cricket ratings rocketed up. ABC TV missed those sorts of opportunities.
This is a welcome report. It is one that we will not adopt holus-bolus, but it is one that we should at least give some serious consideration to, because there is something rotten at the ABC. It is failing, and it is failing to deliver big-time. You have got to sheet home responsibility, and the responsibility for the failure lies with the board and with the management. I do not know how you can restructure an organisation and pay out so much in redundancy and then at the other end have even more people there being paid even more money. What has happened? The average ratings of ABC TV apparently have gone from 18 per cent to 12 per cent. You despair some nights when you turn on the ABC to try to find a program worth watching, yet it does fill a tremendous niche in this country. I am sure we will need to discuss this matter further, so if there are no other contributors I will seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-25,"—I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on methods of appointment to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's board, entitled Above Board?, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee, and move that the report be printed. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On 27 June this year, the Senate referred the following matter to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by 25 September 2001: 
The development and implementation of options for methods of appointment to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that would enhance public confidence in the independence and representativeness of the ABC as the national broadcaster. 
The committee advertised the inquiry in national newspapers on 7 and 8 July 2001, on the committee's home page on the Internet and by letters to organisations and individuals with an interest in the inquiry. The committee received 720 written submissions. The committee also held a public hearing in Parliament House on Monday, 20 August. Three conclusions emerged from the inquiry. First, since the inception of the ABC the party in government has appointed people to the board who are sympathetic to the views of the governing party—although this is not to say that appointees to the board have been either incompetent or ineffective in serving the interests of the ABC or the public. Second, it is abundantly clear from the large number of submissions that there is a strong public perception that the board is not independent. Third, it is vital to the credibility of the ABC as the national public broadcaster that both the board and the corporation be independent in fact and perception. The ABC is a key element in effective democracy in Australia and in its role of independent commentator every effort must be made to strengthen its independence.
In the light of these conclusions, the report recommends introducing a system characterised by the principles of transparency and merit. To give effect to these principles, the chair's report recommends a model of board appointments along the following lines:
1.	An ad-hoc Independent Selection Committee ... be brought together for the purposes of selecting a member ... and recommend a short list ... for the Minister to consider.
2.	Selection criteria ... be drafted by the Merit Protection Commissioner.
3.	The Merit Protection Commissioner be an ex-officio member of the Committee, to provide expertise and advice to the Committee in its deliberations.
4.	The ABC Board vacancy be advertised in the national press and via ABC services ... inviting applications from interested persons.
5.	Those wishing to be considered for appointment to the ABC Board must provide a written application addressing the selection criteria, and a statement disclosing political affiliation. Candidates shall be made aware that their applications will be made public.
	...	...	...
7.	The Minister retains the responsibility for appointments to the ABC Board and is not obliged to choose any of the candidates recommended by the Committee. However, the Minister must not select a candidate who has not first been scrutinised by the Committee.
The chair's report also makes several recommendations designed to enhance the transparency and responsiveness of the ABC board, as follows:
1.	... the Board shall elect a Chair and Deputy Chair.
2.	the ABC Board shall hold a public Annual General Meeting ...
3.	The ABC Board should appoint a member to be a formal liaison officer to the National Advisory Council.
4.	The ABC National Advisory Council shall meet four times per year, at times to coincide with the meetings of the ABC Board.
5.	The ABC Board shall publish information about their activities and decisions, including summaries of minutes to Board meetings.
I note that the government and ALP reports disagree with those recommendations, but I draw the attention of these parties to the widespread unease which gave rise to so many submissions and suggest that the problems which led to this inquiry will not go away. I urge whoever is in government after the next election to seriously revisit this matter. I seek leave to incorporate the speaking notes of my colleague Senator Vicky Bourne. I understand there is agreement with the whips to do this. 
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
This Senate inquiry commenced as an indirect result of my private senator's bill on appointments to the ABC Board.  
Since I introduced that Bill in March 1999, the issue of ABC Board appointments has been placed firmly on the political agenda.

This perception goes further.  ABC audiences are also extremely concerned that the ABC Board is too close to government - both by ideology and by personal acquaintance.  
Whether this perception is real or otherwise - it is very strong. So strong in fact, that over 700 people wrote to the Committee to express their concern about the Board.  They also expressed a very strong desire that a parliamentary committee should have the responsibility for making those appointments - or at least providing the minister with advice on whom to appoint, even if the Minister retains the final approval. 
As we would all be aware, the issue of Board appointments was raised by the Senate in its inquiry into the management and operations of the ABC in 1994, 1995.

It needs to provide its services to Australia as the best producer of information for Australians about the news of the day, current affairs, Australian culture and, indeed, the identity of this nation. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation not only does a brilliant job but is the only organisation in the field that can do that job. Commercial broadcasting outlets simply cannot because of the very nature of their corporate enterprise.
That said, it is a pity that the big parties have once again determined to do nothing much at all here. The Labor Party, in particular, which is critical of the chair's report, has not come up with any strong alternative. Labor members simply say, `If you give enough money to the ABC, it does not matter much who is on there, they will do the right thing.' It is very important that the ABC board be seen to be at arm's length from politics—that it not just provide a balance of Labor and Liberal politics but be at full arm's length from politics. That is why this committee investigation and the more than 700 submissions that have come from the public, along with the heartfelt content of those submissions, are very important. We have got to break the lassitude of the big parties that say: `The ABC is okay. Kick it when you are in government; support it and complain about the way in which it is treated when you are in opposition.'
I support the recommendations of Senator Allison that the ultimate responsibility for appointments should reside with the minister—that was a common finding from people's submissions—that there should be advertising for board positions before a committee is set up to select members for those positions so that the widest cross-section of Australians can know that board positions are available and that expertise required on the board can be sought in any particular application for a vacant membership on board. 
However, I want to put it strongly that the British model, which involves an officer from the Commissioner of Public Appointments, used to appoint BBC board members is the best. That is at arm's length from politics and it is up and working. It is not just for the BBC but for a whole range of national boards serving the national interest in Britain. If they can do it there, we can do it here. So I think we should have had a response in this report to that British model—a more thoroughgoing look at it and a better appreciation of it so that we could be recommending it to the parliament as the model we should be using not only for the ABC board but also for other boards being appointed to serve in the national interest.
On behalf of the Greens, I have also recommended in my additional comments to this report that the chair of the board be elected by the board. That is pretty commonsense. It does mean that you get cohesion on the board and it does mean in the main that you will find that it will be somebody with experience on the board that gets elected from time to time to chair it—very important if you are going to have cohesion and therefore get the best results for the ABC out of its board.
I have made a recommendation that came from the staff. You, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman will know that there have been upheavals in the ABC since the Howard government came to office such as we have not seen before. We have seen them before, but I think this is unprecedented. The recommendation that there should be two, rather than one, staff of the ABC elected on a preferential Hare-Clark voting system by the staff of the ABC is a very strong one. I think that would add to the strength of the board of the ABC and would also improve enormously those fractured relationships which have arisen since the appointment of Mr Shier to his position and the consequent changes—rapid changes, very often without consultation—that have occurred within the staff and the hierarchy of the ABC.
I have also recommended on behalf of the Greens that the guidelines or criteria for selection of board members be drawn up in consultation with the board. It is much better if there is a consultation process there when a committee meets to select board members so that you can get exactly the qualities needed in a board member that is to be appointed to fill a vacancy—for example, expertise in technology, expertise in broadcasting itself, expertise in whatever area it may be that the board has become short on.
Finally, the failure of the current board to offer any submission or advice to this inquiry is unacceptable. It was more than remiss that the board itself failed to present a submission to this inquiry into the future of the board. One does not have to have a great deal of knowledge about how boards are working to say that that itself points to a shortcoming in the board—a defensiveness at best but more likely a political statement from the board saying that it is not going to cooperate with a Senate committee, it is not going to be positive about it, it is not going to feed into it, it does not believe in this sort of public process and it is going to pull up the drawbridge. That is not a positive attitude coming from the current board—or at least the majority of the current board—of the ABC. It is very remiss and a slight on the Senate that the board of the ABC failed to put in a submission and failed to make any points which could help the committee in coming to their findings.
There is a general failure here from the big parties and from the board to be constructive in coming up with a way forward which is going to give the public the confidence in the ABC that it so freely is willing to give, that it wants to give but under current circumstances feels that it does not have, simply because the ABC has not been run as well as it should be. The ABC has been put under extreme political pressure. It has not been funded properly. Appearances are very important in this. There has been an appearance of great instability and dissatisfaction not only within the ABC but within the public that subscribes to it, that upholds it and that holds it in enormous kudos as an important part of the fabric of this nation.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-25,"—One of the difficulties with appointments is trying to distinguish a different process for the ABC board and every other part of government. That is where the larger political parties part ways with the minors.
—The ABC is not a part of government.
—It should not be. Senator Brown interpolates that the ABC is not part of government. A lot of things are not part of government, but that is part of the tradition of executive government. But I do acknowledge the problems that exist in the ABC, the ABC board and the ABC management, all of which over the last 10 to 20 years can be attributed to inadequate appointments to the ABC board over that time. The current board is weighted heavily in a political way.
I said when Mr Michael Kroger was appointed to the ABC board that I welcomed his appointment. I did so because I think having one partisan political heavy on the board is no problem, because that person is often the one designated to go off and talk to government on behalf of the ABC board. So having one like that is fine. It is when you put a whole range of other toadies on the board that there is no drive in the ABC. They then go out and pick a sleeper as ABC manager—and what happens? We have seen what happens: the ratings are going through the floor. No-one is saying that the ABC should just be ratings driven, but it is one indicator, and it is an indicator that they themselves have adopted.
But what do we get? They get the opportunity, for instance—and I am sure that Mr Acting Deputy President will agree with me on this—to telecast the cricket from England for a couple of hours a night—and what do we see? We see the 55th re-run of Fawlty Towers instead. When you look at ABC Radio's football coverage on Friday and Saturday nights during the cricket season you see their overall ratings got the big boost. All of the cricket fans had to listen to the radio, so both their football and their cricket ratings rocketed up. ABC TV missed those sorts of opportunities.
This is a welcome report. It is one that we will not adopt holus-bolus, but it is one that we should at least give some serious consideration to, because there is something rotten at the ABC. It is failing, and it is failing to deliver big-time. You have got to sheet home responsibility, and the responsibility for the failure lies with the board and with the management. I do not know how you can restructure an organisation and pay out so much in redundancy and then at the other end have even more people there being paid even more money. What has happened? The average ratings of ABC TV apparently have gone from 18 per cent to 12 per cent. You despair some nights when you turn on the ABC to try to find a program worth watching, yet it does fill a tremendous niche in this country. I am sure we will need to discuss this matter further, so if there are no other contributors I will seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2001-09-25,"—I move:
That, on Tuesday, 25 September 2001:
	(a)	the hours of meeting shall be 2 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. to adjournment;
	(b)	the routine of business from 7.30 p.m. shall be government business only; and
	(c)	the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed at midnight.
The purpose of this motion is to invite the Senate to sit tonight until midnight to progress the government's program. We appreciate the cooperation we have received from the Senate to date, particularly in sitting last night, but in view of the weight of the program, and particularly the difficulties with transport at the moment, we would like to make as much progress in the earlier stages of the week as is possible. Therefore, we would like the Senate to sit until midnight to further progress the migration package. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,20,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-25,"—I will not speak for long on this, but I think it appropriate to have a brief debate to at least highlight again the steps of the process that we are going through, particularly in relation to pushing seven different migration bills through this place. That is predominantly what this motion is about—to make us sit until midnight tonight to again try to ensure that the migration bills, three of which were introduced only six days ago, are passed through this chamber.
I have a number of times expressed the Democrats' concern in relation to that process. I will not repeat that, but it is worth noting the lengths the government is willing to go to. There are about 50 bills listed on the Notice Paper that the government theoretically wants to get passed in what will be the final week of sittings before the election, with no particular indication of exactly what we are dealing with. I understand there has been a meeting of leaders and whips which may have honed that somewhat, with a few potentially pleasing developments about what we may or may not proceed with in the final couple of days. 
But that does not negate the fact that there are some very significant matters in the migration bills. In a sense, it is positive that we are getting extra time tonight, because it does provide extra time for us to at least start some sort of examination of the detail of that legislation. I anticipate there will be some likelihood of debate on the legislation being guillotined at some stage, which no doubt I will protest profusely about at the time, though in a measured way. Nonetheless we think it appropriate to highlight what is happening here and indicate our opposition to it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,20,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-25,"—Just briefly, I am replacing Senator Carr because I had to sit here for an hour waiting for this to come on, and why waste a two-minute speech? The opposition will support the motion. It does give an extra four hours and 10 minutes, if you calculate it the right way, for the committee stage tonight. I think that is absolutely essential. The Labor Party has always taken the view, and the minor parties know it, that we would support these bills to fruition in this week. People know that. Therefore in relation to the arguments about how much time you have to debate it or expose us, do whatever you like. We are in the business of maximising that as much as possible.
Senator Bartlett mentioned a possible guillotine. Who knows? The one thing we can say to the minors, as always, is that we never gag guillotines. You always get a chance to have your say. But you have to learn the procedures if you want to maximise that, and I am staying mum on that particular subject.
We have had this debate quite a few times this week. The argument has been constantly put from this side that we need some form, some understanding of where we are going. I was not a participant in the meeting that occurred earlier this afternoon, but it seems to me there is a bit of turkey on everyone's plate, which is the right way to approach motions when there is such pressure on the legislative program as there currently is. I hope that we can maximise the amount of legislation passed and omit one or two bills that both the Labor Party and the Democrats and Greens—maybe not conjointly but independently—find obnoxious. The government also, though, will obviously have some priority bills. The opposition will cooperate with this as much as possible, I think it is true to say. 
I repeat that we have always said we will pass these migration bills. If it requires a guillotine in the end to do so, we will not gag it but we will support that guillotine, as I understand it, maximising the amount of time that opponents of these bills will have. I add that we will never support a guillotine that takes away the right to move amendments and have those amendments voted on as this chamber has done on other occasions. We had a showdown on that a few years ago. Tactically, we won that argument. I do not think we will ever have to go through it again. I hope not. 
That is putting it as honestly as we can. There are some wins for the minors; there are some losses. I suggest that we carry this motion and get on with the debate on the committee stage of the bills. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,20,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-25,"—I do not support the motion, but I am not going to hold it up either. I do not support the motion because we have taken part in a sham here, which is the government's wish to push a huge list of bills, including the seven migration bills, through the Senate this week so it can get off and have an election called later in October. We know that the parliamentary sittings have been changed to facilitate that, but there has been no debate about it here. There has been no government explanation about it. We simply know that the Senate recess coming up is three weeks, not two weeks, to allow that to happen. 
The Senate is owed an explanation by the executive: we are not run by the executive here; we are in control of our own destiny. This is the house of the people in many ways. It is at least the backstop to the House of Representatives, where there is a majority government that effectively makes decisions in the Prime Minister's suite about when parliament will or will not sit. That may be, but I expect a mature government to come in and say, `We have decided that the parliament will not be sitting in the next week scheduled, in October, because we are going to take the nation to an election.' Then we will all know where we stand. 
We have a debate here because the government says we have to get these bills through in the interests of the nation. That is what we should be putting first. That is not the case, though. There is this sort of shadow boxing or deceit about having to get these through this week when we have four or five weeks of sittings scheduled to come.
Let us be clear about it. This is being done to facilitate the government's election agenda. I am not against that if there is an election occurring and the Prime Minister can tell the nation what the date is, instead of keeping it in his office while manipulating the sittings of parliament. I do not think that is good form. I will be interested to see what comes up on the schedule. There are mightily important pieces of legislation there. I referred earlier to the regional forest agreement. I would like to see that axed. I am not very good with an axe but, if the government were to take to that piece of legislation with the sort of chainsaw it is taking to the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere at the moment, then it might be getting a bit more support. It is good to see Senator Hill here because, as Minister for the Environment and Heritage, he has not stood in the way of those chainsaws. He probably has the wit and wisdom on this occasion to see that the regional forest agreement is bad news this week—very bad news indeed. Certainly, my constituency will not have a bar of that being put through this place on the run. 
I would like to know now from the leader of the government, Senator Hill—who is in the chair—which pieces of legislation are on the agenda and which pieces are not. I would like to see that one taken off for a proper debate a little further down the line. As far as the migration bills are concerned, I am not here to delay them either. We have a number of amendments. I have spoken strongly in the second reading debate. I will do so also on those amendments but I recognise that fate has caught up with immigration law in this country. The government, the opposition and One Nation have the numbers in here to put through that range of policies. The Democrats and I have taken a different point of view. It is indeed pointless to have that run for days, at the present juncture. Let us debate it maturely, let us be matter of fact about it, let us be expeditious, if you like, but let us not overlook the gravity of the changes to law, including international law, involved in those pieces of legislation.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,20,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2001-09-25,"—I want to speak on the matter very briefly. I want to put on the record that, whilst I note that this is about the tabling of statements and related documents in relation to works already approved within the parliamentary zone for Reconciliation Place, I have examined the statements and the process that has been gone through and the progress to date, and I want to strongly stress my concerns about the way in which the government has supposedly undertaken consultation, not just with indigenous people but right across the board. The proposal has had credible and highly respected people involved at various points, including Dr Evelyn Scott and Mr Ian Spicer, and Ms Matilda House and Agnes Shea, who are both Ngunnawal people and both elders. They were all asked about their views of the concept in relation to the works that have been approved, particularly about the proposal to put in place five slivers at Reconciliation Place, as the first part of a project going over a longer period of time.  
In turning to the slivers themselves, I find it extraordinary that the outcomes do not seem to bear out the variety of views that have been expressed by Australians on the matter of reconciliation. I do not want to be antagonistic to the project because I think that it does enjoy support amongst people, but the theme of one of the five slivers is the theme of separation; it is not about removal or about the stolen generations. Beyond the steering committee, there is a faint mention of the role of Reconciliation Australia and the small reference group, but given that this is a project of national importance, it seems to me that questions need to be asked about who else has been consulted, over what period of time, how the consultation was undertaken, whether it was broad, how the themes were arrived at and why there is an apparent rush to complete the themes in the project when it is apparent that very few people have been asked about their views in relation to this project.
Given last year's acrimonious debate on reconciliation and the stolen generations, and as a result of a range of matters, including a committee that I participated in, the government in this case seems to have resorted to writing its own form of history. Why is it that history is rationalised and minimised to reflect a very singular view, in order to distort the facts of the history of removal? Appropriate consultation should be undertaken and I would encourage the government that there is still time to be able to do that, to talk to more people who have not been spoken about, to make sure that whatever the end project reflects, it is something human that reflects the story of all of the peoples and reflects the stories of the members of the stolen generations.
But it seems to me, given the Prime Minister's commitment to practical reconciliation, that Reconciliation Place itself was essentially meant to be a unifying symbol of the nation and an opportunity for the nation to celebrate reconciliation itself. But I wonder how goodwill can be shown in this case if consultation has been sparse, to say the least. I encourage the government to take that issue on board because it has certainly been the subject of talk, that there has not been enough consultation and people have not been asked their views about this. Whilst this may be worth while and will perhaps cost in the millions, the appropriate work needs to be put in to make sure that the end outcome is one that reflects the views of all people. If it is appropriate I will seek leave to continue my remarks later.
 (Senator McKiernan)—Prior to calling you, Senator Brown, I will take advice from Senator Ridgeway. Is it your intention, Senator Ridgeway, to keep the matter in continuation or can it be resolved now, which is the question before the Senate?
—The intention is to keep the matter ongoing rather than being resolved now. 
—Thank you.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,Parliamentary Zone,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-25,"—I too will be very brief. I am concerned about two things. Firstly, the lack of consultation to which Senator Ridgeway has drawn our attention. I have also had news that in the establishment of the earthworks for Reconciliation Place—for those who do not know, it is between Old Parliament House and the lake; so, if you look from the front door of this place or from Old Parliament House down to the lake, it is being established right next to the lake—there was a protest by Aboriginal people there and one of the protesters was run over in the course of what was a pretty nasty incident. I think it would be good for the government at this juncture to be reporting on that. It would be very worth while for the government to be giving us a report on what led to that event and on how that could come to be.  
Secondly, I am not able to give good comment on the aesthetics or the symbolism of Reconciliation Place, but it should be just that—what the name says. Senator Ridgeway has pointed out that there has been insufficient consultation. That must be altered. I want to finish with a comment I made a couple of months ago when this matter was first brought to the attention of the Senate. I have never known of the establishment of a memorial or a commemoration or a celebration of an event in history by a government when that event has not yet occurred. We have not got reconciliation in this country. Putting in Reconciliation Place, which is a piece of symbolism by the government, should be very secondary to the achievement of reconciliation itself, and there the government has done very poorly.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2001-09-25,"—I just wanted to clarify so that the matter can be resolved. I understand that I may have used the incorrect terminology. I was seeking to adjourn the matter, not necessarily to prevent the motion from being dealt with.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-09-25,"—I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001 and six other related bills. These bills are about protecting Australia's shores from being entered illegally. A clear message must be sent to countries from which illegal boat people leave that Australia is no longer an easy target and that unauthorised arrival on Australian shores is not a quick passport to a permanent visa. Australia must take a firm stand. We must not have people arriving in this country without the relevant visas and documentation. I believe it is necessary to have excised specific offshore places such as Christmas Island, the territories of Ashmore, Cartier and Cocos Island and the relevant Australian sea and resource installations. This has to happen as quickly as possible, and to that extent Pauline Hanson's One Nation supports the legislation.
Coming ashore at these places should not automatically ensure illegal entrants the right to queue jump ahead of those people who have waited their turn and who have entered through the correct channels. By excising these territories, Australia puts in place a migration zone which does not in any way, shape or form impact on the rights of those Australian citizens or residents in the areas to be excised for the purposes of migration. This zone effectively puts a stop to illegal boat people applying for a visa while they remain within the migration zone. An illegal entrant into the migration zone who does not hold a valid visa is an unlawful citizen.  
It is necessary to take a very firm stand with regard to the people smugglers to deter them from accepting people as cargo and putting people's lives at risk in unseaworthy vessels. These vessels generally do not have clearance to leave their ports to come legally to Australia. They are also generally devoid of the necessary safety items. The Australian government must continue to work with the Indonesian government to disrupt the people smugglers. 
The money collected by the people smugglers is a huge injection into the black economy of Indonesia and, while the Indonesian government may want to curtail it, the people facilitating this smuggling obviously have no intent to comply. We must deal severely with those who knowingly break Australian laws by bringing in illegal boat people. People who commit this offence deserve a lengthy sentence of imprisonment—at least 10 years for the first and only offence. Ten years must mean exactly that—10 years of imprisonment. These people smugglers must not be given a second chance; they must not be given the chance to re-offend. 
The Australian Defence Force or a Commonwealth officer must be given the power to search certain ships or aircraft suspected of carrying illegal entrants. These people may be searched without a warrant, without undue force or being subjected to indignity. An officer of the same sex as the person being searched must carry out a search. Weapons or objects capable of inflicting bodily injury that are identified during these searches must be taken into possession and confiscated. The Australian Defence Force must have the power to turn the boat people back to the port of departure, whether they are within or outside Australia's territorial boarders. 
The Australian Defence Force must be able to, with discretion—as opposed to a mandatory duty—detain a person who is seeking to enter an excised offshore place. They must have the power to remove or place illegal entrants on ships or aircraft and, if necessary, restrain those persons with such force as is considered reasonable providing that human rights standards are met. The Commonwealth must have the power to protect the borders of Australia by ejecting persons if an officer or a member of the Australian Defence Force or a person authorised by the minister reasonably suspects that a person is seeking to enter an excised offshore place and is an unlawful illegal entrant. 
This group of seven migration bills is unprecedented in that these bills give the executive government absolute, unfettered powers. They also, to some degree, create a legal fiction about our borders. Our territorial waters are clearly defined; they are as specified by legislation or regulation. Previously, the protection of Australia's territorial waters has been achieved by Australia enforcing its sovereignty over these territorial waters, and that right of the Australian government must continue. As an example, we need only look at the area between America and Cuba, where the American government continues to enforce its sovereignty over its territorial waters in those areas. Professor Amien Rais of the Australian National University, a leading Muslim and chairman of Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly, is referred to in an article in the Canberra Times of Thursday 20 September entitled `Refugee policy could lead to friction with Indonesia'. That article states:
One of Indonesia's most powerful politicians, Amien Rais, told a Canberra audience yesterday that Australia's policy of detaining boat people could eventually become a source of friction within Indonesia. 
Professor Rais, a leading Muslim and chairman of Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly, told a meeting at the Australian National University that Australia should have a more humanitarian approach to asylum-seekers arriving on its shores.  
	...	...	...
Describing the recent terrorist attacks in New York and Washington as stupid, he said if the US had hard evidence that Osama bid Laden and his followers were responsible,  they should be executed. 
The important section of the article that I would like to highlight reads:
People should understand that not all Muslims are fanatical supporters of terrorism.
The situation regarding illegal boat people will not be resolved unless Australia as a nation addresses the root of the problem. This involves exacting swift and forceful removal of the Taliban, who exist only as a name and not as a religious order. Their vile torture and deprivation of their own people clearly portrays that they have no resemblance to a religious order. Murder by the Taliban has no place in the holy book. The Taliban's intention is to get a temporal power and influence through hate, fear and intimidation, not through the words of God. The world's nations need to be absolutely ruthless in extracting retribution against these zealots. Another root cause of this situation is the fertile soil of our failed global economics. This gives rise to unrest in these suppressed countries, subject to domination by the World Bank or the IMF.
We only have to look at East Timor to see some of the problems that are arising in that region. The East Timorese have been told in no uncertain terms that, in order to qualify for assistance from the IMF for the reconstruction of devastated East Timor, they must capitulate and buy rice from Vietnam. They are not permitted to grow it themselves. In this most extraordinary situation, the obvious questions were asked of the International Monetary Fund by the East Timorese: what if no boats arrive from Vietnam with rice? How will we feed our people? Can we purchase rice from Australia? The answer to that one was very quick—`No; the IMF will provide it from South-East Asia.' So we see clear manipulation of the supply of produce between these countries and the weapon, to ensure compliance with those demands, is the withholding of IMF funding for non-compliance.
Australia should not be using its armed forces to transport illegal boat people. I clarify that by saying that there are more economic ways to move people. Our Navy has a far more important function and that is protection of our borders. It is paramount that the illegal boat people be removed from the Manoora immediately and the Manoora returned to active duty in Western Australian waters.
Australia's singling out of these recent arrivals has inherent dangers. That is, that these ad hoc bills introduce a further centralisation of power to the executive government with no right of redress for a subsequent government other than to repeal or amend the bills at a later date. It is paramount for Australia's long term environmental, economic and fiscal survival that the unrelenting flow of illegal boat people be stemmed due to the drain on Australia's financial ability to assess their refugee status, and to provide housing, food, clothing, medication and welfare for those people. The answer lies in addressing the root causes within countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and elsewhere. These sorely oppressed people deserve the empathy of the developed nations. We would be derelict in our Christian duty if we fail to support these people and continually criticise rather than providing practical solutions. We are meddling in an area involving complex religious and economic issues—that Australians have no comprehension of—where the political players have aspirations. Meddling in such an area is fraught with danger.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-09-25,"—I rise to speak on this package of migration legislation. I find these bills draconian. Obviously, it is very much a poll-driven package that undermines fundamental human rights. They are unnecessary bills and are excessive. They will cause many vulnerable people, who are desperate, more misery and heartache. The ALP is to be condemned for their approach to these bills. Originally, they were vehemently opposed to several of them. We see them flapping around looking for a few votes at the coming federal election. They have decided to line up with the government in the hope that they will actually get some votes at the expense of refugees.  
Their lack of commitment and lack of backbone will probably cost them votes. I say this for two reasons: firstly, because as Australians become more aware of the issues, more aware of what these bills are about, I think they will be appalled at what the ALP have done. I believe the ALP cannot hold to a specific opinion or a decision. Given a slight breeze, they waft around and eventually settle with what is a popular option. 
—Whose bills are they? Where do they come from? No wonder you are on the back bench.
 (Senator McKiernan)—Order!
—As the Australian deliberation process has found, once people have more information and had a chance to discuss the issues, to listen to opinions, their understanding and their opinion changes. After that weekend at Old Parliament House discussing reconciliation, we saw the number of participants who considered reconciliation as being one of the most important issues virtually double. It went from 31 per cent before the weekend began to 63 per cent on the Sunday afternoon. I believe that over time, once more of these issues are understood and we have more details as to what the government and the opposition are doing here relating to asylum seekers and refugees, more and more Australians will be horrified by what their parliament has done.
At the moment the polls are showing that treating refugees harshly is popular, but I think the significant and growing minority the Democrats represent here today will continue to grow. We stand for what is humane treatment of the peoples of the world, particularly those suffering oppression. We stand for what is in line with international treaties, what is required under our constitution concerning the separation of powers specifically for the right to appeal to courts. Speedy passage of appeals through the courts is to be commended but not permitting people the opportunity to have their day in court is certainly not.
Many of the churches support our stand. A statement from the Uniting Church dated 24 September states:
The Synod of the Uniting Church of Victoria meeting today in Victoria unanimously voted to express its deep concern at both the Federal government's and the Australian Labor Party's treatment of and the attitude towards asylum seekers.
It goes on to talk about, in a recommendation debated without dissent, the church expressing its concern at the haste with which the legislation has been introduced. The Reverend David Pargeter, social justice director of the Uniting Church of Victoria, said in his moving of the recommendations that he `was finding it difficult to find any sophisticated arguments to understand the way asylum seekers were being treated in this debate'. He said:
When our main political parties are not prepared to lose an election over 600 refugees, well, I think they have lost their integrity.
We are all appalled at the terrorist acts in the United States on 11 September. Indeed, that date will be etched into the world's calendar. I believe it will be a day, for generations, on which people will stop and remember those who lost their lives. And, yes, we must now work at an international level to stop terrorism but this legislation is not about stopping terrorism: it is simply an attack on refugees and asylum seekers. It is about demonising them. Yes, we did have about 4,000 people arrive by boat seeking asylum last year but around the country we have about 50,000 people illegally overstaying their visas. Many of them are probably working illegally yet our government seems to have no interest in vilifying them.
This legislation is supposed to send a message that these refugees are not welcome and that therefore—as the government theory goes—people in Afghanistan or Iraq will be deterred or persuaded not to come. The situation for many in those countries is absolutely desperate. They are not sitting at home in their lounge rooms with their feet up watching the coverage on TV of boat people found off Christmas Island being forcibly sent off to Nauru after quite a few days sitting in the sun on the deck of a Norwegian boat. The ABC's FourCorners program about life under the Taliban in Afghanistan, which aired two weeks ago, should be shown again and again. It should be compulsory viewing for anyone who argues that people fleeing the Taliban—especially women—are not genuine refugees.  
Life in Afghanistan, particularly for women and children, is appalling. Indeed, it is so appalling it is difficult to describe when one only has words. Three-quarters of all children in Afghanistan have lost an adult relative in the four years of Taliban rule. Women are forbidden to work—indeed, they are not even supposed to leave their homes without a male relative. They have no access to education; they have no access to medical treatment because they are only permitted to see female doctors and the female doctors are prohibited from practising medicine—prohibited from working.
No-one who was seen this program will ever forget the faces of one woman's children. Unable to work, the woman was forced to beg for mouldy bread that was being sold as animal food. The mother scraped off the mould, then ground the bread until it resembled sawdust and fed it to her seven children. Then there was the footage of the football field, a gift from the international community to the people of Afghanistan. It has been turned into a public execution area. Women were led, blindfolded, into the stadium, as hundreds of people looked on, and forced to kneel on the dusty ground and were then shot in the head. There were dead men hanging from the goal posts.
A representative from Doctors Without Borders on Friday evening's PM program described the situation in Afghanistan after three years of drought. She said: 
... a large number of people are dependent either on food aid, or on money which relatives send to them from outside of Afghanistan in order for them to buy food because there's no cultivation or agriculture going on at the moment, of course, because of the drought.
She continued: 
If the NGO's are not there to support the hospitals and clinics, there's only the private health system which exists, which in itself is not really a system—it's just a few rogue doctors or pretend doctors who sell drugs in the bazaar, in the marketplace.
She said: 
They're very vulnerable people physically, nutritionally. There's no ability to respond to an epidemic, for example if there was an outbreak of cholera or any other epidemic, there's no-one able to respond.
When asked by a journalist if there is a danger of a mass humanitarian crisis, she replied: 
Well I think there already was. That's the message I'd like people to understand. There already is a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan ...
For a rich industrialised country like Australia to be wasting so much time, so much money and so much energy to have the legal right to reject a boatload of desperate individuals from Afghanistan seems absurd to me, and it certainly seems absurd to my Democrats colleagues in the Senate as well. To answer some of the critics—such as the previous speaker—who say that they should all just go and queue, there is no queue in Afghanistan or indeed in most of these countries—in Iraq and Iran, for example. 
There was no queue in Vietnam, either, after the war ended there. At that time, and we are now going back to the early eighties, there was some opposition about Asian refugees—Vietnamese boat people—coming here. But they were welcomed by the government. They were offered support and there were no detention centres. My family—we were living in Mount Gambier at the time—was among those families who supported Vietnamese families. They came and lived with us, and we helped them to adjust to their new country and to the Australian way of life. The Vietnamese boat people took enormous risks—just as the Afghani, Iraqi and Iranian refugees and others are taking similar huge risks today. The estimate is that as many as 50 per cent of the Vietnamese boat people perished on their way to freedom and a better life. Many Vietnamese paid to get on a boat and/or they paid pirates at sea for safe passage. Most of them arrived here with only the clothes that they stood up in. I stress here that this is not how committed terrorists, bent on destruction and chaos, would come. They would be, or perhaps already are, amongst those who have overstayed or who, in the future, are planning to overstay, tourist or student visas. 
Most of those Vietnamese boat people are now Australians. They have settled here, they are valued members of our community and their children are now young adults who, looking at the results, have done extremely well at school. Many went on to university and are now our young professionals. The vast majority of refugees from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan have been found to be genuine. They are not falsifying papers. They are not telling stories; they are not lying. They are genuine refugees fleeing torture and trauma. They will be staying here.
I ask this place: what sort of introduction is it to their new country to be here under the circumstances that we are forcing upon them—being locked up, being sent to camps ringed by barbed wire and then being bussed to capital cities if they qualify as refugees, with no support and only the charities to rely on, often at all sorts of odd hours of the night? For children in particular this is extremely traumatic. The physical and mental health of refugees, as you read the reports, is frequently very poor as a result of trauma in their country of origin, frequently exasperated by the hardship of their journey and put under further stress in Australia thanks to their treatment, particularly in detention centres. Often as they are released, because they do not qualify for Medicare—they do not qualify for much support at all—the services that they desperately need are simply not available.
The antirefugee phenomenon is not new in Australia; it has been building up over about the last 15 years. It has been well documented by C. Graydon in an article entitled A Decade of Dismay: Good Bye to Refugee Protection, to which I want to refer. If we go back to 1986, it was a Labor government which amended the Citizenship Act to remove citizenship rights to children born in Australia to asylum seeking parents. It was a Labor government in 1992 which introduced mandatory detention. In 1994 Labor removed the right to appeal a refugee decision on a range of grounds. It was Labor in 1995 which imposed a processing freeze on East Timorese refugee applications. The effect of this is that we have still got, about 10 years later, some East Timorese asylum seekers in limbo. So perhaps the stand of Labor today is not quite that much out of character, and I certainly will not be holding my breath waiting for them to change any of these draconian provisions should they happen to win government at the coming federal election.
I would like to go through some other steps that have been taken to show people like Senator Harris that so much has already been done to protect our borders. We have an enormous range of provisions already that makes it extremely difficult for people to even get here, particularly for people to be accepted as genuine. The article says:
1st July 1996 Minister announces a global `quota' system for on and offshore refugee and special humanitarian programs, nominally allocating 2,000 places to onshore refugees and 10,000 to entrance under the offshore Refugee and Special Humanitarian Programs.
Basically, it now became a competition between refugees from various parts of the world to see who could actually get up the list.
20th August 1996 Introduction of a range of processing measures at primary level including: requirement that all claims, evidence and other information be lodged at time of applications; rejection without further inquiries if claims not lodged immediately; no general requirement/expectation of interview; `strict' adherence to letter of codified `natural justice'; adverse information rarely made available to applicant ... 
20th August 1996 Withdrawal of Asylum Seekers Assistance (financial support administered by the Australian Red Cross) after rejection at primary stage. Severe restrictions on payment of asylum seekers assistance to those in exceptional financial hardship before the requisite six month `waiting period' for eligibility has elapsed.
21st March 1997 Minister attacks independence of Refugee Review Tribunal by introducing measures, which include “clearer articulation of my (the minister's) expectations and directions to Tribunal members”.
1st July 1997 Withdrawal of permission to work (and therefore access to Medicare) to anyone who does not apply for refugee status within 45 days of arrival in Australia.
1st July 1997 Introduction of $1,000 post application `fee' for unsuccessful applicants to the Refugee Review Tribunal. 
1st July 1997 Announcement that holders of temporary pieces for those from Sri Lanka and former Yugoslavia would not be further extended despite absence of proof of improvement of conditions ...
	...	...	...
Sept 1997 Immigration detention centres (Port Hedland, Villawood-Sydney, Maribyrnong-Melbourne, Perth) privatised and contracts awarded to ... a subsidiary of Wackenhut Corrections Corporation.
1st May 1998 Tightening of character requirements legislation, reversing the onus of proof so that visa applicants are required to show they are of good character. Legislation, unprecedented throughout the Commonwealth, requirement that any character cases heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must be decided within a 45 day period or the applicant automatically loses.
And so it goes on:
8th May 1998 Government tables Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report ... in Parliament on the same day as the Federal budget is handed down. The report found that conditions in Villawood and Perth detention centres breached Article 7 of the ICCPR which prohibits torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
1st July 1998 Removal of eligibility for Legal Aid for all asylum seekers, except in cases before the Federal or High Court and then, only in very narrow circumstances.
As we move through we see:
... Removal of eligibility for bridging visa ...
	...	...	...
1999 Legislation to overcome the Federal Court's decision that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have the power to send a sealed letter to an immigration detainee ...
Basically, what all this means is, yes, people have rights, but they no longer have any way in which they can know what their rights are.
30th April 1999 `Safe Haven' legislation passed by Senate denying holders of safe haven visas—
and they were mainly Kosovars and people from Timor—
the right to seek asylum ...
	...	...	...
26th May 1999 Decision by United Nations Committee Against Torture against Australia that a Somali asylum seeker refused refugee status may face torture and that his proposed return would constitute refoulement and hence a breach of Australia's international obligations under the Convention Against Torture.
It goes on and on. There are another eight on the list here of various actions that the government has taken during 1999 and 2000 to further restrict the rights and opportunities of people who are seeking asylum here. Perhaps the one that really does need mentioning, as I am running out of time, is:
16th Dec 1999 ... the Border Control Amendment Act ... prevents some asylum seekers from even applying for refugee status (those having spent 7 days in another country, are deemed to have a right of return to that country) ... Other amendments fundamentally change the definition of a refugee requiring asylum ...
Early Feb 2000 Reports of asylum seekers held at the remote Curtin Air Base detention centre, protesting—
violently and vehemently against the conditions that they were facing in that detention centre.
Those who would like a full read of this quite lengthy litany of how both Labor and Liberal governments have taken away the rights of asylum seekers can find further details in the report A Decade of Dismay: Good Bye to Refugee Protection. As I said, we already have a process that is very tough on refugees. We are not swamped in Australia; we do not take too many refugees. Indeed, in 2001 we will have the usual amount of about 12,000. Pakistan has about one million Afghani refugees already; it is now letting tens of thousands more across the border with the help of the Red Cross. Iran hosts over a million Afghani refugees. As you move through Africa, you see that countries have hundreds of thousands of refugees. In Tanzania, I think that there is one refugee for every 76 Tanzanians. In Britain, there is one refugee for every 530 Brits. But in Australia we have only one refugee for every 1,583 Australians. I say: enough is enough; this simply is not fair. Surely we should be doing to others as we would have them do to us. I think that as a parliament we will stand in history quite rightly condemned for the legislation we are passing today. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2001-09-25,"—Firstly, I seek leave to incorporate Senator Ridgeway's speech on the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001 and related bills, as he is unable to deliver it at the moment.
 (Senator McKiernan)—Has the speech been circulated?
—Senator Ridgeway has provided us with an outline of the speech. For our part, we have read it and we agree to it being incorporated.
—The position is the same for the government.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Thank you, Madam President,
I also rise tonight to speak against all of the seven bills before the Senate.
As so many speakers from the Australian Democrats before me have said, I consider this to be a shameful moment in Australia's history, where fundamental principles that I thought all Australians held dear are being thoughtlessly and needlessly cast aside by the two old parties.
Tonight we are dealing in one hit with seven pieces of legislation that are not being subjected to proper parliamentary scrutiny, despite the gravity of their purposes, not to mention their international ramifications. 
Tonight's debate—if I can call it that—is a prime example of how politicians can manipulate and indeed abuse the legislative process to achieve a pre-determined outcome. 
It does nothing to counter the growing cynicism that many Australians have towards their parliament. Rather, I am concerned that tonight's proceedings will only go to reinforce the cynicism and disregard that many Australians feel towards one of our foremost democratic institutions.
The need for full parliamentary scrutiny
The parliamentary committee process is a more appropriate vehicle for assessing these Bills than the floor of the Senate.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee has received submissions and commenced hearings on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.6) 2001—which will restrict the definition of persecution for refugees under Australian law—with further hearings planned for October.
I agree with the comments of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission President, Mrs Alice Tay, that “any legislation that proposes to weaken legal rights of vulnerable people must be open to full debate and consideration. It is crucial that these Bills receive proper scrutiny regarding their impact on human rights.”
But it seems that neither the Government or the ALP have enough regard for the views of one of our most respected national agencies which is charged with upholding human rights, equity and social justice in this country.
Both parties have decided to totally ignore the recommendation of the President of HREOC to suspend debate on these 7 bills to allow the Senate Committee to expose the legislation to full public and parliamentary scrutiny.
The need to observe Australia's human rights obligations
I also share the concerns expressed yesterday by the President of HREOC that the restrictive refugee definition proposed in the legislation before us will endanger people genuinely at risk of persecution.
Like the President of HREOC, I too call on members of both parties to have regard to the potential human rights implications of the Bills.
As Mrs Tay pointed out:
“Australia has a core legal obligation under several international human rights instruments not to forcibly return individuals to countries where they face persecution or serious harm.
“Australia also has a specific obligation to protect refugee children. Some of those who arrive in Australia seeking protection are refugee children, who are protected from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment because of Australia's commitments under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Children's lives, health and safety may be at risk if they are not protected by Australia.
“We have international obligations to refugees, but we also have a more fundamental obligation, as a fair and decent country to protect people who are at risk of persecution. We must not reduce our commitment to protecting the lives and safety of people who are genuinely escaping persecution from oppressive regimes.”
But both parties have allowed themselves to be totally intimidated by perceived public opinion. 
They consider it more politically expedient to bend to the perceived power of public opinion polls, when only last week the leaders of both parties were on national radio down-playing the reliability of polls to reflect the true sentiments of the broader community, or to gauge what people would actually do when they entered a polling booth on election day. 
Why are the same polls suddenly such an accurate measure of people's views on how we should handle the migration policy in this country?
Are Australians being asked in these polls whether they support any of the following:
·	The undermining of the Rule of Law so that the powers of the Executive prevail over those of the Parliament in certain migration matters. Are we dealing with lawlessness by being lawless ourselves?
·	The removal of the right of asylum seekers to initiate legal proceedings in Australia when they allege there has been a breach of their human rights.
·	The overturning of basic human rights, such as the right of asylum seekers, to `have the right to liberty and security of the person', and whilst in detention, `to be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person', as required by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
·	The introduction of mandatory sentencing into Federal legislation.
·	Or the denial of asylum seekers who arrive on Christmas Island or any of the proposed `excised zones' to ever apply for refugee status. 
I think if the Government and the ALP were to be honest with Australians and expose these bills to full public scrutiny, the public would be horrified by what some of their elected representatives are seeking to do.
Past PMs are providing Leadership and Statesmanship 
Personally, I think that some of the previous leaders of these two parties are showing themselves to be the true upholders of the principles of liberal democracy and common humanity.
Recent statements by Mr Malcolm Fraser and Mr Gough Whitlam have shown them to be the Statesmen and leaders that their current counterparts seem incapable of being.
As Mr Malcolm Fraser wrote in the SMH last Tuesday, 
The tragedy in the United States must not be allowed to blur the inhumanity of our official attitude to boat people, themselves fleeing oppression and terror. Australians are being led in the wrong direction about asylum seekers.
Of all the Afghan or Iraqi asylum seekers who have come to Australia, more than 80% have been accepted as genuine refugees. So why has the group been demonised so thoroughly and arbitrarily? Is it merely to send a message overseas? No democratic government can act harshly enough against such people to deter them from fleeing desperation, devastation and terror.
When governments pursue policies that negatively impact on the weak and defenceless, those policies become instruments of tyranny. To proclaim that we live in a global world for trade, finance and the ownership of Australian land and assets, but that for some people we must set aside our compassion, involves its own contradiction and obscenity.
Mr Fraser went on to point out that past Australian Governments have, from time to time, not formulated national migration policy on the basis of perceived public opinions. 
As other speakers have reminded us tonight, Australia didn't vote in the 1940s when then immigration minister Arthur Calwell, introduced a major migration program in Australia with the ACTU's support. 
We didn't ask the country on whether they wanted several thousand Italians or Greeks, or nearly 20,000 Vietnamese asylum seekers after the Vietnam War. 
But in Mr Fraser's opinion, if governments had asked, public opinion probably would have been strongly opposed to any increase in migration.
Governments of the day acted contrary to community sentiment because they were convinced that there was a moral and ethical obligation to come to the aid of refugees and immigrants. 
In Mr Fraser's words, “refugees and immigrants came; it was accepted. ... In all these instances, governments provided a lead and Australians accepted that lead. We are a better country as a consequence.”
I also want to make reference to a letter that Eva Cox recently submitted to the Sydney Morning Herald.
In that letter, she referred to an Australian Gallop poll in 1947, which showed that a substantial majority of the population opposed resettlement of Jewish refugees, even after Auschwitz.
Eva Cox writes, 
“ I arrived in (Australia) in 1948, as did thousands of others because the Government had the courage to do the right thing despite public opinion.  
Polls on migration issues like `Asian' immigration have always shown high levels of intolerance and racism, but, fortunately for Australia, governments have not followed populist sentiment. 
May both political parties remember their responsibility for the common good by behaving ethically and not legalistically and let the people land.”
Unfortunately we cannot rely on the ALP in opposition to even make a semblance of protest against the most draconian legislation I think any Australian Parliament has ever been expected to consider. 
Maybe the ALP needs to seek the counsel of their former Leader, Mr Gough Whitlam, who also recently tried to steer his old party back on course on migration policy. 
Mr Whitlam wrote in the Age on 6 September that the Border Protection Bill would be “the most demeaning legislation since Arthur Calwell's war-time Refugees Removal Act and Bob Menzies' Communist Party Dissolution Act”—harsh criticism indeed.
Yet tonight we have a Labor Party that considers this package of seven migration bills so innocuous that none of them need to be fully debated and scrutinised in accordance with regular Senate procedure.
In the same letter in the Age, Mr Whitlam put on the public record the principles of the ALP relating to refugees and asylum seekers, which were agreed to at the 2000 ALP National Conference. 
I'd like to remind the ALP of those principles, and perhaps the ALP will be able to enlighten the Chamber as to how it reconciles its position on these 7 bills with its own policy.
As Mr Whitlam recounted:
“Labor will ensure that Australia's international obligations towards asylum seekers and refugees are met, and Labor will positively promote the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. 
“Refugees, including those who arrive as asylum seekers, and persons admitted under humanitarian programs, some of whom have suffered torture and trauma before arriving in Australia, will receive appropriate support, including counselling for trauma.”
I wonder what Mr Whitlam would be thinking tonight when he looks at the cowardly and callous position that his party has taken towards refugees and asylum seekers—the ease with which it has over-ruled its own policies, in preference for what it appears the most politically expedient option in the lead up to a federal election.
I would imagine that he is profoundly disappointed, perhaps even ashamed. 
Ashamed that Australia has so thoroughly undermined our decades of hard work and leadership in the field of international human rights protection and advocacy.
International damage to Australia's reputation
As someone who attended the World Conference Against Racism earlier this month in Durban, South Africa, I can assure Senators that serious damage has been done to Australia's international reputation already—before these Bills before us tonight were even drawn up.
Condemnation of Australia's perceived inhumanity towards the 460 people aboard the Tampa leapt to the top of the pre-conference agenda and prompted what I regard as scathing criticism from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Mary Robinson.
She had the following to say to the international media in attendance at the conference:
“It's very worrying that a country with a fine tradition like (Australia) would be unable to reach out to people who are suffering like that. 
“Australia has a very fine tradition of being concerned with the problems of boat people in that region, and I hope that the Australian people will be able to put pressure on the Australian Government.”
Refugee policies in other countries
So let's look at how the rest of the world deals with refugees and asylum seekers.
The United States, for example, has to deal with a long, uncontrollable border with Mexico. There are more than 3 million Mexicans in the US without official papers. President Bush believes that they should be accepted and allowed to work. 
By contrast, the few thousands who have sought refuge in Australia, or the 12,000 places that we allocate to refugees, appear small. 
They are certainly not figures that in international terms—or relative to our national population of less than 20 million—that could be described as “overwhelming” or the equivalent of a “deluge”, as some media commentators have tried to suggest.
The need for a comprehensive, long-term Government response
The Australian Democrats believe that the responsible course of action for the Australian Government to the current influx of refugees and asylum seekers is to put in place a comprehensive, long-term strategy that is consistent with our international human rights obligations. 
The problem of refugees is the major humanitarian problem of our time. We need an international solution, which is co-ordinated and consistent with accepted international laws and standards.
Some of the principles which the Australian Democrats believe need to be incorporated into an international response include:
·	We should implement a non-discriminatory immigration policy which gives priority to refugees and family reunion.
·	Australia needs to work with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN more generally, and especially with other countries prepared to receive significant numbers of asylum seekers to establish a more uniform international system.
·	The need for the UNHCR to uniformly undertake the assessment of refugee status, and to provide a just appeal system.
·	We should ensure sufficient places are made available in recipient countries so that genuine refugees are not kept in camps for many years without hope.
·	We should cease demonising boat people, and instead tell Australians the truth of their backgrounds. 
·	As recommended by HREOC in report on the detention of unauthorised arrivals in 1992, Australia's policy of mandatory detention should be abolished on the grounds that it is both an unreasonable and a disproportionate response to unauthorised arrivals in Australia. The Democrats have been long-standing advocates of the need to consider alternatives to detention whilst applications for refugee status are being assessed—it works in other countries like Sweden—and we believe it could work in Australia.
·	We should encourage compassion, rather than anger and hostility.
·	We should work co-operatively with the international community to tackle the primary causes that leave people no opportunity but to flee their homes for Australia and elsewhere. These include the despotic regime of the Taliban, and the extreme adverse impact of sanctions on the poor in Iraq.
·	And finally, these policies should be accompanied by stringent internationally co-ordinated strategies to eliminate the people smuggling trade.
In closing 
I want to refer to some of the comments made by Mr Thabo Mbeki, the President of South Africa, in his welcome address a couple of weeks ago to the opening of the NGO Forum at the World Conference Against Racism in Durban.
Everywhere and without exception, race and gender continue to define the actual living spaces that billions of human beings occupy. They dictate the boundaries that frustrate the translation into reality of the noble concepts that people are born equal.
We should not allow ourselves to be diverted by those who are opposed to [the sustained upliftment of those who continue to suffer from racism].
Everything must be done to address the gross racial imbalances that stare us in the face everyday. The first step towards the realisation of this objective is a firm commitment by governments and all of us that we will do everything necessary to work towards this outcome.
These words sum up the motivations of the Australian Democrats tonight, because we believe that many Australians want to see their political representatives take up the fight against racism in this country—whether it be racism against Indigenous Australians, migrants or asylum seekers.
Thank You.
—I rise today to speak in the cognate debate on the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001 and related bills, and in doing so I speak from the perspective of the rights of children. At present, more than 200 children are detained in detention centres around Australia, and recent arrivals mean that there are greater numbers again of children whose wellbeing is subject to the bills we are considering today. By contrast, the children of people who enter Australia on a valid visa—whether it be travel or business—and then claim protection are not usually detained. These children live with their parents in the community while their claims are processed.
Malcolm Fraser recently described the detention centre for asylum seekers near Woomera in South Australia as a `hellhole'. It must not be forgotten that, in committing those who seek shelter from persecution to detention in these hellholes, we are also committing their children to the same fate. A hellhole is no way for a civilised nation to treat children who, along with their parents, are fleeing political persecution and, in Mr Fraser's words, `absolute tyranny'. Apart from the lack of compassion, there is little evidence that the approach is reducing the numbers seeking refuge in Australia, and there is absolute evidence that the welfare of children is being compromised. 
Australia's image as a caring and humane society—consistently the theme in speeches for the Centenary of Federation celebrations earlier this year—is being tested internationally by the extraordinary international concern about the mental, physical and even dental health of the children of asylum seekers and detainees in the Australian detention centre system. The risks of the `one size fits all' policy of detention are especially palpable when it comes to the detention of children. Australia has an obligation to ensure the protection of the special needs of children under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CROC. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Australia, requires in article 37(c) that a child in detention must be treated `in a manner which takes into account the needs of a person of his or her age'. There is observational material which shows that the children in Australia's detention centres are developing very aggressive tendencies because they are not socialised properly and that they are developing other symptoms of trauma, such as bed-wetting. The high levels of distress in the parents increasingly diminish their ability to support children during this process. The manner of detention most certainly does not take into account their social or psychological needs. They see themselves and their parents detained indefinitely, confined, stripped and searched, physically and verbally abused, and denied access to families, lawyers and organisations which could help them. Simply, these children are not getting the special help they need. Where counselling is offered to Australian children traumatised by media reports of world events, confinement is considered appropriate treatment for children traumatised by real life exposure to such events.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report Those who've come across the seas: detention of unauthorised arrivals, which was tabled in this parliament on 12 May 1998, deals with the policy of the mandatory detention of most unauthorised arrivals and the conditions of detention for those detained, including children. The report said that the conditions of detention are inadequate and in violation of human rights when children and other vulnerable people are detained for prolonged periods. The report went on to say that article 37(b) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. Children and other vulnerable people should be detained only in exceptional circumstances. The best interests of the individual child should be the paramount consideration. The Convention on the Rights of the Child also imposes a positive obligation on state parties with regard to both child asylum seekers and refugee children. These children have a right, as per article 22, `to receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of [their] human rights'. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the refugee convention largely define what is appropriate assistance. 
Australia has therefore undertaken an obligation—pursuant to the ICESCR, CROC and the refugee convention and protocol—to protect asylum seekers while their status is being determined and to respect their human rights during that process when they are within Australian territory. Changing the definition of Australian territory does not diminish our international responsibility to children. 
A further treaty ratified by Australia, and directly within HREOC's jurisdiction in the case of asylum seeker children, is the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Essentially, the key provisions of the ICESCR  and the particular protections for children in the Convention on the Rights of the Child are that non-citizens, particularly unauthorised arrivals, are entitled to the benefit of human rights protection and must be assessed. The Convention on the Rights of the Child similarly protects children in particular from arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Article 37(b) provides in part: 
No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily.
It is no answer to say that bridging visas are available for young children by the order of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The minister has no discretion to grant a bridging visa to release the child's parents. A child released from detention would therefore be denied the protection and assistance of his or her parents. This may lead to a breach of article 9.1 of CROC. This explains why only two children out of a possible total of 581 have been released on bridging visas since 1 September 1994.
Australia's own history makes us aware of the social consequences of removing children from their parents. Children have a right to live with and enjoy the protection and assistance of their parents. The preamble to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child acknowledges that `the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment'. Article 9.1 obliges `States Parties to ensure' that children are not separated from their parents against their will, except when it is necessary in the best interests of the child. These provisions clearly apply to children and their families seeking asylum and deprived of their liberty under the Migration Act and the legislation before us.
The convention recognises the rights of children seeking refugee status to education (article 28), recreation (article 31), medical and dental care (article 24) and, in the case of children suffering from torture or trauma, special measures to assist them (article 39). Under current practice, vulnerable groups such as children are detained for lengthy periods. In some cases individuals detained under the Migration Act provisions have been held for periods that vary from less than one month to as many as five years. This is arbitrary detention and cannot be justified on any grounds under these conventions. In summary, the facilities and conditions in detention centres constitute a breach of a number of international treaties on human rights and requirements under our own HREOC Act.
Prior to 1997, detention centres in Sweden faced a similar crisis to Australia's present dilemma. Media attention focused on harsh conditions, the number of suicide attempts and hunger strikes by asylum seekers in detention and, in particular, the inappropriateness of detaining children in such centres. Since 1997, all asylum seekers who arrive in Sweden without documentation have been detained only until their identification has been investigated and verified, which usually lasts from about two weeks to two months and not for the entire duration of the determination process. No child is held in detention for more than three days—and in special circumstances six days. Families who arrive without documentation are moved into group homes.
The Australian Democrats call on the government to immediately consider alternative models, such as those in Sweden, and hopes that this is one step closer towards ending the unnecessarily punitive policy of mandatory detention of certain asylum seekers in Australia  which merely victimises the victims. The Democrats believe that children should not be exposed to conditions as hard as those at Woomera or in other detention centres. This does not mean they should be separated from their parents; rather that the clear message is that better community based accommodation should be provided for them and other asylum seekers who do not present security or criminal threats. Given the serious allegations relating to sexual abuse and the handling of such claims by Australasian Correctional Management, which runs Woomera, the recent call by Malcolm Fraser for a full, impartial and open inquiry is more likely to find the truth than the narrow departmental inquiry which was ordered by the minister, Mr Ruddock. It is imperative that we find a reasonable and safe solution to the treatment of asylum seekers who arrive on our shores. In this heated debate, cool heads must prevail, particularly when dealing with young children.
The other matter I want to briefly address is the entire issue of the government pursuing the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties and their associated lawyers for legal costs arising out of the appeal in respect of the MV Tampa. I now move the second reading amendment which is being circulated in the chamber: 
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate calls on the government to refrain from pursuing legal costs from the applicants or their lawyers involved in the Federal Court actions relating to the people rescued by the MV Tampa”.
It is simply extraordinary that a government would go after such people, volunteer lawyers, who out of the goodness of their own heart are donating their time to ensure that Australia's obligations under international law, the Magna Carta, habeas corpus and all the rest of the various provisions which underpin our common law are met. That such people should actually become the target of a government action for costs is simply extraordinary. Only earlier this year the Attorney-General was actually encouraging lawyers to provide more pro bono legal action and ensuring that lawyers were available so that those who could not be represented were in fact represented.
Only last week in the Sydney Morning Herald, David Marr actually outlined in some detail the extraordinary efforts to which the government went to ensure that the asylum seekers on MV Tampa were denied access to Australian lawyers, because the minute that one of those asylum seekers actually got access to an Australian lawyer they could actually give the instruction that they sought refuge in Australia and then they would have standing. Because of that enormous legal edifice that was put in place to deny them access to Australian lawyers, the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties were forced to put their own people on the line to ensure that these issues came before the courts in Australia and that at least the issue of detention, as opposed to the legality of all the other actions of the government, was addressed by our courts.
It is extraordinary and absolutely appalling that this government, having actually encouraged lawyers to go pro bono and having put out statements time and time again encouraging volunteering by professionals and a whole range of other people, should now seek to pursue such people for the government's costs. It reminds me in many respects of the Canadian government going after the Anglican Church in Canada for the legal costs of defending actions in respect of first nation people in Canada who had reached agreement with the Anglican Church but were actually being pursued by the government for costs.
I really hope that this Senate passes the amendment I have moved to the second reading motion to ensure that the government is put on clear notice that this Senate does not support the pursuit of government actions for costs against pro bono lawyers. We have to make a statement that we believe that volunteer action, whether they be by lawyers, doctors or anybody else, should be encouraged as government policy. That was government policy right up until the minute that the government decided to start using its latest bullyboy tactics against the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties to ensure that the whole issue of lawyers actually trying to defend human rights is prevented in Australia. I commend the amendment to the Senate and I urge the Senate to reject these bills.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-25,"—I rise again at the second reading stage to speak to the amendment which has just been moved by Senator Cherry. I do so because this is an important issue. It is probably worth noting and recording some of the interjections by Senator McGauran in the last contribution. It is fairly rare for me to suggest that any comment of Senator McGauran's is worth noting; I note it solely to make a point in relation to the government's attitude—and Senator McGauran is, of course, a representative of the government. I believe he is deputy whip. He is therefore a senior member and no doubt a mouthpiece for the Prime Minister. The motion moved by Senator Cherry states:
... but the Senate calls on the government to refrain from pursuing legal costs from the applicants or their lawyers involved in the Federal Court actions relating to the people rescued by the MVTampa. 
I will move an amendment to the border protection bill that will put that call into force and will prevent the government from pursuing those costs. I hope that it will get the support of the ALP. If it does not, I would urge them to at least support this second reading amendment, to send a strong message from the Senate that it believes this is completely unacceptable. It is an issue that has probably been lost amongst all the smoke and mirrors, fabrications and distortions from the government in relation to the whole issue of boat people, but it is an important issue in itself. Senator McGauran said to Senator Cherry by way of interjection that the claim was `vexatious'. It would be the first vexatious case I have ever heard of which they actually won in the Federal Court—which they did. It would be the first vexatious claim where one judge on the full bench, the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, agreed with it. That is hardly vexatious. Indeed, Justice French, who was one of the judges that upheld the government's position on the full Federal Court decision, said:  
The council and solicitors acting in the interests of the rescuees—
that is, the asylum seekers on the Tampa—
in this case have evidently done so pro bono. They have acted according to the highest of ideals of the law. They have sought to give voice to those who are per force voiceless.
We have heard from Senator Cherry how great were the lengths the government went to to keep those people voiceless. I return to the quote:
... and on their behalf, these solicitors sought to hold the executive accountable for the lawfulness of its actions. In so doing, even if ultimately unsuccessful in the litigation, they have served the rule of law and the whole community.
That is something that the government dismissed as vexatious. Even a judge who did not support the case put by the Civil Liberties Council was unstinting in praising the role the council performed in giving a voice to the voiceless and holding the executive to account. That is something that goes to the heart of what we have been debating about all these bills and particularly the border protection bill. The government seeks to prevent itself from being held to account by the legal system. It wants to be above the law. Philip Ruddock wants to be Judge Dredd: it is now 2001AD; he wants to be Judge Dredd; he is the law and nothing else matters. That is the situation that the government is trying to put itself in. 
The people who undertook this action have served the rule of law and so have served the whole community. It is typical of this government that it seeks not only to pursue costs against the applicants but also to vilify people who have sought to ensure that the government is held to account. Of course, to ensure that it can escape that scrutiny of law the government has brought forth the border protection bill to retrospectively legalise what it has done—thus pre-empting a High Court appeal.
Senator McGauran was saying before, `Well, the government won.' It did—only just, by two to one. If you add the first judge, Justice North, it was two-all. It is probably bad form to bet on a High Court outcome but I would have given a reasonable bet that the High Court would have upheld the original case by the applicants on some fairly fundamental principles. Maybe they would, maybe they would not—we will never know, because the government has basically put itself outside the law by retrospectively legalising what it did. To pass a bill retrospectively legalising something you have done that is potentially unlawful is dodgy enough in itself. To then pursue people who undertook court action in relation to those potentially unlawful actions—which you have only managed to make lawful because you have passed your own piece of legislation—is absolutely disgraceful. It shows the absolutely shonky nature of what the government is up to here.
I emphasise that the government is hypocritical also because it has said a number of times that it seeks to promote pro bono work and it seeks to encourage it. It is a valuable community service, and indeed it fills the massive gap in our legal aid system in Australia. For those that do not know, pro bono publico means `for the public good'. People acting for the public good should be able to do so without fear of reprisal. The Attorney-General himself has said:
The fact is that lawyers from around the country do about 1.7 million hours of pro bono work every year. This is a massive contribution to the public good. It needed to be acknowledged. And it needed to be applauded. 
The government has a great way of acknowledging it! Lawyers are doing pro bono work for people who are being gagged and detained, potentially illegally—we will never know—by the government and a great way of `encouraging and applauding' them is to go after them for costs, potentially putting the applicants out of business. Wonderful stuff! I quote from the Attorney-General again:
I have tried to act as a catalyst on pro bono issues. And I intend to stay closely involved in the discussion over the report and its findings. 
Indeed, in this year's Federal Budget $1 million was allocated to support the outcomes of the ... report ... a solid indication that I—
that is, the Attorney-General—
and the government, remain firmly committed to pro bono initiatives.
We are trying to encourage pro bono—we certainly don't want it to be faced with a situation where it is declining.
This one action will make it decline. People will be far more disinclined to undertake pro bono work, particularly in the area of immigration and refugee law—and we all know how much this department and this minister hate losing in the courts and they go after every single case. Plenty of the court costs that the taxpayer has to pay are because the government will not accept court decisions and keeps appealing and appealing them. It cannot stand to lose. The suffering it puts asylum seekers and migrants through in those circumstances is disgraceful in itself, let alone the cost to the taxpayer. But now the minister is going a step further. Not content to simply attack the refugees, asylum seekers and migrants rights, he is now attacking the opportunities for people to uphold those rights, to act for free in the public good to uphold those rights. He is going after those people as well. Those are the depths that this government's approach has reached. That is the level of thuggery that we are now faced with. The government has indicated that it will be seeking an order for costs against the applicants—the applicants being, as I understand it, the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties.
There are some significant considerations which apply here. This is public interest litigation, as the full bench of the Federal Court recognised so strongly. Australia's constitutional arrangements are such that it is the rule of law which protects individuals from an unjust or unlawful exercise of power by the executive government. This fundamental protection must not be hampered by the inability of persons to access the courts because of a lack of resources. It is this consideration which underlies the government's obligations concerning legal aid and the legal profession's obligations concerning pro bono service. Lawyers get a lot of flak, some of it deservedly, but the last area in which we should be attacking them is when they undertake pro bono—public interest—work.
For those in the community inclined to support the government's approach in this sort of area, just think what it might be like some time when you need someone to help you out—when you are being given a raw deal by the government, by the bureaucracy or by big business—and there is some solicitor who might be thinking of providing you with pro bono work in a key public interest case and then think back to what the government are doing. It is the refugees today; it could be you tomorrow. That is the reason it is so important that we defend principles such as these so strongly. That is the reason we have to emphasise so strongly why what is being done is so dangerous, not just in regard to all of these bills but, outside of these bills, in regard to this government's ruthless pursuit of people who are trying to act in the public interest and to hold the government to account—people who are actually trying to shine a spotlight on the government to show them up for what they are doing and to show them up for potentially acting illegally. It is yet another stifling of dissent, let alone a stifling of any opportunity to use our principles and our processes of government and law as we should.
In any legal proceedings the government is expected to conduct itself as a model litigant. It is highly questionable, in deciding whether to pursue costs against the applicants in these cases, whether the government is conducting itself as a model litigant. Given the government's actions in this whole area, it is pretty obvious that one could not expect this government to act in any way like a model citizen or a model litigant—or any model of a positive nature at all. 
The case that we are talking about relates back to the Border Protection Bill, which retrospectively legalises the issues relating to the Commonwealth's conduct, including potentially unlawful detention, which is a fundamental ancient legal right; a breach of Australia's international obligations; the deliberate contriving of situations where asylum seekers would be denied the ordinary protection of Australian law and refused access to procedures which this parliament has established; the denial of any access to or communication with the asylum seekers, including the outright refusal of a request by solicitors from the Council for Civil Liberties for access to the asylum seekers in order to seek instructions; and the use of military personnel to enforce potentially illegal detention.
The issues at stake were complex, and none of those issues had been the subject of an authoritative determination by the High Court. It would have been very much in the public interest to have had that determination made by the High Court so that those principles of law could have been determined. They will now be swept away by the atrocious border protection legislation, which will be passed sometime tonight or tomorrow. As things now stand, Liberty Victoria—that is, the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties—and, I believe, Mr Vadarlis are at risk of having an order for costs made against them for the Federal Court proceedings. Commonwealth representatives have given instructions that they will seek an order that all costs be paid.
The rule of law depends on access to the courts—never more so than when the rights of an unpopular and powerless minority are at stake. This is another one of those principles that goes back to some of those classic quotes. We have got to stand up for those people that might be being persecuted. We might be okay at the moment, but, if we do not stand up and protect people that are being persecuted now, there will be no-one left to protect us when people come after us. That is a crucial principle and one that the Democrats believe very strongly in. We are extremely disappointed in the border protection bill that is likely to be passed, but we believe this particular principle—which is one more flow-on effect, out of many, of this government's approach that is undermining so many fundamental things and that needs to be condemned and condemned absolutely—really needs to be emphasised.
In conclusion, I would draw senators' attention to a couple of excellent articles, one from yesterday and another from today, in the Canberra Times. The article yesterday was by Justice Michael Kirby and gave the history of a previous attempt to significantly undermine basic human rights back in the 1950s and the contrast then. This was in regard to banning people's rights to be members of the Communist Party and be involved in communist activities. That action was initially fairly popular at the time—it fed the public's fears and anxieties. It was only because there was strong and principled political opposition to the fundamental undermining of that principle that community opinion was turned around over time and the referendum on it was lost.
An even more interesting and relevant article in today's Canberra Times concerning this amendment and these bills was that by Ian Matthews about the Magna Carta. We often think of the Magna Carta as some sort of quaint old thing that is vaguely linked to Robin Hood or something like that, but it is actually a fundamental underpinning of a lot of our system of common law. The article points out that the Prime Minister will be paying homage to the Magna Carta this week with the ceremony tomorrow unveiling a sculpture in a landscape park on the Senate side of Old Parliament House to be known as the Magna Carta monument, celebrating the role that the Magna Carta played and the ancient rights that it outlined.
Obviously, as the article said, the Magna Carta does not stand up perfectly 800 years down the track, particularly in its discrimination against women and its racist nature. But some of the rights there included, among many other things, that accusations had to be tested at a fair hearing, that imprisonment could only follow lawful judgment—that is a joke; we already did away with that many years ago with mandatory detention, but we are going even further with these bills: imprisonment not without lawful judgment but without even any charge is what we are up to—and that to no-one would we deny or delay right or justice. Yet these bills are seeking to deny people access to justice and this amendment concerns the government's intent to deny people access to justice through pro bono legal work, through public interest litigation. 
It is a particular disgrace—although no surprise at all, given the government's fundamental undermining of the rule of law in so many ways with this package of legislation—and the capping disgrace that the government are seeking to pursue costs in relation to this particular court action. This will not only undermine and dissuade people from undertaking pro bono work in the future but obviously particularly affect people who are thinking of providing legal assistance to asylum seekers, who of course are amongst the most voiceless people on the globe. This is yet one more area where condemnation should be given to this government. I do urge the Senate to at least support this second reading amendment.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-25,"—Many things have been said about this package of migration bills but, firstly, let me turn to the second reading amendment which was moved by Senator Cherry. In particular, I refer to the remarks of Senator Bartlett. I say at the outset that the court has a discretion to make orders as to costs in any matter which is litigated before it. That is a discretion which resides with the courts, and quite rightly so. When the court looks at a particular case and assesses whether or not to award costs, it does so looking at a variety of aspects of the case, one of which can be the conduct of the litigants involved. It is usually open to a successful party to be able to recover its costs from the other party. But I stress: it is for the court to determine that.
The government has taken the view that in this case it is appropriate to make an application for costs and it rejects totally that this is in any way an act of thuggery and rejects entirely the pejorative terms which have been used in criticising the government's course of action in this regard. This is something which the government is entitled to claim in this instance. When people go to the courts and use up the time and cause cost to the courts and to the community as a consequence, it is only fair that there be open to the courts the discretion to award costs if the court thinks fit. That is precisely what is open to the court in this instance.
In this particular instance, we are not dealing with an applicant who is impoverished, an individual who has no funds; we are dealing here with an applicant which is a body. It is, in particular, the Victorian Civil Liberties Council. The Prime Minister, when asked, stated that we are not dealing with any impoverished individual. The lawyers were appearing for a public advocacy group, the Victorian Civil Liberties Council. In fact, the lawyers concerned, albeit they believed they had a strong case and were acting in the public interest, did not have as clients instructing them, that is, the people who were the subject of the application. The lawyers here were representing a public advocacy group. When they go to court and they may make an application of that sort they have to expect that if they are unsuccessful there could well be an application against them for costs. That has been part of our legal system for a very long time, and quite appropriately so. To say that the government is in any way churlish in this application or that this is an act of thuggery is totally out of order and the government rejects that. For those reasons, the government vehemently opposes this second reading amendment.
There has been some criticism about dealing with this package of bills together and as to why we are dealing with them now. I would put to the Senate that if we did not deal with these issues now we would be doing a disservice to the Australian people, who regard these as priority issues of great concern which need addressing in the national parliament. Of course, dealing with these bills together has its advantages. There are issues which are related, albeit that they are dealt with in different bills. It gives the legislature the opportunity to comment on this package of bills as a whole and to look at the connection between the various issues covered in these bills. 
We have a package of seven bills. The first three relate to what we broadly describe as border protection. Upon the introduction of these bills, the Leader of the Opposition described the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001 and the package of bills associated with it in these terms:
... a series of good reforms to the Migration Act that strengthen our borders, and therefore we support it, as we support the other bills because they strengthen the regime and they do so in a reasonably humanitarian way.
That is precisely what the government has been saying. The government has been trying for some time to reach a point of certainty in relation to these issues and also to deal with them in the national interest. When you look at the Leader of the Opposition's, Mr Beazley's, comments and compare them with some of the comments of the senators from the opposition who commented on this legislation, you could forgive yourselves for wondering if they are in fact arguing from the same point of view. We have a number of comments from opposition senators which indeed said something quite different.
Senator Sherry spoke in support of the package of bills, saying, `I believe it is necessary'. But he then went on to describe the measures as a `political exercise' and to accuse the government of trying to deflect the community from the true issues. You have to ask yourself: where was the logic in relation to Senator Sherry's comment? He is saying, `It is necessary', but then he criticises the government for being opportunistic and says that this is all a political exercise. In fact, Senator Schacht said that the Leader of the Opposition had announced that, as the government had accepted all of the opposition's recommendations, comments and efficiencies in relation to the Border Protection Bill 2001, the opposition would now support the legislation. Having said that the government had accepted these recommendations, one would assume that the opposition would then think that the legislation would make good law, but that is not what opposition senators went on to say. You had Senator Bolkus saying that he was supporting the legislation, notwithstanding that he thought that this is not the best way to go.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—Before the break, I had been outlining the discrepancy in relation to opposition senators and what they had been saying. They had said, `We now have legislation which we can support, because the government has taken on board our recommendations and suggestions.' That was on the one hand. On the other hand, they still said, `This is not good law.' I looked at what Senator Bolkus had to say and at what Senator Schacht had to say. Senator Schacht had been saying that the government had amended this bill as a result of suggestions from the opposition. One would think he would then say that the bill makes sense and is good law, but he then went on to say, `It will not work in a number of ways.' 
What we have here is a division in the ranks of the opposition in relation to the question of this legislation. It is interesting to see that Senators McKiernan and Cooney also made some points in relation to the legislation. In fact, Senator Schacht went further on radio 5AN when he said:
When we get back into government we will review any number of areas and make adjustments accordingly.
What exactly are the opposition on about here? Are they going to change the legislation if they ever get the opportunity—and let us hope they do not? They are saying that this is a good piece of legislation now that we have taken on board their suggestions but on the other hand saying it is not. There is total inconsistency in what they say.
Let us have a look at the legislation. In relation to the border protection bills, the first three that are listed on the Notice Paper, the opposition say that they could not support the previous bill and they can only support the legislation now because of the amendments. That is totally untrue. The Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001 was developed by the government to address broader issues that developed as further boats, such as the Aceng, entered Australia's waters illegally. The government's focus is, as always, centred on fixing the problem it has been confronted with by the insidious people smuggling trade that we have seen to the north-west of this country.  
In relation to the Tampa, we proposed legislation which not only was Tampa specific but also dealt with surrounding circumstances. The opposition said they could not support that—that they could support it only if it related to the Tampa only. That was short-sighted, and we have seen how short-sighted it was with the effluxion of time and the events that have occurred since. What we have done is produce a package of legislation that deals with the protection of the integrity of this country's border and sovereignty. This is in the nation's interest, and the opposition had no choice other than to come on board and support it. You can see the support that the legislation enjoys in the community, and rightly so.
The three bills that I have mentioned include enhanced border protection powers and new visa arrangements for refugees who have left their country of first asylum before seeking entry to Australia. Let me say that the government is fully committed to meeting Australia's international obligations at sea and on the land, and we have a proud history in relation to this. Australia has a right, however, to decide who can come to this country, who can cross our borders and under what conditions they can do so. Control of a country's border is an idea that goes back to ancient times and is something which is quite rightly in the province of any sovereign nation.
When we look at recent media reports, we see there are at least another 5,000 people currently waiting for arrangements to be finalised with people smugglers for travel to Australia by boat. The steps that the government has taken in relation to this legislation are to discourage those people smugglers, people who deal with a human cargo without any regard to the life or welfare of their cargo. We have looked at penalties in relation to people smuggling. Previously, there was a two-year maximum, which we increased to 10 years if it involved fewer than five people, and 20 years if it was five or more. Those penalties were quite rightly brought in by this government in recognition of the seriousness of people smuggling. When we looked at the implementation of that direction from the legislature, we saw that the average sentence was about two years—in real terms, somewhere between six and 12 months. The government thought that was totally inadequate. What we have done is seek to address that by imposing penalties which will have truth in sentencing and will act as a deterrent to anyone who might consider bringing people to Australia's shores illegally.
We are tackling the Mr Bigs, and we have the Australian Federal Police and officials of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade working in the region for upstream disturbance. We have had some success with that. We are working at that end of the market. But you also have to deal with the crew who bring people to Australia. The crew act callously, and I reject outright that these crew are lower order and do not deserve the attention that we are giving them. These are the crew who do not care that they are on vessels that are unseaworthy, that there are people's lives at risk, particularly those of women and children. They do it for money. They should face the full force of the law if they are found guilty.
The other bills that I have mentioned relate to judicial review. In particular, I refer to the fourth and fifth bills in the list on the Notice Paper. The first deals with the judicial review of migration decisions. It gives legislative effect to the government's longstanding policy commitment to restrict access to judicial review in migration matters in all but exceptional circumstances. The commitment was made in light of the extensive merits review rights in migration legislation and concerns about the growing cost and incidence of migration litigation and the associated delays in the removal of non-citizens with no right to remain in Australia. Access to neither the Federal Court nor the High Court's original jurisdiction is prevented, but the available grounds of judicial review are reduced. It is important to remember that that access is not denied.  
The fifth bill, the class action bill, provides that people with no lawful authority to remain in Australia will be unable to misuse class actions to prolong their stay and frustrate removal action. In the last six years, there has been an increase in the use of class actions and in the number of people involved in these actions. Since October 1997, 20 class actions, involving thousands of people, have been commenced. In the past five months alone, over 1,400 people have been added to one of those proceedings. These class actions are allowing more and more people to obtain bridging visas and remain in Australia until the courts have determined the matter. A pattern has also developed of people moving from one class action to another in order to further prolong their stay in Australia. Class actions are unnecessary to resolve or determine the lawfulness of migration laws and processes. These issues can be tested adequately in individual applications and the outcomes are applicable generally. The government will also be moving amendments to the class action bill in the committee stage and we will deal with those in due course.
The sixth bill on the Notice Paper deals with the refugee convention. This restores the application of the refugee convention to its proper interpretation and promotes the integrity of Australia's protection visa application and decision making processes. Under the refugee convention, a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. The convention does not define key elements of the test. Over recent years, Australian courts have expanded the definition of a refugee. As a consequence, protection has been provided in cases lying well beyond the bounds originally intended by the refugee convention. These generous interpretations of the convention encourage people who are not genuine refugees to test their claims in Australia. 
This potential for abuse of Australia's refugee protection arrangements is exacerbated by the continuing influx into Australia of unauthorised arrivals. In addition, people-smuggling operations often give highly detailed information and coaching to unauthorised arrivals in order to maximise their chances of successfully gaining a protection visa. It is crucial that we have the power to test protection claims effectively, given the increasingly sophisticated attempts at nationality, identity and claims fraud. A strong message needs to be sent to people smugglers and others wishing to exploit our protection arrangements that Australia is not a soft touch.
The seventh and last bill on the list deals with passenger information. This deals with the ability of Immigration officials to obtain passenger information once amendments to the Privacy Act come into force in December. It will allow private sector organisations such as airlines, travel agents and shipping companies to continue to provide information to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs concerning people's travel. A similar situation exists in relation to Customs and is often referred to as `forward clearance'. The department needs to receive this information to ensure speedy immigration clearance. Without it, there may be significant delays at air and sea immigration points. This makes sense and the government welcomes the support from the opposition in relation to this bill, which really does reflect what exists in relation to Customs at present. It is only fitting that these provisions should extend to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
I have briefly covered here the areas touched on by these bills before the Senate. These bills are timely, much-needed and in the interests of Australia. This has been recognised not only across the community but also by the vast number of people who have bothered to look at this issue and the problem that Australia faces. There are a number of amendments which we will be dealing with in the committee stage and I understand there are other amendments which will be put forward by others. I will reserve my comments until the point in time when they are raised. Suffice to say, this package is an essential one for Australia's migration laws and one which I commend to the Senate. 
Question put:

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-25,"—Madam President, I ask that the Senate divide this question as we are debating seven bills cognately and then voting on them. Whilst our position is consistent on all of them, there have been reports of a number of individual senators who have expressed concerns privately and publicly about the various bills. I think it is important to ensure that they have the opportunity to express their views clearly on each of these bills. I request that the vote for each of the seven bills be taken separately.
—Senator Bartlett, are you planning to vote differently on any of the bills?
—No, I am not. 
—Your request is denied.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2001-09-25,"—I wish to pay a tribute tonight to the late Sir William Knox, a distinguished former Deputy Premier and Treasurer of Queensland who died in Brisbane last Saturday at the age of 73. William Knox was born in Melbourne on 14 December 1927 and was educated at Melbourne High School. He settled in Brisbane as a young man and involved himself in many community activities, of which his participation in politics was a natural extension. In the early 1950s, he succeeded Sir James Killen to become the second Queensland president of the Young Liberal Movement. 
At the time of the Labor split in 1957, Knox was elected as the member for Nundah in the state parliament, a seat which he was to hold continuously for 32 years. He was defeated in 1989 at the landslide which saw the election of the Goss government. He thus had the unique claim of having a career which spanned precisely the long period of coalition and then National Party government which commenced with the defeat of Gair and ended with the election of Goss. By the time he left parliament in 1989, he had achieved the dignity of `father of the House'.
Sir William was the leader of the Liberal Party in the Queensland parliament, and the Deputy Premier and Treasurer from 1976 to 1978. Prior to that time, he had enjoyed a successful ministerial career, which began in 1965 when he became Minister for Transport in the Nicklin government at the age of 36. He was, at that time, the youngest person ever to have been appointed to the ministry in Queensland's history. His success in that portfolio led to swift advancement, and he was appointed as the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice in 1971. It was during Knox's time as Attorney-General that Queensland led Australia in law reform, with the establishment of the first law reform commission, the first office of ombudsman, and the most advanced legal aid system known to Australia at the time.
With the retirement of Sir Gordon Chalk in 1976, Knox was the obvious choice as leader of the party—a position which, in those days, carried with it the deputy premiership and the position of Treasurer. He continued that distinguished line of Liberal Treasurers—notably, Sir Thomas Hiley and Sir Gordon Chalk—who acted, in effect, as the chief executives of the Queensland government during the coalition years, and were responsible, far more than anyone else, for the economic development and growing prosperity the state enjoyed during the 1960s and 1970s. 
It was Bill Knox's misfortune that his period as deputy premier coincided with some of the excesses of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen—made arrogant and reckless by his stunning victory in the 1974 election on a tide of anti-Whitlam sentiment. It is an unglamorous role in politics to be the person who prevents bad things happening—who stands in the way of wrong decisions—by stubborn, unyielding resistance. And it is a thankless role as well when that resistance is made in the face of a popular demagogue, when the victories are anonymous, and when the achievements are essentially negative. But it can be a necessary role, and in Queensland in the late 1970s it was an important one. We have Bill Knox and his Liberal colleagues to thank for putting the brakes on Bjelke-Petersen at a dangerous time—how dangerous we were not to know until a decade later, when the Fitzgerald inquiry revealed all, and the Liberals, whom Bjelke-Petersen spurned at the time as do-gooders and trendies, were revealed to have been men and women of integrity and courage.
Knox was deposed in a party room coup in 1978, but remained in cabinet as Minister for Health. After the end of the coalition government in 1983, he never occupied ministerial office again. But it was, paradoxically, at that very time that his full stature as a man was made plain for all to see. The Liberals paid the price for standing up to Bjelke-Petersen—still an enormously popular figure—by losing all but eight of their 22 seats at the 1983 election. Then, with the defection of the Liberal Party's two most infamous rats, Lane and Austin, their numbers were reduced to six, and the National Party, for the first and no doubt the last time, formed a government in its own right. Bjelke-Petersen, who recognised Knox's great talent as a minister, offered him the opportunity to return to the positions of Treasurer and Deputy Premier, if he would betray the Liberal Party. It was commonly believed at the time that Bjelke-Petersen had also offered him the succession to the premiership, if he would betray his party. Of course, he did not. He settled, instead, for the thankless and in many ways humiliating task of leading a rump of five other members of parliament on the cross-benches.
But the most important thing to note about Knox is that, when the temptation was offered to him by Bjelke-Petersen, it just never crossed anyone's mind that he would succumb to it. The key to understanding Bill Knox was to understand that he was a man of pure, stubborn, granite integrity. He could have had every political prize he had sought. He could have returned to the high offices from which his own party had sacked him. He could probably have been Premier. But he did not, because he was just not made like that. No matter how much his own party may have hurt him, no matter how much he may have despaired of some of the decisions of its organisational wing at the time, the idea that Bill Knox would ever be disloyal to the Liberal Party was simply unthinkable. Over the next three years, he held the party together through its greatest test. They were difficult and thankless years, but he was there when the party needed him most, and nobody but he could have done it.
That is my tribute to the late Sir William Knox, who I knew well when I was a young man, and from whom I gleaned much wisdom. He won, and he lost, many of the most glittering prizes politics has to offer, but it is not for the prizes we remember him. We remember him, in a sense, for the opposite reason—for his willingness to forgo the prizes, to take the hard road, because for him there were more important things in public life: loyalty, integrity, honour.
When Sir William Knox died last weekend, he died with many accomplishments and many high offices to his name. But none of his accomplishments was greater than this: he died as a man who, in 32 years of active, significant public life, left parliament with a reputation which was as stainless and pure as the day he was first elected.
