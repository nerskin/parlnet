"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—Mr Speaker, I think the Leader of the House knew that it should have been but he defied the normal conventions of the place. He did that earlier in question time and that is the thrust of my question to you. Earlier in question time the Leader of the House accused the Governor-Designate of Tasmania of being a sell-out. Standing order 74 clearly says:
No Member ... may use the name of Her Majesty, her representative in the Commonwealth, or her representative in a State, disrespectfully ...
in debate. I understand that when this point of order was made by the member for Werriwa your response was to say that this person is not currently the Governor. But the fact is that he is the Governor-Designate. 
I ask you to reflect upon the circumstances of the allegation—the slur—that has been made by the Leader of the House. I also draw attention to page 492 of the House of Representatives Practice in which some previous rulings have been that restrictions applying to statements disrespectful to or critical of the conduct of the Governor-General apply equally to the Governor-General designate. That was referenced to a House of Representatives debate in 1969 at page 207.
Mr Speaker, on the basis of your acceptance of my drawing this to your attention now, I ask you to ask the Leader of the House to withdraw the slur and the smear. If you are not prepared to do it on my say-so at this stage, I ask you to reflect upon it and, having considered it, come back to the House and require the Leader of the House to withdraw it at a later stage. The Leader of the House is a person who always wants to get up and make accusations about us. He is always quick to throw it. This is a person with quick throwaway lines and no regard for protocol.
—The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat because he is now not assisting his own argument.
—Mr Speaker, in response to the point of order: I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition now respects the vice-regal office—a respect he never showed to the former Governor-General. On the point of order, I make three points. The first point—
Opposition members interjecting—
—I have recognised the Leader of the House. I have also exercised the regrettable power that I have to exercise in warning a number of people. They will know whether or not those warnings mean something if they continue to behave as they have behaved, including those immediately on my left. The Leader of the House has the call; I have recognised him.
—The first point is that Mr Butler is not the Governor of Tasmania yet. The second point—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: exactly under what standing order does the Leader of the House speak? The matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition was not a point of order; it was a question to you, Mr Speaker, about matters that have occurred in question time, about which he referred to in the context of standing orders. It was a question to you; it was not a point of order raised in this House to which the minister is now speaking. It seems to me, Mr Speaker, that the minister has no basis on which to be recognised.
—The member for Brand is right.
—I am not being assisted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Opposition members interjecting—
—I warn the member for Bruce! The member for Brand is perfectly right, and I do not claim otherwise. I thought my deliberation on the matter may have been assisted by a view from the Leader of the House. I am allowing the Leader of the House to continue, and I will do so under indulgence. I remind him that indulgence can easily be removed.
—Mr Speaker, given that the Leader of the Opposition in his question to you referred extensively to the standing orders, I thought it was appropriate to raise a point of order on his use of the standing orders. The second point I would make is that Mr Butler has said that he will not be the representative of the Queen in Tasmania; he will be the representative of the people. But that will not stop him taking the Queen's shilling, will it? 
Opposition members interjecting—
—Mr Speaker, the Leader of the House continues to compound the problem.
—One moment: in order to meet properly the requirements of the standing orders, as rightly highlighted by the member for Brand, can I indicate whether or not the Leader of the Opposition is seeking the call under a particular issue; otherwise I will respond to the Leader of the Opposition's earlier inquiry about the reference to the Governor-Designate of Tasmania.
—Mr Speaker, I am more than happy for you to respond to the point of order raised by the member for Brand. But, before you give your response to my earlier point, I simply want to add to it, given the fact that the Leader of the House has just compounded the problem. I want to draw your attention to what he is deliberately seeking to do in defiance of an effective reading of standing order 74 but certainly based on previous practice.
—Mr Speaker—
Opposition members interjecting—
—The whole House would be facilitated enormously if at the end of question time questions were over. This afternoon the most constructive use of questions to the Speaker has been exercised by the member for Lowe.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Governor-Designate of Tasmania</title>,Questions to the Speaker,7,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—As the sun sets slowly in the west and the chilly winds of Canberra begin to blow, I raise this matter of public importance because the working men and women of Australia are under sustained pressure from this zealous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and government. They are under pressure from inside and outside of the parliament. They are under pressure from a government that tears away at the hard-won working conditions of Australians, won in workplaces over 100 years. This government tears away at the safety net so carefully erected by previous Labor governments to ensure that working families have a decent standard of living in this country. It does so inside the parliament by introducing legislation on almost a daily basis, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—If I am to be as precise as the member for Prospect is insisting that I be, then I would be forced to do the immodest thing as well and ask that the member for Rankin refer to me as the Speaker.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. I certainly do, but I see a substitution on the way.
—What I guess you could call `speaker designate' if you wished.
—I am very happy to refer to you as Mr Speaker-designate.
—The member for Rankin misunderstood.
—If you could advise us on any future developments, Mr Speaker, we would all be fascinated. I notice the member for Mackellar has aspirations for your position, Mr Speaker, but I think you are far better qualified. This government introduces legislation on almost a daily basis to tear away at the working conditions of Australian families—to tear away at the safety net. It does that inside the parliament, while outside the parliament this minister intervenes in industrial disputes. Wherever there is conflict, the minister likes to intervene. Where there is no conflict, he seeks to create it. He either creates conflict or inflames disputes. 
I refer to the disgrace under this government's legislation—introduced in 1996 and furthered subsequently—of the lockouts that are going on in this country. Two of them are continuing. Another, which finished recently, was at Morris McMahon in Sydney, where employees were locked out for 17 weeks because there was no requirement to bargain in good faith on the part of the employer. ACI's Box Hill site in Melbourne is the subject of an ongoing lockout, which has now been going for 16 weeks. The member for Chisholm, who will be speaking on this motion, will no doubt tell us more about the consequences of that lockout. The other lockout that is ongoing is at Geelong Wool Combing in Victoria, which has already locked out employees for 14 weeks. Seven of those employees have had to put their homes on the market.
The other day, this minister said that he does not like lockouts. I do not think anyone here would believe that. I think he likes lockouts a lot, because the minister's legislation facilitates lockouts. It facilitates an uneven bargaining situation. There is no requirement to bargain in good faith and no role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate in those cases, because it was taken away by this government. Meanwhile, the government is up to its neck in crony capitalism. It has friends and relatives who are being given a rails run. We heard today that the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government intervened on behalf of his son. We have seen over the last couple of weeks Manildra-gate, where the Prime Minister is still not `Honan' up to misleading the parliament about helping his friend.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Rankin will be very careful.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. And there is the most infamous example of all: the Prime Minister's brother, Stan Howard—the only employer in this country whose employees were given full protection of their entitlements by this government and the Prime Minister of Australia when all the other employees who have lost their entitlements have been given, at best, miserly benefits from the GEER Scheme. The fact of the matter is that this minister has brought into this parliament 12 bills—a dirty dozen bills—which attack the bargaining capacity of working Australians. Those dirty dozen bills allow workers to be dismissed unfairly and weaken the capacity of the trade union movement to represent the interests of working Australians in this country.
These dirty dozen bills are the work of a right-wing ideologue and an apostle of the far Right. The other day the minister came into the parliament invoking the words of an old song. I could invoke the words of a famous group that is still around Canberra, Mental As Anything, who sang:
A close encounter with a hard-hearted man
Who never gave half of what he got ...
This is a hard-hearted man. This is a flint-hearted minister for workplace relations—a hard-hearted man, a flint-hearted man.
—That is very impressive!
—There is another song, a Billy Joel song—
—The Minister for Foreign Affairs should be aware of his position in the parliament. He has been warned.
—I just referred to some music by Billy Joel, where he sang:
You may be right 
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for ...
Billy Joel was right on with that music. We have a hard-hearted minister in Flintheart here, in a three-cornered leadership contest with Braveheart and Noheart: Braveheart, the minister for education, and Noheart, the Treasurer, because he has no heart after being told that he was not going to get the top job.
—I fail to see what this has to do with the motion before the chair.
—It is about the motivation—
—You must be relevant to the motion before the chair.
—of this minister in bringing his dirty dozen pieces of legislation into this parliament, and the motivation is to please his boss, the Prime Minister of Australia. That is quite obvious. He said of the Prime Minister on Meet the Press on 29 June this year:
... I see no reason why he can't continue to do that job indefinitely.
So now the Prime Minister is immortal, too! But, Minister, isn't it against one of the 10 commandments to worship false idols—`thou shalt not have false idols before thee'? The minister went on to say:
Certainly I think that the Prime Minister has well and truly established himself as the greatest Liberal since Bob Menzies. ... John Howard is going strong and he is getting better and better as he goes along.
Isn't that just the worst case you have ever heard of sucking up to your boss? So this minister wants to impress his boss. He has entered this three-cornered contest, but he needs a bit of time on his side. He also needs to impress him by bringing in these dirty dozen pieces of legislation. But the fact is that the minister is a failure. The minister is a failure because he cannot get his dirty dozen bills through this parliament. Why? Because they are ill conceived, they are unfair, they are biased, they are divisive and the Australian parliament will not have a bar of them—12 pieces of legislation all designed to divide Australians, to set Australian against Australian, to intervene on behalf of the employer and to tear away the capacity of the trade union movement of this country to represent the working men and women of Australia.
There was a profile of the minister in the Australian Financial Review just last Friday, and I think he has read the writing on the wall. He realises that he is not getting very far with these tactics of bringing in his dirty dozen bills, so now he wants to be some sort of sensitive new age guy and he has gone all lofty on us; he is making lofty speeches. Lofty speeches are fine, but there are very few policy ideas coming from this minister. In fact he only has one idea, and that idea is to facilitate the transition from welfare to work. He knows that people on welfare face effective marginal tax rates of up to 111 per cent, while the constituents in his own seat of Warringah complain about effective marginal tax rates of 48½ per cent.
On this, the minister is right. But once every three or four months the minister says: `I've got this great new plan. We ought to facilitate the transition from welfare to work.' Once every three or four months, the media writes it up: `The minister's got a great new plan. What a great idea.' It is not his idea at all; it is the idea of the Labor Party. It was Labor policy in the 1998 election. It is being championed by the member for Lilley, the shadow minister for families. But this minister says, `It's my idea,' and then he rolls it out three or four times a year, takes it to cabinet three or four times a year, and three or four times a year the cabinet throws it out. 
So, on the true test of whether this minister is effective and successful, he is unsuccessful. He is a policy failure, so he resorts to these lofty speeches. He said, for example:
“None of us are true to our best selves, but I think we always need to aspire that way.”
I think it is worth aspiring to truth and honesty in this parliament. It is a pity that we have not seen much truth and honesty in this parliament over the last 10 days with Manildra-gate, the protection of the interests of Stan Howard and also, today, the minister for regional services. So the minister talks of truth and honesty? Just before the Tampa sailed into Australian territorial waters, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources was in all sorts of strife in this parliament for his GST scam—all sorts of strife. He was just on the point of having to resign. A censure motion had been moved by the opposition and the workplace relations minister spoke on behalf of the minister for industry, describing the Groom GST scam as `an honest mistake'. An honest mistake? I can reveal to the House that the tax office audited that GST scam and applied a 50 per cent penalty tax. A 50 per cent penalty tax applies when a scheme is a blatant piece of contrived tax avoidance, and that is what it was. It was no honest mistake, and the minister knew that at the time he said it was a honest mistake. It was a blatant tax scam and it was defended by this minister.
This minister is an ideologue. He describes unemployed workers as job snobs. He says a bad boss is like a bad father or a bad husband—better than none at all. He condones abusive relationships in the workplace. Let us hear what his colleagues and fellow travellers have had to say about him on the question of honesty and truth and character. Members here might remember Mr Jay Pendarvis. The member for Lingiari would remember Mr Pendarvis—the Mudginberri dispute of the 1980s, where Jay Pendarvis had a red-hot go at the meatworkers union in the Northern Territory. You would think that Mr Pendarvis would say glowing things about the minister for workplace relations, but in fact Mr Pendarvis described him as `a dangerous man'. Mr Pendarvis said, talking about the minister for workplace relations:
“His attitude is them against us. He's 100 per cent employer orientated and the employees don't get a look in ...”
How is that for a character reference? But the minister wore that criticism like a badge of honour. He said, in response to a question from the member for Prospect:
Jay Pendarvis is a very intelligent man. I accept that. He has done a lot of great things for Australian industrial relations. If he says that I am a dangerous man, who am I to disagree?
I think that is right: who would disagree that he is a dangerous man?
Not only is the minister dangerous, but another former colleague—that is, former Liberal Party leader Dr Hewson—sacked him for `incompetence and disloyalty'. So he is dangerous, he is incompetent and he is disloyal—all that from his colleagues. There is another reference, but this time it is a reference given by the minister to a colleague; in fact, it was given to a former staffer. Of this former staffer the minister said, `He was in short an absolutely outstanding staffer, the kind of lieutenant every politician needs and hopes for.' Who was this wonderful staffer? Who was this great man? Of course, it was David Oldfield, the co-founder of the One Nation Party. Mr Oldfield returned the compliment and gave the minister a free character reference. When asked whether the minister's views would be at home in One Nation he said, `Oh largely, yes.' Of course the minister's views are at home in One Nation. 
In explaining his views on life, this minister invokes his Christianity. He said on the Sunday program, `Blessed art thou amongst women; that's how I feel.' How blessed amongst women does the minister feel after refusing to bring into parliament legislation that would allow mums who have had a baby to come back and resume work on a part-time basis? Why has this minister presided over a situation where, just the week before last, a woman had to win a court case to be able to return to work on a part-time basis? This minister is not blessed amongst women. This minister has brought 12 pieces of legislation into this parliament, all of them antiworker—and Labor will oppose them. We are proud of our links with the trade union movement. We proudly recognise the trade union movement as the lifeblood of the party. We will repel this minister's relentless attacks on the wages and conditions of the working men and women of this country.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—The member for Rankin is the third opposition shadow minister for workplace relations with whom I have had dealings over the last 2½ years. Both the member for Brisbane and the member for Barton were highly intelligent representatives of Labor perspectives. They always had something worth listening to; they always had something to say. I learned quite a lot from listening to their insights garnered in the workplaces of Australia through their long associations with either the union movement or industrial law. I regret to say that one would learn nothing at all from listening to the member for Rankin—at least if today's speech is to be our yardstick. The member for Rankin has a doctorate, and I respect him for that; good on him for having a doctorate. But this parliament and his party would benefit if, in making contributions on the important topic of workplace relations, he were to give us his insights and not his abuse.
What we have seen this afternoon is more bile than brain. I suppose the member for Rankin is conscious of the fact that, unlike the member for Brisbane, he is not a former union official and, unlike the member for Barton, he is not an industrial lawyer of long experience. But I do not think he persuades anyone by resorting to the kind of personal abuse and gutter language which we have seen this afternoon and have witnessed on numerous occasions since he took that position.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Rankin has had his say.
—I suppose the member for Rankin has looked at the recent history of the opposition. He has seen members advancing because they have made political exhibitionists of themselves. He has seen members advancing because they have mastered the art of abuse.
—The member for Rankin will be dealt with if he does not remain silent.
—He has taken his Latham pills in the hope of getting a Latham result. But, on the basis of what he has said this afternoon, I do not think he has it in him to be an effective brute. Let me try to deal with some of the substantive things that the member for Rankin said in amongst all the abuse and insult. He said that I intervene in cases before the courts and industrial commissions of Australia. Yes, I do intervene. I intervene not on the side of the worker and not on the side of the employer.
—The member for Rankin will remove himself under standing order 304A. 
The member for Rankin then left the chamber.
—I intervene on the side of the law. I intervene because I believe that the law of the land and the policy of the government deserve to be upheld and asserted in the courts and tribunals of this country. The member for Rankin then said that I support lockouts. I do not like industrial action. I think that industrial action should always be the last resort. It should never be entered into lightly, because industrial action, whether a strike or a lockout, always causes damage and hardship; sometimes it causes job losses. It should always be a last resort. But I accept that, under this government's legislation and under legislation brought in by the previous government in 1993, both strikes and lockouts are perfectly legal under certain circumstances. As far as I am aware, the lockouts referred to by the member for Rankin are perfectly legal. 
The member for Rankin is unhappy because this government's legislation does not encourage arbitration at the early stages of an industrial dispute. One of the problems in our industrial system is that, for far too long, we had far too much micromanagement of our workplaces by judges and commissioners who did not really understand exactly what was going on in them. It is fundamental to the government's approach that we believe those who know their workplace best should, as far as is humanly possible, make the decisions for those workplaces. I am not going to encourage the Industrial Relations Commission or anyone else into the workplace at the first sign of trouble. I think that intervention by the commission or by the courts, when we are dealing with a lawful industrial dispute, should be something which happens at the end and not at the beginning of that dispute. 
The member for Rankin talks about a sustained attack on bargaining capacity. That is far from the case. This government believes that, in their workplace, workers ought to be entitled to negotiate and make representations. The employer ought to be entitled to make offers. What we are on about is freedom. When the members opposite talk about good faith bargaining, they mean union bargaining. They are not on about compulsory bargaining with workers; they are on about compulsory bargaining with union officials.
The member also alleges deterioration in living standards. If living standards have deteriorated over the last few years, let us have more deterioration. By every objective indicator, the workers of Australia as a group are better off now than in March 1996. There are more jobs, there is higher pay, there is greater protection and there are fewer strikes. One million new jobs have been created since March 1996, and half a million of those new jobs have been full-time jobs. Since March 1996, full-time average weekly earnings have gone up in real terms by 14 per cent and basic award earnings have gone up in real terms by some eight per cent.
If you compare our record with that of members opposite when they were in government, I think this government is happy to be judged by that comparison. Under the former government, full-time average weekly earnings rose by only five per cent in real terms and basic award earnings actually fell by five per cent in real terms. Members opposite, who like to claim to be the friends of the workers of Australia, used to boast about it—they used to come into this place day in, day out, and boast about suppressing the wages of the workers of Australia.
This government gets little credit for what it has done to protect worker entitlements. For 96 years, no Australian government put in place any protection for worker entitlements. In September 2001, this government put in place a comprehensive scheme of protection of worker entitlements. All statutory and community standard entitlements are protected and guaranteed by this government. That was a very significant addition to the social safety net and members opposite ought to give us a bit of credit for it. Three times this government has given significant tax cuts to the ordinary working people of Australia. The new tax system was the largest personal income tax cut in Australia's history. As I said in question time today, strikes are at their lowest level since records were first kept in 1913. 
There is a reason for all of this. These tangible benefits to the working people of Australia have come about not through serendipity or the action of some hidden hand, but, rather, because this government has pursued important and necessary structural change to the workplaces of this country. In fairness to members opposite, I should also add that, in very important respects, we have built upon some of the changes that were made in the 1993 legislation. What we have done over the last seven or eight years is move from industry bargaining to enterprise bargaining and from industrial awards to enterprise and individual agreements. That is precisely the way it should be, because the people who understand a business and know its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the particular challenges and opportunities it faces, are the people in that workplace. They are the ones who ought to be making those decisions.
It should be no surprise to members opposite or others that this government has been able to deliver sustainable workplace outcomes—more jobs, higher pay and fewer strikes—in a way that none of its predecessors have because we have built on the fundamental strengths and the fundamental decency of the workers and managers of Australia. The kind of enterprise bargaining that this government has encouraged, and which has spread under this government, has delivered higher productivity that has better enabled Australian businesses to survive and prosper, sometimes in difficult international and domestic economic circumstances.
In the 1980s, under the old system, labour productivity increased by just two per cent a year. In the first half of the nineties the former government tried, often against the wishes of some of its own supporters, to liberalise the system, and labour productivity increased at the rate of 2½ per cent a year. Since the mid-nineties, due to the accelerated liberalisation and greater freedom, flexibility and fairness put in place by this government, labour productivity has increased at the rate of three per cent a year. This is one of the foundations of Australia's economic success and social stability over the last few years. It did not happen by accident. It happened because this government, along with others, was prepared to do the difficult work of re-engineering the legislation and trying to change the culture of our workplaces so that people could work better and smarter than in the past. As a result, they have been rewarded with more jobs and higher pay.
Judge this government by its results, not by the tired, overblown and demeaning rhetoric of the member for Rankin. The difference between this government and the member for Rankin at least is that we will never resort to those cheap cliches of the class war or those cheap them-and-us antinomies which were so obvious in the member for Rankin's speech today. We believe that the average Australian worker is a person of intelligence, of creativity, of diligence—a person who is more than capable of standing up for his or her best interests. We believe that the average Australian boss is a person of decency, humanity and intelligence. We believe that bosses and workers in this country want to work together. We think that the workplace should be a scene of partnership, not antagonism. 
We concede that every so often there will be disputes or fights, but we think those disputes should, as far as is humanly possible, be minimised. If the dispute is dragging on to the extent that meaningful workplace bargaining is no longer possible or if it is dragging on to the extent that there is significant damage to the national economy, then under those circumstances, but not before, the Industrial Relations Commission should get involved—and it does. Sometimes I intervene to try to ensure that those disputes are settled.
The saddest thing about the member for Rankin's contribution today is not that he let down his party and that he let down the intellectual standards which you would think someone with a doctorate would uphold; he let down himself, because last year he said:
By opposing for the sake of opposing, Labor will have let Australia down badly.
That is precisely what the member for Rankin has done today. There is only one place for the member for Rankin to go after today and that is up. He will improve his standing and his performance by trying to model his conduct as shadow minister on the conduct of the member for Barton and the member for Brisbane. You can disagree with them—I often did disagree with them—but I always respected them because they always had something worth saying and they always had something worth listening to.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Economic Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I am saddened to be following the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on this MPI and I am saddened that we are having to talk about this issue. Again he has demonstrated all the rhetoric from that side: `We're going to have this wonderful thing with the workers and the bosses getting together and working it all out.' That is wonderful, except if you are an employee in an industry of 22,000 workers, you are on the other side of Australia and you might not even know who your boss is. We get accused on this side of not knowing about small business, but nobody on that side has ever been involved in industrial relations. None of them have ever actually been involved in negotiations. If they had—
—That's not right!
—Except for the member for Deakin, perhaps. He may be the only person over there who has ever been involved. I have been involved on both sides, having worked for the bosses and for the union movement, and realise what it is like to be involved in these negotiations. The airy-fairy ideals that they put across do not work—they simply do not work in the workplace.
The MPI today I think captures the essence of this government—a government not, as they claim, `for all', a government not for families or, as the Prime Minister so derogatorily puts it, `ordinary Australians'. No, this is a government for the wealthy, and in particular those who are keen on donating to the Liberal Party. We no longer have a government for the people, by the people of Australia; we have a government for the wealthy, by the wealthy. We have a government in particular with a Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations who has no appreciation or understanding of working men and women. His only interest in his portfolio has been in employers. Never once has he spoken in, or indeed outside, this House about workers' rights. His only interest is employer rights. His raft of legislation in this place is about stripping away the last vestige of any rights a worker may have had. Gone are the rights of employees; gone are the rights of workers to collectively bargain, to have some voice and power in negotiations with their employer. Instead we have a system which seeks to starve workers into submission to agree to job losses and reduced conditions. It is a system which encourages and promotes employers to avoid bargaining in good faith and actively promotes conflict ahead of resolution. 
This government has in place legislation that openly encourages hostility towards workers. It encourages management thuggery on its workers. This government is wonderful about talking about union thuggery, but what about management thuggery? It is out there and it is alive. The minister braved it once at a picket line in Sydney at Morris McMahon, where he said the workers had the right to seek a collective agreement. What he failed to add is that they may have that right, but they have no ability to enforce it. There is no way you can actually get the management to come to the table and collectively bargain. Has the minister visited any of the sites where staff are not on strike but have been locked out by their management? Has he told the 76 workers at ACI on Lexton Road at Box Hill that they have a right to collectively bargain? Has he sought to intervene in this dispute to help 76 decent workers get back to work? Has the minister sought to introduce legislation which assists workers and management to resolve disputes? No. What he has done and continues to do with his legislation is attack workers' rights to bargain and to achieve a decent living standard.
ACI at Box Hill—does it sound familiar? It does to me, because this is not the first time that these staff have been locked out; it is the third time. The management locked out staff in 1995, in 2000 on Christmas Eve, and in 2003. What greater demonstration is there that ACI management at Box Hill has no desire to bargain in good faith? ACI is again demanding its workers give up hard-won basic conditions. ACI wants staff to have a doctor's certificate for every single day of absence. With no bulk-billing doctors around, this is actually a massive impost. It wants staff to cash out leave instead of taking it. The humdinger is that midway in the lockout—into six weeks—it said that it wanted staff to revert to a five-day, eight-hour roster after it enforced a six-day, 12-hour pattern in its first lockout in 1995.
Drastic changes to work patterns are not like installing new machinery. A normal family life is never easy for shift workers. Being married to someone who was once a shift worker, I know it is not easy. You just do not change your life that easily. These workers have now accommodated this and can no longer deal with it. To top it all off, the company recently sacked a worker who had just returned to work after being injured. He had spent 32 years with the company; he was aged 64 and wanted to keep working. Surely that is a desire the Prime Minister could appreciate—he was 64 and he wanted to keep working. I thought that was something that this government was meant to be encouraging. The current situation at Box Hill is putting the wellbeing of 76 families at serious risk. These families have not been paid an income for over four months and this will continue, as they received another lockout notice until 18 September. Most have no access to Centrelink benefits, yet it is ACI that is effectively on strike, not the workers.
Workers affected by the lockout are in genuine fear of defaulting on their mortgages and are facing a crushing debt crisis. During the lockout in 2000 they washed cars to raise money. Because of the water restrictions, they now cannot even do that. There is no income going to these 76 families. Marriages are at serious risk of breakdown. Serious health issues related to stress are surfacing. Some of the workers have even talked about suicide. The current Workplace Relations Act does not provide any avenue whatsoever for this dispute to be resolved. The commission has had its powers to ensure that parties bargain in good faith ripped from it. There is nowhere for these workers to go to resolve this. What has management done? Management has lodged this with the commission—not only to end the dispute but to actually terminate the agreement. So these workers are going to be left nowhere, high and dry. That is all this government offers people. 
What else do we have? We have 93 workers at a wool combing factory in Geelong—very low-paid workers—who have been locked out for 14 weeks. Why? Because they would not agree to a certified agreement that reduced their pay by 25 per cent. I think that is fairly unreasonable. Seven of those workers have already had to sell their homes. We also have Blue Ribbon in Launceston, which is in the 140th day of its lockout. Why? Because staff with in excess of 30 years experience will not accept contracts which do not specify their pay. I think it is a reasonable thing that, if you are going to accept a contract, it should state what the pay and conditions are. Also, the company is now denying that these people were ever employees, even though they have been there for 30 years. This is a government that actively promotes and encourages this appalling behaviour.
Although his title is the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in reality the minister is an antiunion zealot who believes his calling in life is to undermine unions, regardless of the vulnerable position in which this will leave honest and hardworking Australians. It is ironic that it was this minister who said of the union link with the ALP:
The union link made sense in the era of robber-baron capitalism when unions helped to civilise the workplace and establish ... dignity ...
If that is true, I see a real need not only for unions but also for a party in this House that has an even stronger link with them, since the Liberal Party has done nothing more than try to re-establish that era of robber baron capitalism through its one-sided legislative reforms aimed at kicking those already in need.
I find it extraordinary that the minister, who forever talks about how he wants to bring equality to the workplace—and he has stated it again today—has resorted to the old favourite of union bashing instead of trying to bring some true equality into the workplace. How can he realistically expect to build a working relationship with both sides of the argument and be a conduit to bipartisan reform when he consistently calls every unionist a `thug' and describes hardworking people who dare to stand up to management as a `mob'? You see, the truth is that those on the other side of the House just want one thing. They want antiworker and antiunion bias institutionalised in the federal industrial relations system so that they can simply wipe their collective hands like Pontius Pilate and deny that they are breaking the backs of average Australians and denying them their hard-earned rights.
What is so wrong with the word `union'? It is a collective of individuals getting together. It is a collective of people in the work force standing up for what they believe in. It is not a three-headed monster. It is not the terrible thing at the end of the garden. It is a collective of human beings standing up and exercising their democratic right to be heard together—and actually that will not be a right anymore under this government; they are trying to rip that away from them. 
Although the minister is largely to blame for the situation and is the government's mouthpiece, we must not forget who the real culprit is. I am talking about the man who conveniently lets his brother's company have its say—little cosy deals in relation to employee entitlements. The minister talked about GEERS. GEERS would be wonderful if it actually paid out money to anybody. I have 101 workers at another site in Box Hill who lodged applications with GEERS and GEERS said, `No, you can't have the money.' It is not working. That system has failed. He holds up his hand and says it is wonderful. Maybe we did not introduce one because we did not have companies who had a system where they could actually deny the workers their entitlements, set up shelf companies and say: `No, you were never our employees. Off you go.' 
We have a Prime Minister who likes to be a buddy or, dare I say it, a lapdog to big business and thinks the behaviour shown by Patrick Stevedores was simply inspiring. Where are you, Prime Minister, when workers such as those at ACI need you? You are nowhere to be found. It is a pity none of their surnames is Honan.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Economic Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1
"Barresi, Phillip, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—It is a pleasure to be able to speak on this MPI the opposition has brought about on the subject of `sustained attacks on the bargaining capacity and living standards of working Australians'. It is a pity that the shadow minister for workplace relations spent 13 of the 15 minutes allocated to him in this debate abusing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations rather than discussing the issues—playing the man rather than the ball. At least the member for Chisholm had the decency to speak on the issue. 
The first part of this MPI refers to `sustained attacks'. I find it quite extraordinary that those words are being used about this government's approach in furthering the living standards of Australians. The situation is quite the contrary. Since this government was elected, the ALP has made a sustained attack on every measure introduced by the government which would improve the economic security of our nation and, in turn, the personal economic security of every Australian, whether they be traditional supporters of the coalition or not. In fact, the term `Howard battlers' has often been used to describe the traditional blue-collar Australians who once supported the ALP and have been disillusioned with the Australian Labor Party and the direction in which the ALP has taken them.
The member for Rankin talked about the motivation of this government in its industrial relations policy. I would like to talk about the motivation of the member for Rankin in bringing this MPI into the parliament. It is a farce. It is factually incorrect by any measure. There are three reasons why this MPI has been introduced into the parliament today. Firstly, it is an attempt to win over those people who have turned their backs on the ALP. The ALP is attempting to be seen to be doing something. The only thing that they have done is get in the road of real reform in this country and the reform agenda which this government has a mandate to introduce.
How depressing it must have been for members of the ALP this morning to wake up and to see that, after five days of sustained attacks against the government last week and this week, and in particular against the Prime Minister, the Australian public is not buying their strategy of `seek and destroy'. This is an ALP that is negative in every sense of the word—a negative opposition that is desperate for a scalp. If it is not a minister, it is a governor-general. If it is not a public servant, it is an attack on a businessman. Today we saw more of it. How depressing it must be for members of the ALP to wake up and read that the Newspoll shows that no inroads have been made by the Leader of the Opposition as a credible and worthy alternative leader. The motivation is to try to regain some credibility with the workers out there. It just is not biting—they are rejecting their strategy in this House and outside. 
Secondly, this matter of public importance has come about as an attempt by the ALP to bolster its standing with the trade union movement while it holds its ACTU congress in Melbourne. How disappointing it must have been for Dougie Cameron, Greg Combet, Craig Johnston, Martin Kingham and Sharan Burrow to wake up this morning and see that the team in which they have placed their support, faith and trust in Canberra is letting the side down. How disappointing it must have been for them to know that the $28.5 million that they have donated to the ALP since 1996 has basically been money wasted. They would have been saying to themselves this morning, `We have wasted this money, the hard-earned blue-collar workers' money in the form of union fees, to prop up the federal ALP and it is letting us down.' It is no wonder we have individuals such as Greg Combet venturing into the debate on issues such as health and education. They know that the Australian Labor Party is failing in its duties in key policy areas and they are starting to venture into that area. I say to the Australian Labor Party: wouldn't it be great if some of that money that has been donated to the Australian Labor Party actually went to causes that would benefit the people out there? 
The member for Chisholm has spoken in the debate. The member for Chisholm was a member of the Australian Services Union. That union has donated $1.5 million to the Australian Labor Party since 1996. I say to the member for Chisholm: I can think of a number of community groups in the part of Melbourne that we share that would love to get their hands on just part of that money—money that would do some good rather than be wasted.
The third reason this matter of public importance has been introduced is that the opposition has a pathological hatred of the minister—a minister who is doing his duty and responsibility as a member of the executive to introduce a mandate that the Australian people have voted on. You only have to drive around Melbourne to see how pathological that hatred is, to see the billboards on the eastern freeway which feature the Prime Minister and the minister for workplace relations and which are paid for out of hard-earned union money—money which is wasted in order to criticise the minister and the Prime Minister for what they are doing in bringing forward real industrial relations reform.
My experience with the minister is anything but what has been portrayed by the opposition today. They talk about him and decry his tactics. I had the great pleasure this year of being with the minister at Monash University campus in Morwell, where we were confronted by a posse of union officials wanting to engage and intimidate. Rather than shirk the encounter, the minister engaged in a very professional, civilised manner with those union officials and in fact even invited them into the meeting to listen to the address so that he could answer their questions with total civility and respect for their position and for the position of the workers whom they represented. The minister for workplace relations in this government is a minister we can all be proud of. Yes, he is dogged. Yes, he will not shirk an issue. But I have to say that he acts with the true intent of improving the living standards of ordinary Australians.
As I said at the outset, I find this matter of public importance to be a baffling one from the opposition. Let us get a couple of things straight: this MPI claims that the workplace reform agenda of the Howard government has `attacked' working Australians. What an absolutely ridiculous suggestion. How on earth could the mandated workplace reform agenda of the coalition be construed as hurting the nation when 1,120,100 more Australians are now in employment?  
It was interesting to view last night's Lateline program on the ABC, when Tony Jones had the opportunity to quiz Greg Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, over recent Labor announcements and its Medicare intentions. I found it curious because the union movement has now ventured into the debate on health and education. It has lost heart in the ALP's ability to do the attack for them so it is venturing into it. It was quite wise of the Lateline producers to speak directly to Greg Combet, who is a commander in the ALP movement. It was quite a revealing interview yet upon rereading the transcript I was left a little confused. Following a question about another Newspoll survey regarding the Medicare levy, Tony Jones asked Mr Combet:
So you're saying then, people are prepared not only to forgo tax relief but tax increases could be on the cards (if these people wanted to have more services)? 
Combet responded:
Yes, and I'm sorry to disappoint Peter Costello.
But he went on:
It's not in fact a push for taxes at all ...
Jones responded:
That does in fact look like you've tested the waters for a tax increase, doesn't it?
Combet said:
We've asked people about their preparedness.
Combet then went on to accuse the federal government of being a high-taxing government. What an absolute cheek! Talk about destroying the living standards of working Australians! I would like to ask Combet and his comrades what they have to say about the high taxes that their mates in the state parliaments have introduced. What a two-faced approach by the union movement. State governments around Australia are the highest taxing jurisdictions in the world yet we find that the union movement and the ALP are criticising our attempt to reform industrial relations in this country. 
The record of this government in improving living standards is a proud one in every respect. We have seen interest rates whereby Australian home buyers are now able to pay $330 less per month for a $100,000 mortgage than they did when Labor was in office. We have seen real jobs growth—growth in permanent jobs, rather than simply an increase in casual employment, which some members on the other side often accuse us of promoting. We have seen Labor's debt interest payments being paid off so that there is more money to invest in better things such as health and education. We have seen real changes in the tax thresholds in this country. (Time expired)

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—I move:
That the amendments be disagreed to.
I will not detain the House long. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002, which the Senate has very heavily amended, is a very simple bill. It is essentially a piece of legislative housekeeping. It is essentially about correcting an oversight that crept into the legislation over the years. The bill simply provides that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will have the same powers in respect of the transmission of certified agreements as it has always had in respect of awards.
It was a very simple and straightforward piece of legislation. In the government's view it has, unfortunately, been very heavily amended. Opposition amendments were proudly entitled `MUA here to stay' amendments. On that subject I point out that no less a person than a commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission has recently stated that the award which the MUA wished to have apply to certain vessels was unsuited `to the efficient performance of work according to the needs of the workplace or enterprise'. The commission further observed that `inappropriate work practices based partially on award provisions and partially on custom and practice might be the order of the day'. In the light of those very recent statements by a commissioner of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission I think that the House should respectfully disagree with the opposition's amendments.
As for the amendments moved by the Democrats, I simply point out that the government's decision not to confine the Industrial Relations Commission's discretion was a deliberate and considered one because the government believes that the commission should have maximum flexibility to devise solutions to what are frequently complex issues. Members of this House often rightly extol the virtues of the industrial commission. If the industrial commission is everything the members of this House think it is, surely we ought to trust the Industrial Relations Commission to handle the transmission of certified agreements in the same way that it handles the transmission of awards. So I move that the amendments be disagreed to. ",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—In the absence of the shadow minister, I respond on behalf of the opposition. We oppose the government's motion. We believe that the Senate amendments should be agreed to. The debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002 was canvassed in respect of the ALP opposition amendments in the House. We moved provisions which were designed to ensure a continuity of entitlements in circumstances where there was a transmission of business. We sought to broaden those provisions to have regard to the nature of the duties performed by an employee whose employment was transferred, as opposed to simply the activities of the employer.
In respect of the amendments which the government have sarcastically dubbed the `MUA here to stay' provisions, we moved them because we see the opportunity, if left unchecked, for the terms and conditions of Australian workers—not simply those engaged in the maritime industry but also those engaged in, for instance, the transport industry—to be undermined if there is a regular contracting out or at least reflagging of vessels under foreign flags for the purpose of avoiding Australian industrial conditions. That was the purpose of our amendments. 
As I understand the substance of the Democrat amendments, the minister said that they seek to restrict the discretion—we would say `guide the discretion'—of the commission in the event of a transmission of business situation to allow a variation of established conditions contained in the certified agreement if the parties to the agreement agree that they should be so varied or if there is no disadvantage—I gather that is an overall disadvantage—in the terms and conditions of employment or if the variation is part of a reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term crisis. I recall that the Letona factory was an instance where the commission did that. 
As I understand the position in the Senate, the Labor opposition supported the Democrat amendments because they provided an appropriate guidance to the exercise of discretion by the commission. So, again, we say that the government should accept those amendments as being a reasonable proposition. In summary, the opposition opposes the government's motion and believes that these amendments are practical and worth while and should be adopted.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—I do not propose to long detain the House on this question. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003 is a modest one, and I do not think it requires an enormous amount of further discussion at this stage. The bill seeks to codify and strengthen provisions in the Workplace Relations Act regarding contempt of the commission. A number of members opposite pointed out in the course of debate: `As far as we are aware, contempt of the commission has been a dead-letter issue. There have been no prosecutions for contempt of the commission.' But I regret to inform the House that there have indeed been plenty of contempts of the commission; it is just that there have been no prosecutions. The reason there have been no prosecutions is that the existing provisions are not entirely clear and do not contain sufficient penalties. I repeat: there have been numerous contempts of the commission over the years.
The Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry made reference to numerous contempts of the commission or numerous actions and events that would under any reasonable understanding of the law be contempt of the commission. The Patricia Baleen industrial dispute late last year, a strike lasting almost two months, continued despite two section 127 return to work orders of the commission. I believe on any reasonable interpretation of the law they were contempts, and it ought to be possible to prosecute those contempts much more readily than it currently seems to be.
The whole point of this bill is to ensure that the commission is respected. Members of this House often stand here and extol the merits, virtues and importance of the commission. I think they are right to emphasise the respect in which the commission should be held, but the commission will not be respected if there are not consequences for defying the commission. That is why this bill is necessary. In debating this bill, members opposite rhetorically posed the question: what is a little bit of defiance of the commission between friends in the workplace relations system? I do not believe it is ever right to defy a properly constituted court. It is never right to act in defiance of a quasi-judicial body such as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That is why this bill is important and deserves the support of the House.

—Report 53 contains the findings of the inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into nine treaty actions, tabled in the parliament on 14 May 2003 and 17 June 2003, relating to the matters identified in the title of the report. A further treaty action proposing amendments to the annex to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, including consideration and adoption of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, was also tabled on 14 May 2003. The committee believes that this treaty warrants further investigation and has informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs accordingly.
The agreement with Sri Lanka for the promotion and protection of investments aims to encourage and facilitate bilateral investments by citizens, permanent residents and companies of Australia and Sri Lanka. The agreement is intended to put Australian investors in a better position to benefit from investment opportunities in Sri Lanka by providing them with a range of guarantees relating to non-commercial risk.
The committee also supports the social security agreements with Belgium, Chile and Slovenia which essentially address gaps in social security coverage and provide for portability of benefits from one country to another. They predominantly cover age pensions, disability support pensions for people who are severely disabled and survivors' pensions. While the agreements have several features in common, they also cover specific entitlements, such as Chilean pension of mercy payments.
The agreement with Timor-Leste relating to the unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour fields provides a comprehensive framework for the joint development of the Sunrise and Troubadour fields, together known as the Greater Sunrise field, which straddles an international boundary. The significance of the international unitisation agreement is that it is the framework which will allow the commercial exploitation of the Greater Sunrise field to proceed. It addresses matters such as the administration of the field, taxation, employment and training, and safety and health, as well as customs, security and environmental protection.
The committee recognises that International Labour Organisation conventions Nos 83, 85 and 86, which apply only to Norfolk Island, are no longer relevant to Australia. The committee found that these denunciations ensure that International Labour Organisation conventions that are no longer relevant to our circumstances form part of Australia's regulatory structures.
Among the proposed treaty actions tabled on 17 June and supported by the committee was the agreement on medical treatment for temporary visitors with the Kingdom of Norway. This bilateral reciprocal health care agreement enables visiting residents of one country to access the public health system of the other and to obtain any treatment that is immediately necessary prior to travelling home. This particular agreement covers public hospital care, pharmaceutical care and out-of-hospital care.
The committee also supports the Convention on Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, which will establish a commission to manage and conserve such fish stocks and promote their optimum utilisation and sustainable use. The committee recommends that, through preparatory conferences, Australia supports and encourages the aim of ensuring that countries that are proposed as members of this body ratify the United Nations fish stocks agreement. The committee was concerned about an apparent conflict in the principles that the commission will follow in adopting conservation measures between best scientific evidence and a precautionary approach. The committee considers that the notion of `precautionary approach' is ill defined and recommends that, in future, Australia seeks to give preference to more rigorous language, such as that contained in article 5(b) relating to best scientific evidence. 
The treaty action concerning the Fulbright agreement amends one provision. It provides that members of the board of the directors of the Australia-American Fulbright Commission are appointed for two years instead of the current one year. The committee believes that the amendment will result in the board operating more efficiently and effectively. In conclusion, it is the view of the committee that it is in the interests of Australia for all the treaties considered in report 53to be ratified, and the committee has made its recommendations accordingly.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—by leave—I commend the report to the House and would like to make some additional comments. In relation to the agreement with Sri Lanka for the promotion and protection of investments, I suggest that the committee understands that Australian educational institutions have already been established in Sri Lanka. There is also the opportunity for further development of investment initiatives in education between Sri Lanka and Australia, and the agreement would facilitate the growth in joint venture educational enterprises between both countries.
The three social security agreements—with Belgium, Chile and Slovenia—are in addition to Australia's existing network of 13 international social security agreements. The committee believes it is important that Australian residents are made aware of their rights under such international social security agreements. Further, Centrelink acknowledge that some people who have come into contact with them did not know about these agreements. While Centrelink noted that this was an issue, it has sometimes been quite difficult contacting people who may be eligible for benefits but who have not previously come into contact with Centrelink.
In relation to the agreement with Timor-Leste relating to the unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour fields, the committee tabled its report on the Timor Sea Treaty late last year. In that report the committee emphasised the importance of the international unitisation agreement arising from article 9 of that treaty, providing a framework which will allow for commercial development of the Greater Sunrise field to proceed. In the committee's 49th report, it also emphasised the importance of the Australian government in ensuring that occupational health and safety environmental standards that prevail in the JPDA are equivalent or superior to those applying in Australian jurisdictions already. The committee reiterates that these issues should be given prominence in the unit area to which the IUA applies. It was also acknowledged that the original treaty allows for ongoing negotiations in relation to the maritime boundary dispute. I believe those negotiations are currently being undertaken.
In relation to the agreement on medical treatment for temporary visitors from the Kingdom of Norway, the committee is concerned that the limited data collection and monitoring of eligible patients in Australia and Norway does not provide a realistic picture of the costs incurred by the agreement. The committee also recognises that, although there are a few situations in which Australians travelling to Norway could dispense with the need to take out travel insurance, there are significant benefits to people who are ineligible through age or pre-existing medical conditions for travel insurance cover. The committee, therefore, supports the agreement and urges the department to implement effective measures for accurate monitoring of usage under that agreement. 
With regard to the Convention on Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, I support the chair's comments in that the precautionary approach has not been defined with sufficient clarity in the treaty text. The committee believes that this could undermine the implementation of effective conservation measures by the commission. The establishment of the commission is critical, as there has been a move of the fishing capacity by distant water-fishing nations from the Northern Hemisphere into the western and central part of the Pacific Ocean. I acknowledge that we have a number of representatives of the fishing industry currently in the House.

"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-08-19,"—I rise to oppose the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003, and I do so with what I believe to be the support of 90-odd per cent of country people. There have been a number of surveys done across a range of states and electorates, and I understand there are currently surveys being done in a number of key rural seats in both New South Wales and Queensland—some being carried out by private organisations, others being carried out, I believe, by the Democrats—to ascertain the views of people in relation to the full sale of Telstra. There is no doubt in my mind that the National Party, in particular, and the Country Liberals have deserted country voters on this issue.
If there were ever an issue that was going to negate distance as being a disadvantage for people living in the country, this is it. If we do not get this communication technology right; if we do not make it equitable to country people; if we do not provide country people with an equal footing in relation to future technology, we will leave our children and grandchildren a legacy of not only the distance factor but also the cost factor that we have become accustomed to in country areas. This is the one piece of legislation that should be rejected by the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents in the Senate if they want to do an enormous service to country people. It is the one piece of legislation for which the National Party and Country Liberals should have been the anchor for country people. It is the one piece of legislation since I have been in this parliament that could make an enormous difference—in a negative sense if passed and in a positive sense if rejected—to the livelihood of country people in the future.
I see it as not only the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill; it is more like the Telstra transition to the end of the National Party as we know it. That may well be one of the positives that come out of it. This debate has been going for four hours and one National Party member has spoken. You look at the list of speakers and, despite the importance of this vote, three National Party members are going to speak. 
—Appalling!
—It is appalling, as the member for Lowe said. There are certain things that I will raise later in terms of the promises that the government has given, which may interest the member for Lowe. There are three members of the National Party to speak on this issue, with the leader and deputy leader absent—not interested. They could not care; they are just leaving it to drift through, with most other members doing the same thing. I compliment, though, the member for Hume, Alby Schultz, for at least having the guts and tenacity to listen to his constituents and ask them about the issue, whereas many other people have changed their view, including the member for Riverina and the member for Dawson, whom I complimented in a speech about a year ago for the way they were relating to this bill within the party room and within the public arena. At least Alby Schultz has the guts to maintain his view, whereas many others have gone to water and have not even bothered to come into this chamber to speak to their constituents and argue why this piece of legislation should go through the parliament.
—Shame!
—It is a shame, as the member for Lowe said. I think it is a disgrace and they should be condemned. As I said earlier, many surveys have been done on the full privatisation of Telstra. The member for Calare has done a survey that indicated something like 96 per cent of his constituents are against it. The member for Kennedy conducted a similar survey with roughly the same numbers. I did a survey last year and, I think, 98 per cent of my constituents were against the sale with about 6,000 households responding. The member for Hume is doing a survey and I think about 92 per cent of his electorate is saying a similar thing. I am currently conducting another survey within my electorate and have asked for the survey forms to be returned by 24 August. As of 19 August 2003, the running sheet for the survey indicates that 7,408 households have responded and, of those, 7,143 say that they do not want the full privatisation of Telstra. That is 7,143 households out of 7,408, which is well up into 97 or 98 per cent opposition to the sale.
Of those in support of the sale, 111 households have indicated that they would support the full sale of Telstra, 58 are undecided or do not care—they were given a number of options: want it sold, do not want it sold, do not care or undecided—and 96 have filled out the form incompletely and had their replies considered as informal. There were 154 households that were either undecided or could not fill out their form correctly, against 111 that wanted the full privatisation to go ahead. So not only is my electorate of New England opposed to the full sale but other surveys done in other electorates are showing similar results.
I do not think it is just country people saying this. I think if a survey were done of city people it would probably come up with 60 per cent in favour of retaining Telstra. I think the Labor Party is on the right track in relation to this issue. I noticed the other day that the shadow minister for communications, Lindsay Tanner, was saying that the Labor Party is the only party that has been opposed to the full sale of Telstra from the inception. That is not quite true. In fact, in their policies the Greens have always maintained full opposition to the sale of Telstra. I compliment those two parties for the way in which they have maintained their views. I hope that other senators will vote against this bill in the Senate. I think they will. All indications are that the Democrats are opposed to the full privatisation. 
I have been told in recent days that the One Nation senator, Len Harris, is opposed to the full sale of Telstra. I hope Len maintains that view. A lot of people threw a lot of mud at One Nation during its infancy. Len is the product of their vote in the current parliament, and I think he and the people who supported him have absolutely no doubt that those who voted for One Nation, to get Len into the Senate, would be fully opposed to the full privatisation of Telstra. I hope that Len would represent that view, which is not only the view of the people who have voted for him but also one he has expressed on a number of occasions. I hope also that the Independents in the Senate—Senators Harradine, Murphy and Lees—will also oppose the legislation. This piece of proposed legislation is a real test of what the Senate is all about.
A significant minority group—30 per cent of the vote—in our nation has been essentially ignored by those who represent it: the National Party and the Country Liberals. That is a strategic position that has been taken by the government. That decision has been taken within a cabinet that has assumed, with the Labor Party in some degree of political disarray, that they can make a very hard decision—a decision that their country members do not agree with—and get away with it. I can assure you that they will not get away with this, because I do not think it will get through the Senate. If it were unfortunate enough to get through the Senate, I think you would see a reaction in country Australia in relation to the Senate ticket. That will allow people to carry out another survey, a survey of their own about whether the people they put into the Senate really care about their views on this issue. That is a survey where people will, if it comes to that, be able to make some decisions in terms of their so-called representatives in this parliament and in the Senate.
The strategy that the government is using—believing that the Labor Party, being in some disarray, will not be able to gather momentum before the election, so the government can make a difficult decision and impose it on country people—is, in my view, a high-risk strategy. I think you will see a number of the National Party people who support this legislation challenged at the next election in the House of Representatives. As I said, if the Independents and minor parties in the Senate were in some way swayed through bribery and some degree of coercion to support this, I think you would see country people who may well have voted for those people in the past expressing their views quite strongly in a pro-Telstra, pro-country Senate ticket. 
The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, has been casting a lot of aspersions and words about a number of people. Everybody who says anything against the sale of Telstra is, in his view, fair game. He has criticised my survey, which nearly 7,500 households have responded to. He says that my survey is biased and he disagrees with some of the facts elaborated in the survey. I would like to refute those criticisms for the public record. The front page of my survey says, `The full sale of Telstra is not inevitable. You can do something about it.' Quite obviously it is not inevitable. If you want it sold, it is not inevitable. It has to get through the Senate. If you do not want it sold, it is not inevitable, because it has to get through the Senate. I am pleased to see that one of the National Party members, who is not on the speaker's list, has just entered the chamber. Maybe he will be able to identify the reasons why he is supporting this legislation. I speak of Larry Anthony, a man whose father would never have allowed this sort of circumstance to occur— 
 (Mr Barresi)—The member will refer to other members by their correct title or by their seats.
—I cannot think of his correct title, but I do remember that his father was a man of great regard and would never have allowed the Liberals to do this to what used to be the Country Party, in those far-off days. He never would have allowed it. The minister for communications takes me to task over the facts that are in the survey. I will read the facts out. Fact 1 says, `The government cannot bind future governments to any guarantee of future services.' Those are the Prime Minister's words, not mine. Fact 2 says, `The government received a $1.4 billion share of Telstra's profits for the year 2002.' Those are the Treasurer's words, not mine. If they are biased, they are biased on the part of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Fact 3 is about problems with `Internet access and speed and no absolute guarantee of future technology for country people.' The Prime Minister said that as well. Constitutionally, one government cannot bind a future government. 
Fact 4 says, `The government cannot bind a private company to provide the latest technology at affordable prices to country people, so what is up to scratch now may not be up to scratch in 10 years time.' Obviously you cannot, through contractual arrangement, bind a private company to provide technology that has not even been invented yet. I would like to see someone with some knowledge explain to me how that is going to be done. I am not suggesting that it is not possible to do in terms of some sort of legislative phase, but if you expect a private company to enter into an arrangement that is open-ended in 10, 20 or 30 years time, you have got to be kidding yourself. Fact 5 says, `Even John Anderson says we won't know the full impact of a sale for 10 to 15 years.'
—The member for New England!
—The Deputy Prime Minister, rather—and he is not even going to be bothered speaking in this debate. He was sitting next to Senator Alston when he made that comment. What a pathetic way to make policy: to actually say to the public, when you are releasing the draft of the bill, that we will not know the result of this for 10 or 15 years.
—Shame!
—Isn't that an absolute disgrace? Someone who is actually sitting beside the minister who had carriage of the bill says to the press—and is quite proud of it—that we will not know the result of this for 10 or 15 years. No wonder the Doug Anthonys of this world are ashamed of what is happening in this parliament. Senator Alston says that community service obligations will be bound in legislation. He says, `Trust us, it will be okay; don't you worry about it.' I would like to refer the parliament to Senator Alston's press release, where he has a go at my survey. He says:
For example, the Survey forms lists as a “fact” that the Australian Government is unable to bind future governments to any guarantee of future services, but Mr Windsor knows that services are guaranteed by legislation, and that legislation does bind future governments unless they change it.
Isn't that something?
`... and that legislation does bind future governments unless they change it.'
That is about the security we have got on this. He is talking about future governments. You do not even need to be in a future government, which you cannot bind, to have the rules changed. I would refer the parliament—and particularly the senators who might take some interest in what I am about to say—to a similar privatisation that took place a while back: that of Sydney airport. 
—I know all about it.
—The member for Lowe would know all about that. Prior to the privatisation I was quite involved because I had concerns about regional issues. I know the member for Lowe and others had concerns about noise issues. There were certain guarantees given by the government and the ministers in charge—Anderson, Minchin and others. With those guarantees they were saying, `Look, trust us. This will be guaranteed by legislation. We will legislate that noise control, access and all these sorts of things will be set in concrete. They will happen.'
—What happened?
—Two days after the sale—and I refer the House to Thursday, 27 June 2002—minister for finance Nick Minchin also conceded that a future government—this is a future government after a privatisation; the similarities between this and Telstra are enormously close—would be open to try to change existing regulations. He conceded that. On the Seven Network Senator Minchin said that those caps and curfews were in legislation and they would not change: `The company cannot change them; only the parliament can change those limits'. Obviously, we cannot bind future governments but I cannot imagine any government in the future changing those rules. Isn't that similar to what Senator Alston has recently said? 
The Prime Minister in this chamber said, in answer to a question that I raised about our Constitution, that we cannot bind future governments to decisions that are made now. Look at what the government is doing in relation to the Kingsford Smith privatisation. We are not in future government mode at the moment—yet, after that 747 plane had brake problems in relation to the curfew, the current Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, is reconsidering the rules. He has asked that the rules be reconsidered to see whether something can be done to vary them so that the problems with brakes will not occur into the future. I use that by way of example. You do not have to wait for the next government to have the rules changed. It can happen within a term of government.
Essentially, people do not trust the government. People want Telstra to be maintained in some degree of public ownership so that the political imperative can be relayed through their members of parliament to make sure that services are delivered. There is a whole range of issues. I think it is an absolute insult that the government is saying that $45 million a year will make everything okay. I think $45 million a year comes out at about $9 a taxpayer. The government is prepared to spend $7,000 of taxpayers' money on the new home owners and $9 for a country vote—$9 to sell off Telstra. That is absolutely pathetic. I cannot understand why country members of parliament would endorse that.
If you look at the financials of the business, as the shadow minister has done, Telstra has a 20.8 per cent return on assets and 32.1 per cent return on equity, and it pays $3 billion in dividends—half that going to government. What are we talking about when the dividend gained is greater than the interest that would be lost through the sale? Why are we even talking about the sale of an asset like this? If the government says there are protections, just remember HIH. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—I rise today to speak to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003. As a member who represents a regional area in New South Wales, I am pleased to be speaking on this legislation—legislation that will ultimately be to the benefit of my constituents. Telecommunications in this country have moved to a new era since this coalition came to power. There has never been a government like this government—that has had the commitment and initiative to actually tackle the hard issues facing regional areas and that has backed telecommunications with safeguards such as universal service obligations and the customer service guarantee.  
The success of that initiative is clear when you look at what is happening in my electorate of Paterson and the benefits that consumers have gained through competition. The proceeds of T1 and T2 have gone into improving telecommunications services and every other worthwhile program. The environment is a big winner from the T1 sale with the $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust program. This is the biggest monetary commitment that any government has ever made to the environment. Thousands of projects in local communities have received funding as a result of this, including the Wallis Lake Catchment plan, which received more than $350,000 in funding to help manage this beautiful and economically important catchment area. 
Proceeds from the sale of T1 also went into the Networking the Nation program. This program has been a great success and has funded a number of projects in the Paterson electorate such as the Dungog Learning and Technology Centre and the Port Stephens Telecentre, which provides Internet access and computer training. The sale of T2 has also led to a number of benefits to consumers in my electorate: $150 million went to untimed local calls in extended zones—a first for these areas in Australia—and $120 million was allocated for TV Black Spot programs, which has brought TV reception for residents in Forster and soon into Stroud, Pacific Palms and Smiths Lake. In addition, the reception issues of the Tomaree Peninsula—including transmission towers which have been delayed due to spectrum availability problems—will hopefully be addressed through the alternative technology solutions program. More than $83,000 was delivered to the Forster project, which means that residents can now watch five free-to-air TV channels without the snowy, ghosting pictures they had previously. Over $750,000 has been allocated to install the transmitters previously mentioned at Pacific Palms, Smiths Lake, Stroud and the Tomaree Peninsula, once planning issues are addressed by local and state government authorities. Funding also went into other projects, such as the $25 million for improving mobile phone coverage on national highways, including the Pacific Highway. As a result of this, Vodafone were able to build a tower at Nerong to improve coverage to this part of the highway. 
What this legislation to privatise Telstra will do is remove the conflict of interest that currently exists with the government on one hand being the one who makes the laws and rules that govern the telecommunications industry and then on the other hand having a direct financial stake in Telstra. It is also important to note that protections on total foreign ownership in Telstra will be put in place, limiting it to a maximum of 35 per cent of its listed capital, with a maximum holding by any individual foreigner or foreign company of five per cent. Importantly, this legislation will benefit the 1.8 million Australians who have shares in Telstra, as it will allow Telstra to realise its full potential and, further, it will allow the government to pay off more debt that was left behind by the previous Labor government.
Let us not forget Labor's record when it comes to debt. This government has paid off more than $60 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt, thanks in part to the sale of Telstra. That is a saving of almost $5 billion each year in interest alone. Under Labor, debt peaked at around 20 per cent of Australia's GDP and that has now dropped to around five per cent. In fact, Labor's spending got so out of control that in its last year it was spending more on interest payments than it was on education. That is an important point to note: Labor was prepared to spend more on interest servicing the debt of this country that it had racked up than it was on education. It is a record that Australians have to be constantly reminded of, particularly when the opposition's current mantra towards the government is `just say no'. 
Unfortunately, we have had to listen to Labor for a number of years now peddling the line that they would never sell Telstra. But I think the Australian public has a better memory than the ALP will give it credit for. People should not believe Labor's rhetoric on Telstra because they have a history of selling off public assets. They promised in the share prospectus that they would not sell any more of the Commonwealth Bank and yet they turned around and did just that. Labor sold off Qantas, one of the greatest airlines in the world.
When they were in power they wrote a proposal to sell 100 per cent of Telstra and did not tell the public about it. More recently, they have considered splitting up Telstra and selling off its assets. The shadow minister, Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, is in the chamber. I remember well the paper he put together on the splitting up of Telstra. For him to come into this chamber and dictate to this government that Telstra should never be sold is hypocritical. Australians know only too well that Labor cannot be trusted when it comes to Telstra or the financial affairs of the nation. They have lied before; they will do it again.
I think it is important in this debate to talk briefly about the benefits that have come to consumers thanks to the competition in the telecommunications industry, which was opened up in 1997. The number of telecommunications companies has grown from three to 89, and 40 per cent of those offer services in regional Australia. According to the Australian Communications Authority, telecommunications prices have fallen by 24.8 per cent since 1996. A dollar is a dollar and in the bush every dollar is hard earned. When telecommunications prices fall by 24.8 per cent, that is something people in my area understand only too well.
For example, mobile phone call costs have dropped by 27.4 per cent. The cost of a local call has dropped by 29.1 per cent. Long distance call costs have dropped by 29.6 per cent. International call costs have dropped by a massive 61.2 per cent. Why? Because of competition. My constituents remember only too well the high cost of phone calls to regional centres from outlying areas—the high level STD rates from Nelson Bay to Newcastle or from Gloucester to Maitland or Taree. These costs are more competitive—more affordable—under the coalition reforms. The Regional Telecommunications Inquiry stated:
Satellite handsets are now available from approximately $1000 compared with more than $5000 in 1997. Call costs have also decreased ...
The cost of making a call from a satellite phone is roughly the same now as a call from a digital phone three years ago. Prices are coming down and what is important for those who talk about coverage is that satellite covers 100 per cent of the globe, let alone my local area. Neither a government nor any communications supplier could ever afford to build the number of transmission towers required in my electorate due to the topography. Here we have a solution: satellite communications.
As a result of competition in this industry, Australia's economy is $10 billion larger and there are an additional 100,000 jobs. But there are also improvements that have been made in the Paterson electorate that I would like to mention—for example, the mobile phone towers that have been installed and upgraded in Dungog, Gloucester and Port Stephens. Last week I attended the opening of the Gresford CDMA tower, which has brought improved mobile reception to this part of the Hunter. It means that you can now drive between Maitland and Gresford and have continuous CDMA coverage the entire way. It is an example of just one project that is happening in a regional area that is a direct result of this government's commitment to improving services. 
I make special mention here of the tremendous work that Gresford resident Ted Murrell, Dungog Shire Council staff and Mayor Steve Low have done on this project. I also mention the mid-North Coast Telstra Country Wide staff, including the general manager, Jim Atkins; Rowan Saunders; and Telstra Country Wide in Maitland. Without their efforts this project would never have been completed. I congratulate them all on such a great job. But the job to complete the construction of a number of towers in Paterson is not quite finished yet. The tower at Vacy will be officially opened in the beginning of September, which should boost the signal through the Gresford and Vacy area. The Pacific Palms and Smiths Lake towers, which will provide both CDMA and GSM coverage, should be commissioned by December. These towers, however, have been delayed not by the federal government nor by Telstra but by local and state government planning authorities
The towers at Medowie, Anna Bay, Fingal Bay and Williamtown should also be commissioned by December 2003, again subject to state and local planning approvals. The Medowie and Williamtown towers will provide GSM coverage, the Anna Bay tower will have CDMA and the Fingal Bay tower will have CDMA and GSM. Stroud should have their tower up and running in the next month, which will provide much needed CDMA coverage in the area, particularly along the Bucketts Way.
I will now take time to give credit for the Stroud phone tower and TV transmission tower to Paul Downey. Paul passed away recently but he made an enormous contribution—he was the champion in getting this tower up and running. I understand the tower is very close to completion and it is a project that the Stroud-Booral Progress Association has worked hard on and deserves to be credited for. 
The Brandy Hill tower is likely to be commissioned by November and will provide much needed CDMA coverage in that area. The Karuah tower that will provide CDMA and GSM coverage will be up and running in line with the Pacific Highway reconstruction. This is an enormous undertaking for one electorate and the mid-North Coast office of Telstra Country Wide should be congratulated for their efforts. They have officers and technicians out in the field finding locations for these towers, negotiating with landholders and working on the councils just to get the job done. It is a great effort and once completed the towers will cover every major centre in Paterson.
Last week at the opening at Gresford, farmers were telling me that it used to be difficult to try and call people during office hours, particularly when they were working out in the paddock away from the house phone. Now we have heard comments from the farmers that they can be out and about on the farm doing what they do for a living and can answer calls, thanks to this improved reception. It can save an enormous amount of time for these people and they have a direct benefit from improved telecommunication services. 
But the benefits are not just to mobile phone reception; there are also other services that have been rolled out over recent years and will continue to be rolled out in coming years. ADSL is being rolled out in Paterson and is now available in Nelson Bay, Raymond Terrace, Medowie, Seaham, Soldiers Point and Tanilba Bay. More than 80 per cent of exchanges in Paterson have ISDN. Internet access has been improved in areas such as Dungog, Tea Gardens and Gloucester, where residents have had issues such as interference from radios, electric fences and line faults. 
Residents in Paterson also benefit from mobile satellite phones. The government has already introduced a satellite handset subsidy for people living in areas where it is not feasible due to problem mobile phone coverage. In response to the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry, the government is going to review the eligibility guidelines for this scheme and it will provide an additional $4 million to extend the subsidy. In fact, the government recently committed an extra $181 million to implement all 39 recommendations from this inquiry. This will mean, for example, a comprehensive national broadband strategy; improving Telstra's worst performing exchange services; continuing the Internet Assistance Program; upgrading old radio concentrator phone systems; and improving the quality of phone services and dial-up Internet speeds on poorly performing systems. All of these things will be done, regardless of whether or not this legislation goes through. The government has made a commitment that every one of the 39 recommendations will be delivered—and delivered in full.
The consumer safeguards that are already in place will remain in place regardless of whether this bill goes through. These safeguards ensure that phone services remain affordable and that phone companies abide by service standards. They are among the toughest safeguards in the world and involve the universal service obligation, customer service guarantees, the network reliability framework, the priority assistance arrangements and retail price controls on Telstra. Regardless of who owns Telstra, all phone companies will continue to be subject to these safeguards.
Labor will no doubt continue their line of `just say no to everything this government tries to do', regardless of whether or not telecommunications services have improved. But how long are they going to let this conflict of interest continue, where the government sets the rules for the telecommunications company and yet has a direct financial interest in making sure that Telstra's profits are maximised? Simply put: the Labor Party would have it believed that they have put the case, without reasons as to why no should be the answer—but they have failed on that. In fact, the Labor Party have a hidden agenda. That agenda is to hold the sale off until they come to power. Once in power, they will put the privatisation of Telstra on the table and take the money and do what they did with all of the proceeds from Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank.
Their inability to manage the financial affairs of our country has been proven—they just spend, spend and spend without any consideration of the better economic welfare of this country. They proved that with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Qantas. Heaven help us if they get the same amount of money from the sale of Telstra! What would they do with it? They would argue that that money goes to the benefit of all Australians. But the problem is that Labor would get caught up in a spending loop and all of a sudden we would again have spiralling debt—spiralling debt which led to high inflation rates and high interest rates, that penalised every home owner with a mortgage in Australia and that stopped young people being able to afford to buy their own home. 
—That occurred when there was a budget surplus, you idiot!
 (Mr Barresi)—Order! The member for Melbourne will withdraw that statement.
—I withdraw.
—We have a shadow minister who has an inability to control his language. Imagine what he would do if he were in charge of Telstra. It again proves that Labor have an inability to control finances, an inability to control their actions and a proven track record of misleading the public on their intentions with regard to privatisation. As I said, we remember the hidden agenda—there was to be no sale of the Commonwealth Bank and no public announcement of the sale of Qantas until it was too late.
The shadow minister has already proven that he intends to do something with Telstra. What he intends to do is split it up and privatise it. That will damage the financial future of all Telstra shareholders—all the mums and dads who have gone into the investor market. If this shadow minister had a considered view in relation to those mums and dads, those shareholders, he would understand that this is the best direction and that, in telecommunications competition, it is best to allow market forces to take direction, provided there are government guarantees. I believe, and my constituents I have spoken to believe, that these safeguards have been put in place for the betterment of telecommunications services. They can see the improvements that have occurred under this government in pricing, access and speed—and that will continue.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—Listening to the previous speaker on the government side, the member for Paterson, has demonstrated to me the difference between us. We listen to what our constituents have to say to us. We hear the message that each and every one of us has been getting: that is, the people of Australia, the people whom we represent in this House, want Telstra to remain in majority public ownership. We do not live in fairyland. We do not try to justify our actions by attacking those on the other side of the House. Rather, we listen to what people have to say and then look at what is best for Australia as a whole.
Labor oppose this legislation because we believe it is imperative that Telstra remains in public ownership. On this side of the parliament we believe that the only way to ensure an adequate and affordable telecommunications service with equitable access to that service for all Australians is for the Commonwealth to retain 50.1 per cent equity in Telstra. The majority ownership of Telstra should remain with the Commonwealth of Australia—or, should I say, with the Australian people, because they are the ones who have the majority ownership of Telstra now. What better way is there to ensure that Telstra meets the needs of Australians than if its majority owners are the people of Australia?
Put in that context it is easy to see why the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 is an extremely important piece of legislation that will change the way telecommunications operate in Australia, just as the introduction of the GST—which the government promised it would never, ever introduce—changed the way we in Australia pay tax.
One of the responsibilities of government is to ensure equal access to services and that groups and individuals within the Australian community are not disadvantaged. Unfortunately, the legislation we have before us today fails to ensure equity of access to telecommunications for all Australians, which I spoke about earlier. Australians living in regional and rural areas are permanently disadvantaged when it comes to telecommunications. People in regional and rural Australia currently have an inferior telecommunications system to that of those living in Sydney and Melbourne. That is an unquestionable fact. When travelling in regional Australia the lack of service becomes very apparent. The previous speaker, the member for Paterson, mentioned places in his electorate such as Stroud and Gloucester. I had occasion to visit that area recently and I noticed that there was no mobile phone coverage. This is what the people who live in the Paterson electorate are faced with each and every day. The member for Paterson has whitewashed this situation and said that it will improve in the future. He blames the poor service on the topography or whatever else he can find to use as an excuse. This is happening in his electorate to the people he represents in this parliament. His electorate is very close to my own.  
The member for New England, who has also contributed to this debate, identified the problems. He stood up in this parliament and fought for the people he represents. He knows why he has been elected to this parliament: to listen to what the people in New England have to say and to fight for them in this House. What a different approach taken by these speakers!
I turn now to my own electorate, the Shortland electorate. I cannot drive from one end of my electorate to the other without losing mobile coverage. If I walk across the road from my office in Belmont to the supermarket, which is right in the heart of the electorate, I cannot get mobile phone coverage. There is inadequate coverage throughout Australia. There are pockets where you cannot access mobile phone coverage, and people in those areas are extremely disadvantaged. Yet the government says that the service is of a high standard and that no-one in Australia will be disadvantaged. I argue strongly against that. I will stand up in this parliament and argue on behalf of the people I represent. The majority of people who have approached me on this issue have said, `Whatever you do, fight against the further privatisation of Telstra.' I, like my colleagues on this side of the House, do listen to constituents.
There are a number of problems being experienced in regional and rural areas throughout Australia. I mentioned the issue of mobile phone coverage earlier but there are other issues such as faults in phone lines and the length of time it takes to have those faults corrected. I will give a couple of examples in a moment of problems within my own electorate where there have been outages and workers have had to be brought in from other areas in Australia. Recently in the Hunter and Central Coast areas of New South Wales, which is where the electorate of Shortland is, a number of Telstra jobs have gone—workers have been sacked. Along with that we have had a deterioration of service. So when there is a fault, an outage, workers have to be brought in from as far away as Dubbo to fix the fault. That happened very recently. Staff from outside the area are paid $130 a day in travelling allowance above their wages and for excess travelling time. They are pressured into working overtime. On Fridays they are sent SMS messages to say that they have to work on Saturday, and there is absolutely no flexibility at all to change their rostered days off. This situation has arisen because of the enormous cuts to staff numbers within Telstra. Added to that is the fact that the network has been allowed to run down by this government in its quest to privatise Telstra. There is the prospect of a further 3,000 workers being sacked and a further 4,200 jobs going. And we have the government saying, `Let's privatise Telstra. Let's sell it off. We've got the service up and running and it is as good as it should be.' Yet we have these problems with outages and workers having to come in from all around Australia. 
On the Central Coast there was an incident where sensitive network cables were being protected from water damage by plastic bags because Telstra simply does not have the staff to repair the boxes and cover the wires. Telstra has cut costs and cut corners. As a result of that, services are affected. If Telstra is sold, things will only get worse. As I have said, more workers will lose their jobs, the infrastructure will be allowed to deteriorate further and there will be less investment in capital works. We have seen the Besley and Estens inquiries, and the government has ignored the substantive submissions to those inquiries. The Estens inquiry was a whitewash, a sham, conducted by a friend of the Deputy Prime Minister. I really believe that the members of the National Party in this parliament stand condemned for not representing their constituency in the way that their constituency expects them to. When speaking to people in regional and rural areas in Australia you find that they are very concerned about the impact of further privatisation, faults with their phone lines not being fixed immediately, the lack of Telstra workers in their area, poor access to broadband and inadequate dial-up Internet speed.
Those two facts are very important when you consider where we are in the world, when you consider technology and when you consider the access to knowledge and learning that computer technology provides to people. Without that, you are disadvantaged. So this is another area and another way in which the people living in rural and regional Australia are being disadvantaged by the government's action in attempting to further privatise Telstra.
You might ask: what is the main reason that we should not sell Telstra? I would say, first and foremost, the main reason not to sell Telstra is that the people of Australia do not want it sold. Throughout Australia, we are being told that Telstra should remain in majority public ownership. The member for Hume recently conducted a survey, and 96 per cent of the people within his electorate said that Telstra should remain in majority public ownership. The member for New England has also conducted a survey, with similar results. Within my electorate, people are constantly telling me that, at all costs, the Labor Party must prevent Telstra being further privatised. It is not an option. This is something that will greatly disadvantage the people of Australia, particularly the people in regional Australia.
We only have to look to New York and the recent electricity outages to see what happens when important public infrastructure is privatised. It is allowed to run down and, as a consequence, all the people living in those communities, states and countries are disadvantaged. We can see the impact that the privatisation of electricity has had in Victoria and how the people in that state have been disadvantaged. It is the same old story. You allow the infrastructure to run down so you can maximise your profit, and the people who lose out are the people who are using the service. We do not want that to happen with Telstra. We do not want that to happen with our telecommunications. That is one of the major reasons why we oppose this. The cost of telecommunications will obviously increase if Telstra is privatised. As the shadow minister said during the last speaker's contribution, the cost of line rental has increased immensely since this government started down the track of privatising Telstra, and that will only increase further if there is any further privatisation of Telstra. The bottom line with privatisation is that you get a poorer service and you pay more for it. 
So why would you sell Telstra, and what would it deliver to the people of Australia? The ideologues on the other side of the House have a philosophy that private is good, public is bad; therefore you must sell everything. Their approach to government is to sit back and govern Australia like a board of directors govern a company. It is a very hands-off approach. It is an approach that is designed not to deliver the best to Australia but just to let market forces determine where Australia goes. The result is that you end up with a system where some people are very disadvantaged, and that would definitely happen in the case of the further privatisation of Telstra.
If Telstra were privatised, it would be an enormous, privately owned monopoly. It would be able to manipulate the market and the social and political landscape, and it would have an enormous impact on Australian society. It would be very similar to the situation of banks, where banks are leaving towns and people in smaller regional areas are getting poorer services. A privatised Telstra would have the same level of power and monopoly position as Microsoft does in the US. Obviously, a privatised Telstra would introduce timed calls, and the discount schemes that exist for pensioners would immediately come under attack. It would be a situation where market forces rule, the strong survive and the weak are disadvantaged. Freedom of information would no longer be available and we would get more of those commercial-in-confidence responses, which means that companies could do whatever they liked and governments would have no control over them whatsoever. The public accountability of Telstra would be gone, and the only people assured of any public accountability would be those people who had an issue with Telstra prior to its sale. There is currently a ministerial power to direct. It is not being used, but the fact that it is there is a strong incentive for Telstra to do the right thing.
As I mentioned earlier, there are many reasons why we should not sell Telstra. At the opening of the 40th Parliament on 12 February 2002, the government said that it would not proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it was satisfied that arrangements were in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians. I would argue very strongly that they have not achieved that. That is the first reason why there should not be any further privatisation. Also, the government is currently getting a constant income from Telstra. Once Telstra is sold, that stream of income is gone forever. You get that one-off pot of money, and then you lose any future income. The fact that Telstra is a public utility is a very important thing to consider when we are looking at why it should not be sold.
There is one other matter that I think is probably fairly important to all Australians. It comes into that issue of the accountability and corporate responsibility of companies. The CEO of Telstra, Dr Ziggy Switkowski, recently was granted a one year's salary—$1 million—redundancy package.
—If he gets sacked.
—If he gets sacked; that is right. I think this indicates that there will be more of that. The fact is that Australian workers are never in a situation where, if they are sacked, they are going to be paid the outrageous sum of $1 million. They are never in a situation where they are going to be paid a year's salary. Rather, there is more of this corporate philosophy, this corporate mentality of looking after the people at the top. So, on one hand, Dr Switkowski is being looked after very well but, on the other hand, workers in every regional centre throughout Australia are being sacked—regional centres that are struggling to deliver adequate services to the people of Australia, even regional centres as close to Sydney as the Central Coast and the Hunter. The government is sacking them, with nowhere near the redundancy package that it is prepared to offer the CEO of Telstra. There will be more looking after the people at the top—looking after the CEO—and not being accountable to the people of Australia. 
The ALP have a very different position to the government. We believe that action should be taken immediately to turn around what the government has done to Telstra. We believe that Telstra needs to intensify its focus on its core responsibilities to the people of Australia. The Labor Party are committed to equity: equity of access and equity of service. We believe that no Australian should be disadvantaged because they live in regional Australia and we believe that the only way to ensure that this happens is if Telstra remains in majority public ownership. Labor oppose further privatisation of Telstra, the majority of Australians oppose any further privatisation of Telstra and the people of Shortland also oppose any further privatisation of Telstra.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—I will keep my remarks on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 relatively short. I am not inspired to respond to any remarks from the previous speaker because I am not quite sure how much of that actually had anything to do with what is before the parliament. This is not a chance to rewrite history and show that the Labor Party has finally woken up to some ways of improving telecommunications service. Most of the gains that the member for Shortland and certainly the shadow minister for communications, who is at the table, like to point to have been achieved under a coalition policy regime. Where they want to see more gains, they are looking at tools that the coalition government has put in place.
The similarity between comments, when you listen to speech after speech from the Labor Party, is amazing—it is quite remarkable. I read the Leader of the Opposition's speech on this subject, and I read the shadow minister's—and I am pleased to see that he has a good speech writer! 
—It was me.
—It sounded remarkably similar to the one the shadow minister presented, with its reiteration of the points that the shadow minister made. I guess message repetition helps, but it did not add anything. Congratulations to the shadow minister for writing such a well-constructed speech, albeit road-tested by his own contribution a little earlier.
The bill that is before the parliament seeks to remove the restriction that requires the Commonwealth to retain 51 per cent of the equity in Telstra, enabling its full sale at a time when it is prudent to do so—at a time when the government is satisfied that the quite remarkable gains in the telecommunications services available to all citizens in this country can be not only sustained but extended. What a great idea; what a great idea to keep that work going forward. The policy framework that the government has implemented has seen price reductions—contrary to what the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition said—of around 25 per cent, from the time the government was elected to 2002, and a remarkable enhancement in the technology and the choice of products and services that are available.
There are about 89 licensed carriers, compared to the three that we had in 1996. It has been a remarkable demonstration of how the rapidly changing telecommunications market, when understood by a government with a clear policy focus—not one of political opportunism and dribble, like the Labor Party branch speeches we have been hearing—that looks at what matters to consumers and what is in the best interests of the economy and pursues that, can deliver good results for everybody: a greater choice of providers, significantly lower prices and an increased range of services. What a fantastic story it is. 
What is being discussed tonight, though, is when the time is right to move further and reduce the share of equity in Telstra that the Commonwealth retains. It is quite remarkable that one of the opposition's key points is getting stuck into Telstra's share price. The shadow minister talked about shareholders taking a bath. Isn't it incredible that the ALP gloat about how their obstructionism and opportunism has damaged the share price of Telstra? They gloat about it. They gloat about the loss that some shareholders have incurred, when everybody knows that the current circumstances are unsustainable in the longer term and that if they were genuinely interested in the shareholders—genuinely interested in the national interest—they would support this package.
The shadow minister also said that he was worried about Telstra having a monopoly—that it was too powerful for any government to regulate—yet if you look at the performance and the results on the ground that presents a remarkably different story. The shadow minister said that a privatised Telstra would only be interested in `lucrative markets in the major cities', yet we know Telstra Country Wide has been so successful and profitable that it has been extended. So again the facts just scream down the nonsense that the Labor Party goes on about when it comes to the question of the privatisation of Telstra.
Telstra Country Wide is a profit centre in its own right. It is so successful that it is even coming to my part of the world, which I think is fantastic. And that is something that has been driven by the commercial focus of Telstra—namely, to make sure that they not only provide the most responsive service to their customers but put the infrastructure in place to explain the technological possibilities to consumers, and explore those possibilities with consumers, so they can get the telecommunications services they want at a price that they are happy with. That is a fantastic story, yet the Labor Party wants to talk about it as if something terrible was going on outside the major cities.
What has really got me is the shadow minister saying that Telstra would leave town faster than the banks. Is this acute irony? They talk about their own experience in privatising the Commonwealth Bank—but they gave no thought to revealing to the taxpayer plans to privatise that bank. The moral issues of integrity and disclosure of government policy and mandate matters that the opposition spokesman at the table goes on about were just shrouded in fog at that time. The Labor Party sold the Commonwealth Bank without even thinking of what the service consequences would be. The reason why so many branches `left town', to use the shadow minister's term, was that those opposite did nothing about such consequences. They made no effort whatsoever to contemplate the economic and social impact of their decision to sell the Commonwealth Bank. You could not find a more vivid contrast in policy than that approach of the Labor Party to sell anything it could get its hands on—or anything it could get its hands off might be more to the point. There was the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, Aerospace Technologies of Australia, the Commonwealth uranium stockpile, CSL—the former Commonwealth Serum Laboratories—the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services, the Defence house loan portfolio, the Defence home loan franchise, the Commonwealth housing loan scheme, and it goes on and on. 
Prior to the 1995 budget, the Labor Party, under then Prime Minister Keating, was really keen to sell off Telstra's mobile and Yellow Page business. If you want to talk about monopolies, talk about the Yellow Pages; there is a conversation worth having. But there was a government, a Labor government, at that time wanting to go out and sell parts of Telstra. The shadow minister even had this idea of bonding with investment banks about the prospect of splitting up Telstra and selling off non-network assets, until he realised that the Telstra picture is one of integration and that structural separation of the network and of the non-network business, as he was advocating, would have a devastating impact on Telstra and on the shareholders, both private and Commonwealth. Rightly, he dropped that proposal in January 2003. He provided some benefits then and he realised what a nonsense idea that was. 
But there is a history of the Labor Party wanting to sell Telstra. The 199596 budget paper, marked `highly protected', later obtained under FOI, showed how the Labor government had drawn up a proposal to sell 100 per cent of Telstra in five tranches. There was no mention of what they were going to do with the service side of things, no mention about the impact of that policy—none of the measures that the government has put in place that have actually seen telecommunications services improve, prices come down and choice expand. Just in the area that I represent, let us have a look at what has happened. The Howard government was elected at a time when there was reckless indifference to the environment, to the neighbourhood and to the heritage consequences of cable and tower—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would ask the member for Dunkley to table the 1995-96 budget paper he is referring to. 
 (Mr Barresi)—There is no point of order. 
—I would be happy to table my speech, because that is probably far more gripping. The issues when we were elected in 1996 were around cable and telecommunication tower infrastructure—this was when the Labor government had been in power. Telstra was 100 per cent owned and there was reckless indifference shown to the interests of neighbourhoods, to heritage, to the environment and to streetscapes, and off the Labor Party went. There was a 100 per cent owned Telstra operating as though it were in the wild west, and it took the Howard government to put some sense and sensitivity into the deployment of infrastructure. That is another example of where the Labor Party stood by and did nothing at a time when Telstra was 100 per cent fully owned. Beyond that, we have seen local call access to BigPond in my area; the call charge review, making untimed local calls to Melbourne a reality for every business and every household in my electorate—something the Labor Party could never do, did not do and chose not to do when Telstra was 100 per cent Labor Party government owned. In 13 years it did nothing to fix up untimed local calls to Melbourne. 
We have had directory and call assist changes to support the interesting area of Frankston—most of it is in the metropolitan area but some of it is not. If you are in the little enclave in South Frankston and you ring up directory assistance or go on to the Net to find a phone number, they say, `There's nobody there.' They actually are there but they just happen to be in a different call area. I have mentioned Telstra Country Wide. Another example is where that has been introduced into the electorate of Dunkley, and the Mornington Peninsula and Greater Frankston area is benefiting from it. In response to my call for a Telstra outer metropolitan initiative, we are seeing Telstra Country Wide and its presence already delivering positive outcomes in my area. Now we have BigPond ISDN access.  
There is a picture of service improvement—of improved choice, improved performance, lower cost and better outcomes for telecommunications users in the community that I represent. That has been achieved by regulation. That has been achieved by a sound business case. That has been achieved by Telstra understanding that its interests coincide with those of its customers. This is where Labor's argument falls over. When it had 100 per cent ownership, it achieved none of those things. None of those gains were achieved under a Labor Party with 100 per cent ownership of Telstra. 
Looking at the picture, what also supports the proposition tonight is the ongoing maintenance of those checks and balances that have delivered those gains, irrespective of changes to Telstra's ownership—those universal safeguard obligations: the customer service guarantee, the network reliability framework, the priority assistance arrangements and the retail price controls on Telstra. All of these represent a regulatory framework within which Telstra and other competitors can function. Those other competitors are there, and they must look with some bemusement to see the regulator holding the whip hand on the major player. They must wonder: `Is the industry's interest being reflected here? Is the share price being reflected here? Is the government regulating for self-interest or is it regulating for a better telecommunications sector?'
Again, regulation and not ownership has been the key to delivering those improved outcomes and managing Telstra's behaviour. A change of ownership will not affect, will not disadvantage, that framework. You have already seen as a result of the reviews about the relative availability and performances of services outside of the metropolitan area a number of initiatives, the most recent of which were as a consequence of the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry. That is a further $180 million to deliver better outcomes—something that is not contingent on the sale of Telstra, a government intervention or a policy intervention, and something that is not precluded regardless of the ownership structure of Telstra. My only message relating to that $180 million—
—I am grateful for the encouragement of the shadow minister—is, when we are looking at that definition of what is regional, doesn't the Telstra Country Wide network provide a perfect footprint to devise these regional areas that can benefit from some of the enhancements that are going to made possible from that response to the Estens inquiry?
In closing—and I have been asked to keep my comments brief; there is plenty more I would like to talk about but I will save that for another day—I hope the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme for regional areas will be made available to all Telstra Country Wide areas. I am certain I will be there cheering on some projects in the community I represent. But let us look at the history: better service, cheaper prices, competition, better outcomes for consumers, better public policy gains—all achieved through regulation, not through 100 per cent government ownership, where the Labor Party would have you forget the record of its time in government and the history of Telstra's performance before the Howard government was elected. ",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I am delighted to be speaking on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003, but I am not delighted that it has come before this House. I am not surprised that it has finally come here, despite the obfuscation, the misleading and the downright lying that has happened over a number of years out on the hustings by this government and by its leader, the Prime Minister.
Prior to the 1996 election, when the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, tried to tell everybody that there was really no difference between him and the then Labor government and denied most of his public policy stances, the case was: `We really don't want to sell all of Telstra; we only want to put a proposition up that will partly privatise Telstra'—just a little bit of it would go into private hands. After they won government, the first dilution of Telstra was called the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. They have diluted public ownership all right, and they did it on the basis of selling down the full value of Telstra to make sure that they got a very strong public response. In that first tranche—and Telstra has been sold in two lots—the total value of the sale of a third of Telstra was in the order of $14 billion to $15 billion.
Mr Deputy Speaker, if you cast your mind back to the point in time when they sold another 16 per cent of Telstra to bring the total sold up to 49 per cent, you may remember that that brought in about $16 billion or so. So the total sale price from a third of Telstra was $14 billion, which was really underweight in terms of the value of Telstra's stock when around half as much, or 16 per cent, got more money. So the sale price for 33 per cent of Telstra was $14 billion and then the sale price of a further 16 per cent of Telstra was $16 billion. The total amount, of course, when you add it together—so for those people who bought T1 and T2 and effectively dollar cost averaged this—has fallen dramatically as a result of the changed circumstances in the stock market over the past couple of years.
But the underlying reality has not changed. Prior to the 1996 election, the member for Bennelong, the then Leader of the Opposition, had it in his mind, had it in his heart but did not have it on his lips that his ultimate aim was always to be, and has continued to be through all of the obfuscation and misleading over the past seven years, the total sale of Telstra—and here we finally have it in this bill.
The only contingent statements that have been made now in relation to this bill are that, if it passes in the other place, it will have to await an appropriate time for the government to achieve a sale price and that the government will have to be satisfied that telecommunications services have appropriately been improved Australia wide. We have been through the farcical inquiries—the Estens inquiry and the Besley one before that. The Estens and Besley inquiries have been used as vehicles to do an AstroBoy job on telecommunications, particularly in country Australia. For those people who did not see the AstroBoy cartoons in their youth, AstroBoy always got into a punch-up doing the right thing, attempting to try and fix problems and taking on the baddies, and he would almost immediately come up in bandaids all over his face where he had been injured. This is a bandaid job of the first order.
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been put forward to supposedly fix problems in regional Australia in terms of access, and this government has now brought the National Party to heel with of the promise of further hundreds of millions of dollars. They have argued not only that they would actually improve and fix communications in regional Australia but that they would future proof them. I would just advise the members of the National Party in this place and in the other place who have taken a concerted action in contravention of the dominant feeling of their constituents and the constituents of just about every member Australia wide to take a close look at what was said prior to the 1996 election, what was said by the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister—that they really were not interested in a full sale, that they only wanted a partial sale and that they would have to look at it as they went along. 
We have seen a long history of misleading the Australian people, but I think finally—or, hopefully, finally—the knock on the door has been made loudly enough and people know that the whole future of our telecommunications system rests on what we always knew was the government's complete and utter intention to flog the lot. This government does not believe in federal ownership of anything. It has contracted out as many services as it can. There are still some more to come but not all that many. It has not contracted out the Army yet, but I would not be surprised if it went the full hog and did that. It has not yet sold off everything there is to sell. The previous speaker, the member for Dunkley, ran through a list of Commonwealth assets that Labor sold whilst in office. That is true. Every government in the history of the Commonwealth has sold assets and then, usually, purchased others. This government does not purchase other assets or seek to increase its investment Australia wide, except in programs to buy the votes of Australians for a further sell-down of our most significant assets.
Telstra is the biggest, most formidable, most monopolistic business in Australia's history. We had full public ownership of Telstra up until the first tranche of its sale, which was followed by the second tranche. We now only have 51 per cent ownership. Every Australian could have claimed, quite rightly, in 1995 that they owned a percentage of a total business, a fully government owned and government directed business whose main task and aim was to provide effective communications services to all Australian at the lowest possible cost, given that it also acted as a means of gaining revenues for expansion and for the general government coffers to allow the country as a whole to do other things. We have seen government after government use the dividends from Telstra for community ends—either directly, by reinvestment into Telstra to allow it to operate from year to year, or indirectly, by investment into other Commonwealth ends. Those dividends are very important and a key part of the story of what Telstra's future role could be if it were not sold.
If Telstra were not sold, we would still only have half the dividends returning to the Commonwealth. The other half go to the 1.8 million Australians—not the 20 million—who own the shares. They own half of Telstra but own those shares as individuals, rather than as part of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Commonwealth has gained $30 billion from the sale of half of that monopoly, but the future dividends from Telstra have been halved. From this point to any point in the future that you choose to take, the yearly dividends from half of Telstra could return in the order of $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion or $4 billion to the Commonwealth. If this entity is fully sold, only a one-off amount of money will go to the government. The government will then choose to use that money in some way, as it did when it helped to set up an environmental fund that only put an extra $183 million into what the government normally put out. The heritage fund was in fact a combination of a series of different existing government programs that were rebadged with some extra moneys as an attempt to convince people that the proceeds of the Telstra sale could be spent on other ends. So we expect  the government to put up another such proposition at the next election—perhaps to do with the environment; for example, saving the Murray—or a series of objectives to be achieved. 
A one-off sale would mean a one-off amount of money coming back to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth would miss out on year-on-year dividends that could be ploughed back into Australia's telecommunications infrastructure to allow Telstra to continue to do the job that no-one else has been able to do in the history of Australia's communications—that is, encompass the communications needs of the entire nation, covering metropolitan as well as urban, outer urban, regional, rural and remote areas in a way that gives a decent deal to everyone. The member for Lingiari, who is at the table, knows full well the increased costs across a range of services delivered into remote, rural and regional Australia. Those costs are extremely high if they are not cross-subsidised by people living in the cities. Part of Telstra's central role has been to provide services not at cost but cross-subsidised to people Australia wide. That is why there is such a strong voice in the seat of Lingiari, in the seat of McMillan and in all the regional seats Australia wide saying: `We don't believe that the government really has our interests at heart on the question of the full sale of Telstra.'
It has been proved in the past that government control over this entity is needed. Telstra was once a full monopoly. Now, after the sell-off of 49 per cent of it, Telstra still has a 95 per cent monopoly in terms of the income coming back to it and its importance within the economy. Its competitors, who have been brought in from overseas, have not been able to effectively compete on the same level and scale as Telstra. Over the years we have seen, very worryingly, the attempted transformation of Telstra on the basis of the notion that communications and broadcasting are converging, that all means of communication are being pushed together such that it is a really smart deal to bring them all together in one company. We have seen extravagant adventurism from Telstra's board and its senior officers in Ziggy Switkowski and Ted Pretty. They seem to want to go from their fundamental areas of concern—running a communications company with telephone and data services. They have not seemed very interested at all in running that seemingly boring company that provides such fundamental services to all Australians. They have been off trying to buy their way into the Internet boom—which crashed so heavily—and trying to buy into mobile phone companies in Asia. You did not need hindsight to tell you that that was a pretty dodgy proposition. You could see it at the time, and commentators at the time said, `This is not a reasonable or sensible thing to do.' We have seen a couple of billion dollars go down the chute as a result of those misadventures.
We have also heard them say, time after time, that they wanted to get into the broadcast area and then indicate an interest in buying Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd. Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, being from Perth, you would remember that there was a certain individual who sold his media holdings to one Mr Packer after trying to buy out PBL. Mr Packer has already found one Mr Bond in his lifetime; I think he has come across two more Mr Bonds in the persons of Mr Switkowski and Mr Pretty. They would like to buy PBL. In buying PBL, if they were able to do it, particularly if Telstra is totally sold, we would have a situation where Telstra would then be able to have its head about where its investments should be made. If they bought PBL, we would have a situation where the controlling interest in a Telstra that is entirely monopolistic in the communications area is linked to the strongest entity in the broadcast area. We know that there is an effective duopoly between Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch in broadcasting in Australia—the others can struggle against them, but they are the dominant forces. We know that cross-media ownership rules currently constrain them. But we also know that the strength of their expertise in that private area is that they understand a pretty fundamental thing, and it is understood in one of the provisions of this bill and it has been understood previously: that effective control of a company can come from the ownership of as little as 15 per cent of its total share market value. 
The provisions in the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 say that government regulation and direction of Telstra should cease once the level of the government's ownership falls below 15 per cent. It is recognised by just about every commentator in the land that a private entity such as PBL, or Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch joining together, or others joining together, could exercise control on not only the most significant communications company in Australia but also the most significant communications and broadcasting company that Australia could ever possibly envisage. This is one of the great dangers in the sale of a company that still maintains its monopoly—taking it from a public monopoly to a private monopoly. Based on our past experience, I would think that most Australians would take pause and think that to invest a private monopoly with the strength and power of Telstra with a range of possibilities that could not be properly governed by any government of the future—coalition or Labor—would not be a wise thing to do. To put this to the test is not smart politics, it is not smart government but it is part of the fundamental—we would say, from our point of view, ideology; the government would say its fundamental philosophy—market-driven approach to these things.
If you look at the way things have gone worldwide, in the very changed world of communications that we have seen over the past 10 years, you will see that the moves towards attempted convergence have, by and large, failed. Those countries which have sold off half their major telecoms have, in fact, retained half ownership. Having a hybrid public-private company, as we have now, is sustainable into the future. It allows us a direct say. It allows us a continuing dividend from the activities of this communications company and a continuing ability to positively direct its future, to ensure that future proofing would not be left up to those private shareholders—whether it is the institutions, private individuals, private companies taking part of that share taking, the directors, the board or the chief executive officer of this private monopoly that would emerge—but be the responsibility of an Australian Commonwealth government. It ensures that it could not walk away from its duty to provide the fundamental infrastructure of the 21st century and ensures as open an access to that infrastructure as is possible for all Australians no matter where they come from, no matter what their income, no matter what their level is in society and no matter what their capacities are in terms of their economic backing or facility. Communications will be the centrepiece of this century's activity; it will be the centrepiece upon which our 21st century economy is based. To take a situation where you convert a public monopoly to a private monopoly and then willingly simply wash your hands, Pilate like, of the consequences of that is utterly irresponsible.
I have never been in favour of the sale of any of Telstra's shares because I think the government has a responsibility to this very large continent with a relatively small population. It has a responsibility to cover all of its citizens with the fundamental infrastructure that they need to conduct their private affairs and their businesses, and to build with open access to modern communications—which has not been improved quickly enough—full economic power now and into the future.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—The debate about the privatisation of Telstra has been about since before the Howard government was first elected in 1996. In fact, the coalition went to that election with a policy of the part sale of Telstra. When we contested the subsequent 1998 and 2001 elections we openly campaigned with policies of further sale provided that certain service levels were reached. So there is nothing new in this legislation. The Howard government has been up front each time it has gone to the people. We did not contest any of those elections saying one thing about Telstra and then proposing something else after the election. I supported those policies, and the people of Eden-Monaro knew where I stood each time they elected and re-elected me in 1996, 1998 and 2001. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 simply delivers on those policies previously put to the people. There is nothing new in it.
But the real issue is service, not ownership. If ownership were the most important issue, as the Labor Party would have you believe, why were telecommunications so poor 10 years ago when the Labor Party was in government and Telstra was fully government owned? Why were overseas and STD calls so expensive under full government ownership? Why could Telstra connect a phone whenever it liked under that regime? Why could you wait weeks to get your phone fixed, without any compensation, when Telstra was run by a Labour government? Government ownership guaranteed you nothing when it came to telecommunications. In fact, guarantees of service levels have only existed under a coalition government and with a partly privatised Telstra.
I will come back to just what has been achieved in telecommunications for the people of Eden-Monaro since 1996 but, firstly, I will comment on the principle of privatisation. The Labor Party says it is against the further sale of Telstra. If the leadership of the Labor Party honestly believes in Telstra remaining in government hands, surely they would be advocating the buying back of the 49.9 per cent that is currently privately owned. They are not doing that, so how committed are they really to maintaining government ownership? I would say that they are about as committed as they were to maintaining ownership of the Commonwealth Bank.
I remind the House and the people of Eden-Monaro that when the Labor Party was in government they were great advocates for privatisation, and at one point they only partly sold the Commonwealth Bank. They actually issued a share prospectus that said they would not sell off any more of it. They then went to an election with such a policy. But what did they do? As soon as the election was over they sold off the balance. They not only broke an election promise but also went against the share prospectus they issued. So much for the honesty of the Labor Party. Given their record, how could anyone believe what they are currently saying? They are opposing this bill for opposition's sake. That is what they think they must do—oppose, oppose, oppose. They will take the populist line every time instead of good policy.
I will now return to the real issue, which is service. Geographically, Australia is a very large country, but we have a relatively small population and the great majority of that population is concentrated into small areas. This provides a huge challenge for telecommunications. For decades the rural and regional parts of Australia put up with second-rate telecommunications. Anyone who spent any time in rural areas not all that long ago would remember such things as party lines. If you ever spent time in remote regions, you would know it could take years just to get a phone. It would take weeks to get a phone fixed and it cost a small fortune to ring a major city. Phoning overseas was only for the very well-off. 
New technologies in the last couple of decades have certainly helped improve telecommunications, but through the nineties the demand for mobile telephony was outstripping the supply of infrastructure. Analog mobile phones were a great help to rural and regional areas, as their reach was far greater than digital mobile phones. But the previous Labor government, clearly not taking into account or perhaps not understanding the reality of life in the bush, did a deal with Optus and Vodafone such that analog would be phased out without any plan for a replacement. That was the situation when the Howard government came to office: a growing demand for mobiles, minimal digital coverage throughout my electorate of Eden-Monaro and the reliable analog service on the way out.
My initial reaction was to see if there was some way we could reverse Labor's decision. Unfortunately they had stitched it up so well that the cost to the taxpayer to reverse it would have been enormous. The partial sale of Telstra gave the people in the bush an opportunity that would never have existed if Labor had stayed in government. While a significant amount of the money collected from the part sale of Telstra was used to retire debt, thus helping the Australian economy to stand out compared to our OECD counterparts and reducing interest rates to 30-year lows, part of the proceeds went to improving telecommunications, particularly in rural and regional Australia. Instead of three licensed telephone companies, as was the case in 1996, we now have 89. Forty per cent of these are now operating in regional Australia. There are also 963 service providers registered with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.
In 1996 there was no mobile phone coverage in Bungendore, Braidwood, Bombala, Delegate, Adaminaby and Captains Flat—just to name a few towns in my electorate—and the coverage was pretty ordinary in most locations along the coast. Over the past 7½ years all the towns I just mentioned have had mobile phone towers installed and there have been numerous additions along the coast, thus improving coverage enormously. By the end of this year, when towers are completed in other towns such as Tathra, Broulee and Moruya Heads, it will be even better. The Princes Highway was also included in the continuous coverage along major highways program, thus further strengthening the network. We have also seen the establishment of our very own Southern Phone Company, which is located in Moruya. This project was instigated primarily by the Eurobodalla Shire Council and currently has about 40 shire councils as shareholders. I should recognise Phil Herrick, who was the driving force behind getting the Southern Phone Company going throughout the south-east and beyond in New South Wales. Southern Phone Company is offering very competitive local and STD calls and recently embarked on a broadband network. Various Australian government funded programs have allowed all of this to happen—programs such as Networking the Nation, from which Southern Phone Company received nearly $5 million to help it get established. 
Let me just highlight a few other things that have been able to be established thanks to the Howard government's investment in my electorate resulting from the partial sale of Telstra. A $135,000 grant will help to get a community technology centre at Wallaga Lake online. A similar set-up predominantly funded by the Australian government was also recently opened at Delegate. Bermagui was recently announced as the location for a CTC. Rural transaction centres have been funded in various towns, including Braidwood, Delegate, Bemboka, Nimmitabel, Candelo and Wyndham, to name a few. 
A myriad other projects have been funded, which have helped our communities compete in a technological age. Just three examples I will mention include: the ACR Online Project, covering all shires in my electorate as well as a further 10 shires in the region, plus the ACT; the Eden Community Access Centre; and the Cooma Call and Technology Centre. While these extended services were being provided, the Howard government was also putting in place the safeguards needed, particularly for rural and regional Australia—safeguards such as the customer service guarantee, which requires all telephone companies to meet specified time frames to connect fixed line services, repair faults and keep appointments. If a telephone company fails to meet these time frames, they are required by law to make automatic compensation payments to customers. This is fixed in legislation. It is the law. It never existed under Labor nor under a fully government owned Telstra. The universal service obligation is another safeguard entrenched in legislation; it guarantees all Australians access to basic telephone services.
Other measures introduced by the coalition government include a priority assistance service, untimed local calls, price controls on Telstra, a low-income customer package and the National Relay Service, which ensures that people who are deaf or have a hearing or speech impairment are able to use a telephone. With growing demand for Internet access, there is also the digital data service obligation, which guarantees all Australians access to Internet data speeds, upon request, of at least 64 kilobytes per second through Telstra's ISDN service, and there is the Internet Assistance Program.
At the same time that all this has happened, overall telecommunication costs have fallen. Labor will always pick the odd part of a service and claim something has gone up; but, with accelerating technology, one must look at the overall costs. So let us look at the figures released by the ACCC, which compared costs in 2000-01 with those in 1996-97. International call costs have fallen 61.2 per cent, long-distance call costs have fallen 29.6 per cent, local call costs have fallen 29.1 per cent, mobile call costs have fallen 27.4 per cent, and fixed phone-to-mobile call costs have fallen by 13.3 per cent—an overall average fall of 24.8 per cent.
There is no question that we rely much more on our telecommunications today than we did even five years ago, but there is also no question that the unit cost for those services has been reduced dramatically. Competition and technology have achieved that for the consumer. Quite correctly, people in Eden-Monaro have concerns for future services, but history shows that a government owned monopoly does not guarantee a service. More often than not, all it guarantees is the lowest common denominator. Future governments, of whatever persuasion, would never have the capital to keep pace with technology change and would never compete in an increasingly competitive market. I would not want a second-rate service for my electorate.
The Telstra of the future will need the flexibility to compete, and that can, realistically, only happen if it is set free from government. The Labor Party knows that, but it is too dishonest to admit it. If you look at the technological change which has taken place in the last five to 10 years, I can assure the House that the next five to 10 years will see a substantially greater change. No government will have the available capital to fund those changes; so a Telstra tied down by government ownership will be left behind. Some people may have trouble understanding this, but look at the airline industry if you want a comparison. If Qantas had remained in government ownership, there is no way taxpayers would wear the sort of capital investment Qantas has had to spend to remain competitive. At the time, many people could not have envisaged Qantas being anything other than government owned. Now it seems only natural that it is a private company. 
Change is never easy, but it is necessary to go forward. Just like the airline industry, safeguards must be put in place for the telecommunications industry, and that is where a federal member representing a rural and regional electorate must put his or her energy: in ensuring the safeguards are in place. It is called future proofing. I will be insisting that the recommendations put forward by the Estens committee are made secure in legislation. For example, Telstra will be required, as the primary universal service provider, to maintain an ongoing local presence in regional, rural and remote Australia. It is a pity the Labor Party did not do something like that when it sold the Commonwealth Bank. The Howard government had to clean up after it, with our rural transaction centres putting banking services back. We will also be putting in place a national broadband strategy. We understand that there is an escalating demand for broadband; therefore we will ensure that the bush is not left behind. I understand that, while broadband is available to many more locations today than was the case even one year ago, there is still much to do. These are the issues I will be working on to ensure the guarantees and the safeguards are in place. This must be done before the further sale of Telstra.
Representing a predominantly rural and regional electorate—and one which has been traditionally, for many decades, a very marginal one—the easy thing for me to do would have been the populist thing; that is, oppose this policy. But I know that to be a cop-out. I know that, in the long term, that would not be the best thing for the people I have been elected to represent. As a community leader, it is always easy just to do what you think the majority of people perceive to be best about a particular issue at a particular point in time. There is no great courage in that. As elected representatives, we must make our own decisions; otherwise one would spend one's whole time asking 90,000 people what they think about every single matter which comes before us. It is not credible to single out one issue; you either make your decision or you never do. 
As I said at the beginning, the coalition have now gone to the people on three separate occasions, with our policy on Telstra well articulated. I have supported that position on each of those occasions. The coalition have always said that we proceed only when the service levels get to acceptable standards and when safeguards are in place. We continue to work on both those matters, and this legislation is part of that process. I commend the bill to the House and I condemn the opposition for their dishonest, populist and hypocritical opposition to it. ",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 raises four issues: firstly, the nation-building role of telecommunications in its crucial role in underpinning the provision of goods and services; secondly, the equally important role of telecommunications in improving the competitiveness and productivity of businesses throughout Australia; thirdly, the ability to provide equitable services to all Australians, whether they live in rural or regional Australia or the outer suburbs; and, fourthly, the impact on the budget of privatising Telstra. There has been a lot of debate during the course of this bill about the issues concerning services provided not just to the bush but to Australians everywhere—in particular, in addition to rural and regional Australia, to the outer suburbs. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for communications have both spoken on the bill. They have canvassed a range of issues, particularly about the provision of telecommunication services, the broader economic implications, nation building and equity.  
I want to focus today, in my capacity as shadow minister for finance, on the impact that the sale will have on the budget. If you set aside the important issues about services that have been debated and presented so well by others, as a majority owned public asset Telstra generates considerable wealth, which is returned to taxpayers through the budget. The government has been trying to narrow the budgetary debate to talk just about debt and not about the broader question of net wealth, for example, in the asset side of it. The government does not talk about budgetary implications in terms of revenue—revenue forgone and expenditure. This has been to some extent used by people on behalf of government, particularly the National Party, to focus on what the proceeds of the sale of Telstra will buy for the government, what pork-barrelling they can do and how much of this money they can raid. This has concealed the broader implications for the budget and for the fiscal sustainability for Australians in the future. There needs to be more debate about why the government is so keen to sell off Telstra and to forgo the Telstra dividends, particularly when it claims to be seeking to maximise value for Australians. 
I come back to this point—which is where I wish to focus—of the impact the sale will have on the budget and, in particular, the government's underlying assumptions concerning the sale and the costs to the budget over the forward estimates period. Let me look first at this question of dividends forgone. In the last financial year, Telstra dividends paid to the Commonwealth were valued at $1,482 million—just think about that. That is the extent to which Telstra improved the underlying cash balance for the Commonwealth. This does not include the special dividend that was also paid to shareholders in April 2003, which was valued at an additional $193 million. Rather than managing a dividend stream which will improve the budget bottom line by $5.8 billion across the forward estimates period—that is, over the next four financial years—and fund services for all Australians, the government is prepared to sell off a key asset for questionable broader economic gain. 
Let us examine the core assumptions underlying the budget and the figures behind the budget's treatment of the sale—which are rubbery, at best, and put the government's core reasons for privatising Telstra at great risk. I am really concerned that some of the propositions being put forward reduce the funds available to pay off debt and reduce public debt interest. Let us have a look at these rubbery assumptions. One is about the cost of privatising Telstra—that is, the costly fees that the government will have to pay to investment bankers to manage the sale—and the other is the dodgy Telstra share price assumption in the 2003-04 budget. In relation to the sale cost assumptions, if we believe the rubbery 2003-04 budget papers, the sale of Telstra will reap gross proceeds of $11.28 billion per year across the forward estimates period. However, the conservative estimate of selling Telstra is about $654 million.  
I do not know if taxpayers are aware of that, but the proposition of the government is that it will pay $654 million to bankers and other financial advisers and consultants just for the pleasure of selling an asset that the people want to keep—$650 million. I believe that that number is a conservative estimate because it does not include the potential extra costs involved in the proposition of complex hybrid securities being involved in the sale of Telstra, which have been floated recently. If the government goes down that direction, making the sale process more complex and moving into complex areas like hybrid securities, it will wind up hiring even more investment bankers and analysts and the costs will blow out. But let us stick with the $654 million figure for the sake of this analysis.
The greater the cost of the sale, the greater the fees flowing to investment bankers, the more it reduces the level of proceeds which are available for other purposes, including—as the government always used to say—to pay off debt and reduce the government's interest payment on debt. Going through the process, essentially we ask: how much money are we going to get for selling Telstra? How much of that are we going to have to spend in the sale process? How much of that are we going to have to spend to buy the support of the National Party? How much is left? What do we save in public debt interest by using that money to pay off debt? That is not what the government will do, I might say; I will come to that in a moment but for the moment let us assume they do. What is the saving? What is the loss in dividend forgone? If we answer those questions, then we can make an assessment of the budgetary implications.
There are bigger issues about net wealth—the increasing value of Telstra—but I do not want to go to those. They are more complicated issues which I think also argue in the same direction. Let us not cross that bridge, which requires too many assumptions to be easily validated. If the government would only make its assumptions clear it would be very easy to make the budgetary implication clear.
Let us go through that process. First of all, let us look at the issue of the sale price and the assumptions used in the budget to value the Commonwealth's shareholding. In a Senate estimates hearing of May 2003 we exposed a $3 billion error in the valuation of the Commonwealth's shareholding in Telstra. This error occurred because the finance department incorrectly valued Telstra and did not correctly apply GFS accounting standards, which require assets to be valued at their market value. This budget fiddle overstated the government sector balance sheet by $3 billion.
The fundamental basis of the Telstra sale, and the proceeds that are underpinning the government's motivations for privatising Telstra, is fundamentally flawed. It is flawed because it is based on a Telstra share price which is currently 11 per cent above the current market price; a share price that Telstra has not traded at since May 2002; a share price that even the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration admitted should not have been applied in the budget papers. That is rubbery figure No. 1.
There are other rubbery aspects to the assumptions used by the government in the 2003-04 budget. I ask whether the government has factored in the impact on the share price of some of the key aspects of this legislation and the Estens outcomes—for example, three-yearly reviews of telecommunications and the requirement to respond to recommendations that arise from these reviews, the use of hybrid securities in the sale, licence condition requirements on Telstra and an upcoming review of the universal service obligation. 
These issues would impinge both directly and indirectly on the delivery of telecommunication services in Australia, have a big impact on Telstra and should be factored into the budget estimates for the sale price, cost of sale and net impact on the budget of the sale of Telstra. There we have the fact that the figures the government has assumed—the $11.28 billion per year in the forward estimates—are very rubbery. But when I make my concluding analysis of the budgetary outcome I will still use those government numbers, even though I think they are exaggerated.
More importantly, it is still not clear what the government has in mind for the proceeds from a sale of Telstra. There are two issues here: firstly, how much of the proceeds will the government need to spend to satisfy the NFF and gain National Party support for the bill and, secondly, how will the government spend the remaining proceeds of the sale? The Minister for Finance and Administration and the Treasurer have previously said that the aim of the sale is to eliminate debt but as yet the amount of debt to be retired is unknown. The reason that both the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration cannot specify the level of debt is that they have spread themselves a little thin when it comes to making promises they cannot keep about the use of proceeds from a sale of Telstra.
How can the government use all that money to retire debt and keep its promise to maintain the Commonwealth bond market? How can the government retire debt when the Deputy Prime Minister is developing a National Party wish list of how he wants to spend the proceeds? I am sure the senators with whom the government is hoping to make a deal about this bill will also have a wish list.
To add to the confusion about the use of sale proceeds, the Treasurer has also said that he may invest the proceeds in a term deposit at the RBA—at an unknown rate of return but clearly less than the bond rate—or, alternatively, he may use them to establish a portfolio of financial assets to enable those resources to be set against government debt elsewhere. But the Treasurer has indicated at the moment, it seems to me, that his preferred option is the term deposit at the RBA.
I have examined a number of Telstra sale scenarios. I want to contrast now some conservative market estimates of future dividends and take into account in the arithmetic how sale proceeds will be used. Under the most conservative scenario estimates, I have revealed a $1.7 billion black hole in the budget's treatment of the sale. This is based on dividend projections, as forecasted by Macquarie Bank, of 27.5c in 2005-06, 29c in 2006-07, 30c in 2007-08 and 31c in 2008-09. These dividend forecasts are the lower of two private sector forecasts, publicly available, which have been obtained by my office and are treated in a manner which is consistent with the three-tranche sale applied in the 2003-04 budget. The $1.7 billion black hole is also based on the assumption that proceeds will be placed in a term deposit with the RBA at a rate of 4.75 per cent—that is, 25 basis points below the current long-term yield of around five per cent.
An alternative scenario shows the impact that a $3 billion slush fund for the National Party would have on the budget. Reducing sale proceeds by this amount and then deducting the dividends forgone would result in a budget black hole over the forward estimates period of $2.1 billion. These scenarios use the conservative estimates of the cost of privatising Telstra, which I believe understate the cost of a sale. They also use the rubbery ambitious figures of the government for the sale price—the overvalued 2003-04 budget estimate of sale proceeds. Therefore, the budget hole I have discovered is by the very nature of the budget estimates understated and could be much greater than the $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion scenarios that I have canvassed. 
I have challenged the Treasurer on many occasions to disprove my calculations, which I have published in detail, regarding the budgetary implications of selling Telstra, and he has failed to respond. Unlike the government's assumptions, which are secret and—where we have managed to extract them—rubbery, my calculations are soundly based on market derived dividend projections and also take into account the possibility of the National Party slush fund.
There clearly needs to be an alternative approach outlined about how the budgetary implications of Telstra will be dealt with. Once and for all, we must dismiss the argument that reducing government debt improves the macroeconomy or the overall level of savings if this is achieved by selling off our assets. We must also dispel forever the argument that selling Telstra provides budget benefits, that somehow or other there is money available in the budget to spend on pet projects if we sell Telstra, because it always assumes away the massive loss from forgoing the dividends that flow to the budget now—$5.8 billion over the forward estimates period.
I want to make this point very clear. My challenge to the government, to all the government members who speak after me, to the Treasurer and to the Minister for Finance and Administration—a challenge I have raised publicly on several occasions and I raise it again now—is for them to reveal all the underlying assumptions in the budget about the sale of Telstra: the price, which we think we now know; the cost; what you are going to do with the money; the assumption about returns on deposit at the RBA or paying off public debt interest; the assumptions factored into the budget and how they differ from those which I have made or, look at the assumptions which I have outlined and the budgetary implications which flow from them and come forward with a contrasting scenario that shows that there is any flaw in these calculations.
If the government cannot provide alternative analysis of the budget impact, we are entitled to conclude that, over the forward estimates period, we will have $1.7 billion to meet our alternative policy proposals, and we will fund our propositions accordingly. This is a fundamental question. The government talks about the Charter of Budget Honesty. We want a clean and open debate about the implications of a Telstra sale for the capacity of competing governments at the next election—the government and the opposition—to fund our programs. I believe that somewhere between $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion over the forward estimates period is available to the opposition, and not to the government, as a result of our decision not to forgo the dividend flow from Telstra, not to spend $650 million selling Telstra but rather to retain the asset, to retain the wealth, to retain the dividend flow. That is the logical and rational budgetary thing to do.
If the government has a desire to forgo that $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion because it has an ideological commitment to selling Telstra, it is entitled to have that view but it has to come clean on the arithmetic. Others will engage in this debate about the services, about the equity issues and about the long-term impacts on competitiveness in our economy—which I have spoken about in the past and which I believe is much more important than the issues I am raising. The core question is about the place of telecommunications in a 21st century economy, but there are plenty of people here to make that debate. I want to pose the central question. I have posed it to the Treasurer and to the finance minister over the weeks and months since the budget, and all we get in response is stony silence. I think there is a simple reason for that: they do not have an answer. Let them analyse the figures that I have put forward publicly again today. This is not new; I have done it on a number of occasions. I have done it repeatedly. I did it on 7 July and on 17 July. We continue to put out these assessments and challenge the government to respond—stony silence. It is because the government does not have an answer. 
The government knows that when the figures are revealed they will be close to my assessment of the budgetary implication. That has profound implications for the respective capacity of government and opposition to fund new policy proposals going to the next election. It is a central question about the Charter of Budget Honesty. It is a central question about fiscal responsibility. It is a $1.7 billion black hole in the government's budget. We want the ministers to come clean and answer the questions about the assumptions in the budget and what underlies their figures and, if they wish to challenge our figures, to put out their assessment of the budget implications of Telstra. We have put ours on the table. We believe it has profound importance for the sustainability of the budget and our capacity to fund new programs. I challenge the government to disprove it or, if it cannot disprove it, to acknowledge it and live with the consequences.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—I was interested in the member for Fraser's comments on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003. As usual, he makes an interesting contribution—and he should not leave the chamber until I respond to some of his arguments. He did not fundamentally address the argument of whether privatisation of Telstra is a good thing or in the interest of the Australian people whether in private or public ownership.
The member for Fraser talked about the debt dividend and the $1.4 billion dividend that the government will receive. I note that that was never a great issue when the Keating government wished to privatise a number of assets, which I will talk about a little later. I am somewhat sympathetic to the proposition put by the member for Fraser in relation to the cost of the fees that will be involved in the sale of Telstra. I do think that the fee regime in the privatisation programs of both governments has been fairly extravagant in the way in which the broking fraternity charge their fees. The figure of $650 million certainly seems a fairly big figure to me.
The member for Fraser put forward an argument about public debt and the interest received. However, I note that the Keating government had no compunction about using capital moneys received for current expenditure. There was no concern under the Keating regime that there was a total public debt of $96 billion or that the sale of public assets was not used to reduce the level of public debt. So I totally reject the member for Fraser's arguments that this is a question of finance or of calculating the figures for the budget. This is a fundamental argument over the best way that Telstra can operate for the benefit of all Australians. The bill before us amends the Telstra Corporation Act 1991. I remind the House that the Telstra Corporation was set up by the ALP in 1991. It was well supported by those in opposition at that time. We thought that moving to a corporation was the right thing to do, that it would put Telstra in a corporate structure and give it the ability to compete in the market and provide better services for Australians. There was no great argument at that time about privatisation or corporate structure; the then Labor government moved to that position, which we commended. 
We are now recommending to the people of Australia that the 50.1 per cent of Commonwealth ownership should be sold to the market. There is no merit in retaining the one-tenth of a per cent share majority that gives the Commonwealth so-called majority holding on the board. The directors have a commercial responsibility to serve shareholders, be they the Commonwealth government or individual shareholders throughout Australia. The bill has a framework for regular and independent reviews of regional telecommunications services, and that has been mentioned by other speakers. Australia is a big continent and telecommunications are important for regional Australians. Obviously this parliament and this government want to make sure, by way of legislation, that regional Australians are well looked after and well serviced. We want to do this by way of regulation rather than by way of owning Telstra as a company. This bill amends the Telecommunications Act of 1997 to enable the minister and the Australian Communications Authority to establish administrative arrangements for the placing of conditions on Telstra for the preparation of local plans.
The longstanding policy of the Howard government has been to transfer Telstra to full private ownership subject to a regulatory framework. I think members of this House ought to be quite clear that the regulatory framework is the key issue here rather than the ownership of this particular company. The regulatory framework can protect consumers, no matter which party is in government; promote competition amongst all players; reform the telecommunications sector; and ensure that there is genuine competition between private sector operators. With the sale of Telstra, Australians can have access to high-quality, innovative and low-cost communications services. Members would be aware of the Estens independent Regional Telecommunications Inquiry report of 2002. That was an effort by the government to ensure that the concerns of rural Australians—who do have difficulties with telecommunications because of the size of Australia and the distances involved—were taken into account. That followed the Besley report of 2000 where a number of these concerns were raised, and I think those concerns were genuinely taken on board by both the government and Telstra.
The bill allows the sale of Telstra on an open timetable so that the government will not be committed to an immediate program. Contrary to the member for Fraser and those opposite, the government will be seeking to ensure maximum returns for its investment. Telstra shares are standing at about $4.70 at the moment. I guess the market will judge Telstra somewhat on the outcome of this bill and on commercial criteria such as Telstra's ability to perform in the marketplace here in Australia and around the world. So the market will make a commercial judgment. The market would like the company to act in a commercial way, not to keep one hand behind its back because of the 50.1 per cent shareholding held by the government. The bill allows a conventional single tranche sale so that the sale can meet the market's expectation and its ability to absorb this fairly big sale. It also allows other market instruments, such as hybrid securities, to make the sale of this very big corporate entity.
The argument we have heard on both sides about the sale of Telstra and its impact on consumers is not the real point here because the government, of whatever political colour, can protect the interests of consumers, competitors and the public generally. The safeguards will remain, such as the universal service obligation or USO. Those of us who have been in the parliament for some time have heard arguments back and forth as to what fully constitutes the USO—be it in Telstra, Australia Post or one of the other instrumentalities where the commercial profit motive is not the key element. The customer service guarantee has improved. Telstra have given a customer service guarantee, but this has not always been the case. The government have moved to put legislative pressure on Telstra to ensure that customers are well looked after. We have the network reliability framework. Again, there has been an argument in rural Australia that some of the services have not been as reliable as they should be—that they should be repaired on time and maintained—and that a telecommunications industry ombudsman should be appointed to take up some of those issues in an independent way on behalf of the government for the Australian people. So there will be further safeguards for regional Australia and the minister can impose licence conditions on Telstra to ensure that some of the local conditions are fulfilled. 
We have a bill here that looks after the political interests of regional Australians who do not live in capital cities, remembering that those Australians who live in capital cities have good communication systems in terms of mobile phones and landlines which are close to their local exchanges, whereas rural Australians, especially those in remote Australia, are somewhat disadvantaged by modern communications because of the sheer distance and the sheer cost of ensuring that they are connected. The bill ensures that there will be an independent review every five years to make sure that the aims and objectives of the bill are carried out and that the commercial imperatives of Telstra do not override the importance of looking after both those urban and rural subscribers. The bill also ensures that those people who will be on those committees of review will have experience of rural and regional Australia.
The other key element of the bill is that Telstra will remain Australian owned and controlled by Australian directors. Again, it is very important that Telstra cannot be sold off to overseas interests and that we have genuine directors who will have an understanding of the unique Australian conditions and continue to serve the subscribers and their shareholders, being aware of both demands. The maximum aggregate foreign ownership allowed in Telstra will remain at 35 per cent. We cannot have a major superannuation fund out of New York buying up Telstra because it is a good commercial investment. There will be a spread of the shareholding, ensuring that Telstra is not dominated by an individual group, and the maximum individual foreign ownership level will remain at five per cent.
I will summarise the arguments for why we should sell Telstra. The current arrangements provide a conflict of interest for the government, as it is a regulator of telcos and the major owner of the biggest telco in Australia. The government is a regulator and owner all at once. It is fairly obvious to anyone who has a commonsense view of these matters that there is a conflict between a government and their department setting the regulations and having an interest in the commercial outcomes. The government now regulates 89 telcos, but it has a major shareholding in one major telco—Telstra. As I have said, government ownership does not lead to better service in itself. It is really the genuine competition between those telcos that will drive the price down.
I go back to the point that it was the Labor Party that put Telstra on a commercial basis in 1991. This is just a further development of that basic concept that the Labor Party and those opposite who have argued so strongly in recent days against the sale of Telstra introduced. The quality of services is really affected by two fundamental factors in market forces: how many people want the services and what price will they pay? It is interesting to observe that the prices have in fact been reduced in this regime. From 1996-97 to 2000-01 they reduced by about 25 per cent. So we see the competitive pressure that has been brought to bear on Telstra by other market operators in the marketplace, competing in the various areas of mobile phones, untimed calls, landlines and trunk calls. They produced pressure to ensure that the consumer had a reduced price. That is a far call from the original concept of Telstra being a totally government operation. 
The regulations will look at untimed calls, the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, time limits on phone installations—which is very important for a number of our customers—and time limits on fault repairs, which is very helpful to some country people. They are all things that will be decided by the government independent of their ownership of Telstra. I again emphasise that point. The review of future service guarantees could be done by governments, not by the ownership of Telstra. The maintenance of the future of Telstra Country Wide could be looked at in a regulatory process and regular reviews of performance.
I will quickly review the ALP's performance in terms of privatisation. Time is short, but it is interesting to note that they sold anything that moved during their time in government. They did not tell the people that they were going to privatise these instrumentalities, and I well remember the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. They never told anyone. They did not tell their own people. In fact, they had a troika of the cabinet—I think there were three members: the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and one other. They came into the parliament on budget night and said, `We're going to privatise the Commonwealth Bank. We want the money.' So it is strange that those on the other side come in here and talk about the ills of the privatisation of Telstra.
They also sold Qantas, Australian Airlines, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, Aerospace Technologies of Australia, the Commonwealth uranium stockpile, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Amdel, the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services, the Defence Services Housing Corporation, the Defence Force home loan franchise and the Commonwealth housing loan assistance schemes. There we have it. That is what the Labor Party did when they were in government—they privatised anything that moved, and they did not tell the people. The Howard government have been very up front about their arguments regarding the privatisation of Telstra, yet the Labor Party come into this chamber and argue strenuously against a concept that they implemented quite rigorously when they were in government.
I would like to finish by talking about Telstra Country Wide. In my electorate, Telstra Country Wide has done a remarkably good job. I think country members would be aware of the success of Telstra Country Wide in the southern area, where the general manager is Laurie Paratz. In my own area, there is Andrew Sheridan at Geelong and Chris Doody at Ballarat. In the old days, Telecom were an impenetrable organisation in my view. They were not orientated towards customer service or towards members of parliament raising queries. Now they have Telstra Country Wide, where customer service is a very important part of their outlook and philosophy, where we have local management and where they are prepared to look at local problems. The key thing about Telstra Country Wide is that it is profitable in its own right. This new part of Telstra not only looks after rural and remote country people by providing customer service but is working as a profitable unit—so much so that the plans for Telstra Country Wide were improved and endorsed at the end of 2002. 
The $187 million that has been allocated by Telstra to rural services is fixing up landlines, especially in areas with a high incidence of faults, such as in my area in the Surf Coast Shire and in Colac Otway Shire, where old cable and trouble spots have been repaired. Also in my area, approximately 300 exchanges have been transferred to digital technology, an upgrade at considerable capital cost. In Geelong, Country Wide have made sure that new base stations for mobile phones were put in the Bay City Plaza and in Deakin University. So we saw local knowledge and local understanding of the issues, and that capital investment took place. GMHBA, a health fund, had a new call centre put in which made the operation more efficient.
So I say congratulations to Telstra Country Wide. They are now in local management in the local community, they are improving telecommunications and making them better for local customers, they are providing better customer service and they are doing a good job. They reflect a new attitude in Telstra and they reflect what would happen if Telstra were fully privatised and had to meet customer needs, competition and government regulations. I strongly commend the bill to the House and I think that those opposite should remember what they did in 1991.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I think that the member for Corangamite might have made an argument there for why the ABC should be privatised and why Australia Post should be privatised. His argument is basically that we need to privatise Telstra because we regulate it. We regulate Australia Post. We regulate health insurance as well; there should be no government involvement in health insurance, by that argument. Obviously, we regulate broadcasting, so maybe we should privatise the ABC—according to the member for Corangamite.
—That would be a good idea.
—He says maybe it would be a good idea. I am glad he has put that on the record today. Maybe a few more people in the Liberal Party room will be as frank and up front as the member for Corangamite in declaring their secret agenda to privatise the ABC. I just want to come to this point—
 (Mr Lindsay)—The member for McMillan will return to the substance of the bill.
—Very quick off the mark you are too, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 is an important piece of legislation. It is important to be very plain about what we are talking about and what it means to country people in particular. Like the member for Corangamite, I represent a country district. The attitude of country people towards Telstra is that, overwhelmingly, they are opposed to its sale. If the member for Corangamite wants to stand up and tell me honestly that he thinks the majority of people who live in the country districts in his constituency are in favour of the sale of Telstra, I would have to say to him in all honesty that I do not believe him. Those of us who are close to the action in country districts know that the people who live in our constituencies are overwhelmingly against the sale of Telstra. They are overwhelmingly against it because of their experience of what happens when services are privatised and when there is complete deregulation of service provision.  
We have seen it with the banks in country districts. I do not want to have an argument with the member for Corangamite over which one of us has the more rural constituency; let us just call it a draw. I think he probably has a fairly rural constituency as well. He should know just how many banks closed in country districts when people took the view that we needed to leave it to the marketplace, it would sort itself out and somehow, miraculously, we would end up with decent service provision in country districts. It did not work out that way. It did not work out that way at all, and I think people remember that experience when they are forming their views about whether or not it would be a good thing for country people if Telstra were fully privatised. I think it is a case of once bitten, twice shy. We have had our experience with the banks, and our fear is that if Telstra is fully privatised we will have that same experience again, except this time it will be an even more important service that we miss out on—telecommunications.
I want to come back to this point. For those of us in country districts, this issue is different from the issues for people in this place who represent seats in the city—there is no doubt about that at all. We understand in the country that telecommunications hold the great potential to wash away some of the historic disadvantage associated with living outside the metropolitan parts of Australia. We know that through broadband and new telecommunications technology there is the great chance, the great hope and the great opportunity of accessing services that for decades have been unavailable to us. That is what we hope telecommunications technology can do for us. That is what we believe technology can offer us.
But we know that that is not something that a fully privatised Telstra would see as its core business. We know that when a company has as its sole objective the maximisation of profits then they are required—under Corporations Law, no less—to pursue that objective. Telstra would be no different. If Telstra were fully privatised, I have no doubt that it would vigorously pursue every single financial opportunity that it had to maximise its profits, and there are no surprises in me saying that. I do not think it comes as a surprise to anyone in the House that that is what it would do; I think it is generally agreed.
What I disagree about with some of the other country members of parliament in this place, from the Liberal and National parties, is that they seem to want to run out this argument that somehow there is a really good dollar to be made in the country, that Telstra would not focus its energies to maximise its profits on Melbourne and Sydney and that it would focus its services—because there is a dollar to be made—on providing services out to Mudgee, Trafalgar, Orbost, Ballarat and other places in country Australia.
I do not deny there is a dollar to be made in country districts; of course there is—but not as much money as can be made by Telstra Corporation in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart. I do not think anyone in their right mind would suggest that you can make as much money off a server servicing 150 people as you can off a server servicing 150,000 people. Noone in their right mind, I think, could sensibly put that point of view. That probably means that some people from the Liberal-National side are gilding the lily in this debate in saying there is a good dollar to be made and that Telstra would be in it and would focus their energies on making that good dollar and being customer service focused in country areas. That is not the case. Telstra will focus the most energy on the areas where it can make the most money, and that is often where there are the most people and the least cost—and that would be the capital cities that I mentioned before. 
Like a few members in this place, I have spent a bit of time talking to people in schools, hospitals, community health centres and neighbourhood houses. Overwhelmingly, people are telling me that they do not want to see Telstra fully privatised; that is the overwhelming view. I am conducting a survey of my constituency to ascertain people's views in a slightly more scientific manner. A community survey is not the most scientific process that can be used, but often it is a pretty good guide. I have sent out a survey to the people who live in the rural parts of my constituency, and overwhelmingly people are against the sale. My office staff enter the results of this survey as they come in and they have produced this set of statistics today. In answer to the survey's question, `Do you support the Howard government's plans to sell off Telstra?' 250 people said that yes, they do, and 1,845 people said that no, they do not. In answer to the survey's second question, `If Telstra is sold off, do you think service levels in rural areas will get better or worse?' 188 people said that yes, they would get better, and 1,817 people said that they would get worse. I just put those survey results before the House today as the views and attitudes of people who live in my constituency in relation to this issue. I am prepared to concede that this survey is not the most scientific process in the world. I have not paid an expensive Melbourne or Sydney based polling company $20,000 to ascertain the views of people in my constituency, but I think this survey probably reflects pretty accurately what people in my constituency think on this issue.
There are plenty of towns in my electorate, and probably plenty of them have for a fair part if not all of their history traditionally voted for the former Country Party—what has now become the National Party. People are pretty straight up with me about this: they are bitterly disappointed in the National Party rolling over in relation to this issue—bitterly disappointed. A lot of people ask me, `Whatever happened to the tough old men of the Country Party, the National Party? Whatever happened to those fellows; whatever happened to those guys?'
I grew up in the Latrobe Valley and went to school with plenty of farmers' kids and people from the rural parts of what is now my constituency. We grew up with Peter Nixon, who was the member for Gippsland, the neighbouring seat. At that time people in the National Party were pretty tough and pretty hard line, and they really stood up to the Liberal Party on behalf of the people that they represented. People like Peter Nixon drove a pretty hard bargain for his constituents and for country people more generally. But we do not have that with the current National Party leadership, not at all, and people are bitterly disappointed about it. I think people in the National Party caucus here in Canberra are pretty disappointed with the National Party leadership as well. You only have to look at the current crop of National Party ministers to see why people in electorates like mine are so bitterly disappointed with the National Party and with what it has become. There is John Anderson, the member for Gwydir, the current Leader of the National Party. He is a fellow who went to the King's School and then went to the University of Sydney; he has a master's degree from the University of Sydney and he thinks he is pretty special. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. One of the standing orders is that the debate must be relevant to the motion before the chair. This is not relevant. I ask you to bring the speaker back to the point of the debate. 
—I thank the member for Page. The member for McMillan will return to the substance of the debate. 
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The only reason we have this bill in the House is that the National Party have rolled over and said that it is okay. So of course this is relevant. If what I have said is irrelevant to the debate, then nothing that anyone else has said in this debate is relevant either. I am making a very straightforward point. This bill would not be before the chamber now if it were not for the National Party agreeing to the Liberal Party drafting this legislation. If I cannot talk about it, what is the point of having the parliament? If we cannot talk about these issues in the parliament, what is the point of having the parliament? 
The facts are very straightforward. The tough old fellows of the Country Party before it became the National Party would not have allowed this to happen. They would have stood up for the country people in their constituencies and they would have made sure we would not be here today discussing a piece of legislation like this. They would have made sure they were in a strong position to ensure that people in their districts got good services from Telstra Corporation as a government owned enterprise. That is what they would have done; I have no doubt about that today. It is appropriate to talk about the National Party leadership in relation to this because people in country districts do not think the National Party is reflecting their attitude about this. There is no doubt about that at all. I make the point that it used to be that you had leaders in the National Party who had a real rural and regional experience in their life; they had lived there, had gone to school there, had studied there and had worked there, and their families were from there. It seems to me we have now ended up with a group of people leading the National Party who have not had that experience and who do not understand these issues properly. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The bill before the House is very specific, and the member for McMillan is not addressing the bill. I would ask you to bring him back to the terms of the bill.
—I thank the member for Page. The member for McMillan knows full well that discussion of the leadership of the National Party is not in the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003. I ask the member for McMillan to come back to the substance of the bill and to debate the substance of the bill.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I make a very simple point, which is that we would not be having consideration of this bill if we had had strong leadership from the National Party. I am happy to try—
—Order! The member for McMillan has made his point. He will now return to the substance of the bill.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, this is the substance of bill.
—Order! The member for McMillan will resume his seat. The member for Adelaide.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order: the member speaking is actually reflecting on your ruling, and I suggest that he take your ruling very seriously; otherwise, there are other methods in this chamber for dealing with the issues that he raises.
—I thank the member for Adelaide. I think the member for McMillan may well understand that the chair is very uncomfortable about this situation and would ask the member for McMillan to respect the ruling of chair and to return to the substance of the bill. 
—I have great respect for you, Mr Deputy Speaker; in fact, I have great respect for the member for Page, who has made these points. My point is that these matters are of direct relevance to the bill that we are discussing today. Overwhelmingly, people living in country districts do not want to see Telstra sold off; they do not want to see Telstra privatised. People can take points of order. They can do that if that is what the once great National Party is reduced to. They can get up and make points of order, if that is what they feel that they have to do. But the fact is this is how people feel, and I have a right to say in this parliament what people feel in relation to this issue.
It is not as though it is a 55 per cent to 45 per cent situation. People feel very strongly about this issue, and they do not want to see Telstra privatised. They understand that this will mean fewer services for them. One of the other things that people see very clearly in country districts is that, unless you have that strong control and influence over Telstra Corporation, there will be a more direct flow of the industries that are associated with telecommunications to the capital cities—no doubt at all that that will take place. It will mean that the digital divide which exists between country districts and those capital cities will grow. We are hoping that the new breakthroughs in telecommunications technology will lead to a situation in which the disadvantage that has been historically associated with country people will lessen. Yet this government is supporting an exacerbation of those problems we have traditionally encountered relating to the disadvantage of our geographic distance from those major population centres. There is not much ambiguity in relation to this issue.
I just make the point that people look to the National Party in country Australia to provide leadership in relation to these issues. The National Party has traditionally represented a lot of these rural areas but, I tell you what, people have lost confidence in them. They have lost confidence in them under the leadership of John Anderson and Mark Vaile.
—Order! The member for McMillan must surely know the contents of standing order 81. If the member for McMillan continues to defy the chair, I will sit the member for McMillan down and call on the next speaker.
—I will reiterate that this is a pretty straightforward thing. In the context of the debates that we have had in this parliament, it is certainly not contentious and is something that is as far removed from inappropriate references in relation to this bill as you could possibly imagine. I am happy enough to talk more directly in relation to telecommunications matters. I just want to make the point that the matters that I raise, which are to do with the National Party and the fact that they have not shown leadership on this issue, are relevant to this debate. We would not be having this debate if it were not for them rolling over in relation to this.
I had a forum in my constituency, at Trafalgar, which is an important town in my district. People came from Willow Grove, Thorpdale and the town of Trafalgar and also from Moe and Newborough to participate in that debate. People were pretty fired up, and we probably had about 50 people there. Lindsay Tanner spoke on our behalf and answered questions. There were small business people, farmers, people who work in certain industries and people who work for themselves and understand the importance of telecommunications to their capacity to get work from Melbourne. People from the township committee talked about how important the development of broadband in particular was to the township of Trafalgar. So this is not something that affects one or two people; this affects a lot of people in our community, and that is why there is so much overwhelming opposition to the full sale and privatisation of Telstra. This is an important issue, and we want to have an honest debate on this side of the House in relation to it. It might be that the National Party want to gag debate in relation to this issue, but this is an important matter and a proper debate will be held whether they like it or not. (Time expired)
—The member for McMillan, in relation to comments about the National Party gagging the debate, it is the Speaker who controls the House of Representatives and not the National Party.
—Why don't you shut your mouth?
—The honourable member for Page will resume his seat. The member for McMillan, I ask you to withdraw that comment that you just made to the member for Adelaide.
—What about the interchange? It cuts both ways.
—I asked the member for McMillan to withdraw that comment.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek clarification. What are you asking me to withdraw?
—It is unparliamentary to suggest to a member opposite that they shut their mouth. I ask you to withdraw that, and we will move on.
—I am happy to move on when you ask her to withdraw what she said.
—Have you a comment in relation to the member for Adelaide?
—I am happy enough to withdraw.
—I thank the member for McMillan. Does the member for McMillan have a comment?
—I took offence at a comment which the parliamentary secretary at the table made, and I ask her to withdraw.
—Would the member for Adelaide please withdraw.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, if I have to suggest that respect is shown to the chair, that is hardly something that I would withdraw. I think this debate is—
—That is not what you said. He has taken offence, and you will withdraw it.
—It's true. I heard it.
—What did you hear?
—Not across the table.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The normal procedure is that, if a member takes offence at comments from the other side of the chamber and a request is made that they are withdrawn, then they are withdrawn. I ask you to uphold the normal procedure in this House.
—I thank the member for Batman. The member for Adelaide, what were the comments you made?
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I was disturbed that your ruling was not being adhered to.
—That is not what it is about. As soon as he sat down you had a go at him. 
—Nobody seems to know what I said.
—I do.
—I said that there should be some sensible debate and the Deputy Speaker should be respected.
—And then you had a crack at him.
—Order! The chair is at the disadvantage of not having heard the member for Adelaide's comments. I did hear the member for McMillan's comments, and I asked the member for McMillan to withdraw. I thank the member for McMillan for withdrawing.
—I am happy enough to withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker—
—You have already.
—and I did. To facilitate your judgment on this, I am happy enough to say that the parliamentary secretary at the table said to me across the chamber, `You're just a little boy.' She said that—I heard her. Three people on this side heard her say that. I think that, if it is good enough for me to withdraw for telling her to shut her mouth after she said that, it should be good enough for her to withdraw as well.
—I thank the member for McMillan. Does the member for Adelaide have a comment on that?
—Tell the truth.
—I have no difficulty telling the truth, but I think this is deteriorating, and the debate would be improved and the—
—Just withdraw and be decent about it. He did.
—The member for Batman!
—That is not what I said.
—I accept the explanation from the member for Adelaide. I think we should move on.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Batman, the member for Holt and the member for McMillan are determined to not allow me to speak in this particular debate. That is why they have come into this chamber. I ask you to rule against them.
—I thank the member for Page. I do not think that is a legitimate point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Three members on this side of the House heard comments that the member for McMillan regards as unacceptable. He has requested that those comments be withdrawn in the same decent way in which he acted when you requested it so that the proceedings of the House can proceed. The way we are going raises questions of people potentially deliberately misleading the House and the chair with respect to what was said.
—I thank the member for Batman. I think the House is a little overheated at this stage.
—Ask her to withdraw.
—I did not hear what the member for Adelaide said. I have accepted the member for Adelaide's explanation, and I propose that we move on with this debate.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: three members on this side of the House heard the comment that the member for McMillan took offence at. You did not—
—The member for Batman will resume his seat. The chair has ruled on this matter. ",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2003-08-19,"—I listened very closely to the member for McMillan, and I have listened very closely to the debate on this subject.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. A pretty robust debate was had, and I was prepared—
—Parliamentary Secretary, you lied to the House too.
—I did not.
—You did, and the record will show it.
 (Mr Lindsay)—The member for McMillan will resume his seat. The member for Batman will withdraw the comment he made across the table.
—I withdraw the reference to the fact that the member lied and maintain my view that she misled you with respect to what she said.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, to facilitate the House, I was given a pretty robust time by a few people here while I was giving my speech, but that is part of the political process. What is not part of the political process is the parliamentary secretary at the table yelling out and saying to me, `You're just a little boy.' That is not an appropriate thing to say—
—The member for McMillan will resume his seat. I have ruled on this matter.
—I have listened with interest to members on both sides in the debate on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003, and I am yet to hear any policy. I have listened to the member for McMillan, the member for New England and the member for Calare. I have also heard comments from the member for Hume on the subject of Telstra. The real issue is not the sale of Telstra. This is an enabling bill. The real issue is: how do you protect regional and rural Australia into the future? I think that is the most important point in this debate.
If you have a close look at what has happened in recent times with Telstra, you will see it is fairly clear that the Labor Party have nothing to offer. The only thing the Labor Party and the Independents can offer is the fact that they are opposed to the sale of Telstra. They want to take some spots off the National Party because they see us as the opposition to attack in this particular debate. We want to hear from Independents and the Labor Party what they are prepared to do in the future, because the whole issue about Telstra started with the deregulation of the telecommunications industry. From there on, of course unprofitable services from Telstra were going to be at risk. The coalition government have recognised that rural and regional Australia, with their unprofitable services, were going to be at risk.
If you go through some of the actions that this government has taken to try and overcome that, it is patently clear that this government has runs on the board as far as the protection of regional and rural Australia is concerned. In the first tranche in the sale of Telstra, $250 million was set aside to look at the infrastructure problems in telecommunications. In the second tranche of the sale of Telstra, $670 million was set aside to improve communication services. The total money that has been expended by this government on improving services to the bush is more than $1.2 billion.
We hear from the member for McMillan, the member for New England, the member for Calare and the member for Hume about these juvenile surveys that they have taken. But did those members ever ask their constituents whether they are prepared to go back to the monopoly of Telstra? Are they prepared to go back to 35c calls? Are they prepared to go back to STD calls? Areas like Bonalbo in my electorate, which is only 60 or 70 kilometres from Casino, used to be on STD calls. Are they prepared to go back to limited calls? Are they prepared to go back to the overseas charges that we had in the past? They are the issues you should be asking your constituents: are they prepared to go back to those types of services? We continually see the services that are offered at the present time. For instance, local area calls are 15c and we see unlimited time phone calls overseas for $2 advertised on television quite regularly. 
Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that there will always be a need to support unprofitable regional and rural services in Australia. What I want to hear from the Labor Party and the Independents is whether they are prepared to support, in the future, government support for these particular services, because that is the most important point and that is the point the National Party brings up regularly. Are those opposite prepared to support these services? The member for New England continually raises the point that you cannot bind a future government. Apparently he does not believe in democracy, because the government of the day has the right to change legislation—that is obvious. But I put it to the member for New England that this government has shown its spots, it has shown what it is prepared to do for regional and rural Australia. If he wants to guarantee that the services into the future will be guaranteed for regional and rural Australia, then he should vote for the coalition government. Do not vote for Independents, do not vote for the Labor Party; vote for the coalition government, because we have shown what we will do for regional and rural Australia. That is how you guarantee services into the future.
The telecommunications industry is very competitive and technology is changing fast, there is no argument about that. Were we arguing five or six years ago about mobile phones? Were we arguing about broadband access speed? Of course we were not. They were not available. Now the biggest issues that we have got are access to mobile phones and access to high-speed Internet broadband—they are the issues. I put this to you, Mr Deputy Speaker: technology is going to keep on changing and needs are going to keep on changing, and there will always be an unprofitable service somewhere in Australia. What we want to hear from these people—not these carping arguments and juvenile surveys; we do not want to hear about those—is whether they are prepared, in government, to give us the assurance that they will support these areas. That is what we want to hear: some policy. These Independents are coming out here—
—What about Alby Schultz?
—yes, and one of our own members as well, the member for Hume—on a populist bent, saying `I'm putting out this juvenile survey about what people think.' That is not what we want to talk about; we want to have an intelligent debate about this, about what is going to happen in the future. Where are we going in the future? Technology will change, and you only have to look at the services that have been provided in my electorate to see that. I am pretty fortunate in my electorate. I am pretty happy in fact, because I have had a lot of money spent in my electorate. For instance, there was $1.5 million for Norlink, which was a wireless local loop; Richmond Valley Telecentre got $110,900; Yamba Chamber of Commerce got $75,000; TAFTCo got $894,000; Northern Rivers Internet Marketing got $83,250—the list goes on of the services that this government has provided to these local areas.
If you look at some of the tranches that have been put out, you will see that it is a very interesting list. If you look closely for regional and rural Australia initiatives, you will see that there is funding to meet the telecommunications needs of remote island communities, $20 million; Internet access, $36 million; continuous mobile phone coverage along designated highways, $25 million; Building Additional Rural Networks, $70 million; local government fund, $45 million; expanded mobile phone coverage; connecting Tasmanian schools—the list goes on. Would you believe that in the last election, the Labor Party made it very clear that they wanted to remove some of these government— 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: I understand that, during the course of the contribution by the member for McMillan, when he made some comments about the National Party you ruled those comments out of order.
—I did.
—I, therefore, seek a similar ruling from you with regard to the comments by the member for Page about a member of his own party—the member for Hume—the Independents, the Greens and the Labor Party that those contributions are out of order based on your previous rulings.
—I thank the member for Batman. The ruling was that the member for McMillan should return to the substance of the debate. As the member for Batman is aware, there are some other issues going on at the moment, so I did not hear the member for Page's comments or whether he has strayed from the substance of the debate. I will listen closely now.
—It is obvious that the member for Batman has been hurt by these comments, because in the last election campaign it was clear that the Labor Party was determined to remove the privileges we gave to regional Australia. It was their policy. He made a deliberate interjection—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to the question of relevance and the ruling you just made. I ask you to request that the member for Page return to the bill and that you continue to monitor his performance in the same way that you rigorously monitored the member for McMillan's comments.
—I thank the member for Batman.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. While recognising your decisions in this matter, this is a wide-ranging debate. I think this is an attempt to curtail the member for Page's time. Let me just say—
—The member for Dawson will return to the point of order.
—Others have strayed a long way along country paddocks, and the member for Page should be given latitude.
—I thank the member for Dawson. In the interests of the operation of this House, I ask the member for Page to return to the subject.
—I thank the member for Dawson, though I did not really need her support. It is fairly clear that the member for Batman is not prepared to listen to the text of this debate. All he wants to do is go out there and spoil; he does not want to listen to what the debate is about.
—The member for Page will return to the substance of the debate.
—The substance of the debate is that the Labor Party will not give an assurance that the services that have been provided to the bush will be maintained. The coalition government has made its position very clear. It has seen that in this deregulated market there will always be areas that will be disadvantaged, and it is prepared to support those areas of disadvantage. I want an assurance—and I have not heard it—from the Labor Party and the Independents that they will support that position. That is the position that rural Australians want to hear. They want to hear whether in fact they have bipartisan support for the services they are entitled to. 
Another point I want to make in this debate is that Telstra is half government and half private. There is no doubt that technology is changing and that it is very expensive. If technology changes quickly, companies have to adjust quickly because, if you are not running fast in this environment, you go under. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the position taken by the Labor Party and the Independents will eventually destroy Telstra. Telstra is a great Australian company. It has the technology to compete on world markets but, if it is not allowed to go out and compete, it will go under—there is nothing surer than that. If Telstra had new technology that would help it lead the market and it needed $10 billion for that technology, I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: do you honestly believe that the Treasury would put forward 52 per cent of that $10 billion? I have been dealing with treasuries for something like 10 years and I can assure you that it would not happen.
These people are trying to hobble Telstra. The Labor Party and the Independents want to hobble Telstra and eventually destroy it, because if you do not allow Telstra to go free and compete it cannot provide the services that Australia needs. If governments—both sides of government—are not prepared to commit themselves to the unprofitable areas of these services, isolated and rural Australia will certainly not get the benefits they are entitled to. That is the real issue I want to hear about from speakers from the other side. I have not heard it; all I hear is carping criticism of the National Party and about why the government wants to sell Telstra. I will make one final point and ask if contributors for the Labor Party would tell me one thing: what did they do with the sale of assets when they were in government? Did they pay off Australia's debts or did they spend it indiscriminately? I challenge the members for Batman and Holt—the member for McMillan has made a contribution—to guarantee that we will have the services in the bush if they ever get into government. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003. This bill is about the complete disregard by the Howard government for people living and working in the outer suburbs of our cities and in rural, regional and remote Australia. The bill repeals the provisions of the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 that require the Commonwealth to retain majority ownership of Telstra. The bill does not stipulate the timing of the sale or the process—it will be left to the Minister for Finance and Administration to determine when and the manner in which the sale will happen.
The passing of this bill and its implementation would be a calamity for many Australians, including workers and people living in the seat of Herbert. It would further entrench the divide between the haves and the have-nots. It would exacerbate the ever increasing divide between the prosperous, globalised inner city regions and the outer suburban and country regions. As we all appreciate, Telstra services in outer metropolitan and country regions lag well behind those of inner city regions such as those represented by the member for Adelaide, and that many members of the government suggest otherwise beggars belief, honesty and integrity. Any government member representing an outer metropolitan or country electorate who says otherwise is clearly not listening to the people they purport to represent, nor are they telling the truth. 
As I travel around this country I meet with thousands of people. Never once have I heard anyone speak up in support of the further privatisation of Telstra, and there are very good reasons why people do not support it. They know that they will be the losers if this bill is passed and implemented. They know that the privatisation of Telstra would stymie their hopes of expanding opportunities for the growth and development of their communities and regions. These people have a deep respect for Telstra—a respect that goes back more than 50 years to a government owned and operated business that delivered for Australia and Australians irrespective of where they lived, irrespective of whether they worked or were unemployed and irrespective of their age or whether they were retired. It was a company that was prepared to deliver for all Australians. It delivered a very sound telecommunications service to all of us, but importantly it did far more than that.
The predecessors of Telstra—the PMG and Telecom Australia—were part of the backbone of many regional communities. They employed and trained large parts of communities and they contributed significantly to their economies—and this is exceptionally important in historical terms in Australia. Telstra and its predecessors are historically recognised and respected as part of the driving force that established Australia as a highly skilled country. Telstra was about more than just delivery of telecommunications; it was also about training Australians and, especially, delivering training and many skills for people who worked in regional Australia. Therefore, people in these communities fondly remember the PMG and Telecom. 
When people in regional Australia tell me about their respect for the PMG and Telecom, they invariably outline their fears if Telstra is fully privatised. They tell me over and over again that their access to information and telecommunications technology is decreasing relative to inner city people, and they know that it will only get worse if Telstra is further privatised. People tell me this everywhere I go. I find it unbelievable that members of the government are not hearing the same message. Maybe they have been bullied by the Prime Minister into simply not listening but accepting his will, despite what their constituents believe.
Regional development is dependent—as Deputy Speaker Causley appreciates—on the provision of effective and efficient infrastructure such as roads, rail, energy, water and telecommunications. More importantly, telecommunications are part of the fundamental infrastructure that can drive future economic and job development in regional Australia. Access to information and communications technology is vital to support regions, to create opportunities, to create economic prosperity and to create jobs and training opportunities for young people. 
Access to telecommunications technology facilitates the development of internationally competitive businesses. It is these businesses that help diversify the economies of our communities and create jobs and opportunities for our people. These businesses rely more and more on information and data. For them to be competitive, they will need equitable access to services such as broadband. Communities with access to broadband will have a greater chance of business growth and development, and communities without access will fall further behind. 
Only majority public ownership will ensure that Telstra will act in the national interest as new services such as broadband are rolled out. If Telstra is privatised, broadband services will be rolled out only to places where it is profitable. We can only surmise that the release of the government's own study into the needs of regional businesses, the Regional Business Development Analysis, is being delayed—it sits on the desk of the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party—because it highlights the need for coordinated government action for the provision of vital regional infrastructure such as telecommunications.  
Future services such as broadband are important not only for new and expanding businesses. They are also vital for the development of critical social services within communities and regions. In particular, future telecommunications services are vital for education. Our schools, TAFEs and universities are becoming more and more dependent on access to reasonable and equitable communications and data systems. Many of these organisations already have high-speed Internet access and electronic communications facilities; however, we must be very aware that it is not only the administration of these important institutions that rely on services such as broadband. Increasingly, research and development by students and academics rely on access to broadband. This research is not just taking place at the TAFE or the university; it is taking place in homes and in workplaces, including remote mining work camps, where workers are encouraged to not only work but also further their education and training on the job. I therefore believe that it is not enough to provide a single point of access at the learning institution; these services must be available in the homes and workplaces of Australian workers. 
Regions and communities with reasonable and affordable access to these services have an advantage over communities that do not. At present it is the inner city suburbs in places such as Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne that have this access, and outer metropolitan and country regions are disadvantaged—areas such as many towns in your own seat, Mr Deputy Speaker—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I remind the member for Batman that when I sit in this chair I do not have a seat. 
—As I have frequently visited the seat of Page, I understand the need for these telecommunications systems to be improved. And I am not convinced that they will be improved in seats such as Page and Richmond if Telstra is fully privatised. 
This takes me to the importance of higher education institutions to regions, something that is, without doubt, part of our future. It is irrefutable. Better access to broadband would not only support an increase in student numbers but also facilitate closer engagement of the institutions with their communities. Regional universities have to accept more than ever that they are part of the leadership of these regional communities and they therefore need the tools of a decent communications system to enable them to accept that leadership position and to assist local communities, especially those lagging behind on the economic and employment front.
Broadband will facilitate the transfer of data and information between members of the community and researchers. With this information, researchers will be able to localise their research and provide better and more specific information back to the community. The development of these interrelationships will strengthen the competitive advantage of local businesses, creating more opportunities for their communities and regions.
A privatised Telstra will not facilitate the expansion of broadband services to outer metropolitan or country regions. A similar position potentially applies to the all-important service of health. The expansion of equitable access to broadband services to outer metropolitan and country regions will facilitate more efficient delivery of health services. Rather than forcing patients to travel to our capital cities, the expansion of access to broadband will enable doctors, with their patients, to consult with specialists via videoconferencing. What a bonus this would be to regional communities such as the town of Bunbury. It would keep the patient in the community, it would keep a lot of money in the local economy and it would provide more incentive for doctors to service these regions. It is about improving health services and access in regional communities. 
It is only a very clear, definitive decision for Telstra to remain in majority ownership that will see reasonable and equitable broadband services expanded into outer metropolitan and country regions. But it is not only Labor and Labor supporters that have been calling for Telstra to remain in majority government ownership. The opposition's position on this is very clear and has always been so, but the same cannot be said about the government, especially the increasingly junior partner in the coalition, the National Party.
I suggest to the House that in the debate on Telstra and the bill before the chair this evening the National Party purport to represent the views of country Australians—people living in rural, remote and regional Australia. I simply note the electoral pendulum: more and more, the National Party are disappearing from regional communities. Their parliamentary party decision to support this bill, without proper consultation with their rank and file membership, is a clear indication that their representation is a sham. They are not interested in playing a role in the development of regional, remote and rural Australia. They are completely out of touch with the people living outside our capital cities.
Just like their coalition partners, they have been completely seduced by the financial community. As with the provision of televisions to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, perhaps more than ever—as is evident in this House during question time—they can be bought with generous donations from the private sector. The facts speak for themselves. Just like their coalition partners, the National Party have no heart. They have got no guts; they have got no determination and no will to stand up and speak and fight for the communities they have traditionally sought to represent. They are not the National Party that we knew 30 and 40 years ago, when they had decent leadership committed to regional communities. They are in essence a pale image of a party that once had some standing and respect in the Australian community.
—The member for Batman is straying a long way from the leave of the bill. I ask him to come back to the leave of the bill.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I am dealing with a very important debate: it is about the issue of Telstra and the question of ownership, the decision-making processes related to that and whether or not the patronage of the coalition government of the day in this House can be bought. It is the financial community that will be the only winners if Telstra is fully privatised.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am very concerned that the member for Batman is in fact impugning certain motives in his conduct here tonight. A number of his comments have strayed way beyond the debate. The suggestion, which he has not corrected on the record— 
—I have the point of order. The member for Batman has strayed from the leave of the bill. He will come back to the leave of the bill.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was dealing in a very proper way with the issue of Telstra and whether or not there has been undue influence brought on potential decisions relating to where parties stand on their support or opposition to the sale and full privatisation of Telstra. It is part of the debate. I know suggestions about this embarrass some people on the other side of the House—and so they ought to, Mr Deputy Speaker. You and I know that the carpet outside the doors of the offices of the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has been worn out by the lobbying done by the financial community, demanding the full sale of Telstra. That is what it is about—the full sale of Telstra.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on the same point of order that the member for Batman raised on the previous speaker—keep to the relevant topic. 
—I thank the member for Dawson. The member for Batman is at the present time within the leave of the bill.
—Most definitely, Mr Deputy Speaker. Perhaps the member for Dawson would like to talk about whether or not undue influence was brought on her with respect to the issue of ethanol and her position on the matter.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I suggest the member for Batman needs to rethink his approach with his speech and to withdraw such an imputation on the member for Dawson and what he attempted to say tonight about the Prime Minister and on the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts with his nonsensical assertion regarding televisions that were loaned to them. He needs to withdraw those comments.
—I have the point of order. The member for Batman knows that, if he wants to attack another member in this House, it has to be done by substantive motion. I ask him to speak to the bill.
—Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I was saying—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There has been an accusation that I am guilty of corruption. I want that withdrawn now. I want it withdrawn, Mr Deputy Speaker. 
—The member for Dawson will resume her seat. I think that is an overreaction—
—That is what he said. Nobody leans on me.
—The member for Dawson will resume her seat! I think it is an overreaction. I do not believe that was the imputation. But the member for Batman had strayed from the leave of the bill. I ask him to come back to the bill.
—I agree with your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was an overreaction by the member for Dawson.
—I am not asking for an agreement; I am asking you to come back to the bill.
—As I said, on the privatisation of Telstra the coalition has fallen for the approaches from the financial sector of Australia hook, line and sinker. The opposition opposes the passage of the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. He is at it again. He is going on about people's motives. Get him back to the bill!
—I do not believe so.
—Rather an emotional performance, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: there has been a reflection on the chair by the honourable member. The words I heard were, `You listen!'
—Thankfully, I did not hear it. 
—I did—
—There is no point of order.
—and I am concerned about your status in this place.
—I think the member for Lingiari is taking the member for Batman's speaking time.
—I thank the member for Lingiari for defending your honour, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I said, the opposition oppose the full privatisation of Telstra. Labor listen to people in the outer metropolitan and country regions of Australia. We know that they will be disadvantaged by the passage of this bill. Coalition support for this bill is another indicator of the citycentric policies of the Liberal Party and the National Party. It confirms that the National Party members are completely out of touch with their communities and that they are completely in the pocket of their Liberal Party masters.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Can we get back to the substance of the bill and not political issues?
—The member for Batman is on the substance of the bill.
—The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 is a disgrace. It reflects the fact that the National Party is merely a tail on a Liberal Party dog. It has no substance, no guts and no determination and the member for Dawson is a reflection of why the National Party is in decline in Australia.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this is political ranting. The member is not addressing the bill.
—The member for Dawson might be offended by the comments, but they are not out of order.
—The previous Deputy Speaker ruled in this member's favour.
—The member for Dawson will respect that I, as Deputy Speaker, am ruling on this issue. While you may not be comfortable with the comments, they are not out of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend you for your even-handedness in sitting the member for Dawson down. She is out of her depth in this debate.
—I do not need any support from the member for Batman.
—She has sold out the seat; she does not represent the views of her constituents. She is a disgrace to the National Party. (Time expired)
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. There were a series of frivolous points of order taken by the member for Dawson.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I did not hear any points of order. I think that in the spirit of what has just been discussed we will ignore what has gone on. 
—I am prepared to accept that give and take provided that you have a word with the previous occupant of the chair. His lack of even-handedness and give and take in the way he treated the member for McMillan reflected on him and the chair and it is about time he grew up.
—The member for Batman would realise that there has been a fair amount of tolerance tonight with points of order, including those from the member for Batman.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,2003-08-19,"—The Telstra debate and whether or not to fully privatise Telstra has largely moved on in my electorate of Forrest. The issue is not so much about privatisation or about the government's dividend from Telstra but more about how best we can guarantee service levels in areas and electorates such as mine that are rural and regional in nature.
I remember that when I came into the parliament Telstra was a fully publicly owned service and their service was just appalling. The main complaints were: `I don't have a phone and cannot get one,' or `My phone has been out of service for several weeks and I want it fixed.' In those days it did not seem to bother people that they did not have a phone for a week or so. I guess we were all less dependent on technology.
Telstra, to its credit, lifted its game and when we privatised the first tranche of Telstra the big issue was mobile phone coverage. With the closure of the analog network, digital and CDMA coverage—or more precisely the lack thereof—became the focus of complaints to my office. I still cannot believe to this day that members opposite agreed to the closure of the analog network. It puts people in my electorate at an extreme disadvantage. The Wireless West project that was put in place to infill mobile phone coverage in the south-west is of course CDMA.
My electorate has a very strong tourism focus. Members will be familiar with Margaret River, but lesser known places such as Nannup and Northcliffe have access only to CDMA coverage. This is a real disadvantage for tourists from Perth who only have digital phones, and anecdotal evidence suggests that lack of mobile phone coverage does and can impact on the tourist trade.
I supported the first two tranches of the sale of Telstra, T1 and T2. I was pleased that so many of what are termed `mum and dad investors' bought shares. I am disappointed now that those shareholders have found their share price hamstrung by the uncertainty of a half-privatised Telstra. While their dividend stream is good, I am sure those investors would be feeling a lot more comfortable if their share price were not constrained by the government's 50 per cent holding.
As we approach this hopefully final bill—the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003, which will give the government the ability to sell the remainder of Telstra—I take stock of the numbers of complaints that come into my office about Telstra. I can advise that one of the biggest concerns is Internet speed. I have welcomed the advent of the Internet Assistance Program, which helps people get up to speeds of 19.2 kilobytes per second. I have to tell you that in this day and age as a standard it is woefully inadequate. People want and expect faster and more reliable data connections and data speeds—and this includes people living in rural and regional areas. In many ways it is more important for people in regional and rural areas such as the residents of my electorate, who now rely heavily on the Internet for communications and for business.
I mentioned Margaret River earlier. To illustrate the problem we have been having with data speeds, many of the famous wineries down Caves Road cannot operate EFTPOS machines because of the problems with the data speed of the copper wires and the pair gain system. I think you would agree that EFTPOS facilities are almost a business must these days. It is for these reasons that I welcome the commitment to future proof our regions. The federal Liberal government's commitment of $181 million will do much for our regions and for my electorate. I look forward to the identification of problems and to urgent work to improve the reliability of Telstra's worst performing exchanges. I am certain that the south-west will have several on this list. 
The $181 million will also lock in the benefits of the Internet Assistance Program as part of Telstra's licensing conditions—although, as I stated earlier, I do not think 19.2 kilobytes per second is really good enough these days. I also note that the bulk of the $181 million will be for a national broadband strategy, at a cost of $142.8 million. The national broadband strategy includes a higher bandwidth incentive scheme to provide a financial incentive for providers to offer broadband services in regional and rural areas at prices comparable with those in urban areas. I hope providers take up this initiative, because I can assure them that there is demand for the service.
Bunbury was one of the first regional areas to get ADSL—which, for the uninitiated, is broadband via cable. In Bunbury you can get ADSL but in South Bunbury you cannot. The reason for this is it is slightly more than five kilometres from the exchange and ADSL is only available within a five-kilometre radius from the exchange, even if it is at a rate of 19.2 kilobytes per second. Perhaps even worse are those that are classed as remote customers. Their phones operate by radio link to the exchange. The best they can hope for in terms of data speed is 9.6 kilobytes per second.
In terms of assistance we have drawn a line on a map. If you are on one side of the line you are an extended zone customer and the government has extended subsidies for two-way satellite connection; if you are on the other side of the line you do not get a subsidy. We need to recognise that with technology it is not as simple as drawing lines on a map; rather, it should be about the type of service you get. I believe the broadband strategy and the $181 million to future proof Telstra finally acknowledge this.
I know this will be a relief for a constituent of mine who, although not living too far from the exchange, is bordered by quarantined forest and, as a consequence, is connected to the exchange via radio link. My constituent, himself a former Telstra technician, will be relieved by the broadband initiative, as his son wishes to pursue an IT career and will need broadband as part of his computer course. Currently the only option open to him would be two-way satellite, but he currently does not receive a subsidy because he is not in the extended zone. The privatisation of Telstra and the implementation of the broadband initiatives would make a real difference to their lives.
I mentioned future proofing before. Part of the future-proofing initiative will require that as a part of Telstra's licensing conditions there will be a need to keep the Telstra Country Wide offices and maintain a presence in regional Australia. Telstra Country Wide have made a difference, but there is more to be done. The culture of Telstra still needs to change to recognise and value their rural and regional customers. Telstra Country Wide are on the ground regionally. They do get out and about and they are willing to meet people face to face, which is great, but there is still more to be done in terms of Telstra Country Wide. 
When Telstra spruiked the importance of the Country Wide initiative it was all about how decision making and authority had been devolved to local management—which in the south-west is Ray Philp. I regularly see Mr Philp's smiling face in advertising talking about how he is our local man from Telstra—and, to give him his dues, he is always available. However, when I asked him to meet with people who have been seriously disadvantaged by a Telstra legal department decision, he did not wish to go out to their property but rather wanted the meeting on safe ground and was only prepared to defend the Telstra position if he did meet with them. It appears that he did not have the authority to change the position.
The legal decision to which I am referring relates to a farming family in Harvey who had a new house built. The couple waited more than 10 months to get their phone on. I might add that it was only when I got involved that the phone was finally installed. The couple live on a road which, due to some vagaries, has one name at one end and a different name at the other end. Despite telling Telstra that there was cable pit down one end of the road which was closer to their house, they were instructed to dig a trench from the other end and run the cable up the road. They did this because Telstra assured them that there was no cable pit at the other end of the road.
When the technicians came to install it, they did not have enough cable and—surprise, surprise—discovered there was a cable pit at the other end of the street which was actually closer and they debated whether they should dig a trench and run the cable the shorter distance. Naturally, the couple put in an application for compensation for the delays and the additional cost. Telstra's legal department issued a ruling saying, in effect, that they can tell people to connect the phone from wherever they like. It is my firm belief that Telstra made an error. They do not want to admit it and have hidden behind this legal department ruling.
Naturally, this case is now before the ombudsman, but what appals me the most is that the local manager does not have the ability to help this couple and override this decision that Telstra made. My point is: it is okay to legislate and require Country Wide to stay in regional and rural Australia, but we need more than just a presence and a business unit which sells broadband; we need an actual commitment to rural and regional customers.
I also note that the federal government has committed, as part of the sale, to regular reviews of the adequacy of regional telecommunications services to be conducted by an independent review group. Perhaps if we had this all along, these fundamental infrastructure issues may not have arisen. There is no doubt that our infrastructure, particularly in regional and rural areas, has not kept pace with the changing and increasing uptake of new technologies. The challenge for us as a nation and as a government is to ensure that rural and regional areas which are perhaps not as attractive to the telecommunications market continue to advance. I would point out that this did not happen when Telstra was fully government owned; it only just started to happen when Telstra was half privatised. I am convinced that the telecommunications industry and market will operate better with a fully privatised Telstra which is backed up and reinforced by regulation to protect rural and regional residents.
I am convinced that this bill provides certainty, provides choice for consumers and, more importantly, future proofs telecommunications for rural and regional people. I look forward to the day when Telstra will be fully privatised and my customers can get the service they demand, whether that involves broadband or other services. The industry is fast-moving and we can really only keep pace with those sorts of technologies if in fact we fully privatise Telstra and give those mums and dads who are shareholders of Telstra the ability to have their share value as well as their dividend improve in accordance with market conditions. I commend the bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-08-19,"—Five hundred textile jobs—or more—in my local community are under threat. Recently I was invited to speak at a textile workers rally at Devonport. I assured workers and their families that the Labor Party supported their cause and would strongly resist the further destruction of the textile, clothing and footwear industries in the name of free trade that is not fair trade. In Devonport the local full-time work force is approximately 5,200 people. Of these, 500 workers or 10 per cent are employed at Australian Weaving Mills—AWM—and Ulster Tascot Carpets, located in East Devonport. These businesses draw on services and supplies from over 110 companies within a 30-kilometre radius of Devonport. The workers at these two fine companies are drawn from all points on the north-west coast of Tasmania. Over $20 million in wages enters our local community each year.
—Clearly, member for Corangamite, if these 500 jobs are threatened or lost the social and economic implications will be huge—and no laughing matter. When supporters of AWM and Ulster Tascot speak about assistance to the TCF industries, they are not talking about propping up inefficient or ailing industries. Those days have long passed, as we all know, and these companies are two of Australia's best. `Assistance' means positively supporting a viable industry so that it can compete fairly in the global market over time. For this reason, the future of the TCF industries in Tasmania should not become a race to the bottom by competing on wage costs.
—The member for Indi does not need to shout interjections. How can our businesses compete with countries that pay less than $2 per hour in labour costs? Does the member for Indi want to argue about that as well? So what is threatening our local textile jobs? It is not our local skills, our managerial expertise, our productivity or indeed our products. No, it lies in the preferred options advocated by the Productivity Commission inquiry into the TCF sector which is reporting to the Howard government. The Productivity Commission's initial report released for public discussion proposes continuing existing levels of industry support—that is, the SIP—between 2006 and 2010, slashing this by half until it ends in 2015 and reducing tariffs to five per cent in 2015. Local workers; their union, the TCFUA; the industry peak body, the TFIA; and Labor do not support these options. They have the potential to cause great job losses and the dislocation of communities such as Devonport, Ulverstone and Latrobe—
—And Launceston.
—And indeed Launceston, as my colleague the member for Bass points out. These options also have the potential to cause a drop in research and development and capital investment in the TCF sector—the very things that have made AWM and Ulster Tascot so competitive and viable to date. Labor, industry workers and employers have vigorously argued that SIP assistance should be maintained at least at current levels until 2015 and should be made more flexible. With regard to tariffs, it is Labor's view, supported by the TCF industries, that the Productivity Commission's review has failed to make the case for further tariff cuts. 
In addition, Labor believes that before any proposed 2005 tariff cuts take effect—if they must—a review must be undertaken into the tariff and non-tariff barriers practised by our trading competitors and the likely social and economic impact of further tariff reductions on TCF workers and the broader community. Furthermore, unlike this government, Labor supports a national employee entitlement scheme based on the principle that employees should receive 100 per cent of entitlements, including superannuation entitlements, due to them. Local jobs in the textile industry are at risk if the Howard government adopts the preferred options of the Productivity Commission. It is incumbent on all Tasmanian Liberal senators to vigorously oppose these options as we do. To accuse, as one local Liberal senator did, the TCFUA of being `too narrow-minded' in its campaign to preserve the jobs of its members is an insult both to this union and, significantly, to the hundreds of local textile workers it represents. Workers and their families do not want excuses; they want their jobs.
