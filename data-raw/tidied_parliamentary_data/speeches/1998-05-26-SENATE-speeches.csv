"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-05-26,"—My question is to the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston. Has the minister sought a briefing from his department on the veracity or otherwise of the claims of the heads of two auditing companies, Consulcom and Billbusters, that Telstra derived more than $800 million of its profit last year from overcharging customer accounts? Has the minister sought a report from Telstra? Does the minister consider there is any substance to these claims? If so, what action does he propose to take?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I ask a supplementary question, Madam President. Minister, in view of your concern—but it was not clear whether you had sought information or had asked the ACCC or any other regulatory body to investigate the claim and provide you with information, or whether as minister you had referred it to any of those bodies for investigation—are you aware that Mr Paul Morris, the head of Consulcom, has provided details of overcharges on 65 businesses his company assessed? Is the minister aware that Consulcom assessed an average $23,000 overcharge for each business and that billing errors ranged from tens of dollars for small operations to $625,980 for Woolworths? Again, Minister, in view of the seriousness of these charges, can you confirm that you have actually sought information or asked the relevant regulatory agencies that you mentioned to investigate these very serious claims?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-05-26,"—I did see the reports. I also saw a strenuous denial by a spokesman for Telstra. They are, of course, matters of concern to the government, particularly the quantum alleged, and we would certainly expect the matters to be properly investigated by the communications authority, the ACCC, or even the TIO. There are plenty of people who have direct responsibility for aspects of charging and billing and we would expect them to be pursuing those matters.
Certainly there is already an industry code of practice in place in relation to the accuracy and timeliness of charging and billing, and the communications authority has the power to direct any non-complying carriage service provider to comply with the code. The TIO is also able to investigate and make determinations on complaints about overcharging of certain services, including standard telephone services provided to residential and small business users, and public mobile services.
The ACCC has a general mandate to protect consumers and considerable powers to investigate allegations of anti-competitive conduct. I understand that Telstra has already written to the ACCC claiming that the allegations 
 constitute misleading and deceptive conduct. There is clearly an area of dispute, but it is not one that needs to be resolved by the government at this point in time or that requires more than an expression of concern; from that will flow all the necessary and proper inquiries.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-05-26,"—All Senator Schacht has done really is to repeat the substance of the allegations, and as I have said, on the face of it, a substantial sum of money is involved. These are matters of concern.
—Have you raised them with the relevant authorities?
—I have not gone out of my way to make specific inquiries, but certainly I gave a press interview at the time indicating that I wanted the matters to be looked at by all the relevant authorities. My understanding from the department is that that is already occurring. Indeed, as I have already said to you, Telstra hotly contests these allegations to the point of alleging bad faith on the part of at least one of those who have conducted the survey.
—They always do! They always do.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—We know where your prejudices are coming from. I would have thought that you would be prepared to await the outcome of those various inquiries and then pass judgment, and not do what silly old Senator Carr seems to think is the appropriate approach—that is, bagging Telstra every time he gets half a chance.
In fact, you ought to concentrate a bit more on getting those branch stacking allegations clarified. I can understand why you do not want to, because you would be terrified if they actually adopted a merit based preselection process. You would have no hope at all.

Yesterday in the Senate, Senator Jacinta Collins asked me questions without notice about referrals of unemployed people by Centrelink to new employment agencies
I am now in a position to respond I am advised that:
.	 by 25 May, Centrelink had assessed over 277,000 jobseekers and referred over 77,800 jobseekers to Intensive Assistance (the most personalised and intensive service for disadvantaged jobseekers) Over 4,300 jobseekers have been referred to Job Search Training (providing training in job search techniques) by Centrelink and thousands of new jobs have been lodged on the National Vacancy Data Base by Job Network Members;
.	 referrals from Centrelink to Intensive Assistance have reached 82% of the 95,000 target of referrals to Job Network Members for Intensive Assistance to be achieved by the end of May and 87% of the Job Search Training referral target;
.	 the targets will be achieved in most regions Centrelink has put in place strategies to meet the referral targets. Any shortfall that may arise will be addressed in June;
.	 Job Network members are not guaranteed a set number of referrals It is up to jobseekers to choose the organisation which best suits their needs As planned and subject to jobseeker choice, Job Network Members can expect to have close to full capacity soon after the start of the new financial year;
.	 compared with how long it took to get a much smaller change fully operational with Case Management arrangements under the previous Government—the introduction of Job Network has been an outstanding success.
In respect of aspects of the question relating to the financial circumstances of the new job agencies, I have been advised by Dr Kemp's office that
.	 Job Network members have always been fully aware that they will be paid on the basis of 
 results—that is, they will be paid the bulk of their fees when a jobseeker has been placed in a job for 13 weeks and then 26 weeks—so the bulk of fees would not be received until some time after the market commenced",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Centrelink</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech

The document read as follows—
`NOT A LEVEL PLAYGROUND—THE PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL FUNDING OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The appropriate mechanism for referring issues such as voluntary contributions to the States and Territories is the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). The areas of responsibility covered by the Council include primary and secondary education and it is supported by a number of taskforces which are convened as needed for particular tasks, have prescribed timeframes and reporting arrangements and are reviewed annually. Functions of the Council include coordination of strategic policy at the national level and negotiation and development of national agreements on shared objectives and interests in the Council's areas of responsibility. MCEETYA is therefore the appropriate forum for consideration of the majority of the report's recommendations. The Government considers that the relevant course of action for Parents and Citizens Associations to follow is to pursue these matters further with the relevant State and Territory governments.
The Government agrees with statements made in the minority Report that it appears much of the evidence raised by the Committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated. 

The Committee's claim that there has been a decline in government commitment to education is not borne out by funding figures. Commonwealth funding to schools, for example, has risen by 88 per cent from 1987/88 to 1997/98. (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98).
SENATE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation 1 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments, develop and adopt consistent terminology to describe the various contributions invited, and charges imposed by schools.
Response:
This would be a matter for State and Territory governments to agree. The Government will refer this recommendation to State and Territory governments for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA.

Recommendation 2(a) —
The Committee recommends that governments fund public schools at a level sufficient to deliver the appropriate standard of education within the Eight Key Learning Areas and commensurate with the National Goals of Schooling.
Response-
The Government agrees with this recommendation. In March 1997, MCEETYA reaffirmed its commitment to national collaboration and consultations in the pursuit of national goals for schooling. It also agreed to examine the Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling in Australia to ensure they reflect current and future educational developments. At the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, it was agreed that a small group representing the Commonwealth, all States and Territories and the non-government sector should be established to prepare a draft revision of the National Goals for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA. Work is continuing.

Recommendation 2 (b)  (c)
The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments jointly establish a School Education Costs Committee to undertake consultation and research with the aim of ascertaining the cost of delivering, at the various stages of schooling and in each of the eight key learning areas, an education which will meet the basic requirements of those Key Learning Areas and the National Goals for Schools; and on the basis of such data and information determine overall resource levels, allocative mecha 
 nisms and the relative funding shares of the various governments.
Response—
As indicated in the minority report, the establishment of such a committee would be a matter for MCEETYA. Commonwealth funding for schools has increased by 88 per cent over the period 1987/88 to 1997/98 (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98) and is guaranteed by legislation to the year 2000. The Government is committed to education reform, better targeting and improved educational outcomes for students, and is determined to achieve real improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy. While the Commonwealth provides funding for specific national objectives, it is a matter for State governments to decide the allocation of resources to individual schools. 2.

Recommendation 3 -
The Committee recommends that each State and Territory establish a committee comprising senior education department officials and nominees of peak parent associations to:
(a)	 monitor the amounts set and paid as voluntary contributions, subject levies and other charges
(b)	 monitor schools' compliance with departmental policy that contributions and levies be voluntary
(c)	 record, receive and act on complaints concerning contributions, levies and other charges.
Response -
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 4 -
The Committee recommends that government schools distribute to each family at the start of each school year a Charter of School Education. This Charter shall set out:
(a)	 the nature and extent of the education that will be provided in government schools at public expense
(b)	 government policy on voluntary contributions, and any subject levies and charges for areas outside the eight Key Learning Areas
(c)	 contact details for the committee appointed to monitor the voluntary contributions and arrangements for subject levies and other charges
(d)	 information on any financial assistance provided at the system level for families in 
 cases of genuine financial hardship to assist with the costs of schooling.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 5 -
The Committee recommends that schools provide a statement to be attached to the Charter of School Education referred to in Recommendation 4. The statement should:
(a)	 make explicit to parents any charges the school sets for the areas outside the Eight Key Learning Areas
(b)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(c)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(d)	 provide information about any assistance provided at the school level for families in cases of genuine hardship.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.3.

Recommendation 6 -
The Committee recommends that all States and Territories develop or modify their student assistance schemes to ensure that;
(a)	 eligibility be linked to the Commonwealth Health Card with provision for other hardship circumstances to be taken into account
(b)	 the purposes of the payment be specified and that payments not be used for anything other than those purposes.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 7 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commission a major national research project on costs to families associated with government schooling and their relative impact on low income families.
Response—
The Government does not support this recommendation. This would be a duplication of some of the work of the Committee. However, the Government is interested in ways of supporting choice in the schools sector and in how parents might be better informed of the choices available. The Government will be supporting research into school choice in the schools sector as the best way to ensure that 
 government schooling meets the needs of all students.
Recommendation 8 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments amend their Education Acts by inserting the word `education' in place of `instruction' or `tuition'.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 9 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government restore the level of funding for targeted equity programmes to 1995/96 level.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation which is based on a false premise. Funding for equity programmes has not decreased and this Government has provided additional funding for literacy and school-to-work as programmes designed to give direct benefits to disadvantaged students. The 1997/98 funding package features $596 million for special programs including $163 million for literacy, $148 million for students with special learning needs and $191 million for indigenous education. There is no evidence in the report which demonstrates areas of unaddressed need.4.

Recommendation 10 - 
The Committee recommends that all Commonwealth, State and Territory governments
(a)	 develop comprehensive guidelines for sponsorship arrangements at both school and state levels
(b)	 ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to monitor schools' compliance with the sponsorship guidelines
(c)	 ensure that sponsorship assistance is used to provide additional opportunities for students beyond those provided through the 8 Key Learning Areas.
Response -
The eight Key Learning Areas were formed as part of the national collaborative curriculum development project under the direction of the former Australian Education Council (AEC). The national collaborative curriculum development project was completed in June 1993. At its meeting in July 1993, the AEC agreed that the publication of the statements and profiles is the prerogative of each State and Territory.
The Commonwealth funded the Curriculum Corporation to develop a range of materials to assist in the implementation of the statements and profiles in the eight key learning areas including Annotated 
 Work Samples  and a package entitled, Introducing statements and profiles . In addition, the Commonwealth provided considerable assistance to the States and Territories for professional development across the eight key learning areas.
The development of sponsorship guidelines is an issue for the States and Territories to consider as they have responsibility for the daily operation of government schools.

Recommendation 11 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments which seek to supplement government funding to schools via sponsorship establish a centrally-managed Education Foundation for the negotiation of sponsorship deals, and for the equitable distribution across all government schools of any benefits which result.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation. An additional level of bureaucracy is not required.

Recommendation 12 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government require the State and Territory Governments to review practices involving the sale or rental of school land with a view to enabling any decisions and any benefits to be state wide.
Response-
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation. The disposal of assets is a matter for State and Territory governments. 5.

Recommendation 13 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments
(a)	 develop as a matter of urgency a statement of national principles regarding computer based information technologies in schools, and
(b)	 determine the funding implications of providing schools with the technological infrastructure, training and support to ensure that those principles are realised.
Response-
Cooperation in technology between Commonwealth and States is already underway through OLTC and  Education Network Australia (EdNa) School Advisory Group. EdNA is a Commonwealth initiative where States and Territories and non-government authorities collaborate on all aspects of information technology across all sectors of education. Its aim is to maximise the benefits of information technology for Australian education and training. The EdNA Schools Advisory Group focuses particularly on collaboration about informa 
 tion technology in schools. It has developed a set of standards for content and management of websites on the EdNA Directory Service. The Government does not intend to dictate the schools funding priorities of State and Territory Governments. The Commonwealth will, however, seek the agreement of State and Territory governments to specific national objectives in schooling as set out in the Federal Government's policies for schools.

Recommendation 14 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government reappraise it Capital Grants program with a view to increasing the level of funding to enable government schools to implement technology to a standard jointly determined by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.
Response-
Funding under the Capital Grants Programme will be considered in the Budgetary context. Capital Grants funding for government schools for each year from 1997 to 2000 will be $211 million per year.",SENATE,<title>JABILUKA URANIUM MINE</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Miscellaneous,11,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The government's response to the Senate committee report Not a level playground—The private and commercial funding of government schools  is some nine months overdue. Effectively, they have had just under 12 months to prepare a reply, and they exceeded the normal three-month deadline by some nine months. In that time, they have come up with a startling revelation: that the concerns and the issues raised by the Senate committee on fees and charges being made by schools across this nation are in fact the responsibility of the states. They have attempted to dismiss the concerns of many hundreds of thousands of Australians by buckpassing this issue to the states.
This government tries to present to the Senate, in this most inadequate and totally unresponsive manner, its views which should best be summed up as `referring it to someone else to deal with', to basically pass it off to other people; to suggest that the volume of evidence presented by the Senate committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated; and to maintain the great myth, the great lie that this government seeks to assert, that it is maintain 
 ing its commitment to public education in this country.
The committee report demonstrated, over and over again, the substantial concern of many hundreds of thousands of Australians that the level of support by public education authorities is declining; that in recent years we have seen a devolution of responsibility to schools and, as a consequence, more and more, there is an expectation by governments that it is not governments' responsibility to take care of the legitimate concerns for the educational needs of this country, but that it is for individual parents to meet the funding shortfalls that arise from government policy decisions to reduce government expenditure.
The Liberal's own National Commission of Audit demonstrated that there was a decline in the level of government spending on school education. Expenditure by all levels of government on schools rose by 2.8 per cent of GDP throughout the 1970s; in the 1980s it rose by a slightly greater amount, but it declined under this government. During the period that this government has been in office, public education support has seen a massive reduction.
The government tries to maintain that it is increasing its spending, but the lie was revealed in an answer to a question in the estimates committee. In real terms, in the amounts of money actually being spent, in real dollars that are available for the education of the children of this nation, there has been a substantial decline in public support by the governments of this country. Answer to question No. 52 before the Senate education committee demonstrates in real terms that, in 1995-96, $1.338 billion was spent on government education, by this year the figure had fallen to $1.335 billion and in 1998-99 it will fall to $1.318 billion.
Those figures are quite clear, they are official statistics, yet this government seeks to maintain the lie that it is maintaining its level  of commitment to public education. It seeks to include the additional funds that would normally be applied for inflation or additional students enrolled in the system in the money spent; it does not acknowledge that it is 
 reducing the money spent on public education in real dollar terms.
The Victorian Commission of Audit demonstrated that, in Victoria today, between six and seven per cent of total education revenue is now being raised by parents at a local level; that is, $155 million is coming out of the pockets of parents as a result of so-called voluntary fees and charges. It is not just that people are being expected to put in a bit extra to fund their child's education, the fact remains that not all parents have equal access to money, not all parents have equal access to opportunity. But what you are seeing under this government is a reduction in the level of opportunity, a reduction in the level of real choice being made available to those who seek to use the public education system.
The Victorian Auditor-General demonstrated that 16.9 per cent of non-staff school operating costs was raised as a result of fees and charges being levelled by government schools in Victoria. This is a long way from the claims made in this shonky response that this government has presented to this Senate today, which says that there were `unsubstantiated allegations'—not unsubstantiated to the National Commission of Audit, not unsubstantiated to the Victorian Auditor-General. A number of submissions to the committee demonstrated that the real cost to parents of sending their children to government schools is now in the range of 33 to 70 per cent of the non-staff school operating costs as a result of the government cutbacks in that state. Again and again, you see the parents and teachers highlighting to the public that it is not just a question of people not having the capacity to pay.
Substantial educational issues follow from that. It has been demonstrated again and again that individual children of families who cannot pay these voluntary contributions—these so-called voluntary levies and charges—through various acts of what I would call humiliation, are being embarrassed and their educational opportunities in our schools diminished. Such examples include the withholding of academic reports; the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other functions; the withholding of education 
 al material such as photocopied handouts; the marking of students as absent so that Austudy and Abstudy payments cease; the linking of student enrolment or re-enrolment to the payment of levies; the sending out of accounts for payments of levies; the use of debt collectors on children in this country; the failure to provide school diaries to students; and the removal of various state government support payments—the school card provisions, for instance, in South Australia.
We see the denying of the use of books, the refusing of students access to computers and library; the refusal to allow students whose voluntary contributions have not been paid to attend excursions or camps; the withdrawal of curriculum materials from woodwork, cooking or photography classes and so on.
What the committee demonstrated, again and again, is the use of illicit and, I think, deeply ingrained attempts to humiliate students and force these so-called voluntary payments. The concerns that are raised by the committee go much further than just the question of educational opportunity; they go to some really basic questions about the level of civil rights within the schools in our system.
This is a situation that is becoming more and more intense as a result of the declining levels of financial support by governments for public education in this country and a retreat by governments from what was once accepted as the universal notion of the right of all children to enjoy access to high quality public education.
What you have seen is a rapid growth in the use of levies and charges to make up for the shortfalls in funding that are the result of these government policies. What you are seeing is an increasing use of practices by schools to conceal the so-called voluntary nature of these charges and to engage in what can only be described as bullying and heavy-handed tactics to enforce payment.
What you have here is a Commonwealth government that does not care. It is essentially a Commonwealth government dedicated to the promotion of an elitist view of education—a 
 notion of education that is essentially a 1950s idea—that those who have plenty of money can go to elite schools to enjoy the exclusive conditions of those elite schools and those are the ones who do well in our society. Those who do not have access to large sums of money and do not have access to large sums of disposable cash miss out on educational opportunity. This report is a disgrace.",SENATE,<title>JABILUKA URANIUM MINE</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Miscellaneous,11,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-26,"—I think the comments of Senator Carr are a disgrace. What he is doing is totally misrepresenting evidence. What he is making out to be hard evidence on this matter in reality is just anecdotal evidence. The committee was enormously frustrated in terms of getting any sort of clear picture of what was happening, purely on the basis of a lack of evidence.
Let us look at what is happening broadly in the school system in this country in relation to funding levels. What we have had over a very long period of time is increasing expectations of parents as to what schools should provide. That is fine; we have no problem with that. The difficulty is with finding enough public money to fund such a proposition. Senator Carr makes out that this is a new problem but it is not a new problem, Senator Carr, as you realise. If you look at the minority report you will see a quote going back to the Schools Commission in the early 1980s. It raised a lot of the problems that you are raising in relation to there not being enough money in public schools. It is quite a reasonable proposition, we feel, that parents of children in these schools contribute something towards their education.
It is quite surprising, however, to find that, far from there being a shortage of public money in education in our public schools, in the case of New South Wales there is an absolutely massive surplus. Let us find out where that is. The Sydney Morning Herald article of 16 April—and as Senator Carr realises, our report was brought down in July last year so we have only the benefit of hindsight with this information; but it makes very interesting reading—lists the funds in reserve that public schools have in the high schools of New South Wales. Senator Carr, it 
 lists all 250 high schools. It has beside it the balances of those high schools.
We find, for example, that Bossley Park High—not exactly in your North Shore area of Sydney—has reserves of over $1 million. We find that Goulburn High School has $620,000. We can go through a number of areas in the western suburbs of Sydney: Blacktown High School has $250,000; Liverpool High has $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has $283,000; Wollongong High, in the steel belt, has $219,000; and Young High School has $432,000.
I found your figure for Victoria interesting, Senator Carr, when you said that parents were asked to chip in $155 million. I do not see any great problem with that: if you divide it by the number of school pupils it is not a huge amount of money. In comparison, in New South Wales, if you look at the total of what I have been talking about—and remember your Victorian figure was $155 million—reserves in New South Wales high schools are $285 million. That is just in the high schools, not primary schools—and that money is sitting there at the moment. It is a matter of great concern to the department's general manager of finance, Ken Dixon. He says that funds allocated to schools are to be expended in general in the year of allocation.
Senator Carr, you really have to answer this question: if there is such a shortage of funding in public schools, how come they can build up a quarter of a billion dollars in reserves in the state of New South Wales? It is good housekeeping, I am sure, but it does not really paint the poor picture that you are trying to put up.
The report that was brought down had dissent from the government senators. What we discovered, in listening to the evidence around the country, was that the extra funding of private money in public schools was not significant and that it came in two parts: sponsorships and fees and charges. We found  that in fees and charges these levels were not high and in many states, and in a vast number of schools, there was the opportunity for people who could not pay to make other 
 arrangements. Many of the schemes were voluntary in any case. In the case of sponsorships of schools we found that this was an opportunity for many schools—schools always have limited resources; they always have had and always will—to get extra funding from particular organisations.
We find totally unacceptable the recommendation of the opposition members of the committee that that sort of funding should be used outside the eight key learning areas only. Obviously schools should have the flexibility to use such funding across a much broader area. The idea of central sponsorships with big companies sponsoring events and the resulting funds spread across schools is attractive to us. But we were not drawn to the suggestion of opposition senators that this should be a centrally managed pool of funds.
The broad implications of what was presented in the report of the opposition members are basically unrealistic on a number of accounts. They are not based on any hard evidence. We really did not see any evidence, apart from a bit of anecdotal evidence—and systems will go wrong in particular places, obviously—that this is widespread across the system. We did not see any evidence that fees are an onerous burden on people. We did see evidence that there are mechanisms in place in most states to do something about that. We did not see evidence that sponsorships are causing that great a problem.
In summary, the situation in our schools is that there is quite a reasonable level of funding from the public sector. This is demonstrated by the fact that in New South Wales a quarter of a billion dollars of public money has been salted away. The level of fees is not too high. I think most people would agree that it is reasonable for parents who have children at school to contribute something towards their education. This is not a new idea, Senator Carr. Parents have put in contributions over the whole century.
The idea that absolutely everything should be free—that hospitals should be free, schools should be free and universities should be free—is very much a Whitlamesque type view. I thought we had left that behind in the seventies. We saw the economic disasters 
 when a government overspending approach applied. There is a feeling in the community that in all these areas the public should contribute, and that in particular the people who use these particular services should make some small contribution.
We found on the evidence that we have—as I have indicated, it is mostly anecdotal—that there is not a high level of this sort of funding in schools. It is not creating a significant problem. In his description today Senator Carr totally misrepresented what was found in the set of hearings. The evidence really is just anecdotal, but he is trying to make out that it is some sort of scientific evidence. We certainly do not have that. This is not a major problem.
The responsibility for dealing with the matters raised by the committee rests almost entirely with the states. In the response by the minister to this report he has put most of these matters back in their rightful place. They are things that should be considered by the states through the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA.",SENATE,<title>JABILUKA URANIUM MINE</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Miscellaneous,11,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I rise to make some comments about the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground: private and commercial funding of government schools . There is a huge amount to be said about this, but first of all I have to say that at last we have one government response to one of the reports of this committee.
—Your record wasn't so good!
—Senator, what matters is that we wrote a report on early childhood education which was tabled in July 1996. There is still no word from the government. Senator Tierney has a commitment to adult education. This committee did a report on this matter, but we still have not had a response. I would have thought that Senator  Tierney would have been pleased to hear from the government.
There is a parliamentary convention in this place that governments provide a response within about three months of a report being tabled or at least provide an explanation as to why they cannot conform with that convention. Thousands of people have bothered to prepare submissions, attend as witnesses and put their efforts into making these reports  decent and fair representations of the issues that are out there. I think they are very disappointed and jaded when governments are so disregarding of their contributions. I am therefore pleased that we have a response—albeit way too late.
—It took Ros Kelly 18 months to respond!
—You are actually doing very well, Senator. You are over two years late in providing a response to one of the reports of this committee. I have never found it a persuasive argument to say that, just because you are wrong, it is all right to say, `You're wrong because we were wrong too.' Two wrongs do not correct the fault in your case. If I were you, I would urge your government to respond. This is one of those things that convinces people that we are serious about what we do in this place.
The government in its response starts off by saying:
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The response is therefore very disappointing. As I heard my colleague Senator Carr say, the response by the federal government to most of the recommendations is, `That is a state and territory matter. We'll have nothing to do with it.' That is not what the community cares for. The community knows that the Commonwealth has a federal education minister who has an overarching responsibility for education services from schools to tertiary institutions in this country. The government has suggested that the minister's interest is of no relevance and that really it should be left to MCEETYA, which is no more than a council 
 of Commonwealth and state officials. It is not a council that actually responds to ministerial guidelines or directly implements policy. It does the work that allows the implementation of policy, but it is not the committee that should be given responsibility for the running of these things.
It is cavalier of the Commonwealth government to dismiss its own responsibility—and, I might say, to dismiss it in a contradictory fashion, because with some of the recommendations the government is saying, `It is a state and territory matter, and we have no responsibility,' but in other areas it is saying, `The Commonwealth and the states do work together on this.' What we know, and what everybody said in the committee, is that private funding is necessary for our public schools because government funding for public schools is no longer sufficient for the very many demands on those schools.
It may well be that the money has increased, but the demands on the schools have increased far more, and therefore there is an ever increasing gap between the funding provided to our public schools—charged, I might say, under state education acts to provide a free secular education. That retreat from `free' is causing major concern, and the committee picked up on this concern, because what it says is that in some areas of our community, particularly in what are short-handedly known as the Eastern Suburbs, schools are able to set fees and charges for parents using that school and that, in large part, those parents are able to meet those fees, but that, in many other areas of our country, people simply cannot find the wherewithal to pay those fees and charges.
Families creep around, embarrassed and afraid for it to be found out that they are not able to afford those fees and charges. There even are specific arrangements to assist families in hardship to get some extra funding from the schools but, once again, a lot of parents are mortified that they should have to register for this kind of assistance. We have actually made a lot of recommendations in the report about doing it so that the privacy and  decency of families are respected. We have state and territory governments and a 
 Commonwealth government which are all committed to providing education for all Australians but which are not, according to this response, committed to funding it. That is grossly insufficient.
Secondly, we also have that major point that I have just been alluding to, that the need for private funding has led to a gross inequity in the amount of funding going to schools. As I said, schools in the better-off areas are able to set fees and charges and get that extra assistance; schools in those same areas can also much more readily afford the new technology—computers and so on. They are more likely to have parents who can assist the teachers and the schools with getting sponsorship arrangements that also bring more wealth to those schools, while the schools in the so-called Western Suburbs, the tougher areas in our major states and regions, get further and further behind.
The number of schools that have access to computers in this country makes a very interesting little map, but certainly many of the schools in the western suburbs and in regional and rural Australia, isolated areas, do not have the same access. If time and time again we hear of the need for access to technology so that our children will at least be able to get the new jobs that require that technology and that kind of training and capacity, then what we are doing is simply writing a formula now for all those children to be further behind the eight ball when they leave their schools.
This is a report that I thought the government might take much more seriously, because it is a thoughtful and considered report and because, as I say, the committee had very many submissions from many people who were very concerned that the cost of education was pricing education out of affordability for many families. Many families told us, for example, that they had to choose between funding their children for special classes or funding their children for trips and tours. Many families could not afford both, and so their children were being dudded out of some of those visits and trips that the school curriculum decides are important. They also have to deal with the fact that their children are 
 very isolated, alienated, if they are not able to participate with all their school chums.
I find it an interesting thing too that the government seems to be rejecting any recommendation for decent research, for example, about hard data on the actual cost of education. What does it cost to educate a grade 4 pupil in Australia? We do not know. The government accuses us in this response to the report of saying that the evidence was anecdotal and unsubstantiated in many cases. We say that is exactly the case because we have not got the hard data and research, and we recommended that there be such hard data and research—in other words, that the Commonwealth fund that kind of investigation so that we could say in future what it does cost to educate a grade 4, grade 6 or grade 10 pupil, and then we would have a much better idea of what the level of state and Commonwealth assistance ought to be.
It is interesting that Senator Tierney was so dismissive of this report: `It is anecdotal; we are not going to worry; it is all made up, and parents out there in the community are not complaining about education.' I do not know where Senator Tierney has been, but the parents that I know are complaining. They are very concerned about the cost of education and they are very concerned that they will not be able to get the best for their children. That is what so many parents actually put their effort into. They will work at second and third jobs; both parents will work, and the highest priority for so many of those parents is to make sure their children get a good education. When people can no longer afford a so-called free secular education, it is time for governments very seriously to have a long hard look at this.
I find it very disappointing that a Commonwealth government education minister should put out a report that says, `It is not my responsibility.' In the past we have seen education ministers from the states brawling with the Commonwealth minister for education. It has had a very bad effect on the status of teachers, it has had a very bad effect on morale and it has had a very bad effect in  terms of sufficient funding for our schools. The state education ministers know that the 
 Commonwealth's involvement in education is particularly to make sure that they do have adequate funding distributed with equity, and that they get support, so that particularly our children from disadvantaged areas who are doing it tough do get that kind of consideration from the Commonwealth. The government response is a very big disappointment, and parents and families of Australia will judge the government very sternly because of it.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-05-26,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground—Private and commercial funding of government schools , and I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
`NOT A LEVEL PLAYGROUND—THE PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL FUNDING OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The appropriate mechanism for referring issues such as voluntary contributions to the States and Territories is the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). The areas of responsibility covered by the Council include primary and secondary education and it is supported by a number of taskforces which are convened as needed for particular tasks, have prescribed timeframes and reporting arrangements and are reviewed annually. Functions of the Council include coordination of strategic policy at the national level and negotiation and development of national agreements on shared objectives and interests in the Council's areas of responsibility. MCEETYA is therefore the appropriate forum for consideration of the majority of the report's recommendations. The Government considers that the relevant course of action for Parents and Citizens Associations to follow is to pursue these matters further with the relevant State and Territory governments.
The Government agrees with statements made in the minority Report that it appears much of the evidence raised by the Committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated. 

The Committee's claim that there has been a decline in government commitment to education is not borne out by funding figures. Commonwealth funding to schools, for example, has risen by 88 per cent from 1987/88 to 1997/98. (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98).
SENATE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation 1 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments, develop and adopt consistent terminology to describe the various contributions invited, and charges imposed by schools.
Response:
This would be a matter for State and Territory governments to agree. The Government will refer this recommendation to State and Territory governments for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA.

Recommendation 2(a) —
The Committee recommends that governments fund public schools at a level sufficient to deliver the appropriate standard of education within the Eight Key Learning Areas and commensurate with the National Goals of Schooling.
Response-
The Government agrees with this recommendation. In March 1997, MCEETYA reaffirmed its commitment to national collaboration and consultations in the pursuit of national goals for schooling. It also agreed to examine the Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling in Australia to ensure they reflect current and future educational developments. At the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, it was agreed that a small group representing the Commonwealth, all States and Territories and the non-government sector should be established to prepare a draft revision of the National Goals for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA. Work is continuing.

Recommendation 2 (b)  (c)
The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments jointly establish a School Education Costs Committee to undertake consultation and research with the aim of ascertaining the cost of delivering, at the various stages of schooling and in each of the eight key learning areas, an education which will meet the basic requirements of those Key Learning Areas and the National Goals for Schools; and on the basis of such data and information determine overall resource levels, allocative mecha 
 nisms and the relative funding shares of the various governments.
Response—
As indicated in the minority report, the establishment of such a committee would be a matter for MCEETYA. Commonwealth funding for schools has increased by 88 per cent over the period 1987/88 to 1997/98 (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98) and is guaranteed by legislation to the year 2000. The Government is committed to education reform, better targeting and improved educational outcomes for students, and is determined to achieve real improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy. While the Commonwealth provides funding for specific national objectives, it is a matter for State governments to decide the allocation of resources to individual schools. 2.

Recommendation 3 -
The Committee recommends that each State and Territory establish a committee comprising senior education department officials and nominees of peak parent associations to:
(a)	 monitor the amounts set and paid as voluntary contributions, subject levies and other charges
(b)	 monitor schools' compliance with departmental policy that contributions and levies be voluntary
(c)	 record, receive and act on complaints concerning contributions, levies and other charges.
Response -
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 4 -
The Committee recommends that government schools distribute to each family at the start of each school year a Charter of School Education. This Charter shall set out:
(a)	 the nature and extent of the education that will be provided in government schools at public expense
(b)	 government policy on voluntary contributions, and any subject levies and charges for areas outside the eight Key Learning Areas
(c)	 contact details for the committee appointed to monitor the voluntary contributions and arrangements for subject levies and other charges
(d)	 information on any financial assistance provided at the system level for families in 
 cases of genuine financial hardship to assist with the costs of schooling.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 5 -
The Committee recommends that schools provide a statement to be attached to the Charter of School Education referred to in Recommendation 4. The statement should:
(a)	 make explicit to parents any charges the school sets for the areas outside the Eight Key Learning Areas
(b)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(c)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(d)	 provide information about any assistance provided at the school level for families in cases of genuine hardship.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.3.

Recommendation 6 -
The Committee recommends that all States and Territories develop or modify their student assistance schemes to ensure that;
(a)	 eligibility be linked to the Commonwealth Health Card with provision for other hardship circumstances to be taken into account
(b)	 the purposes of the payment be specified and that payments not be used for anything other than those purposes.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 7 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commission a major national research project on costs to families associated with government schooling and their relative impact on low income families.
Response—
The Government does not support this recommendation. This would be a duplication of some of the work of the Committee. However, the Government is interested in ways of supporting choice in the schools sector and in how parents might be better informed of the choices available. The Government will be supporting research into school choice in the schools sector as the best way to ensure that 
 government schooling meets the needs of all students.
Recommendation 8 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments amend their Education Acts by inserting the word `education' in place of `instruction' or `tuition'.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 9 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government restore the level of funding for targeted equity programmes to 1995/96 level.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation which is based on a false premise. Funding for equity programmes has not decreased and this Government has provided additional funding for literacy and school-to-work as programmes designed to give direct benefits to disadvantaged students. The 1997/98 funding package features $596 million for special programs including $163 million for literacy, $148 million for students with special learning needs and $191 million for indigenous education. There is no evidence in the report which demonstrates areas of unaddressed need.4.

Recommendation 10 - 
The Committee recommends that all Commonwealth, State and Territory governments
(a)	 develop comprehensive guidelines for sponsorship arrangements at both school and state levels
(b)	 ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to monitor schools' compliance with the sponsorship guidelines
(c)	 ensure that sponsorship assistance is used to provide additional opportunities for students beyond those provided through the 8 Key Learning Areas.
Response -
The eight Key Learning Areas were formed as part of the national collaborative curriculum development project under the direction of the former Australian Education Council (AEC). The national collaborative curriculum development project was completed in June 1993. At its meeting in July 1993, the AEC agreed that the publication of the statements and profiles is the prerogative of each State and Territory.
The Commonwealth funded the Curriculum Corporation to develop a range of materials to assist in the implementation of the statements and profiles in the eight key learning areas including Annotated 
 Work Samples  and a package entitled, Introducing statements and profiles . In addition, the Commonwealth provided considerable assistance to the States and Territories for professional development across the eight key learning areas.
The development of sponsorship guidelines is an issue for the States and Territories to consider as they have responsibility for the daily operation of government schools.

Recommendation 11 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments which seek to supplement government funding to schools via sponsorship establish a centrally-managed Education Foundation for the negotiation of sponsorship deals, and for the equitable distribution across all government schools of any benefits which result.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation. An additional level of bureaucracy is not required.

Recommendation 12 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government require the State and Territory Governments to review practices involving the sale or rental of school land with a view to enabling any decisions and any benefits to be state wide.
Response-
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation. The disposal of assets is a matter for State and Territory governments. 5.

Recommendation 13 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments
(a)	 develop as a matter of urgency a statement of national principles regarding computer based information technologies in schools, and
(b)	 determine the funding implications of providing schools with the technological infrastructure, training and support to ensure that those principles are realised.
Response-
Cooperation in technology between Commonwealth and States is already underway through OLTC and  Education Network Australia (EdNa) School Advisory Group. EdNA is a Commonwealth initiative where States and Territories and non-government authorities collaborate on all aspects of information technology across all sectors of education. Its aim is to maximise the benefits of information technology for Australian education and training. The EdNA Schools Advisory Group focuses particularly on collaboration about informa 
 tion technology in schools. It has developed a set of standards for content and management of websites on the EdNA Directory Service. The Government does not intend to dictate the schools funding priorities of State and Territory Governments. The Commonwealth will, however, seek the agreement of State and Territory governments to specific national objectives in schooling as set out in the Federal Government's policies for schools.

Recommendation 14 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government reappraise it Capital Grants program with a view to increasing the level of funding to enable government schools to implement technology to a standard jointly determined by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.
Response-
Funding under the Capital Grants Programme will be considered in the Budgetary context. Capital Grants funding for government schools for each year from 1997 to 2000 will be $211 million per year.",SENATE,<title>JABILUKA URANIUM MINE</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Miscellaneous,11,2,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The government's response to the Senate committee report Not a level playground—The private and commercial funding of government schools  is some nine months overdue. Effectively, they have had just under 12 months to prepare a reply, and they exceeded the normal three-month deadline by some nine months. In that time, they have come up with a startling revelation: that the concerns and the issues raised by the Senate committee on fees and charges being made by schools across this nation are in fact the responsibility of the states. They have attempted to dismiss the concerns of many hundreds of thousands of Australians by buckpassing this issue to the states.
This government tries to present to the Senate, in this most inadequate and totally unresponsive manner, its views which should best be summed up as `referring it to someone else to deal with', to basically pass it off to other people; to suggest that the volume of evidence presented by the Senate committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated; and to maintain the great myth, the great lie that this government seeks to assert, that it is maintain 
 ing its commitment to public education in this country.
The committee report demonstrated, over and over again, the substantial concern of many hundreds of thousands of Australians that the level of support by public education authorities is declining; that in recent years we have seen a devolution of responsibility to schools and, as a consequence, more and more, there is an expectation by governments that it is not governments' responsibility to take care of the legitimate concerns for the educational needs of this country, but that it is for individual parents to meet the funding shortfalls that arise from government policy decisions to reduce government expenditure.
The Liberal's own National Commission of Audit demonstrated that there was a decline in the level of government spending on school education. Expenditure by all levels of government on schools rose by 2.8 per cent of GDP throughout the 1970s; in the 1980s it rose by a slightly greater amount, but it declined under this government. During the period that this government has been in office, public education support has seen a massive reduction.
The government tries to maintain that it is increasing its spending, but the lie was revealed in an answer to a question in the estimates committee. In real terms, in the amounts of money actually being spent, in real dollars that are available for the education of the children of this nation, there has been a substantial decline in public support by the governments of this country. Answer to question No. 52 before the Senate education committee demonstrates in real terms that, in 1995-96, $1.338 billion was spent on government education, by this year the figure had fallen to $1.335 billion and in 1998-99 it will fall to $1.318 billion.
Those figures are quite clear, they are official statistics, yet this government seeks to maintain the lie that it is maintaining its level  of commitment to public education. It seeks to include the additional funds that would normally be applied for inflation or additional students enrolled in the system in the money spent; it does not acknowledge that it is 
 reducing the money spent on public education in real dollar terms.
The Victorian Commission of Audit demonstrated that, in Victoria today, between six and seven per cent of total education revenue is now being raised by parents at a local level; that is, $155 million is coming out of the pockets of parents as a result of so-called voluntary fees and charges. It is not just that people are being expected to put in a bit extra to fund their child's education, the fact remains that not all parents have equal access to money, not all parents have equal access to opportunity. But what you are seeing under this government is a reduction in the level of opportunity, a reduction in the level of real choice being made available to those who seek to use the public education system.
The Victorian Auditor-General demonstrated that 16.9 per cent of non-staff school operating costs was raised as a result of fees and charges being levelled by government schools in Victoria. This is a long way from the claims made in this shonky response that this government has presented to this Senate today, which says that there were `unsubstantiated allegations'—not unsubstantiated to the National Commission of Audit, not unsubstantiated to the Victorian Auditor-General. A number of submissions to the committee demonstrated that the real cost to parents of sending their children to government schools is now in the range of 33 to 70 per cent of the non-staff school operating costs as a result of the government cutbacks in that state. Again and again, you see the parents and teachers highlighting to the public that it is not just a question of people not having the capacity to pay.
Substantial educational issues follow from that. It has been demonstrated again and again that individual children of families who cannot pay these voluntary contributions—these so-called voluntary levies and charges—through various acts of what I would call humiliation, are being embarrassed and their educational opportunities in our schools diminished. Such examples include the withholding of academic reports; the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other functions; the withholding of education 
 al material such as photocopied handouts; the marking of students as absent so that Austudy and Abstudy payments cease; the linking of student enrolment or re-enrolment to the payment of levies; the sending out of accounts for payments of levies; the use of debt collectors on children in this country; the failure to provide school diaries to students; and the removal of various state government support payments—the school card provisions, for instance, in South Australia.
We see the denying of the use of books, the refusing of students access to computers and library; the refusal to allow students whose voluntary contributions have not been paid to attend excursions or camps; the withdrawal of curriculum materials from woodwork, cooking or photography classes and so on.
What the committee demonstrated, again and again, is the use of illicit and, I think, deeply ingrained attempts to humiliate students and force these so-called voluntary payments. The concerns that are raised by the committee go much further than just the question of educational opportunity; they go to some really basic questions about the level of civil rights within the schools in our system.
This is a situation that is becoming more and more intense as a result of the declining levels of financial support by governments for public education in this country and a retreat by governments from what was once accepted as the universal notion of the right of all children to enjoy access to high quality public education.
What you have seen is a rapid growth in the use of levies and charges to make up for the shortfalls in funding that are the result of these government policies. What you are seeing is an increasing use of practices by schools to conceal the so-called voluntary nature of these charges and to engage in what can only be described as bullying and heavy-handed tactics to enforce payment.
What you have here is a Commonwealth government that does not care. It is essentially a Commonwealth government dedicated to the promotion of an elitist view of education—a 
 notion of education that is essentially a 1950s idea—that those who have plenty of money can go to elite schools to enjoy the exclusive conditions of those elite schools and those are the ones who do well in our society. Those who do not have access to large sums of money and do not have access to large sums of disposable cash miss out on educational opportunity. This report is a disgrace.",SENATE,<title>JABILUKA URANIUM MINE</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Miscellaneous,11,2,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-26,"—I think the comments of Senator Carr are a disgrace. What he is doing is totally misrepresenting evidence. What he is making out to be hard evidence on this matter in reality is just anecdotal evidence. The committee was enormously frustrated in terms of getting any sort of clear picture of what was happening, purely on the basis of a lack of evidence.
Let us look at what is happening broadly in the school system in this country in relation to funding levels. What we have had over a very long period of time is increasing expectations of parents as to what schools should provide. That is fine; we have no problem with that. The difficulty is with finding enough public money to fund such a proposition. Senator Carr makes out that this is a new problem but it is not a new problem, Senator Carr, as you realise. If you look at the minority report you will see a quote going back to the Schools Commission in the early 1980s. It raised a lot of the problems that you are raising in relation to there not being enough money in public schools. It is quite a reasonable proposition, we feel, that parents of children in these schools contribute something towards their education.
It is quite surprising, however, to find that, far from there being a shortage of public money in education in our public schools, in the case of New South Wales there is an absolutely massive surplus. Let us find out where that is. The Sydney Morning Herald article of 16 April—and as Senator Carr realises, our report was brought down in July last year so we have only the benefit of hindsight with this information; but it makes very interesting reading—lists the funds in reserve that public schools have in the high schools of New South Wales. Senator Carr, it 
 lists all 250 high schools. It has beside it the balances of those high schools.
We find, for example, that Bossley Park High—not exactly in your North Shore area of Sydney—has reserves of over $1 million. We find that Goulburn High School has $620,000. We can go through a number of areas in the western suburbs of Sydney: Blacktown High School has $250,000; Liverpool High has $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has $283,000; Wollongong High, in the steel belt, has $219,000; and Young High School has $432,000.
I found your figure for Victoria interesting, Senator Carr, when you said that parents were asked to chip in $155 million. I do not see any great problem with that: if you divide it by the number of school pupils it is not a huge amount of money. In comparison, in New South Wales, if you look at the total of what I have been talking about—and remember your Victorian figure was $155 million—reserves in New South Wales high schools are $285 million. That is just in the high schools, not primary schools—and that money is sitting there at the moment. It is a matter of great concern to the department's general manager of finance, Ken Dixon. He says that funds allocated to schools are to be expended in general in the year of allocation.
Senator Carr, you really have to answer this question: if there is such a shortage of funding in public schools, how come they can build up a quarter of a billion dollars in reserves in the state of New South Wales? It is good housekeeping, I am sure, but it does not really paint the poor picture that you are trying to put up.
The report that was brought down had dissent from the government senators. What we discovered, in listening to the evidence around the country, was that the extra funding of private money in public schools was not significant and that it came in two parts: sponsorships and fees and charges. We found  that in fees and charges these levels were not high and in many states, and in a vast number of schools, there was the opportunity for people who could not pay to make other 
 arrangements. Many of the schemes were voluntary in any case. In the case of sponsorships of schools we found that this was an opportunity for many schools—schools always have limited resources; they always have had and always will—to get extra funding from particular organisations.
We find totally unacceptable the recommendation of the opposition members of the committee that that sort of funding should be used outside the eight key learning areas only. Obviously schools should have the flexibility to use such funding across a much broader area. The idea of central sponsorships with big companies sponsoring events and the resulting funds spread across schools is attractive to us. But we were not drawn to the suggestion of opposition senators that this should be a centrally managed pool of funds.
The broad implications of what was presented in the report of the opposition members are basically unrealistic on a number of accounts. They are not based on any hard evidence. We really did not see any evidence, apart from a bit of anecdotal evidence—and systems will go wrong in particular places, obviously—that this is widespread across the system. We did not see any evidence that fees are an onerous burden on people. We did see evidence that there are mechanisms in place in most states to do something about that. We did not see evidence that sponsorships are causing that great a problem.
In summary, the situation in our schools is that there is quite a reasonable level of funding from the public sector. This is demonstrated by the fact that in New South Wales a quarter of a billion dollars of public money has been salted away. The level of fees is not too high. I think most people would agree that it is reasonable for parents who have children at school to contribute something towards their education. This is not a new idea, Senator Carr. Parents have put in contributions over the whole century.
The idea that absolutely everything should be free—that hospitals should be free, schools should be free and universities should be free—is very much a Whitlamesque type view. I thought we had left that behind in the seventies. We saw the economic disasters 
 when a government overspending approach applied. There is a feeling in the community that in all these areas the public should contribute, and that in particular the people who use these particular services should make some small contribution.
We found on the evidence that we have—as I have indicated, it is mostly anecdotal—that there is not a high level of this sort of funding in schools. It is not creating a significant problem. In his description today Senator Carr totally misrepresented what was found in the set of hearings. The evidence really is just anecdotal, but he is trying to make out that it is some sort of scientific evidence. We certainly do not have that. This is not a major problem.
The responsibility for dealing with the matters raised by the committee rests almost entirely with the states. In the response by the minister to this report he has put most of these matters back in their rightful place. They are things that should be considered by the states through the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA.",SENATE,<title>JABILUKA URANIUM MINE</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Miscellaneous,11,2,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I rise to make some comments about the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground: private and commercial funding of government schools . There is a huge amount to be said about this, but first of all I have to say that at last we have one government response to one of the reports of this committee.
—Your record wasn't so good!
—Senator, what matters is that we wrote a report on early childhood education which was tabled in July 1996. There is still no word from the government. Senator Tierney has a commitment to adult education. This committee did a report on this matter, but we still have not had a response. I would have thought that Senator  Tierney would have been pleased to hear from the government.
There is a parliamentary convention in this place that governments provide a response within about three months of a report being tabled or at least provide an explanation as to why they cannot conform with that convention. Thousands of people have bothered to prepare submissions, attend as witnesses and put their efforts into making these reports  decent and fair representations of the issues that are out there. I think they are very disappointed and jaded when governments are so disregarding of their contributions. I am therefore pleased that we have a response—albeit way too late.
—It took Ros Kelly 18 months to respond!
—You are actually doing very well, Senator. You are over two years late in providing a response to one of the reports of this committee. I have never found it a persuasive argument to say that, just because you are wrong, it is all right to say, `You're wrong because we were wrong too.' Two wrongs do not correct the fault in your case. If I were you, I would urge your government to respond. This is one of those things that convinces people that we are serious about what we do in this place.
The government in its response starts off by saying:
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The response is therefore very disappointing. As I heard my colleague Senator Carr say, the response by the federal government to most of the recommendations is, `That is a state and territory matter. We'll have nothing to do with it.' That is not what the community cares for. The community knows that the Commonwealth has a federal education minister who has an overarching responsibility for education services from schools to tertiary institutions in this country. The government has suggested that the minister's interest is of no relevance and that really it should be left to MCEETYA, which is no more than a council 
 of Commonwealth and state officials. It is not a council that actually responds to ministerial guidelines or directly implements policy. It does the work that allows the implementation of policy, but it is not the committee that should be given responsibility for the running of these things.
It is cavalier of the Commonwealth government to dismiss its own responsibility—and, I might say, to dismiss it in a contradictory fashion, because with some of the recommendations the government is saying, `It is a state and territory matter, and we have no responsibility,' but in other areas it is saying, `The Commonwealth and the states do work together on this.' What we know, and what everybody said in the committee, is that private funding is necessary for our public schools because government funding for public schools is no longer sufficient for the very many demands on those schools.
It may well be that the money has increased, but the demands on the schools have increased far more, and therefore there is an ever increasing gap between the funding provided to our public schools—charged, I might say, under state education acts to provide a free secular education. That retreat from `free' is causing major concern, and the committee picked up on this concern, because what it says is that in some areas of our community, particularly in what are short-handedly known as the Eastern Suburbs, schools are able to set fees and charges for parents using that school and that, in large part, those parents are able to meet those fees, but that, in many other areas of our country, people simply cannot find the wherewithal to pay those fees and charges.
Families creep around, embarrassed and afraid for it to be found out that they are not able to afford those fees and charges. There even are specific arrangements to assist families in hardship to get some extra funding from the schools but, once again, a lot of parents are mortified that they should have to register for this kind of assistance. We have actually made a lot of recommendations in the report about doing it so that the privacy and  decency of families are respected. We have state and territory governments and a 
 Commonwealth government which are all committed to providing education for all Australians but which are not, according to this response, committed to funding it. That is grossly insufficient.
Secondly, we also have that major point that I have just been alluding to, that the need for private funding has led to a gross inequity in the amount of funding going to schools. As I said, schools in the better-off areas are able to set fees and charges and get that extra assistance; schools in those same areas can also much more readily afford the new technology—computers and so on. They are more likely to have parents who can assist the teachers and the schools with getting sponsorship arrangements that also bring more wealth to those schools, while the schools in the so-called Western Suburbs, the tougher areas in our major states and regions, get further and further behind.
The number of schools that have access to computers in this country makes a very interesting little map, but certainly many of the schools in the western suburbs and in regional and rural Australia, isolated areas, do not have the same access. If time and time again we hear of the need for access to technology so that our children will at least be able to get the new jobs that require that technology and that kind of training and capacity, then what we are doing is simply writing a formula now for all those children to be further behind the eight ball when they leave their schools.
This is a report that I thought the government might take much more seriously, because it is a thoughtful and considered report and because, as I say, the committee had very many submissions from many people who were very concerned that the cost of education was pricing education out of affordability for many families. Many families told us, for example, that they had to choose between funding their children for special classes or funding their children for trips and tours. Many families could not afford both, and so their children were being dudded out of some of those visits and trips that the school curriculum decides are important. They also have to deal with the fact that their children are 
 very isolated, alienated, if they are not able to participate with all their school chums.
I find it an interesting thing too that the government seems to be rejecting any recommendation for decent research, for example, about hard data on the actual cost of education. What does it cost to educate a grade 4 pupil in Australia? We do not know. The government accuses us in this response to the report of saying that the evidence was anecdotal and unsubstantiated in many cases. We say that is exactly the case because we have not got the hard data and research, and we recommended that there be such hard data and research—in other words, that the Commonwealth fund that kind of investigation so that we could say in future what it does cost to educate a grade 4, grade 6 or grade 10 pupil, and then we would have a much better idea of what the level of state and Commonwealth assistance ought to be.
It is interesting that Senator Tierney was so dismissive of this report: `It is anecdotal; we are not going to worry; it is all made up, and parents out there in the community are not complaining about education.' I do not know where Senator Tierney has been, but the parents that I know are complaining. They are very concerned about the cost of education and they are very concerned that they will not be able to get the best for their children. That is what so many parents actually put their effort into. They will work at second and third jobs; both parents will work, and the highest priority for so many of those parents is to make sure their children get a good education. When people can no longer afford a so-called free secular education, it is time for governments very seriously to have a long hard look at this.
I find it very disappointing that a Commonwealth government education minister should put out a report that says, `It is not my responsibility.' In the past we have seen education ministers from the states brawling with the Commonwealth minister for education. It has had a very bad effect on the status of teachers, it has had a very bad effect on morale and it has had a very bad effect in  terms of sufficient funding for our schools. The state education ministers know that the 
 Commonwealth's involvement in education is particularly to make sure that they do have adequate funding distributed with equity, and that they get support, so that particularly our children from disadvantaged areas who are doing it tough do get that kind of consideration from the Commonwealth. The government response is a very big disappointment, and parents and families of Australia will judge the government very sternly because of it.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-05-26,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground—Private and commercial funding of government schools , and I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
`NOT A LEVEL PLAYGROUND—THE PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL FUNDING OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The appropriate mechanism for referring issues such as voluntary contributions to the States and Territories is the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). The areas of responsibility covered by the Council include primary and secondary education and it is supported by a number of taskforces which are convened as needed for particular tasks, have prescribed timeframes and reporting arrangements and are reviewed annually. Functions of the Council include coordination of strategic policy at the national level and negotiation and development of national agreements on shared objectives and interests in the Council's areas of responsibility. MCEETYA is therefore the appropriate forum for consideration of the majority of the report's recommendations. The Government considers that the relevant course of action for Parents and Citizens Associations to follow is to pursue these matters further with the relevant State and Territory governments.
The Government agrees with statements made in the minority Report that it appears much of the evidence raised by the Committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated. 

The Committee's claim that there has been a decline in government commitment to education is not borne out by funding figures. Commonwealth funding to schools, for example, has risen by 88 per cent from 1987/88 to 1997/98. (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98).
SENATE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation 1 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments, develop and adopt consistent terminology to describe the various contributions invited, and charges imposed by schools.
Response:
This would be a matter for State and Territory governments to agree. The Government will refer this recommendation to State and Territory governments for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA.

Recommendation 2(a) —
The Committee recommends that governments fund public schools at a level sufficient to deliver the appropriate standard of education within the Eight Key Learning Areas and commensurate with the National Goals of Schooling.
Response-
The Government agrees with this recommendation. In March 1997, MCEETYA reaffirmed its commitment to national collaboration and consultations in the pursuit of national goals for schooling. It also agreed to examine the Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling in Australia to ensure they reflect current and future educational developments. At the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, it was agreed that a small group representing the Commonwealth, all States and Territories and the non-government sector should be established to prepare a draft revision of the National Goals for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA. Work is continuing.

Recommendation 2 (b)  (c)
The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments jointly establish a School Education Costs Committee to undertake consultation and research with the aim of ascertaining the cost of delivering, at the various stages of schooling and in each of the eight key learning areas, an education which will meet the basic requirements of those Key Learning Areas and the National Goals for Schools; and on the basis of such data and information determine overall resource levels, allocative mecha 
 nisms and the relative funding shares of the various governments.
Response—
As indicated in the minority report, the establishment of such a committee would be a matter for MCEETYA. Commonwealth funding for schools has increased by 88 per cent over the period 1987/88 to 1997/98 (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98) and is guaranteed by legislation to the year 2000. The Government is committed to education reform, better targeting and improved educational outcomes for students, and is determined to achieve real improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy. While the Commonwealth provides funding for specific national objectives, it is a matter for State governments to decide the allocation of resources to individual schools. 2.

Recommendation 3 -
The Committee recommends that each State and Territory establish a committee comprising senior education department officials and nominees of peak parent associations to:
(a)	 monitor the amounts set and paid as voluntary contributions, subject levies and other charges
(b)	 monitor schools' compliance with departmental policy that contributions and levies be voluntary
(c)	 record, receive and act on complaints concerning contributions, levies and other charges.
Response -
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 4 -
The Committee recommends that government schools distribute to each family at the start of each school year a Charter of School Education. This Charter shall set out:
(a)	 the nature and extent of the education that will be provided in government schools at public expense
(b)	 government policy on voluntary contributions, and any subject levies and charges for areas outside the eight Key Learning Areas
(c)	 contact details for the committee appointed to monitor the voluntary contributions and arrangements for subject levies and other charges
(d)	 information on any financial assistance provided at the system level for families in 
 cases of genuine financial hardship to assist with the costs of schooling.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 5 -
The Committee recommends that schools provide a statement to be attached to the Charter of School Education referred to in Recommendation 4. The statement should:
(a)	 make explicit to parents any charges the school sets for the areas outside the Eight Key Learning Areas
(b)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(c)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(d)	 provide information about any assistance provided at the school level for families in cases of genuine hardship.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.3.

Recommendation 6 -
The Committee recommends that all States and Territories develop or modify their student assistance schemes to ensure that;
(a)	 eligibility be linked to the Commonwealth Health Card with provision for other hardship circumstances to be taken into account
(b)	 the purposes of the payment be specified and that payments not be used for anything other than those purposes.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 7 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commission a major national research project on costs to families associated with government schooling and their relative impact on low income families.
Response—
The Government does not support this recommendation. This would be a duplication of some of the work of the Committee. However, the Government is interested in ways of supporting choice in the schools sector and in how parents might be better informed of the choices available. The Government will be supporting research into school choice in the schools sector as the best way to ensure that 
 government schooling meets the needs of all students.
Recommendation 8 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments amend their Education Acts by inserting the word `education' in place of `instruction' or `tuition'.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 9 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government restore the level of funding for targeted equity programmes to 1995/96 level.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation which is based on a false premise. Funding for equity programmes has not decreased and this Government has provided additional funding for literacy and school-to-work as programmes designed to give direct benefits to disadvantaged students. The 1997/98 funding package features $596 million for special programs including $163 million for literacy, $148 million for students with special learning needs and $191 million for indigenous education. There is no evidence in the report which demonstrates areas of unaddressed need.4.

Recommendation 10 - 
The Committee recommends that all Commonwealth, State and Territory governments
(a)	 develop comprehensive guidelines for sponsorship arrangements at both school and state levels
(b)	 ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to monitor schools' compliance with the sponsorship guidelines
(c)	 ensure that sponsorship assistance is used to provide additional opportunities for students beyond those provided through the 8 Key Learning Areas.
Response -
The eight Key Learning Areas were formed as part of the national collaborative curriculum development project under the direction of the former Australian Education Council (AEC). The national collaborative curriculum development project was completed in June 1993. At its meeting in July 1993, the AEC agreed that the publication of the statements and profiles is the prerogative of each State and Territory.
The Commonwealth funded the Curriculum Corporation to develop a range of materials to assist in the implementation of the statements and profiles in the eight key learning areas including Annotated 
 Work Samples  and a package entitled, Introducing statements and profiles . In addition, the Commonwealth provided considerable assistance to the States and Territories for professional development across the eight key learning areas.
The development of sponsorship guidelines is an issue for the States and Territories to consider as they have responsibility for the daily operation of government schools.

Recommendation 11 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments which seek to supplement government funding to schools via sponsorship establish a centrally-managed Education Foundation for the negotiation of sponsorship deals, and for the equitable distribution across all government schools of any benefits which result.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation. An additional level of bureaucracy is not required.

Recommendation 12 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government require the State and Territory Governments to review practices involving the sale or rental of school land with a view to enabling any decisions and any benefits to be state wide.
Response-
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation. The disposal of assets is a matter for State and Territory governments. 5.

Recommendation 13 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments
(a)	 develop as a matter of urgency a statement of national principles regarding computer based information technologies in schools, and
(b)	 determine the funding implications of providing schools with the technological infrastructure, training and support to ensure that those principles are realised.
Response-
Cooperation in technology between Commonwealth and States is already underway through OLTC and  Education Network Australia (EdNa) School Advisory Group. EdNA is a Commonwealth initiative where States and Territories and non-government authorities collaborate on all aspects of information technology across all sectors of education. Its aim is to maximise the benefits of information technology for Australian education and training. The EdNA Schools Advisory Group focuses particularly on collaboration about informa 
 tion technology in schools. It has developed a set of standards for content and management of websites on the EdNA Directory Service. The Government does not intend to dictate the schools funding priorities of State and Territory Governments. The Commonwealth will, however, seek the agreement of State and Territory governments to specific national objectives in schooling as set out in the Federal Government's policies for schools.

Recommendation 14 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government reappraise it Capital Grants program with a view to increasing the level of funding to enable government schools to implement technology to a standard jointly determined by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.
Response-
Funding under the Capital Grants Programme will be considered in the Budgetary context. Capital Grants funding for government schools for each year from 1997 to 2000 will be $211 million per year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Committees,20,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the document.
The government's response to the Senate committee report Not a level playground—The private and commercial funding of government schools  is some nine months overdue. Effectively, they have had just under 12 months to prepare a reply, and they exceeded the normal three-month deadline by some nine months. In that time, they have come up with a startling revelation: that the concerns and the issues raised by the Senate committee on fees and charges being made by schools across this nation are in fact the responsibility of the states. They have attempted to dismiss the concerns of many hundreds of thousands of Australians by buckpassing this issue to the states.
This government tries to present to the Senate, in this most inadequate and totally unresponsive manner, its views which should best be summed up as `referring it to someone else to deal with', to basically pass it off to other people; to suggest that the volume of evidence presented by the Senate committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated; and to maintain the great myth, the great lie that this government seeks to assert, that it is maintain 
 ing its commitment to public education in this country.
The committee report demonstrated, over and over again, the substantial concern of many hundreds of thousands of Australians that the level of support by public education authorities is declining; that in recent years we have seen a devolution of responsibility to schools and, as a consequence, more and more, there is an expectation by governments that it is not governments' responsibility to take care of the legitimate concerns for the educational needs of this country, but that it is for individual parents to meet the funding shortfalls that arise from government policy decisions to reduce government expenditure.
The Liberal's own National Commission of Audit demonstrated that there was a decline in the level of government spending on school education. Expenditure by all levels of government on schools rose by 2.8 per cent of GDP throughout the 1970s; in the 1980s it rose by a slightly greater amount, but it declined under this government. During the period that this government has been in office, public education support has seen a massive reduction.
The government tries to maintain that it is increasing its spending, but the lie was revealed in an answer to a question in the estimates committee. In real terms, in the amounts of money actually being spent, in real dollars that are available for the education of the children of this nation, there has been a substantial decline in public support by the governments of this country. Answer to question No. 52 before the Senate education committee demonstrates in real terms that, in 1995-96, $1.338 billion was spent on government education, by this year the figure had fallen to $1.335 billion and in 1998-99 it will fall to $1.318 billion.
Those figures are quite clear, they are official statistics, yet this government seeks to maintain the lie that it is maintaining its level  of commitment to public education. It seeks to include the additional funds that would normally be applied for inflation or additional students enrolled in the system in the money spent; it does not acknowledge that it is 
 reducing the money spent on public education in real dollar terms.
The Victorian Commission of Audit demonstrated that, in Victoria today, between six and seven per cent of total education revenue is now being raised by parents at a local level; that is, $155 million is coming out of the pockets of parents as a result of so-called voluntary fees and charges. It is not just that people are being expected to put in a bit extra to fund their child's education, the fact remains that not all parents have equal access to money, not all parents have equal access to opportunity. But what you are seeing under this government is a reduction in the level of opportunity, a reduction in the level of real choice being made available to those who seek to use the public education system.
The Victorian Auditor-General demonstrated that 16.9 per cent of non-staff school operating costs was raised as a result of fees and charges being levelled by government schools in Victoria. This is a long way from the claims made in this shonky response that this government has presented to this Senate today, which says that there were `unsubstantiated allegations'—not unsubstantiated to the National Commission of Audit, not unsubstantiated to the Victorian Auditor-General. A number of submissions to the committee demonstrated that the real cost to parents of sending their children to government schools is now in the range of 33 to 70 per cent of the non-staff school operating costs as a result of the government cutbacks in that state. Again and again, you see the parents and teachers highlighting to the public that it is not just a question of people not having the capacity to pay.
Substantial educational issues follow from that. It has been demonstrated again and again that individual children of families who cannot pay these voluntary contributions—these so-called voluntary levies and charges—through various acts of what I would call humiliation, are being embarrassed and their educational opportunities in our schools diminished. Such examples include the withholding of academic reports; the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other functions; the withholding of education 
 al material such as photocopied handouts; the marking of students as absent so that Austudy and Abstudy payments cease; the linking of student enrolment or re-enrolment to the payment of levies; the sending out of accounts for payments of levies; the use of debt collectors on children in this country; the failure to provide school diaries to students; and the removal of various state government support payments—the school card provisions, for instance, in South Australia.
We see the denying of the use of books, the refusing of students access to computers and library; the refusal to allow students whose voluntary contributions have not been paid to attend excursions or camps; the withdrawal of curriculum materials from woodwork, cooking or photography classes and so on.
What the committee demonstrated, again and again, is the use of illicit and, I think, deeply ingrained attempts to humiliate students and force these so-called voluntary payments. The concerns that are raised by the committee go much further than just the question of educational opportunity; they go to some really basic questions about the level of civil rights within the schools in our system.
This is a situation that is becoming more and more intense as a result of the declining levels of financial support by governments for public education in this country and a retreat by governments from what was once accepted as the universal notion of the right of all children to enjoy access to high quality public education.
What you have seen is a rapid growth in the use of levies and charges to make up for the shortfalls in funding that are the result of these government policies. What you are seeing is an increasing use of practices by schools to conceal the so-called voluntary nature of these charges and to engage in what can only be described as bullying and heavy-handed tactics to enforce payment.
What you have here is a Commonwealth government that does not care. It is essentially a Commonwealth government dedicated to the promotion of an elitist view of education—a 
 notion of education that is essentially a 1950s idea—that those who have plenty of money can go to elite schools to enjoy the exclusive conditions of those elite schools and those are the ones who do well in our society. Those who do not have access to large sums of money and do not have access to large sums of disposable cash miss out on educational opportunity.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-26,"—I think the comments of Senator Carr are a disgrace. What he is doing is totally misrepresenting evidence. What he is making out to be hard evidence on this matter in reality is just anecdotal evidence. The committee was enormously frustrated in terms of getting any sort of clear picture of what was happening, purely on the basis of a lack of evidence.
Let us look at what is happening broadly in the school system in this country in relation to funding levels. What we have had over a very long period of time is increasing expectations of parents as to what schools should provide. That is fine; we have no problem with that. The difficulty is with finding enough public money to fund such a proposition. Senator Carr makes out that this is a new problem but it is not a new problem, Senator Carr, as you realise. If you look at the minority report you will see a quote going back to the Schools Commission in the early 1980s. It raised a lot of the problems that you are raising in relation to there not being enough money in public schools. It is quite a reasonable proposition, we feel, that parents of children in these schools contribute something towards their education.
It is quite surprising, however, to find that, far from there being a shortage of public money in education in our public schools, in the case of New South Wales there is an absolutely massive surplus. Let us find out where that is. The Sydney Morning Herald article of 16 April—and as Senator Carr realises, our report was brought down in July last year so we have only the benefit of hindsight with this information; but it makes very interesting reading—lists the funds in reserve that public schools have in the high schools of New South Wales. Senator Carr, it 
 lists all 250 high schools. It has beside it the balances of those high schools.
We find, for example, that Bossley Park High—not exactly in your North Shore area of Sydney—has reserves of over $1 million. We find that Goulburn High School has $620,000. We can go through a number of areas in the western suburbs of Sydney: Blacktown High School has $250,000; Liverpool High has $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has $283,000; Wollongong High, in the steel belt, has $219,000; and Young High School has $432,000.
I found your figure for Victoria interesting, Senator Carr, when you said that parents were asked to chip in $155 million. I do not see any great problem with that: if you divide it by the number of school pupils it is not a huge amount of money. In comparison, in New South Wales, if you look at the total of what I have been talking about—and remember your Victorian figure was $155 million—reserves in New South Wales high schools are $285 million. That is just in the high schools, not primary schools—and that money is sitting there at the moment. It is a matter of great concern to the department's general manager of finance, Ken Dixon. He says that funds allocated to schools are to be expended in general in the year of allocation.
Senator Carr, you really have to answer this question: if there is such a shortage of funding in public schools, how come they can build up a quarter of a billion dollars in reserves in the state of New South Wales? It is good housekeeping, I am sure, but it does not really paint the poor picture that you are trying to put up.
The report that was brought down had dissent from the government senators. What we discovered, in listening to the evidence around the country, was that the extra funding of private money in public schools was not significant and that it came in two parts: sponsorships and fees and charges. We found  that in fees and charges these levels were not high and in many states, and in a vast number of schools, there was the opportunity for people who could not pay to make other 
 arrangements. Many of the schemes were voluntary in any case. In the case of sponsorships of schools we found that this was an opportunity for many schools—schools always have limited resources; they always have had and always will—to get extra funding from particular organisations.
We find totally unacceptable the recommendation of the opposition members of the committee that that sort of funding should be used outside the eight key learning areas only. Obviously schools should have the flexibility to use such funding across a much broader area. The idea of central sponsorships with big companies sponsoring events and the resulting funds spread across schools is attractive to us. But we were not drawn to the suggestion of opposition senators that this should be a centrally managed pool of funds.
The broad implications of what was presented in the report of the opposition members are basically unrealistic on a number of accounts. They are not based on any hard evidence. We really did not see any evidence, apart from a bit of anecdotal evidence—and systems will go wrong in particular places, obviously—that this is widespread across the system. We did not see any evidence that fees are an onerous burden on people. We did see evidence that there are mechanisms in place in most states to do something about that. We did not see evidence that sponsorships are causing that great a problem.
In summary, the situation in our schools is that there is quite a reasonable level of funding from the public sector. This is demonstrated by the fact that in New South Wales a quarter of a billion dollars of public money has been salted away. The level of fees is not too high. I think most people would agree that it is reasonable for parents who have children at school to contribute something towards their education. This is not a new idea, Senator Carr. Parents have put in contributions over the whole century.
The idea that absolutely everything should be free—that hospitals should be free, schools should be free and universities should be free—is very much a Whitlamesque type view. I thought we had left that behind in the seventies. We saw the economic disasters 
 when a government overspending approach applied. There is a feeling in the community that in all these areas the public should contribute, and that in particular the people who use these particular services should make some small contribution.
We found on the evidence that we have—as I have indicated, it is mostly anecdotal—that there is not a high level of this sort of funding in schools. It is not creating a significant problem. In his description today Senator Carr totally misrepresented what was found in the set of hearings. The evidence really is just anecdotal, but he is trying to make out that it is some sort of scientific evidence. We certainly do not have that. This is not a major problem.
The responsibility for dealing with the matters raised by the committee rests almost entirely with the states. In the response by the minister to this report he has put most of these matters back in their rightful place. They are things that should be considered by the states through the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Committees,20,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I rise to make some comments about the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground: private and commercial funding of government schools . There is a huge amount to be said about this, but first of all I have to say that at last we have one government response to one of the reports of this committee.
—Your record wasn't so good!
—Senator, what matters is that we wrote a report on early childhood education which was tabled in July 1996. There is still no word from the government. Senator Tierney has a commitment to adult education. This committee did a report on this matter, but we still have not had a response. I would have thought that Senator  Tierney would have been pleased to hear from the government.
There is a parliamentary convention in this place that governments provide a response within about three months of a report being tabled or at least provide an explanation as to why they cannot conform with that convention. Thousands of people have bothered to prepare submissions, attend as witnesses and put their efforts into making these reports  decent and fair representations of the issues that are out there. I think they are very disappointed and jaded when governments are so disregarding of their contributions. I am therefore pleased that we have a response—albeit way too late.
—It took Ros Kelly 18 months to respond!
—You are actually doing very well, Senator. You are over two years late in providing a response to one of the reports of this committee. I have never found it a persuasive argument to say that, just because you are wrong, it is all right to say, `You're wrong because we were wrong too.' Two wrongs do not correct the fault in your case. If I were you, I would urge your government to respond. This is one of those things that convinces people that we are serious about what we do in this place.
The government in its response starts off by saying:
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The response is therefore very disappointing. As I heard my colleague Senator Carr say, the response by the federal government to most of the recommendations is, `That is a state and territory matter. We'll have nothing to do with it.' That is not what the community cares for. The community knows that the Commonwealth has a federal education minister who has an overarching responsibility for education services from schools to tertiary institutions in this country. The government has suggested that the minister's interest is of no relevance and that really it should be left to MCEETYA, which is no more than a council 
 of Commonwealth and state officials. It is not a council that actually responds to ministerial guidelines or directly implements policy. It does the work that allows the implementation of policy, but it is not the committee that should be given responsibility for the running of these things.
It is cavalier of the Commonwealth government to dismiss its own responsibility—and, I might say, to dismiss it in a contradictory fashion, because with some of the recommendations the government is saying, `It is a state and territory matter, and we have no responsibility,' but in other areas it is saying, `The Commonwealth and the states do work together on this.' What we know, and what everybody said in the committee, is that private funding is necessary for our public schools because government funding for public schools is no longer sufficient for the very many demands on those schools.
It may well be that the money has increased, but the demands on the schools have increased far more, and therefore there is an ever increasing gap between the funding provided to our public schools—charged, I might say, under state education acts to provide a free secular education. That retreat from `free' is causing major concern, and the committee picked up on this concern, because what it says is that in some areas of our community, particularly in what are short-handedly known as the Eastern Suburbs, schools are able to set fees and charges for parents using that school and that, in large part, those parents are able to meet those fees, but that, in many other areas of our country, people simply cannot find the wherewithal to pay those fees and charges.
Families creep around, embarrassed and afraid for it to be found out that they are not able to afford those fees and charges. There even are specific arrangements to assist families in hardship to get some extra funding from the schools but, once again, a lot of parents are mortified that they should have to register for this kind of assistance. We have actually made a lot of recommendations in the report about doing it so that the privacy and  decency of families are respected. We have state and territory governments and a 
 Commonwealth government which are all committed to providing education for all Australians but which are not, according to this response, committed to funding it. That is grossly insufficient.
Secondly, we also have that major point that I have just been alluding to, that the need for private funding has led to a gross inequity in the amount of funding going to schools. As I said, schools in the better-off areas are able to set fees and charges and get that extra assistance; schools in those same areas can also much more readily afford the new technology—computers and so on. They are more likely to have parents who can assist the teachers and the schools with getting sponsorship arrangements that also bring more wealth to those schools, while the schools in the so-called Western Suburbs, the tougher areas in our major states and regions, get further and further behind.
The number of schools that have access to computers in this country makes a very interesting little map, but certainly many of the schools in the western suburbs and in regional and rural Australia, isolated areas, do not have the same access. If time and time again we hear of the need for access to technology so that our children will at least be able to get the new jobs that require that technology and that kind of training and capacity, then what we are doing is simply writing a formula now for all those children to be further behind the eight ball when they leave their schools.
This is a report that I thought the government might take much more seriously, because it is a thoughtful and considered report and because, as I say, the committee had very many submissions from many people who were very concerned that the cost of education was pricing education out of affordability for many families. Many families told us, for example, that they had to choose between funding their children for special classes or funding their children for trips and tours. Many families could not afford both, and so their children were being dudded out of some of those visits and trips that the school curriculum decides are important. They also have to deal with the fact that their children are 
 very isolated, alienated, if they are not able to participate with all their school chums.
I find it an interesting thing too that the government seems to be rejecting any recommendation for decent research, for example, about hard data on the actual cost of education. What does it cost to educate a grade 4 pupil in Australia? We do not know. The government accuses us in this response to the report of saying that the evidence was anecdotal and unsubstantiated in many cases. We say that is exactly the case because we have not got the hard data and research, and we recommended that there be such hard data and research—in other words, that the Commonwealth fund that kind of investigation so that we could say in future what it does cost to educate a grade 4, grade 6 or grade 10 pupil, and then we would have a much better idea of what the level of state and Commonwealth assistance ought to be.
It is interesting that Senator Tierney was so dismissive of this report: `It is anecdotal; we are not going to worry; it is all made up, and parents out there in the community are not complaining about education.' I do not know where Senator Tierney has been, but the parents that I know are complaining. They are very concerned about the cost of education and they are very concerned that they will not be able to get the best for their children. That is what so many parents actually put their effort into. They will work at second and third jobs; both parents will work, and the highest priority for so many of those parents is to make sure their children get a good education. When people can no longer afford a so-called free secular education, it is time for governments very seriously to have a long hard look at this.
I find it very disappointing that a Commonwealth government education minister should put out a report that says, `It is not my responsibility.' In the past we have seen education ministers from the states brawling with the Commonwealth minister for education. It has had a very bad effect on the status of teachers, it has had a very bad effect on morale and it has had a very bad effect in  terms of sufficient funding for our schools. The state education ministers know that the 
 Commonwealth's involvement in education is particularly to make sure that they do have adequate funding distributed with equity, and that they get support, so that particularly our children from disadvantaged areas who are doing it tough do get that kind of consideration from the Commonwealth. The government response is a very big disappointment, and parents and families of Australia will judge the government very sternly because of it.

The document read as follows—
`NOT A LEVEL PLAYGROUND—THE PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL FUNDING OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The appropriate mechanism for referring issues such as voluntary contributions to the States and Territories is the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). The areas of responsibility covered by the Council include primary and secondary education and it is supported by a number of taskforces which are convened as needed for particular tasks, have prescribed timeframes and reporting arrangements and are reviewed annually. Functions of the Council include coordination of strategic policy at the national level and negotiation and development of national agreements on shared objectives and interests in the Council's areas of responsibility. MCEETYA is therefore the appropriate forum for consideration of the majority of the report's recommendations. The Government considers that the relevant course of action for Parents and Citizens Associations to follow is to pursue these matters further with the relevant State and Territory governments.
The Government agrees with statements made in the minority Report that it appears much of the evidence raised by the Committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated. 

The Committee's claim that there has been a decline in government commitment to education is not borne out by funding figures. Commonwealth funding to schools, for example, has risen by 88 per cent from 1987/88 to 1997/98. (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98).
SENATE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation 1 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments, develop and adopt consistent terminology to describe the various contributions invited, and charges imposed by schools.
Response:
This would be a matter for State and Territory governments to agree. The Government will refer this recommendation to State and Territory governments for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA.

Recommendation 2(a) —
The Committee recommends that governments fund public schools at a level sufficient to deliver the appropriate standard of education within the Eight Key Learning Areas and commensurate with the National Goals of Schooling.
Response-
The Government agrees with this recommendation. In March 1997, MCEETYA reaffirmed its commitment to national collaboration and consultations in the pursuit of national goals for schooling. It also agreed to examine the Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling in Australia to ensure they reflect current and future educational developments. At the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, it was agreed that a small group representing the Commonwealth, all States and Territories and the non-government sector should be established to prepare a draft revision of the National Goals for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA. Work is continuing.

Recommendation 2 (b)  (c)
The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments jointly establish a School Education Costs Committee to undertake consultation and research with the aim of ascertaining the cost of delivering, at the various stages of schooling and in each of the eight key learning areas, an education which will meet the basic requirements of those Key Learning Areas and the National Goals for Schools; and on the basis of such data and information determine overall resource levels, allocative mecha 
 nisms and the relative funding shares of the various governments.
Response—
As indicated in the minority report, the establishment of such a committee would be a matter for MCEETYA. Commonwealth funding for schools has increased by 88 per cent over the period 1987/88 to 1997/98 (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98) and is guaranteed by legislation to the year 2000. The Government is committed to education reform, better targeting and improved educational outcomes for students, and is determined to achieve real improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy. While the Commonwealth provides funding for specific national objectives, it is a matter for State governments to decide the allocation of resources to individual schools. 2.

Recommendation 3 -
The Committee recommends that each State and Territory establish a committee comprising senior education department officials and nominees of peak parent associations to:
(a)	 monitor the amounts set and paid as voluntary contributions, subject levies and other charges
(b)	 monitor schools' compliance with departmental policy that contributions and levies be voluntary
(c)	 record, receive and act on complaints concerning contributions, levies and other charges.
Response -
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 4 -
The Committee recommends that government schools distribute to each family at the start of each school year a Charter of School Education. This Charter shall set out:
(a)	 the nature and extent of the education that will be provided in government schools at public expense
(b)	 government policy on voluntary contributions, and any subject levies and charges for areas outside the eight Key Learning Areas
(c)	 contact details for the committee appointed to monitor the voluntary contributions and arrangements for subject levies and other charges
(d)	 information on any financial assistance provided at the system level for families in 
 cases of genuine financial hardship to assist with the costs of schooling.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 5 -
The Committee recommends that schools provide a statement to be attached to the Charter of School Education referred to in Recommendation 4. The statement should:
(a)	 make explicit to parents any charges the school sets for the areas outside the Eight Key Learning Areas
(b)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(c)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(d)	 provide information about any assistance provided at the school level for families in cases of genuine hardship.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.3.

Recommendation 6 -
The Committee recommends that all States and Territories develop or modify their student assistance schemes to ensure that;
(a)	 eligibility be linked to the Commonwealth Health Card with provision for other hardship circumstances to be taken into account
(b)	 the purposes of the payment be specified and that payments not be used for anything other than those purposes.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 7 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commission a major national research project on costs to families associated with government schooling and their relative impact on low income families.
Response—
The Government does not support this recommendation. This would be a duplication of some of the work of the Committee. However, the Government is interested in ways of supporting choice in the schools sector and in how parents might be better informed of the choices available. The Government will be supporting research into school choice in the schools sector as the best way to ensure that 
 government schooling meets the needs of all students.
Recommendation 8 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments amend their Education Acts by inserting the word `education' in place of `instruction' or `tuition'.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 9 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government restore the level of funding for targeted equity programmes to 1995/96 level.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation which is based on a false premise. Funding for equity programmes has not decreased and this Government has provided additional funding for literacy and school-to-work as programmes designed to give direct benefits to disadvantaged students. The 1997/98 funding package features $596 million for special programs including $163 million for literacy, $148 million for students with special learning needs and $191 million for indigenous education. There is no evidence in the report which demonstrates areas of unaddressed need.4.

Recommendation 10 - 
The Committee recommends that all Commonwealth, State and Territory governments
(a)	 develop comprehensive guidelines for sponsorship arrangements at both school and state levels
(b)	 ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to monitor schools' compliance with the sponsorship guidelines
(c)	 ensure that sponsorship assistance is used to provide additional opportunities for students beyond those provided through the 8 Key Learning Areas.
Response -
The eight Key Learning Areas were formed as part of the national collaborative curriculum development project under the direction of the former Australian Education Council (AEC). The national collaborative curriculum development project was completed in June 1993. At its meeting in July 1993, the AEC agreed that the publication of the statements and profiles is the prerogative of each State and Territory.
The Commonwealth funded the Curriculum Corporation to develop a range of materials to assist in the implementation of the statements and profiles in the eight key learning areas including Annotated 
 Work Samples  and a package entitled, Introducing statements and profiles . In addition, the Commonwealth provided considerable assistance to the States and Territories for professional development across the eight key learning areas.
The development of sponsorship guidelines is an issue for the States and Territories to consider as they have responsibility for the daily operation of government schools.

Recommendation 11 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments which seek to supplement government funding to schools via sponsorship establish a centrally-managed Education Foundation for the negotiation of sponsorship deals, and for the equitable distribution across all government schools of any benefits which result.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation. An additional level of bureaucracy is not required.

Recommendation 12 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government require the State and Territory Governments to review practices involving the sale or rental of school land with a view to enabling any decisions and any benefits to be state wide.
Response-
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation. The disposal of assets is a matter for State and Territory governments. 5.

Recommendation 13 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments
(a)	 develop as a matter of urgency a statement of national principles regarding computer based information technologies in schools, and
(b)	 determine the funding implications of providing schools with the technological infrastructure, training and support to ensure that those principles are realised.
Response-
Cooperation in technology between Commonwealth and States is already underway through OLTC and  Education Network Australia (EdNa) School Advisory Group. EdNA is a Commonwealth initiative where States and Territories and non-government authorities collaborate on all aspects of information technology across all sectors of education. Its aim is to maximise the benefits of information technology for Australian education and training. The EdNA Schools Advisory Group focuses particularly on collaboration about informa 
 tion technology in schools. It has developed a set of standards for content and management of websites on the EdNA Directory Service. The Government does not intend to dictate the schools funding priorities of State and Territory Governments. The Commonwealth will, however, seek the agreement of State and Territory governments to specific national objectives in schooling as set out in the Federal Government's policies for schools.

Recommendation 14 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government reappraise it Capital Grants program with a view to increasing the level of funding to enable government schools to implement technology to a standard jointly determined by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.
Response-
Funding under the Capital Grants Programme will be considered in the Budgetary context. Capital Grants funding for government schools for each year from 1997 to 2000 will be $211 million per year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,20,2,speech

That the Senate take note of the document.
The government's response to the Senate committee report Not a level playground—The private and commercial funding of government schools  is some nine months overdue. Effectively, they have had just under 12 months to prepare a reply, and they exceeded the normal three-month deadline by some nine months. In that time, they have come up with a startling revelation: that the concerns and the issues raised by the Senate committee on fees and charges being made by schools across this nation are in fact the responsibility of the states. They have attempted to dismiss the concerns of many hundreds of thousands of Australians by buckpassing this issue to the states.
This government tries to present to the Senate, in this most inadequate and totally unresponsive manner, its views which should best be summed up as `referring it to someone else to deal with', to basically pass it off to other people; to suggest that the volume of evidence presented by the Senate committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated; and to maintain the great myth, the great lie that this government seeks to assert, that it is maintain 
 ing its commitment to public education in this country.
The committee report demonstrated, over and over again, the substantial concern of many hundreds of thousands of Australians that the level of support by public education authorities is declining; that in recent years we have seen a devolution of responsibility to schools and, as a consequence, more and more, there is an expectation by governments that it is not governments' responsibility to take care of the legitimate concerns for the educational needs of this country, but that it is for individual parents to meet the funding shortfalls that arise from government policy decisions to reduce government expenditure.
The Liberal's own National Commission of Audit demonstrated that there was a decline in the level of government spending on school education. Expenditure by all levels of government on schools rose by 2.8 per cent of GDP throughout the 1970s; in the 1980s it rose by a slightly greater amount, but it declined under this government. During the period that this government has been in office, public education support has seen a massive reduction.
The government tries to maintain that it is increasing its spending, but the lie was revealed in an answer to a question in the estimates committee. In real terms, in the amounts of money actually being spent, in real dollars that are available for the education of the children of this nation, there has been a substantial decline in public support by the governments of this country. Answer to question No. 52 before the Senate education committee demonstrates in real terms that, in 1995-96, $1.338 billion was spent on government education, by this year the figure had fallen to $1.335 billion and in 1998-99 it will fall to $1.318 billion.
Those figures are quite clear, they are official statistics, yet this government seeks to maintain the lie that it is maintaining its level  of commitment to public education. It seeks to include the additional funds that would normally be applied for inflation or additional students enrolled in the system in the money spent; it does not acknowledge that it is 
 reducing the money spent on public education in real dollar terms.
The Victorian Commission of Audit demonstrated that, in Victoria today, between six and seven per cent of total education revenue is now being raised by parents at a local level; that is, $155 million is coming out of the pockets of parents as a result of so-called voluntary fees and charges. It is not just that people are being expected to put in a bit extra to fund their child's education, the fact remains that not all parents have equal access to money, not all parents have equal access to opportunity. But what you are seeing under this government is a reduction in the level of opportunity, a reduction in the level of real choice being made available to those who seek to use the public education system.
The Victorian Auditor-General demonstrated that 16.9 per cent of non-staff school operating costs was raised as a result of fees and charges being levelled by government schools in Victoria. This is a long way from the claims made in this shonky response that this government has presented to this Senate today, which says that there were `unsubstantiated allegations'—not unsubstantiated to the National Commission of Audit, not unsubstantiated to the Victorian Auditor-General. A number of submissions to the committee demonstrated that the real cost to parents of sending their children to government schools is now in the range of 33 to 70 per cent of the non-staff school operating costs as a result of the government cutbacks in that state. Again and again, you see the parents and teachers highlighting to the public that it is not just a question of people not having the capacity to pay.
Substantial educational issues follow from that. It has been demonstrated again and again that individual children of families who cannot pay these voluntary contributions—these so-called voluntary levies and charges—through various acts of what I would call humiliation, are being embarrassed and their educational opportunities in our schools diminished. Such examples include the withholding of academic reports; the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other functions; the withholding of education 
 al material such as photocopied handouts; the marking of students as absent so that Austudy and Abstudy payments cease; the linking of student enrolment or re-enrolment to the payment of levies; the sending out of accounts for payments of levies; the use of debt collectors on children in this country; the failure to provide school diaries to students; and the removal of various state government support payments—the school card provisions, for instance, in South Australia.
We see the denying of the use of books, the refusing of students access to computers and library; the refusal to allow students whose voluntary contributions have not been paid to attend excursions or camps; the withdrawal of curriculum materials from woodwork, cooking or photography classes and so on.
What the committee demonstrated, again and again, is the use of illicit and, I think, deeply ingrained attempts to humiliate students and force these so-called voluntary payments. The concerns that are raised by the committee go much further than just the question of educational opportunity; they go to some really basic questions about the level of civil rights within the schools in our system.
This is a situation that is becoming more and more intense as a result of the declining levels of financial support by governments for public education in this country and a retreat by governments from what was once accepted as the universal notion of the right of all children to enjoy access to high quality public education.
What you have seen is a rapid growth in the use of levies and charges to make up for the shortfalls in funding that are the result of these government policies. What you are seeing is an increasing use of practices by schools to conceal the so-called voluntary nature of these charges and to engage in what can only be described as bullying and heavy-handed tactics to enforce payment.
What you have here is a Commonwealth government that does not care. It is essentially a Commonwealth government dedicated to the promotion of an elitist view of education—a 
 notion of education that is essentially a 1950s idea—that those who have plenty of money can go to elite schools to enjoy the exclusive conditions of those elite schools and those are the ones who do well in our society. Those who do not have access to large sums of money and do not have access to large sums of disposable cash miss out on educational opportunity. This report is a disgrace.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,20,2,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-26,"—I think the comments of Senator Carr are a disgrace. What he is doing is totally misrepresenting evidence. What he is making out to be hard evidence on this matter in reality is just anecdotal evidence. The committee was enormously frustrated in terms of getting any sort of clear picture of what was happening, purely on the basis of a lack of evidence.
Let us look at what is happening broadly in the school system in this country in relation to funding levels. What we have had over a very long period of time is increasing expectations of parents as to what schools should provide. That is fine; we have no problem with that. The difficulty is with finding enough public money to fund such a proposition. Senator Carr makes out that this is a new problem but it is not a new problem, Senator Carr, as you realise. If you look at the minority report you will see a quote going back to the Schools Commission in the early 1980s. It raised a lot of the problems that you are raising in relation to there not being enough money in public schools. It is quite a reasonable proposition, we feel, that parents of children in these schools contribute something towards their education.
It is quite surprising, however, to find that, far from there being a shortage of public money in education in our public schools, in the case of New South Wales there is an absolutely massive surplus. Let us find out where that is. The Sydney Morning Herald article of 16 April—and as Senator Carr realises, our report was brought down in July last year so we have only the benefit of hindsight with this information; but it makes very interesting reading—lists the funds in reserve that public schools have in the high schools of New South Wales. Senator Carr, it 
 lists all 250 high schools. It has beside it the balances of those high schools.
We find, for example, that Bossley Park High—not exactly in your North Shore area of Sydney—has reserves of over $1 million. We find that Goulburn High School has $620,000. We can go through a number of areas in the western suburbs of Sydney: Blacktown High School has $250,000; Liverpool High has $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has $283,000; Wollongong High, in the steel belt, has $219,000; and Young High School has $432,000.
I found your figure for Victoria interesting, Senator Carr, when you said that parents were asked to chip in $155 million. I do not see any great problem with that: if you divide it by the number of school pupils it is not a huge amount of money. In comparison, in New South Wales, if you look at the total of what I have been talking about—and remember your Victorian figure was $155 million—reserves in New South Wales high schools are $285 million. That is just in the high schools, not primary schools—and that money is sitting there at the moment. It is a matter of great concern to the department's general manager of finance, Ken Dixon. He says that funds allocated to schools are to be expended in general in the year of allocation.
Senator Carr, you really have to answer this question: if there is such a shortage of funding in public schools, how come they can build up a quarter of a billion dollars in reserves in the state of New South Wales? It is good housekeeping, I am sure, but it does not really paint the poor picture that you are trying to put up.
The report that was brought down had dissent from the government senators. What we discovered, in listening to the evidence around the country, was that the extra funding of private money in public schools was not significant and that it came in two parts: sponsorships and fees and charges. We found  that in fees and charges these levels were not high and in many states, and in a vast number of schools, there was the opportunity for people who could not pay to make other 
 arrangements. Many of the schemes were voluntary in any case. In the case of sponsorships of schools we found that this was an opportunity for many schools—schools always have limited resources; they always have had and always will—to get extra funding from particular organisations.
We find totally unacceptable the recommendation of the opposition members of the committee that that sort of funding should be used outside the eight key learning areas only. Obviously schools should have the flexibility to use such funding across a much broader area. The idea of central sponsorships with big companies sponsoring events and the resulting funds spread across schools is attractive to us. But we were not drawn to the suggestion of opposition senators that this should be a centrally managed pool of funds.
The broad implications of what was presented in the report of the opposition members are basically unrealistic on a number of accounts. They are not based on any hard evidence. We really did not see any evidence, apart from a bit of anecdotal evidence—and systems will go wrong in particular places, obviously—that this is widespread across the system. We did not see any evidence that fees are an onerous burden on people. We did see evidence that there are mechanisms in place in most states to do something about that. We did not see evidence that sponsorships are causing that great a problem.
In summary, the situation in our schools is that there is quite a reasonable level of funding from the public sector. This is demonstrated by the fact that in New South Wales a quarter of a billion dollars of public money has been salted away. The level of fees is not too high. I think most people would agree that it is reasonable for parents who have children at school to contribute something towards their education. This is not a new idea, Senator Carr. Parents have put in contributions over the whole century.
The idea that absolutely everything should be free—that hospitals should be free, schools should be free and universities should be free—is very much a Whitlamesque type view. I thought we had left that behind in the seventies. We saw the economic disasters 
 when a government overspending approach applied. There is a feeling in the community that in all these areas the public should contribute, and that in particular the people who use these particular services should make some small contribution.
We found on the evidence that we have—as I have indicated, it is mostly anecdotal—that there is not a high level of this sort of funding in schools. It is not creating a significant problem. In his description today Senator Carr totally misrepresented what was found in the set of hearings. The evidence really is just anecdotal, but he is trying to make out that it is some sort of scientific evidence. We certainly do not have that. This is not a major problem.
The responsibility for dealing with the matters raised by the committee rests almost entirely with the states. In the response by the minister to this report he has put most of these matters back in their rightful place. They are things that should be considered by the states through the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,20,2,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I rise to make some comments about the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground: private and commercial funding of government schools . There is a huge amount to be said about this, but first of all I have to say that at last we have one government response to one of the reports of this committee.
—Your record wasn't so good!
—Senator, what matters is that we wrote a report on early childhood education which was tabled in July 1996. There is still no word from the government. Senator Tierney has a commitment to adult education. This committee did a report on this matter, but we still have not had a response. I would have thought that Senator  Tierney would have been pleased to hear from the government.
There is a parliamentary convention in this place that governments provide a response within about three months of a report being tabled or at least provide an explanation as to why they cannot conform with that convention. Thousands of people have bothered to prepare submissions, attend as witnesses and put their efforts into making these reports  decent and fair representations of the issues that are out there. I think they are very disappointed and jaded when governments are so disregarding of their contributions. I am therefore pleased that we have a response—albeit way too late.
—It took Ros Kelly 18 months to respond!
—You are actually doing very well, Senator. You are over two years late in providing a response to one of the reports of this committee. I have never found it a persuasive argument to say that, just because you are wrong, it is all right to say, `You're wrong because we were wrong too.' Two wrongs do not correct the fault in your case. If I were you, I would urge your government to respond. This is one of those things that convinces people that we are serious about what we do in this place.
The government in its response starts off by saying:
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The response is therefore very disappointing. As I heard my colleague Senator Carr say, the response by the federal government to most of the recommendations is, `That is a state and territory matter. We'll have nothing to do with it.' That is not what the community cares for. The community knows that the Commonwealth has a federal education minister who has an overarching responsibility for education services from schools to tertiary institutions in this country. The government has suggested that the minister's interest is of no relevance and that really it should be left to MCEETYA, which is no more than a council 
 of Commonwealth and state officials. It is not a council that actually responds to ministerial guidelines or directly implements policy. It does the work that allows the implementation of policy, but it is not the committee that should be given responsibility for the running of these things.
It is cavalier of the Commonwealth government to dismiss its own responsibility—and, I might say, to dismiss it in a contradictory fashion, because with some of the recommendations the government is saying, `It is a state and territory matter, and we have no responsibility,' but in other areas it is saying, `The Commonwealth and the states do work together on this.' What we know, and what everybody said in the committee, is that private funding is necessary for our public schools because government funding for public schools is no longer sufficient for the very many demands on those schools.
It may well be that the money has increased, but the demands on the schools have increased far more, and therefore there is an ever increasing gap between the funding provided to our public schools—charged, I might say, under state education acts to provide a free secular education. That retreat from `free' is causing major concern, and the committee picked up on this concern, because what it says is that in some areas of our community, particularly in what are short-handedly known as the Eastern Suburbs, schools are able to set fees and charges for parents using that school and that, in large part, those parents are able to meet those fees, but that, in many other areas of our country, people simply cannot find the wherewithal to pay those fees and charges.
Families creep around, embarrassed and afraid for it to be found out that they are not able to afford those fees and charges. There even are specific arrangements to assist families in hardship to get some extra funding from the schools but, once again, a lot of parents are mortified that they should have to register for this kind of assistance. We have actually made a lot of recommendations in the report about doing it so that the privacy and  decency of families are respected. We have state and territory governments and a 
 Commonwealth government which are all committed to providing education for all Australians but which are not, according to this response, committed to funding it. That is grossly insufficient.
Secondly, we also have that major point that I have just been alluding to, that the need for private funding has led to a gross inequity in the amount of funding going to schools. As I said, schools in the better-off areas are able to set fees and charges and get that extra assistance; schools in those same areas can also much more readily afford the new technology—computers and so on. They are more likely to have parents who can assist the teachers and the schools with getting sponsorship arrangements that also bring more wealth to those schools, while the schools in the so-called Western Suburbs, the tougher areas in our major states and regions, get further and further behind.
The number of schools that have access to computers in this country makes a very interesting little map, but certainly many of the schools in the western suburbs and in regional and rural Australia, isolated areas, do not have the same access. If time and time again we hear of the need for access to technology so that our children will at least be able to get the new jobs that require that technology and that kind of training and capacity, then what we are doing is simply writing a formula now for all those children to be further behind the eight ball when they leave their schools.
This is a report that I thought the government might take much more seriously, because it is a thoughtful and considered report and because, as I say, the committee had very many submissions from many people who were very concerned that the cost of education was pricing education out of affordability for many families. Many families told us, for example, that they had to choose between funding their children for special classes or funding their children for trips and tours. Many families could not afford both, and so their children were being dudded out of some of those visits and trips that the school curriculum decides are important. They also have to deal with the fact that their children are 
 very isolated, alienated, if they are not able to participate with all their school chums.
I find it an interesting thing too that the government seems to be rejecting any recommendation for decent research, for example, about hard data on the actual cost of education. What does it cost to educate a grade 4 pupil in Australia? We do not know. The government accuses us in this response to the report of saying that the evidence was anecdotal and unsubstantiated in many cases. We say that is exactly the case because we have not got the hard data and research, and we recommended that there be such hard data and research—in other words, that the Commonwealth fund that kind of investigation so that we could say in future what it does cost to educate a grade 4, grade 6 or grade 10 pupil, and then we would have a much better idea of what the level of state and Commonwealth assistance ought to be.
It is interesting that Senator Tierney was so dismissive of this report: `It is anecdotal; we are not going to worry; it is all made up, and parents out there in the community are not complaining about education.' I do not know where Senator Tierney has been, but the parents that I know are complaining. They are very concerned about the cost of education and they are very concerned that they will not be able to get the best for their children. That is what so many parents actually put their effort into. They will work at second and third jobs; both parents will work, and the highest priority for so many of those parents is to make sure their children get a good education. When people can no longer afford a so-called free secular education, it is time for governments very seriously to have a long hard look at this.
I find it very disappointing that a Commonwealth government education minister should put out a report that says, `It is not my responsibility.' In the past we have seen education ministers from the states brawling with the Commonwealth minister for education. It has had a very bad effect on the status of teachers, it has had a very bad effect on morale and it has had a very bad effect in  terms of sufficient funding for our schools. The state education ministers know that the 
 Commonwealth's involvement in education is particularly to make sure that they do have adequate funding distributed with equity, and that they get support, so that particularly our children from disadvantaged areas who are doing it tough do get that kind of consideration from the Commonwealth. The government response is a very big disappointment, and parents and families of Australia will judge the government very sternly because of it.

The statement read as follows—
On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I table the Report on the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 1998-99, in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Auditor General Act 1997.
The tabling of this report is an historic occasion for the Committee which has a unique role in oversighting the process of budgetary appropriation for the Australian National Audit Office. This measure is in itself a significant guarantee of the independence of the Auditor-General from Executive Government.
In its Report No. 346, Guarding the Independence of the Auditor-General , tabled in October 1996, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that it be given a statutory power to consider and report on draft budget estimates of the Audit Office as part of the then Auditor-General Bill. The Committee argued that the proper resourcing of the Auditor-General and the ANAO was:
'integral to the functional independence of the Auditor-General'. It also argued that it was the `role of Parliament and not the Executive to take responsibility for ensuring that audit functions are adequately resourced'.
Although under Section 56 of the Constitution it is indisputable that the Office
of the Auditor-General cannot be legally or financially independent from the Executive in any absolute sense, it has been possible to insulate the Auditor General's financing from Executive influence to ensure that the audit office cannot be starved of funds.
A process has been put in place whereby the draft budget estimates are considered by the JCPAA before the budget is handed down, and the Committee's report provided to the Minister for Finance to be tabled as soon as practicable after the budget. This process allows the resourcing of audit functions to be made transparent to the Parliament so that the Executive is held to account for the 
 level of resources appropriated to allow the Auditor-General to fulfil the statutory functions of his office.
With respect to the budget estimates for the 1998-99 financial year, the Committee accepts that the budget appropriation figure of $53.703m (as finally adjusted), is sufficient for the ANAO to carry out its functions.
The Committee acknowledges the response of the Minister for Finance who commented on the co-operative manner in which this unprecedented process of Parliamentary scrutiny was implemented by the JCPAA and the Australian National Audit Office.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—In the light of the debates we had in this chamber last night and discussions we have had today, I rise to make a statement about schedule 5 of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998  dealing with the choice of fund proposal.
Under the current superannuation rules, many employees have no choice about which superannuation fund is entrusted to invest employer superannuation contributions made on their behalf. This applies to many award employees and to non-award employees. It intrigued me in the debate which we had last night—which was not much of a debate, I have to say; it struck me as more of a filibuster—
—I have another hour.
—You have an hour, have you? That is exactly what I thought, Senator. It was interesting that it came through in that debate that somehow we can allow employees choices about whole aspects of their lives—their jobs, whether they get married, whether they have children; all those important things—but we dare not, apparently, according to some of the speakers, allow employees to make choices about their superannuation. The decision as to which fund invests their money seems at present to almost be a random accident of who happens to be their employer. Employees who want to entrust contributions to another fund cannot do so. We believe that this is undemocratic, uncompetitive, unfair and unAustralian. The government's bill brings in our view greater democracy, fairness and competition to Australia's superannuation industry.
The Australian Labor Party and the Democrats have put forward detailed alternatives to choice. These alternatives are unacceptable to the government. There are a number of reasons why they are unacceptable but one is paramount—neither the Democrats nor Labor guarantee employees any choice of a superannuation fund at all. The government believes employees should have the right to choose their superannuation fund, just like they have the right to choose their home loan, the sort of car they buy or what political party they vote for. We give employees all these rights, but I have always said that when it is a choice between trade union interests and worker rights it is always easy to see where the Labor Party will come down.
The government cannot accept choice of fund legislation that does not provide employees with a right to choose. Of course, the gov 
 ernment believes that it is important that employees are able to make informed choices and that is why we have worked hard to develop, in consultation with industry and consumer groups, a comprehensive disclosure regime and effective information campaign.
Sadly, our repeated offers of briefings and consultations with other parties have not been taken up. I regret that. However, I do congratulate the Greens, the Australian Consumer Association and others who have taken up the offer we have made. We would hope that the ALP and the Democrats will be able to accept the principle of allowing employees to choose once they—
—They already do.
—No they do not. We hope that on reflection they will show more confidence in employees—people whom, from time to time, they like to say they are representing.
The government remains committed to introducing legislation that provides employees with real choice of fund and to providing a disclosure and information campaign in support. However, I regret to say that the numbers in this place at this time appear clear. Monday night saw, quite frankly, utter filibustering by the opposition and what could only be described as an extended set of second reading speeches. Senator Conroy has already loudly and boldly made further threats to do exactly the same thing today.
—If you want choice then have a discussion about it.
—Senator, this is the constructive way you deal with these matters. It might suit you at Labor Party conferences to attempt to shout people down but you are in the Senate chamber now so why don't you just listen for a change?
After we went into the committee stage we did not even get around to debating any of the amendments put forward by the non-government parties on schedules in the bill. I regret to say that the end point of continuing in this vein is evident: we would use up a very large amount of Senate time—that was clearly the intention of the Labor Party senators—yet we would probably not have a 
 bill that would guarantee choice of fund and open competition, which is important from the government's perspective.
Such a course of events would jeopardise the prospect of a number of other measures in the bill, particularly the savings rebate, and I can see we are going to have an interesting debate on that as well. The government simply cannot accept this, and I wish to emphasise that the government will continue negotiations with all other parties in an attempt to reach an acceptable position on the choice measure. The government believes that if other parties put the interests of employees first, such an arrangement could be made so that a choice bill could be passed, hopefully in the these sittings of the Senate.
To this effect, the government will be seeking to introduce the choice bill in the other place as soon as possible and will be seeking consideration of this new bill at an appropriate time during these sittings. I have circulated some amendments that I would propose to move and which would, as I said, have the effect of excising the schedules on choice from this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-26,"—Firstly, I want to take up the allegation from Senator Kemp that my colleagues and I were engaged in a filibustering exercise last night. I totally reject that accusation. One of the frustrating things in dealing with this government and particularly with you, Minister, is that we do not get answers of substance to questions. I put on the record last night seven or eight questions relating to the issue of choice—and, indeed, the rebate issue—and the effect it has on private savings. This is a very important issue which I must say, Senator Kemp, you have done your very best to avoid since becoming a minister. You have done your very best to avoid direct, succinct, accurate and relevant answers to questions in respect of this issue. I reject the issue of filibustering.
I am not going to take up a lot of time but I want to briefly respond to a couple of the other points you made. You made the point in your comments, and you have made it on a number of other occasions, about what is wrong with Australians having the right to 
 choose. Superficially that is a statement of some appeal, but you neglect to acknowledge that, unlike purchasing a house, purchasing insurance or even getting married, superannuation in this country is compulsory. It is compulsory for employees to be members of a superannuation fund. They have to do it. You do not have to buy life insurance, you do not have to buy a house, and you do not even have to get married.
So we have a system, very similar to Chile's, where it is compulsory to have private superannuation. What you consistently fail to address are the failings of a system such as Chile's. It is a very good working example, with some horrific outcomes, of where superannuation is compulsory. There are very significant flaws in a model that forces choice.
I would like you at some stage—obviously not in this debate because you are withdrawing schedule 5—to attempt to explain how we are to overcome the problems of a choice model. As well as the problems of inducement and coercion in respect to people being forced into a particular superannuation product, there is the fundamental problem we have in this country of between two million and 2½ million people being functionally illiterate. How on earth are they to sit down with these key feature statements and analyse, in a compulsory superannuation savings environment, what is in their best interests when they cannot even read or write? You can have all the education campaigns in the world, all the television advertising, all the literature going out and people being bombarded with propaganda, but how are they to understand what they cannot read? That is one of the fundamental failures of a full choice regime.
Even in the United Kingdom, and I gave examples, where people were convinced that choice was good for them, about one million people withdrew from very good superannuation funds to join a model—wrapped in the rhetoric of freedom and choice—imposed on them by the then Thatcher government. Of the one million people who exercised choice, 900,000 of them got ripped off. These were not illiterate people, either. They were teach 
 ers, miners and public servants who could certainly read and write, as I understand it, but they got ripped off to the tune of £10 billion. This is a very good example of the Thatcher government's ideological obsession to impose compulsory choice—a contradiction in terms—and people who were well educated got ripped off.
The government has not attempted to explain, not only to the Senate but to the Australian people, how people will be better off under a choice regime. What I find most ironic, if not obnoxious, Senator Kemp, in your government's approach to its argument on choice is that when employers kicked up about the choice model, you backtracked. Employers did not want full freedom of choice. Employers did not want the employee to have the ability to say, `I want my superannuation paid into my particular fund' because employers feared the administrative difficulties that would emerge. Theoretically, if employers employ 100 different people, they would have to pay superannuation into 100 different funds.
When the employers pressured you and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, you quickly backtracked. You put a veto on choice, and the veto is: if the employer does not agree, there is no choice. You know that the employers were very concerned about the administrative difficulties of paying into a multitude of different funds on employee demand. So the very model that you were offering—in the guise of freedom and choice and the other rhetoric you surround it with—is in fact employer choice.
I am gravely disappointed, Senator Kemp. The ongoing debate about superannuation has convinced Labor that, where an employee wants to opt out of a particular fund and it is administratively convenient for an employer, and the employee and the employer mutually agree—this is your approach—at a workplace, that is not a bad thing. This is reflected in the Labor amendments. So it is a grave disappointment to me that you have got uptight and upset. The numbers do not look good for you, although we will see how the cards fall in the Senate. But you have started pouting and blowing out your bottom lip.
We want this debate on choice. We want debate on the amendments that Labor is proposing that provide fundamental employee choice—worker rights. We welcome that debate, and we want to see our amendments, which improve your choice model, passed by this Senate. We are very gravely disappointed that, in your fit of pique, you have withdrawn it. That is a grave disappointment. But we would still like answers to the questions that were posed last night by me and my colleagues Senator Conroy and Senator Hogg. I think they were very relevant questions for this debate.
I will conclude by saying that this issue of employee choice of superannuation, which is effectively the deregulation of the retail market, is one of the most radical prescriptions—economic changes, fundamental changes—that your government has proposed. We will agree on that, I suspect. It is one of the most radical changes, that will affect millions of Australians. The overriding principle must be: will it generate a higher retirement income for Australians who have superannuation? That is the overwhelming principle. It is not whether it is in the best interests of banks, life agents, the money markets, financial managers or life companies. It is what is in the best interests of Australian consumers, millions of Australians who have superannuation, and fundamentally your model fails the test.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-05-26,"—Firstly, can I thank Senator Kemp for withdrawing schedule 5. I think that is a victory for commonsense.
—That's not what Sherry said.
—Unfortunately, I suspect it has more to do with the legislative program that you are trying to push through in these last few weeks than actually responding to community concerns, because here again in today's papers we see headlines such as `Super fund choice has firms in a flutter' and `Employees' super choice is to opt out'. Today's papers are again pleading with the government to reconsider its choice regime—because it has not been initiated by employers; it certainly has not been initiated by employees. I would like to think it is not a 
 factor that you are struggling to get through your legislative program. I understand that MIB is also possibly not going to get before the chamber because of that legislative program. I really do hope that you are genuine when you say you would like consultations and you would like to try and find a choice regime that everybody in this chamber can support. I hope that is the case because a number of issues which Senator Sherry has already referred to really do illustrate what I believe is not actually a genuine position on the part of the government.
I asked yesterday about the details of the money tree program. I am still waiting. It would be three months since I first asked this question. I think I asked it in Melbourne—some of the officers here would be aware of the request that I put via the superannuation committee. But still to this day a simple thing like `what did the Labor government spend on the money tree program?' is unavailable from your office. Table it. Is it a secret?
—Don't you know what you spent on your own program?
—I actually do.
—Why are you asking me?
—The government wants to stand up here and say we are the ones filibustering and we are the ones delaying this legislation when in actual fact the information has been available to you for months and you have not supplied it to the chamber. So don't come in here and get pious and say, `The Labor Party is filibustering on choice.' You have had the waffle machine on full bore. You have not been prepared to answer the questions that many senators, including many on your own side, have asked about this. You have not been prepared to sit down and discuss the issues.
You have had an ideological barrow to push that is about attacking industry funds, that is divisive, that is reducing national savings, that does not have a serious education program to address ABS statistics—statistics that have not been made up by the industry, ASFA, the Labor Party, the Democrats or the Greens. You have not been prepared to discuss those issues. You have not been prepared to come 
 before the chamber and actually put those issues on the table—and that is disappointing.
I would like to thank Senator Murray and the Democrats, Senator Harradine, and Senator Margetts from the Greens for also being willing to say, `We don't think this is quite the right package. We think there should be further discussions and we think that a compromise could be reached on this issue.' The sides are not really that far apart if Senator Kemp and the government is interested in achieving choice for employees—not achieving choice for employers, which is what this bill does. There is not that much between us. So I would hope that everybody will be willing to sit down in the next few weeks and have some discussions about that, Senator Kemp. I hope that that is the case.
As Senator Sherry said, the key here is whether we will see retirement incomes for ordinary working Australians improved through choice. That is the bottom line; those are the key tests that the government has to be prepared to demonstrate to the Senate and to the broader Australian community. How do we address that? How do we give choice to people who cannot read bus timetables? How do we help them to understand the issues so that they can pick up the key feature statements and look at the earning rates and the crediting rates. Most Australians would not know that there is a difference between an earning rate and a crediting rate—a very important issue.
Super funds of all complexions—I include industry funds in this—should not be able to highlight a crediting rate to disguise their earning rate. It is very important that Australians know how their superannuation fund is performing, not what they are being credited, not what reserve is being brought into play. It is important that they know whether money is being syphoned off in the good years to pad out the bad years. Those are very important issues.
I know we have a busy schedule and that there is plenty of legislation before the chamber but, hopefully, we will have time to discuss issues such as these. We need to ensure that there is full and proper disclosure, that there is no third line forcing, that there is 
 no capacity for spivs to approach employers and say, `Here's the package. Here's how we'll do this: you put all your employees into my little package. Maybe we can talk about the Chile situation where they have kickbacks.' Everything from brown paper envelopes to lotteries, to free mobile phones, to cheap loans have come into play in Chile.
We have seen the shocking outcomes in England where many people have been convinced to leave their super fund and join a new super fund, which is far inferior, and then have not been able to switch back to defined benefit funds. These are the sorts of issues in the government's legislation and they desperately need to be addressed and desperately need further discussion. I hope they will also be part of the debate and discussions that we are going to have in the next few weeks.
I leave that with Senator Kemp because I know he will want to move onto the savings rebate. I know he is looking forward to telling us about how the savings rebate is going to improve national savings, despite what Ted Evans the secretary of Treasury said. I know he is looking forward to doing that. I know Senator Cook is ready to ask a series of questions. I hope the government and Senator Kemp are genuine about discussing the choice regime, because I will certainly be involved. I absolutely object to the suggestion that we have been filibustering.
I am passionately committed on these issues; anybody in this chamber will tell you that. I am passionately committed to making sure that ordinary working Australians have decent retirement incomes and that they are not being dealt with in a mean minded manner. I am passionately committed to choice for ordinary Australians, and genuine employee choice, not some bogus choice where employers get to pick. I will finish here and thank the government for seeing commonsense in withdrawing schedule 5.
—The question is that schedule 5 stand as printed.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—As has been noted by a number of speakers, a large number of questions were raised last night. In fact, I have never been in the chamber and seen people more keen to ask questions and less willing to receive answers. Senator Conroy chalked up about 30 questions, and he was backed up by Senator Bishop and Senator Hogg. They all came up with a fascinating series of questions. As we analysed them this morning, we noted the overlaps. Nonetheless, a lot of questions were put on notice, and I assume that at least some of them were put in with a degree of sincerity and want answers. Therefore, I shall respond to those that relate to the bill currently before the chamber.
One of the issues raised—I think this was touched on by Senator Conroy and Senator Jacinta Collins—was how the mere distribution of moneys from a trust contribute to the national savings when the moneys received by the beneficiaries do not have to be saved. If we cut through a lot of the comments, we can see that the question asked by Senator Jacinta Collins was similar to the question asked by Senator Conroy.
In response to the general comments, the government has examined the available evidence on the provision of tax concessions for savings. A great deal of work has been done in looking at the various savings vehicles, and particularly international experiences where the concessions have been offered on savings and specific savings vehicles.
The evidence points to increased savings in the particular vehicles without necessarily resulting in a net increase in national savings in the countries concerned. The upshot of this is that the least distortionary approach was to provide a broad based concession, as the government proposes to do. Trust distributions may not have been saved by the beneficiary but this is not the point. The distributions result from earnings on particular investments that the trustee has made, which is a form of savings. A broad based incentive is in our view— 
—It is not generating economic gain.
—Senator Conroy, you are not at a Labor Party conference or a faction meeting, you are in the Senate chamber. You jumped up and down all last night and all today, and a series of questions tumbled out and I am trying to give you the curtesy of responding to them. If you can keep quiet for about three minutes, I will deal with the first part of the question that you asked.
A broad based incentive is the best way to encourage an increase in national savings; the government does not want to merely change the composition of Australian savings. If you put extra conditions on the incentive, for example, only new savings—and I think that was one of the issues—or savings held for a certain period, you would, by definition, attract less savings.
There will always be people who do not want to accept the condition, whatever it is. The group of people who are encouraged to change their behaviour would be smaller. A condition of `new savings' only encourages people to shift to so-called new savings. The point is that a savings rebate with any design limitations will thereby suffer limitations in its chances for success. Accordingly, the savings rebate has been deliberately designed to reward current savers and encourage new savers.
As I have said, that was a question asked by Senator Conroy. I am pleased that he has been able to keep quiet for a few seconds so that he could listen to the response.
Senator Sherry asked me to outline in detail what the precise addition to private and national savings of the savings rebate is. I think that is probably a fair summary, Senator Sherry, of the question that you put to me. I will try not to pout, Senator Sherry, in giving my response to you. Of all the things you said, Senator Sherry, a lot washes over one's shoulder, but that rather surprised me.
Projections by the retirement income modelling unit, RIM, indicate that the government's superannuation policies, including measures announced in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets, will lead to an increase in net private 
 financial savings of 1.7 per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01, and 3.9 per cent of GDP by 2019-20; and an increase in national financial savings of 1.5 per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01, and 3.6 per cent of GDP by 2020. This projection assumes no behavioural response to the savings rebate.
If it is assumed that there is a 12 per cent increase in member superannuation contributions as a result of the savings rebate—for example, that is one-third of the response assumed for the former government's co-contribution policy—it would produce member contributions exceeding the cost of the savings rebate on undeducted member contributions alone. The potential increase in private savings is projected to be 0.1 per cent of GDP by 2000-01 and 0.2 per cent of GDP from 2019-20—
—It is the net effect.
—We have assumed no behavioural change, and now we are looking at making very modest assumptions. Because the public savings loss is negligible, this is also an increment to national savings.
If it is assumed, for example, that there is an effective increase in member contributions of 24 per cent in response to the savings rebate, there will be a projected additional increase in private savings of 0.2 per cent of GDP by 2001-02, and 0.45 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. National savings are projected to increase by a further 0.2 per cent of GDP by 2001, and 0.4 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. So these are some examples.
The projection of behavioural responses is very hard, as I think was discussed in Senate estimates hearings. I believe, Senator Conroy, you probably did not quite accurately quote Ted Evans's comments there because I think, resulting from an earlier intervention by you, he made some further comments—and I am sure that, if you want me to, we can read those to the chamber.
As I have said, the modelling by the retirement income modelling unit, referred to in my earlier response, takes account of the government's policy measures announced in both the 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets, including choice of funds and opting out of 
 the superannuation guarantee. With this modelling, you can feed various assumptions in.
—Will you table it so that we can look at the assumptions?
—We will provide you with some material that we can table. I am not quite sure whether it is in the appropriate form tonight, but we are happy to table that. We are always happy to assist the Senate, as you know.
Then the question was raised—and it was done I think by a number of speakers: what is the government's and the Treasury's view about how they imagine the bills will assist private savings? I think that summarised a number of thoughts which came through.
The savings rebate will reward existing savers as well as providing a significant incentive for potential savers. To the extent that individuals respond to the incentive to save provided by the savings rebate, private saving will increase. The design of the savings rebate is such that, if private savings increase as a result of the incentive, there will be a smaller offsetting decline in public saving and, of course, national saving will increase.
The government is confident that there is no question in relation to savings. I think there would be general agreement that there was a significant decline in national savings during the 1980s. There was no doubt that public savings—
—It has been going on for 25 years.
—It is a serious topic. Senator, you were in government for 13 years; we have been in government for two and a bit years—and I assume that will continue on. But there is no doubt that there is a savings issue in this country, and I would hope both parties would look constructively at how they can encourage private savings.
—National savings.
—Private savings and public savings, with an overall rise in national savings. There is no doubt that Australians in the last number of decades have been very 
 dependent on the savings of foreigners. I would have thought there was general agreement around that it was important to increase national savings. We believe that the savings rebate is one—
—Why does your budget show a reduction in national savings?
—What we have done in relation to public saving, as you would be aware—
—How can aggregate national savings go down in your budget?
—I think that is carefully explained in the budget papers. If you want me to read it out to you, I will. I would have thought it was unarguable that this government has moved very effectively and quickly to repair the problems in public saving. There can be no debate about that. Even the shadow Treasurer recognised there was a problem there.
—Four billion dollars in bracket creep.
—I think in the last four years of your government you racked up deficits of some $70 billion, which was quite significant, and left us with an overhang of some $10 billion, which the shadow Treasurer accepted.
I think Senator Sherry asked a question as to whether the medium term was three, five or 10 years. This referred to the discussion on page 3-11 of budget paper No. 1. It makes clear that the medium-term projection for private savings encompasses a number of factors. Some of these, such as the low and predictable rates of inflation and the superannuation guarantee, are already having an effect. Some of these, such as the savings rebate, will begin to take effect over the next one to two years. Some of these, such as demographic change, will take effect over the next decade or so. Perhaps that is not quite as simple as Senator Sherry might have assumed, but the medium term encompasses three, five and 10 years in looking forward.
I think another issue that Senator Sherry raised is how giving the savings rebate to self-funded retirees, who are people in the community most likely to dissave, is going to 
 encourage national savings. One of the great advantages of the savings rebate is that it does reward people for saving. Under the co-contribution, which I do not think Labor could have ever delivered—it certainly found it difficult to deliver while it had the levers of power—the savings rebate will reward those who have saved in the past, such as self-funded retirees, as well as providing an incentive to new savers. We think that is a good thing. We think it is important in a fair and equitable model.
—I would hate this to be nursing homes. It will not help.
—Senator Conroy, you were able to control yourself for at least five minutes. Perhaps I will sit down and see whether we can move on. Before I do, I move:
(1)	 Schedule 4, item 1, page 17 (lines 18 to 26), omit section 220AAF, substitute
220AAF  How amounts must be paid
		 A large remitter must pay an amount by a means of electronic transfer approved in writing by the Commissioner. If a large remitter pays an amount other than by electronic transfer, the large remitter will be liable for a penalty under section 220AAW.
I table an additional supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to this bill. This memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 26 May 1998. The amendment I have moved is of a technical nature. It ensures that there is a clear statutory obligation for large remitters to pay by electronic means, and this overcomes some of the constitutional doubts about the present drafting. Let me make it clear that it does not in any way change the substance of the measure.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I thank Senator Kemp for being a little more informative about the estimates of the contribution to private saving as a result of the savings rebate. I will read the material that you have provided to us with interest. There was one area that I did want to correct you on. You referred to my questioning the benefits of the saving rebate being given to retirees. I did not. What I did question—and it is in the Hansard —was an issue on page 3- 
11 of the budget paper No. 1. In the commentary it refers to a suggestion of an improved outlook for private savings. I did express my surprise that demographic changes over the next decade or so were likely to see a rise in the proportion of the population in age groups which historically have been high savers and a decline in younger low saving age cohorts.
The reason I asked that question which expressed surprise is that we have an ageing population, and people who are retiring are net dissavers. I would be very surprised if the rebate in the context of people who have already retired actually added to their saving levels. I would be very surprised. I would be very surprised if you claimed that the total level of saving amongst people who are retired will go up as a result of the rebate. The point is that it would seem to me that because of demographic changes there will be pressure towards a reduction in private saving because of demographic changes, not the reverse, which is claimed in budget paper No. 1. You might care to address that point at some stage in the debate.
The other question I was going to raise is that, when this measure was announced in the budget, I recall the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, being asked a day or two later in question time whether he was going to collect the rebate. As you would be aware, Senator Kemp, the rebate applies in respect of superannuation contributions, and I assume that is why the Prime Minister would be eligible for the rebate. I do not wish to know the Prime Minister's personal savings habits, but can you please explain to the chamber what is the latest position regarding the Prime Minister's acceptance of the rebate? It is an important question, because he did considerably undermine this measure and contribute to the lack of confidence in the rebate measure by declaring that he was not going to accept it. Can you inform the chamber whether the Prime Minister will be accepting the rebate or not?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—You raise a number of issues. One is an interesting debate, and seeing as you wish to pursue the nature of the demographics on savings—and it is of some value—I will provide you with a more de 
 tailed response to that. I believe it was canvassed in a serious manner so we will naturally respond in a serious manner. Always, Senator Sherry, when I think you are attempting to elevate the debate and my hopes start to rise, I find my expectations being dashed; of course you got back as quickly as you could into the politics. Senator Sherry, my memory is that the Prime Minister did make a statement on that; we will find that statement for you. I have a feeling that it may have been in question time.
—It was splashed all over the front page.
—No, you asked me what the latest position  is and I will provide you with the statement the Prime Minister made.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I want to clarify something Senator Kemp said before. We recently dealt with the bill to do with trafficking in trust losses. I am sure you remember it—it was quite controversial for those battlers in Brighton. The principle that the government advanced, which we supported, was that the individual that incurred the economic loss should not be allowed to transfer it to another individual who did not incur. It seems to me that the same principle, therefore, says that the economic gain of the income/savings should be incurred and the recipient should be the person who incurs it, not using that structure of a family trust to open a couple of bank accounts for your kids and have a distribution to them, because the kids clearly have not incurred the economic gain. They are not the recipients of the economic activity.
When you talk about how proud you are of where you are at on the savings rebate, I am interested in trying to analyse whether or not the individual who actually earns the income that creates the ability to claim the rebate is then able to transfer the income to another party through that vehicle of the family trust, and therefore generate the capacity to make the claim. I am interested in trying to find the consistency between trafficking in trust losses and what is, in effect, trafficking in trust gains.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—You are really 
 stretching it now, Senator Conroy. I am not sure this has got all that much to do with the amendment before the chair.
—We're talking about the savings rebate in the bill.
—No, we actually have an amendment that is before the chair which has been moved, which I do not think you are even aware of. Do you know what it is about?
—Do you?
—Senator Conroy, as I thought, you do not even know what the amendment is about. There was a very extensive debate on trust losses in this chamber and we were always intrigued to see where Labor was going to come down on it, because there was a huge amount of huffing and puffing on this, Senator Conroy. There may have been some people out there, including those battlers you referred to, who thought the Labor Party was actually going to move one way and then it moved the other way. From memory, you found it very hard to fix a position on that issue, Senator Conroy. This is something entirely separate from this bill. I suppose Senator Conroy will raise every little issue in his kitbag and drag it out, as inevitably occurs in these things, but it has nothing to do with trading in trust losses.
—You didn't understand a word of it.
—I do not think you understand it, Senator Conroy.
—You can ask to take it on notice; we will be here tomorrow.
—No, it was explained to you, Senator Conroy. Senator Jacinta Collins raised an issue in relation to the distribution of moneys from a trust contributing to national savings. You have asked the same question again. You are entitled to, but I wish you had listened to the first answer, Senator Conroy. As I was reading through that I noticed some people were listening; some did not.
—I understood it, but you didn't.
—I could go through it again. If you can read, we will go through it all again.
—Just read it out again.
—I do not think I will. I will refer you to—
—They know more than you will ever know, Kempie.
—Madam Deputy President, what are you interjecting there? It does not seem to me to be behaviour that is appropriate to one in your high office. Seeing that you are Madam Deputy President, what did you interject then?
—You stop obfuscating and answer the question for a change!
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. The contribution from Senator Kemp at the moment is not relevant to the issue. We are discussing the rebate and the other related matters in this legislation. Senator Kemp should not be inviting interjections from the Deputy President. He should stop wasting the chamber's time.
—There is no point of order, Senator Sherry. That is a debating point.
—Indeed, Mr Temporary Chairman, what a fruitless and pointless point of order that was. The question was raised by Senator Jacinta Collins. It was a similar question to Senator Sherry's. Now Senator Conroy has come back to it and he has managed to get trust losses into all this—trust losses which the Labor Party did not do anything about when it was in government but which are now of huge concern apparently. The question was: how does the distribution of moneys from trusts contribute to national savings? Senator Jacinta Collins raised that question, then Senator Sherry raised that question, and now Senator Conroy has come back to that question.
The answer I gave was: we looked at the international experience. You will remember I said that we looked at what happened overseas, we looked at the problems of being discriminating in favour of particular savings vehicles, and we looked at the issue of new savings versus existing savings. Then I argued that, in the government's view, a broad-based incentive is the best way to increase national 
 savings. Then I went into some of the problems—the distortions if, say, you have a particular incentive for a particular savings vehicle. Senator, that was the point I was making. I suggest you read what I said. I am not happy to go over it again because it seems a bit tiresome and it seems to be holding up debate unduly, but, if you wish me to do it, I am in the hands of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-05-26,"—Minister, perhaps it may assist you if I rephrase my question. The crux is whether or not the individual who is holding the asset—bearing the economic risk—is to be the beneficiary of the savings rebate or not. The key is: who is bearing the risk of the economic activity, holding the asset, and is that the person you are rewarding? If that is the case, then at least you are achieving what you are setting out to achieve—whether we agree with that or not. But it seems that there is an ability to distribute through the trust to individuals who have not borne the economic risk, and they are then the beneficiaries without having generated the economic activity, held the asset or borne the risk. That is the crux of the matter.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—Bearing the economic risk came into the debates we had in relation to franking credit trading and dividend streaming, and I recall it came into some of the debates on trust losses. The savings rebate that you are finding difficult is quite a distinctive measure; the other measures were the subject of other debates at other times. For example, in relation to the savings rebate, the distribution of trust income qualifies because the distributed income would have resulted from the investment of funds by the trust in various forms of savings, such as shares, bank deposits, other property or a business venture. In this sense, of course, trust distributions are no different from interest earned on bank accounts or income earned by a sole trader from his or her own investment in business.
Senator Conroy, you are shaking your head. Your government put in place taxation measures which relate to trusts. We have taken some initiatives in relation to trusts, particularly relating to trust losses. But, as I have 
 said, the response to your question is that it is not whether the money is at risk. We have indicated that the savings rebate is widely available to most forms of savings. I think that is one of the merits of it; it is not a problem with it, as you seem to be implying. It is one of the pluses of the design of the savings rebate.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-26,"—Honourable senators will have noticed that underneath the government's amendment No. 1 on sheet B98AF338.WB is a Greens (WA) amendment that amends the government's amendment. I move:
(R1)	 Section 220AAF, omit ""If a large remitter pays an amount other than by electronic transfer, the large remitter will be liable for a penalty under section 220AAW."".
In my speech during the second reading debate, I briefly alluded to the reason this amendment is being moved. It relates to the aspect of the bill that requires remittances by electronic means. The government have created this odd situation in an attempt to rationalise and streamline the system of remittance. It seems that they may have ignored a number of negative or unfair implications. They may have turned a blind eye to the implications for businesses of the changes.
Forwarding payments by cheque has previously been a perfectly legitimate form of commercial transaction in this country; now it is not even an option for large remitters. I know that just about every time I go to my own bank they attempt to get me to transfer money by some forms of electronic means or to make payments by electronic means, and I consistently say that I am not interested in that option. Maybe the banks have got to the government and suggested that what is cheapest for them is what they want consumers to do—and not just consumers. We have seen that they have certainly got to the government over the retirement savings allowance. I am just wondering whether the banks have got to the government and said, `Look, this is going to be cheaper for us if these transactions all take place by electronic transfer, and then we won't have to worry about processing cheques.' I do not really think the use of cheques should suddenly be outlawed by 
 governments, even if it is for a limited group of people.
Beyond the expensive and time consuming compliance measures that business is faced with, the government is making failure to pay electronically into an offence with a penalty. These fines can be downright unfair and misguided. They are not aimed at what they are trying to prevent, that is, preventing large payers from deferring payment because the cheque is not cleared for some days. These fines are an unfair penalty on large remitters.
The legislation proposed in section 220AAW does not seek to penalise late remitters; it seeks to penalise large remitters who choose to use some other form of payment. So they are not penalising a late payment; they are penalising people who would choose to use cheques. So even if a large firm pays by cheque and it is cleared before the due date, the firm is still subject to a penalty of either $500 or 16 per cent per annum on the principal amount for a period of seven days. Many people might think that is a drop in the ocean for a large firm but, considering that large remitters may potentially remit twice per week, the liability for cheque payment, even if they were all on time, could be $52,000 per year.
Will it stop there? I just wonder whether, in the end, like analogue telephones and analogue televisions, we will have corporations more and more requiring the parliament to legislate to reduce their costs, the parliament legislating to take away consumer choices. In this case, it might start with business choices and may well end up with the ability of ordinary regular consumers, who may choose still to use cheques, being told that their choices no longer exist. Whilst I would probably like to get rid of the whole section, our amendment removes the penalty from it—and quite rightly so.
If, in the end, the government has a sensible way of dealing with late remittances, please come and talk to the Senate about it. I urge the Senate to accept the amendment to that. I am not saying that I necessarily support the government's first amendment on B98AF338.WB but if the government's amendment does not get up, I will be happy 
 to move our original amendment, which is still on sheet 1001 and which does the same thing outside the context of the government's amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech

I have listened to the contributions by the minister and by the Greens. I must say that I am disposed to support the government. I do not understand really what the penalty is on major businesses or big remitters here. There is a penalty for not doing it in the approved manner after you have sought written permission from the commissioner. Why there should not be a penalty is, to me, not a very clear argument and I am therefore disposed to support the government's amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-26,"—I would like to make the argument a little clearer. My objection to this is that it should not be a crime to pay by cheque. They are saying the problem is late remittances, but they are not penalising late remittances, they are penalising payment by cheque rather than payment by electronic transfer. I just wonder what the real rationale for it is. I am wondering whether it is the banks saying, `It is cheaper for us to be involved with electronic transfers, can't you put that in legislation?' I wonder about the unfairness; about not targeting late payment but targeting the form of payment—because there is no penalty for late payment, the penalty is for use of a cheque to pay it on time.
—That's a fair enough point for the government to answer.
—Yes. The basic question is whether or not in time to come we are going to get the government coming in penalising other consumers because the banks do not want to process cheques. They will say they want people to pay by telephone in the end and, maybe some time down the track, we will get people penalised for not wanting to make bank transfers by telephone.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the document.
This report has been prepared by the Australian National Line, pursuant to the requirement of the equal employment opportunity provisions, and its introduction says:
ANL Limited is pleased to present the annual Equal Employment Opportunity report for the period 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997. This report documents ANL's commitment to equal opportunities for all employees in the workplace.
This process was started by then Senator Susan Ryan. I would like to pay tribute to her foresight in getting the equal opportunity concept into employment. It has flourished and is generally accepted now throughout the workplace. There is a reference on page 16 of the report to section 6(c) of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. It relates to a responsibility of employers and states:
To consult with each Trade Union having members affected by the proposal for the development and implementation of the program in accordance with this Act.
The report is simply saying that employers are to consult with each trade union having members affected by the proposal for the development and implementation of the program in accordance with this act. It goes on to say:
.	 The ANL Limited Award 1996 was reviewed with the Australian Services Union. A consideration throughout discussions was to ensure that flexible work practices would be maintained and that no employee would be discriminated against by any new Agreement.
The Australian Services Union from its office in Melbourne gives great services to its members. It is just around the corner from my office. It is a union that carries out its duties 
 in the best tradition of its kind. Page 3 of this report says:
As one of Australia's major maritime related transport companies, ANL is involved in numerous commercial activities, both internationally and domestically.
It is good to see a company of this nature deal with unions on the basis that unions are organisations that make a proper contribution not only to their members but also to the economic development of the company itself and the community generally.
I note that this report is a report to the department of which Mr Reith is the head. It would be good if that department and the minister understood that this is what unions—including the Maritime Union of Australia—are about. I commend this report and the approach that has been taken by ANL to its obligations and to the unions with which it deals. It approaches them in a proper way, and in that way we get a good outcome for all Australians.

The erection of a 15-storey building that obscures a view of the Opera House from almost every part of the city is an absolute outrage. Not surprisingly, it has prompted a public outcry. A public meeting last week attracted 1,500 protesters, including the playwright David Williamson, scientist Dr Tim Flannery and broadcaster Margaret Throsby. The meeting heard estimates of the cost to get the site back ranging from $250 million to Premier Bob Carr's touted figure of $700 million.
—He is trying to balance his budget.
—Yes, he is trying to balance his budget. Regardless of the cost, the meeting was unanimous in its decision that the building, dubbed the `toaster', has to go and it has the support of international figures such as Robert Hughes and the architect of the Sydney Opera House, Joern Utzon.
The depth of feeling locally, nationally and internationally means action must be taken. East Circular Quay is a site of great significance to Australians, as it is home for the building which many regard as our national icon and symbol, the Opera House. It also incorporates other Sydney landmarks: the harbour, the quay and the botanic gardens. Sydneysiders have great pride in the city, and they will not allow this building to ruin its appearance and its reputation. At the moment, arriving at a solution to removing the `toaster' poses great difficulty, as the whole issue—perhaps appropriately, given the site—has become something of an operatic event. The debate must be allowed to return to sensible levels of dialogue; emotion must be contained.
The role of the New South Wales Labor government in the fiasco is to be condemned, as is Premier Bob Carr's attempted sidestep to avoid tackling the issue and taking any blame. The fact of the matter is that it was Bob Carr who signed the approval for this building. This was 10 years ago, when he was the New South Wales minister for planning. Not only did he approve the development, he approved it to be 20 storeys high. The present building is 15 storeys high so, if Mr Carr had his way, it would be a third higher than it is now.
His approval has allowed a building that blocks out a view of the Opera House from most parts of the city. What great vision this man had, and has, for his state. He signed on the dotted line to allow a building which overshadows the Opera House. His actions have turned what was envisaged as an area for the people into a high-rise accommodation tower which only the very wealthy can afford. Mr Carr's signature has allowed an elitist tower, owned and developed by overseas 
 interests, to spoil an unparalleled icon of our built heritage.
Even as minister for planning, Bob Carr exhibited the traits which are all too apparent now: lack of vision, lack of leadership and lack of commitment to the people of New South Wales. Now that the project to which he gave the nod has spun out of control, guess what? He is appealing to the federal government to bail him out. Based on press reports, there are indications that a solution could be brokered with the building's owners, Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels. Pressed about this, Mr Carr showed how diminished is his own party's confidence in him. Mr Carr mentioned a figure of $700 million being needed to buy the site back from its owners. Perhaps his own government does not keep him informed because it now emerges that Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels held private talks with the New South Wales government as recently as last year, at which they reportedly said that they would vacate the site for something in the order of $250 million.
The public meeting in Sydney heard that the Save East Circular Quay Committee had received word from an intermediary for the developer that it was prepared to sell the site for $300 million. The total value of the development has been put at $600 million. One thing that must be avoided is a Dutch auction with the owners to buy the site back. Very detailed examination must be made of the true value of the undertaking to the owners. In October last year the site was valued at $85.8 million by the Valuer-General. The fact that only 22 of the 237 apartments in this gross complex have been sold—and all of those before 1996—indicates that the project is something of a commercial dud. Obviously, at prices starting from $700,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to $5.5 million for a sub-penthouse, the owners have priced themselves out of the market and this may be behind their willingness to vacate.
Mr Carr and his government have consistently failed to listen to the people of Sydney on this matter and have only taken the cotton wool out of their ears in recent weeks. In the face of continuing protest—local, national and international—Mr Carr, using his $700 
 million figure, tried to insist that the building was too expensive to buy back and that the whole thing was just beyond his government to fix. Once again, he failed to recognise the values and pride Sydney people have for their city. They will not just turn away from what they regard as a travesty which was foisted upon them against their will.
They fought on and, only hours before the protest rally, it was learnt that the Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels had expressed a willingness to quit the site for something in the order now of $300 million. Having been caught out on the figures, Mr Carr has the unmitigated hide to turn to the federal government to come up with the readies to get the site back. Mr Carr's ineptitude in this matter has meant that the obstacles to resolving the problem have not been addressed.
A land swap might simply move the problem, not solve it. In the past, there has been justifiably strong resistance to the notion of swapping land next to the Opera House in return for land elsewhere, on the proviso that permission would be granted to exceed height restrictions in other locations. Given Bob Carr's previous penchant for a 20-storey building, such a scenario is a frightening possibility.
The government has control of much harbour and foreshore land and it must be stopped from doing any deal which compromises these sites. But there is no doubt that the East Circular Quay apartment building is out of character with the site, with the city and with the wishes of the people, so the problem cannot be left unresolved. The critical question is: where would the funds come from to get rid of it? One suggestion which seemed to have some merit was to start a new lottery to help raise some of the money needed. After all, this was how the Opera House was funded, so it would be appropriate to at least help return East Circular Quay to the way it was envisaged through similar means. But the New South Wales government has poured cold water on that idea.
Another suggestion was a one-off fee in New South Wales. Raising $300 million would represent a cost of $67 to each New South Wales resident over the age of 20. This 
 would be in keeping with the desires of the people after a recent Bulletin poll showed people were overwhelmingly opposed to the idea of using taxpayers' money to solve the issue. However, Bob Carr has turned to the federal government and wants money from the Federation Fund to be used to solve the problem. Not one solution has come forward from Bob Carr on his own account. Bob Carr obviously did not confer with his federal Labor Party colleagues on that one.
The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has gone on record saying:
There are many priorities confronting that Federation Fund and I'm not sure that would necessarily be the highest.
Effectively he has told Bob Carr to abandon the idea. For once I agree with Mr Beazley. The Federation Fund was, however, not established to help remedy Mr Carr's colossal errors of bad judgment. The billion dollar fund was set up in the 1997-98 budget to fund projects of national significance as part of the activities to celebrate this nation's centenary of Federation. Mr Howard made it very clear the funds belonged to everyone. Announcing the plan, he said:
Everybody will be treated equally because the centenary of Federation does not belong to one or other side of politics. It belongs to all Australians and this is a practical demonstration of that commitment.
Giving money to Bob Carr hardly fits that scenario.
The Federation Fund projects are ones of major cultural, economic and social significance. As part of Mr Carr's logic, he claims the coalition government is not giving enough money to New South Wales and he has conveniently ignored the fact that the Corowa bridge on the New South Wales-Victorian border is getting $12 million and that there is funding for the Opera House of $32 million and other money for the cathedral refurbishments and other projects.
Mr Carr ignores, in relation to the Federation Fund, that it is up to state governments to develop and to submit proposals for funding of major projects that would have the support of all Australians. Bob Carr has to 
 find his own way to clean up the mess that he allowed to be created at East Circular Quay.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>East Circular Quay development</title>,Adjournment,31,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-05-26,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground—Private and commercial funding of government schools , and I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
`NOT A LEVEL PLAYGROUND—THE PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL FUNDING OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The appropriate mechanism for referring issues such as voluntary contributions to the States and Territories is the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). The areas of responsibility covered by the Council include primary and secondary education and it is supported by a number of taskforces which are convened as needed for particular tasks, have prescribed timeframes and reporting arrangements and are reviewed annually. Functions of the Council include coordination of strategic policy at the national level and negotiation and development of national agreements on shared objectives and interests in the Council's areas of responsibility. MCEETYA is therefore the appropriate forum for consideration of the majority of the report's recommendations. The Government considers that the relevant course of action for Parents and Citizens Associations to follow is to pursue these matters further with the relevant State and Territory governments.
The Government agrees with statements made in the minority Report that it appears much of the evidence raised by the Committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated. 

The Committee's claim that there has been a decline in government commitment to education is not borne out by funding figures. Commonwealth funding to schools, for example, has risen by 88 per cent from 1987/88 to 1997/98. (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98).
SENATE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation 1 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments, develop and adopt consistent terminology to describe the various contributions invited, and charges imposed by schools.
Response:
This would be a matter for State and Territory governments to agree. The Government will refer this recommendation to State and Territory governments for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA.

Recommendation 2(a) —
The Committee recommends that governments fund public schools at a level sufficient to deliver the appropriate standard of education within the Eight Key Learning Areas and commensurate with the National Goals of Schooling.
Response-
The Government agrees with this recommendation. In March 1997, MCEETYA reaffirmed its commitment to national collaboration and consultations in the pursuit of national goals for schooling. It also agreed to examine the Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling in Australia to ensure they reflect current and future educational developments. At the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, it was agreed that a small group representing the Commonwealth, all States and Territories and the non-government sector should be established to prepare a draft revision of the National Goals for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA. Work is continuing.

Recommendation 2 (b)  (c)
The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments jointly establish a School Education Costs Committee to undertake consultation and research with the aim of ascertaining the cost of delivering, at the various stages of schooling and in each of the eight key learning areas, an education which will meet the basic requirements of those Key Learning Areas and the National Goals for Schools; and on the basis of such data and information determine overall resource levels, allocative mecha 
 nisms and the relative funding shares of the various governments.
Response—
As indicated in the minority report, the establishment of such a committee would be a matter for MCEETYA. Commonwealth funding for schools has increased by 88 per cent over the period 1987/88 to 1997/98 (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98) and is guaranteed by legislation to the year 2000. The Government is committed to education reform, better targeting and improved educational outcomes for students, and is determined to achieve real improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy. While the Commonwealth provides funding for specific national objectives, it is a matter for State governments to decide the allocation of resources to individual schools. 2.

Recommendation 3 -
The Committee recommends that each State and Territory establish a committee comprising senior education department officials and nominees of peak parent associations to:
(a)	 monitor the amounts set and paid as voluntary contributions, subject levies and other charges
(b)	 monitor schools' compliance with departmental policy that contributions and levies be voluntary
(c)	 record, receive and act on complaints concerning contributions, levies and other charges.
Response -
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 4 -
The Committee recommends that government schools distribute to each family at the start of each school year a Charter of School Education. This Charter shall set out:
(a)	 the nature and extent of the education that will be provided in government schools at public expense
(b)	 government policy on voluntary contributions, and any subject levies and charges for areas outside the eight Key Learning Areas
(c)	 contact details for the committee appointed to monitor the voluntary contributions and arrangements for subject levies and other charges
(d)	 information on any financial assistance provided at the system level for families in 
 cases of genuine financial hardship to assist with the costs of schooling.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 5 -
The Committee recommends that schools provide a statement to be attached to the Charter of School Education referred to in Recommendation 4. The statement should:
(a)	 make explicit to parents any charges the school sets for the areas outside the Eight Key Learning Areas
(b)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(c)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(d)	 provide information about any assistance provided at the school level for families in cases of genuine hardship.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.3.

Recommendation 6 -
The Committee recommends that all States and Territories develop or modify their student assistance schemes to ensure that;
(a)	 eligibility be linked to the Commonwealth Health Card with provision for other hardship circumstances to be taken into account
(b)	 the purposes of the payment be specified and that payments not be used for anything other than those purposes.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 7 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commission a major national research project on costs to families associated with government schooling and their relative impact on low income families.
Response—
The Government does not support this recommendation. This would be a duplication of some of the work of the Committee. However, the Government is interested in ways of supporting choice in the schools sector and in how parents might be better informed of the choices available. The Government will be supporting research into school choice in the schools sector as the best way to ensure that 
 government schooling meets the needs of all students.
Recommendation 8 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments amend their Education Acts by inserting the word `education' in place of `instruction' or `tuition'.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 9 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government restore the level of funding for targeted equity programmes to 1995/96 level.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation which is based on a false premise. Funding for equity programmes has not decreased and this Government has provided additional funding for literacy and school-to-work as programmes designed to give direct benefits to disadvantaged students. The 1997/98 funding package features $596 million for special programs including $163 million for literacy, $148 million for students with special learning needs and $191 million for indigenous education. There is no evidence in the report which demonstrates areas of unaddressed need.4.

Recommendation 10 - 
The Committee recommends that all Commonwealth, State and Territory governments
(a)	 develop comprehensive guidelines for sponsorship arrangements at both school and state levels
(b)	 ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to monitor schools' compliance with the sponsorship guidelines
(c)	 ensure that sponsorship assistance is used to provide additional opportunities for students beyond those provided through the 8 Key Learning Areas.
Response -
The eight Key Learning Areas were formed as part of the national collaborative curriculum development project under the direction of the former Australian Education Council (AEC). The national collaborative curriculum development project was completed in June 1993. At its meeting in July 1993, the AEC agreed that the publication of the statements and profiles is the prerogative of each State and Territory.
The Commonwealth funded the Curriculum Corporation to develop a range of materials to assist in the implementation of the statements and profiles in the eight key learning areas including Annotated 
 Work Samples  and a package entitled, Introducing statements and profiles . In addition, the Commonwealth provided considerable assistance to the States and Territories for professional development across the eight key learning areas.
The development of sponsorship guidelines is an issue for the States and Territories to consider as they have responsibility for the daily operation of government schools.

Recommendation 11 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments which seek to supplement government funding to schools via sponsorship establish a centrally-managed Education Foundation for the negotiation of sponsorship deals, and for the equitable distribution across all government schools of any benefits which result.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation. An additional level of bureaucracy is not required.

Recommendation 12 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government require the State and Territory Governments to review practices involving the sale or rental of school land with a view to enabling any decisions and any benefits to be state wide.
Response-
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation. The disposal of assets is a matter for State and Territory governments. 5.

Recommendation 13 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments
(a)	 develop as a matter of urgency a statement of national principles regarding computer based information technologies in schools, and
(b)	 determine the funding implications of providing schools with the technological infrastructure, training and support to ensure that those principles are realised.
Response-
Cooperation in technology between Commonwealth and States is already underway through OLTC and  Education Network Australia (EdNa) School Advisory Group. EdNA is a Commonwealth initiative where States and Territories and non-government authorities collaborate on all aspects of information technology across all sectors of education. Its aim is to maximise the benefits of information technology for Australian education and training. The EdNA Schools Advisory Group focuses particularly on collaboration about informa 
 tion technology in schools. It has developed a set of standards for content and management of websites on the EdNA Directory Service. The Government does not intend to dictate the schools funding priorities of State and Territory Governments. The Commonwealth will, however, seek the agreement of State and Territory governments to specific national objectives in schooling as set out in the Federal Government's policies for schools.

Recommendation 14 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government reappraise it Capital Grants program with a view to increasing the level of funding to enable government schools to implement technology to a standard jointly determined by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.
Response-
Funding under the Capital Grants Programme will be considered in the Budgetary context. Capital Grants funding for government schools for each year from 1997 to 2000 will be $211 million per year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Committees,41,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The government's response to the Senate committee report Not a level playground—The private and commercial funding of government schools  is some nine months overdue. Effectively, they have had just under 12 months to prepare a reply, and they exceeded the normal three-month deadline by some nine months. In that time, they have come up with a startling revelation: that the concerns and the issues raised by the Senate committee on fees and charges being made by schools across this nation are in fact the responsibility of the states. They have attempted to dismiss the concerns of many hundreds of thousands of Australians by buckpassing this issue to the states.
This government tries to present to the Senate, in this most inadequate and totally unresponsive manner, its views which should best be summed up as `referring it to someone else to deal with', to basically pass it off to other people; to suggest that the volume of evidence presented by the Senate committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated; and to maintain the great myth, the great lie that this government seeks to assert, that it is maintain 
 ing its commitment to public education in this country.
The committee report demonstrated, over and over again, the substantial concern of many hundreds of thousands of Australians that the level of support by public education authorities is declining; that in recent years we have seen a devolution of responsibility to schools and, as a consequence, more and more, there is an expectation by governments that it is not governments' responsibility to take care of the legitimate concerns for the educational needs of this country, but that it is for individual parents to meet the funding shortfalls that arise from government policy decisions to reduce government expenditure.
The Liberal's own National Commission of Audit demonstrated that there was a decline in the level of government spending on school education. Expenditure by all levels of government on schools rose by 2.8 per cent of GDP throughout the 1970s; in the 1980s it rose by a slightly greater amount, but it declined under this government. During the period that this government has been in office, public education support has seen a massive reduction.
The government tries to maintain that it is increasing its spending, but the lie was revealed in an answer to a question in the estimates committee. In real terms, in the amounts of money actually being spent, in real dollars that are available for the education of the children of this nation, there has been a substantial decline in public support by the governments of this country. Answer to question No. 52 before the Senate education committee demonstrates in real terms that, in 1995-96, $1.338 billion was spent on government education, by this year the figure had fallen to $1.335 billion and in 1998-99 it will fall to $1.318 billion.
Those figures are quite clear, they are official statistics, yet this government seeks to maintain the lie that it is maintaining its level  of commitment to public education. It seeks to include the additional funds that would normally be applied for inflation or additional students enrolled in the system in the money spent; it does not acknowledge that it is 
 reducing the money spent on public education in real dollar terms.
The Victorian Commission of Audit demonstrated that, in Victoria today, between six and seven per cent of total education revenue is now being raised by parents at a local level; that is, $155 million is coming out of the pockets of parents as a result of so-called voluntary fees and charges. It is not just that people are being expected to put in a bit extra to fund their child's education, the fact remains that not all parents have equal access to money, not all parents have equal access to opportunity. But what you are seeing under this government is a reduction in the level of opportunity, a reduction in the level of real choice being made available to those who seek to use the public education system.
The Victorian Auditor-General demonstrated that 16.9 per cent of non-staff school operating costs was raised as a result of fees and charges being levelled by government schools in Victoria. This is a long way from the claims made in this shonky response that this government has presented to this Senate today, which says that there were `unsubstantiated allegations'—not unsubstantiated to the National Commission of Audit, not unsubstantiated to the Victorian Auditor-General. A number of submissions to the committee demonstrated that the real cost to parents of sending their children to government schools is now in the range of 33 to 70 per cent of the non-staff school operating costs as a result of the government cutbacks in that state. Again and again, you see the parents and teachers highlighting to the public that it is not just a question of people not having the capacity to pay.
Substantial educational issues follow from that. It has been demonstrated again and again that individual children of families who cannot pay these voluntary contributions—these so-called voluntary levies and charges—through various acts of what I would call humiliation, are being embarrassed and their educational opportunities in our schools diminished. Such examples include the withholding of academic reports; the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other functions; the withholding of education 
 al material such as photocopied handouts; the marking of students as absent so that Austudy and Abstudy payments cease; the linking of student enrolment or re-enrolment to the payment of levies; the sending out of accounts for payments of levies; the use of debt collectors on children in this country; the failure to provide school diaries to students; and the removal of various state government support payments—the school card provisions, for instance, in South Australia.
We see the denying of the use of books, the refusing of students access to computers and library; the refusal to allow students whose voluntary contributions have not been paid to attend excursions or camps; the withdrawal of curriculum materials from woodwork, cooking or photography classes and so on.
What the committee demonstrated, again and again, is the use of illicit and, I think, deeply ingrained attempts to humiliate students and force these so-called voluntary payments. The concerns that are raised by the committee go much further than just the question of educational opportunity; they go to some really basic questions about the level of civil rights within the schools in our system.
This is a situation that is becoming more and more intense as a result of the declining levels of financial support by governments for public education in this country and a retreat by governments from what was once accepted as the universal notion of the right of all children to enjoy access to high quality public education.
What you have seen is a rapid growth in the use of levies and charges to make up for the shortfalls in funding that are the result of these government policies. What you are seeing is an increasing use of practices by schools to conceal the so-called voluntary nature of these charges and to engage in what can only be described as bullying and heavy-handed tactics to enforce payment.
What you have here is a Commonwealth government that does not care. It is essentially a Commonwealth government dedicated to the promotion of an elitist view of education—a 
 notion of education that is essentially a 1950s idea—that those who have plenty of money can go to elite schools to enjoy the exclusive conditions of those elite schools and those are the ones who do well in our society. Those who do not have access to large sums of money and do not have access to large sums of disposable cash miss out on educational opportunity.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-26,"—I think the comments of Senator Carr are a disgrace. What he is doing is totally misrepresenting evidence. What he is making out to be hard evidence on this matter in reality is just anecdotal evidence. The committee was enormously frustrated in terms of getting any sort of clear picture of what was happening, purely on the basis of a lack of evidence.
Let us look at what is happening broadly in the school system in this country in relation to funding levels. What we have had over a very long period of time is increasing expectations of parents as to what schools should provide. That is fine; we have no problem with that. The difficulty is with finding enough public money to fund such a proposition. Senator Carr makes out that this is a new problem but it is not a new problem, Senator Carr, as you realise. If you look at the minority report you will see a quote going back to the Schools Commission in the early 1980s. It raised a lot of the problems that you are raising in relation to there not being enough money in public schools. It is quite a reasonable proposition, we feel, that parents of children in these schools contribute something towards their education.
It is quite surprising, however, to find that, far from there being a shortage of public money in education in our public schools, in the case of New South Wales there is an absolutely massive surplus. Let us find out where that is. The Sydney Morning Herald article of 16 April—and as Senator Carr realises, our report was brought down in July last year so we have only the benefit of hindsight with this information; but it makes very interesting reading—lists the funds in reserve that public schools have in the high schools of New South Wales. Senator Carr, it 
 lists all 250 high schools. It has beside it the balances of those high schools.
We find, for example, that Bossley Park High—not exactly in your North Shore area of Sydney—has reserves of over $1 million. We find that Goulburn High School has $620,000. We can go through a number of areas in the western suburbs of Sydney: Blacktown High School has $250,000; Liverpool High has $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has $283,000; Wollongong High, in the steel belt, has $219,000; and Young High School has $432,000.
I found your figure for Victoria interesting, Senator Carr, when you said that parents were asked to chip in $155 million. I do not see any great problem with that: if you divide it by the number of school pupils it is not a huge amount of money. In comparison, in New South Wales, if you look at the total of what I have been talking about—and remember your Victorian figure was $155 million—reserves in New South Wales high schools are $285 million. That is just in the high schools, not primary schools—and that money is sitting there at the moment. It is a matter of great concern to the department's general manager of finance, Ken Dixon. He says that funds allocated to schools are to be expended in general in the year of allocation.
Senator Carr, you really have to answer this question: if there is such a shortage of funding in public schools, how come they can build up a quarter of a billion dollars in reserves in the state of New South Wales? It is good housekeeping, I am sure, but it does not really paint the poor picture that you are trying to put up.
The report that was brought down had dissent from the government senators. What we discovered, in listening to the evidence around the country, was that the extra funding of private money in public schools was not significant and that it came in two parts: sponsorships and fees and charges. We found  that in fees and charges these levels were not high and in many states, and in a vast number of schools, there was the opportunity for people who could not pay to make other 
 arrangements. Many of the schemes were voluntary in any case. In the case of sponsorships of schools we found that this was an opportunity for many schools—schools always have limited resources; they always have had and always will—to get extra funding from particular organisations.
We find totally unacceptable the recommendation of the opposition members of the committee that that sort of funding should be used outside the eight key learning areas only. Obviously schools should have the flexibility to use such funding across a much broader area. The idea of central sponsorships with big companies sponsoring events and the resulting funds spread across schools is attractive to us. But we were not drawn to the suggestion of opposition senators that this should be a centrally managed pool of funds.
The broad implications of what was presented in the report of the opposition members are basically unrealistic on a number of accounts. They are not based on any hard evidence. We really did not see any evidence, apart from a bit of anecdotal evidence—and systems will go wrong in particular places, obviously—that this is widespread across the system. We did not see any evidence that fees are an onerous burden on people. We did see evidence that there are mechanisms in place in most states to do something about that. We did not see evidence that sponsorships are causing that great a problem.
In summary, the situation in our schools is that there is quite a reasonable level of funding from the public sector. This is demonstrated by the fact that in New South Wales a quarter of a billion dollars of public money has been salted away. The level of fees is not too high. I think most people would agree that it is reasonable for parents who have children at school to contribute something towards their education. This is not a new idea, Senator Carr. Parents have put in contributions over the whole century.
The idea that absolutely everything should be free—that hospitals should be free, schools should be free and universities should be free—is very much a Whitlamesque type view. I thought we had left that behind in the seventies. We saw the economic disasters 
 when a government overspending approach applied. There is a feeling in the community that in all these areas the public should contribute, and that in particular the people who use these particular services should make some small contribution.
We found on the evidence that we have—as I have indicated, it is mostly anecdotal—that there is not a high level of this sort of funding in schools. It is not creating a significant problem. In his description today Senator Carr totally misrepresented what was found in the set of hearings. The evidence really is just anecdotal, but he is trying to make out that it is some sort of scientific evidence. We certainly do not have that. This is not a major problem.
The responsibility for dealing with the matters raised by the committee rests almost entirely with the states. In the response by the minister to this report he has put most of these matters back in their rightful place.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I rise to make some comments about the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground: private and commercial funding of government schools . There is a huge amount to be said about this, but first of all I have to say that at last we have one government response to one of the reports of this committee.
—Your record wasn't so good!
—Senator, what matters is that we wrote a report on early childhood education which was tabled in July 1996. There is still no word from the government. Senator Tierney has a commitment to adult education. This committee did a report on this matter, but we still have not had a response. I would have thought that Senator  Tierney would have been pleased to hear from the government.
There is a parliamentary convention in this place that governments provide a response within about three months of a report being tabled or at least provide an explanation as to why they cannot conform with that convention. Thousands of people have bothered to prepare submissions, attend as witnesses and put their efforts into making these reports  decent and fair representations of the issues that are out there. I think they are very disappointed and jaded when governments are so disregarding of their contributions. I am therefore pleased that we have a response—albeit way too late.
—It took Ros Kelly 18 months to respond!
—You are actually doing very well, Senator. You are over two years late in providing a response to one of the reports of this committee. I have never found it a persuasive argument to say that, just because you are wrong, it is all right to say, `You're wrong because we were wrong too.' Two wrongs do not correct the fault in your case. If I were you, I would urge your government to respond. This is one of those things that convinces people that we are serious about what we do in this place.
The government in its response starts off by saying:
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The response is therefore very disappointing. As I heard my colleague Senator Carr say, the response by the federal government to most of the recommendations is, `That is a state and territory matter. We'll have nothing to do with it.' That is not what the community cares for. The community knows that the Commonwealth has a federal education minister who has an overarching responsibility for education services from schools to tertiary institutions in this country. The government has suggested that the minister's interest is of no relevance and that really it should be left to MCEETYA, which is no more than a council 
 of Commonwealth and state officials. It is not a council that actually responds to ministerial guidelines or directly implements policy. It does the work that allows the implementation of policy, but it is not the committee that should be given responsibility for the running of these things.
It is cavalier of the Commonwealth government to dismiss its own responsibility—and, I might say, to dismiss it in a contradictory fashion, because with some of the recommendations the government is saying, `It is a state and territory matter, and we have no responsibility,' but in other areas it is saying, `The Commonwealth and the states do work together on this.' What we know, and what everybody said in the committee, is that private funding is necessary for our public schools because government funding for public schools is no longer sufficient for the very many demands on those schools.
It may well be that the money has increased, but the demands on the schools have increased far more, and therefore there is an ever increasing gap between the funding provided to our public schools—charged, I might say, under state education acts to provide a free secular education. That retreat from `free' is causing major concern, and the committee picked up on this concern, because what it says is that in some areas of our community, particularly in what are short-handedly known as the Eastern Suburbs, schools are able to set fees and charges for parents using that school and that, in large part, those parents are able to meet those fees, but that, in many other areas of our country, people simply cannot find the wherewithal to pay those fees and charges.
Families creep around, embarrassed and afraid for it to be found out that they are not able to afford those fees and charges. There even are specific arrangements to assist families in hardship to get some extra funding from the schools but, once again, a lot of parents are mortified that they should have to register for this kind of assistance. We have actually made a lot of recommendations in the report about doing it so that the privacy and  decency of families are respected. We have state and territory governments and a 
 Commonwealth government which are all committed to providing education for all Australians but which are not, according to this response, committed to funding it. That is grossly insufficient.
Secondly, we also have that major point that I have just been alluding to, that the need for private funding has led to a gross inequity in the amount of funding going to schools. As I said, schools in the better-off areas are able to set fees and charges and get that extra assistance; schools in those same areas can also much more readily afford the new technology—computers and so on. They are more likely to have parents who can assist the teachers and the schools with getting sponsorship arrangements that also bring more wealth to those schools, while the schools in the so-called Western Suburbs, the tougher areas in our major states and regions, get further and further behind.
The number of schools that have access to computers in this country makes a very interesting little map, but certainly many of the schools in the western suburbs and in regional and rural Australia, isolated areas, do not have the same access. If time and time again we hear of the need for access to technology so that our children will at least be able to get the new jobs that require that technology and that kind of training and capacity, then what we are doing is simply writing a formula now for all those children to be further behind the eight ball when they leave their schools.
This is a report that I thought the government might take much more seriously, because it is a thoughtful and considered report and because, as I say, the committee had very many submissions from many people who were very concerned that the cost of education was pricing education out of affordability for many families. Many families told us, for example, that they had to choose between funding their children for special classes or funding their children for trips and tours. Many families could not afford both, and so their children were being dudded out of some of those visits and trips that the school curriculum decides are important. They also have to deal with the fact that their children are 
 very isolated, alienated, if they are not able to participate with all their school chums.
I find it an interesting thing too that the government seems to be rejecting any recommendation for decent research, for example, about hard data on the actual cost of education. What does it cost to educate a grade 4 pupil in Australia? We do not know. The government accuses us in this response to the report of saying that the evidence was anecdotal and unsubstantiated in many cases. We say that is exactly the case because we have not got the hard data and research, and we recommended that there be such hard data and research—in other words, that the Commonwealth fund that kind of investigation so that we could say in future what it does cost to educate a grade 4, grade 6 or grade 10 pupil, and then we would have a much better idea of what the level of state and Commonwealth assistance ought to be.
It is interesting that Senator Tierney was so dismissive of this report: `It is anecdotal; we are not going to worry; it is all made up, and parents out there in the community are not complaining about education.' I do not know where Senator Tierney has been, but the parents that I know are complaining. They are very concerned about the cost of education and they are very concerned that they will not be able to get the best for their children. That is what so many parents actually put their effort into. They will work at second and third jobs; both parents will work, and the highest priority for so many of those parents is to make sure their children get a good education. When people can no longer afford a so-called free secular education, it is time for governments very seriously to have a long hard look at this.
I find it very disappointing that a Commonwealth government education minister should put out a report that says, `It is not my responsibility.' In the past we have seen education ministers from the states brawling with the Commonwealth minister for education. It has had a very bad effect on the status of teachers, it has had a very bad effect on morale and it has had a very bad effect in  terms of sufficient funding for our schools. The state education ministers know that the 
 Commonwealth's involvement in education is particularly to make sure that they do have adequate funding distributed with equity, and that they get support, so that particularly our children from disadvantaged areas who are doing it tough do get that kind of consideration from the Commonwealth. The government response is a very big disappointment, and parents and families of Australia will judge the government very sternly because of it.

Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
`NOT A LEVEL PLAYGROUND—THE PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL FUNDING OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The appropriate mechanism for referring issues such as voluntary contributions to the States and Territories is the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). The areas of responsibility covered by the Council include primary and secondary education and it is supported by a number of taskforces which are convened as needed for particular tasks, have prescribed timeframes and reporting arrangements and are reviewed annually. Functions of the Council include coordination of strategic policy at the national level and negotiation and development of national agreements on shared objectives and interests in the Council's areas of responsibility. MCEETYA is therefore the appropriate forum for consideration of the majority of the report's recommendations. The Government considers that the relevant course of action for Parents and Citizens Associations to follow is to pursue these matters further with the relevant State and Territory governments.
The Government agrees with statements made in the minority Report that it appears much of the evidence raised by the Committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated. 

The Committee's claim that there has been a decline in government commitment to education is not borne out by funding figures. Commonwealth funding to schools, for example, has risen by 88 per cent from 1987/88 to 1997/98. (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98).
SENATE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFERENCES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation 1 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments, develop and adopt consistent terminology to describe the various contributions invited, and charges imposed by schools.
Response:
This would be a matter for State and Territory governments to agree. The Government will refer this recommendation to State and Territory governments for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA.

Recommendation 2(a) —
The Committee recommends that governments fund public schools at a level sufficient to deliver the appropriate standard of education within the Eight Key Learning Areas and commensurate with the National Goals of Schooling.
Response-
The Government agrees with this recommendation. In March 1997, MCEETYA reaffirmed its commitment to national collaboration and consultations in the pursuit of national goals for schooling. It also agreed to examine the Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling in Australia to ensure they reflect current and future educational developments. At the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, it was agreed that a small group representing the Commonwealth, all States and Territories and the non-government sector should be established to prepare a draft revision of the National Goals for consideration at a future meeting of MCEETYA. Work is continuing.

Recommendation 2 (b)  (c)
The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments jointly establish a School Education Costs Committee to undertake consultation and research with the aim of ascertaining the cost of delivering, at the various stages of schooling and in each of the eight key learning areas, an education which will meet the basic requirements of those Key Learning Areas and the National Goals for Schools; and on the basis of such data and information determine overall resource levels, allocative mecha 
 nisms and the relative funding shares of the various governments.
Response—
As indicated in the minority report, the establishment of such a committee would be a matter for MCEETYA. Commonwealth funding for schools has increased by 88 per cent over the period 1987/88 to 1997/98 (Source: Table V—Commonwealth Budget Outlays by Function and Subfunction, Budget Paper No. 1 1997-98) and is guaranteed by legislation to the year 2000. The Government is committed to education reform, better targeting and improved educational outcomes for students, and is determined to achieve real improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy. While the Commonwealth provides funding for specific national objectives, it is a matter for State governments to decide the allocation of resources to individual schools. 2.

Recommendation 3 -
The Committee recommends that each State and Territory establish a committee comprising senior education department officials and nominees of peak parent associations to:
(a)	 monitor the amounts set and paid as voluntary contributions, subject levies and other charges
(b)	 monitor schools' compliance with departmental policy that contributions and levies be voluntary
(c)	 record, receive and act on complaints concerning contributions, levies and other charges.
Response -
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 4 -
The Committee recommends that government schools distribute to each family at the start of each school year a Charter of School Education. This Charter shall set out:
(a)	 the nature and extent of the education that will be provided in government schools at public expense
(b)	 government policy on voluntary contributions, and any subject levies and charges for areas outside the eight Key Learning Areas
(c)	 contact details for the committee appointed to monitor the voluntary contributions and arrangements for subject levies and other charges
(d)	 information on any financial assistance provided at the system level for families in 
 cases of genuine financial hardship to assist with the costs of schooling.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 5 -
The Committee recommends that schools provide a statement to be attached to the Charter of School Education referred to in Recommendation 4. The statement should:
(a)	 make explicit to parents any charges the school sets for the areas outside the Eight Key Learning Areas
(b)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(c)	 identify the amounts requested as voluntary contributions and any other charges and the uses to which they will be put
(d)	 provide information about any assistance provided at the school level for families in cases of genuine hardship.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.3.

Recommendation 6 -
The Committee recommends that all States and Territories develop or modify their student assistance schemes to ensure that;
(a)	 eligibility be linked to the Commonwealth Health Card with provision for other hardship circumstances to be taken into account
(b)	 the purposes of the payment be specified and that payments not be used for anything other than those purposes.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 7 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commission a major national research project on costs to families associated with government schooling and their relative impact on low income families.
Response—
The Government does not support this recommendation. This would be a duplication of some of the work of the Committee. However, the Government is interested in ways of supporting choice in the schools sector and in how parents might be better informed of the choices available. The Government will be supporting research into school choice in the schools sector as the best way to ensure that 
 government schooling meets the needs of all students.
Recommendation 8 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments amend their Education Acts by inserting the word `education' in place of `instruction' or `tuition'.
Response-
This is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

Recommendation 9 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government restore the level of funding for targeted equity programmes to 1995/96 level.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation which is based on a false premise. Funding for equity programmes has not decreased and this Government has provided additional funding for literacy and school-to-work as programmes designed to give direct benefits to disadvantaged students. The 1997/98 funding package features $596 million for special programs including $163 million for literacy, $148 million for students with special learning needs and $191 million for indigenous education. There is no evidence in the report which demonstrates areas of unaddressed need.4.

Recommendation 10 - 
The Committee recommends that all Commonwealth, State and Territory governments
(a)	 develop comprehensive guidelines for sponsorship arrangements at both school and state levels
(b)	 ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to monitor schools' compliance with the sponsorship guidelines
(c)	 ensure that sponsorship assistance is used to provide additional opportunities for students beyond those provided through the 8 Key Learning Areas.
Response -
The eight Key Learning Areas were formed as part of the national collaborative curriculum development project under the direction of the former Australian Education Council (AEC). The national collaborative curriculum development project was completed in June 1993. At its meeting in July 1993, the AEC agreed that the publication of the statements and profiles is the prerogative of each State and Territory.
The Commonwealth funded the Curriculum Corporation to develop a range of materials to assist in the implementation of the statements and profiles in the eight key learning areas including Annotated 
 Work Samples  and a package entitled, Introducing statements and profiles . In addition, the Commonwealth provided considerable assistance to the States and Territories for professional development across the eight key learning areas.
The development of sponsorship guidelines is an issue for the States and Territories to consider as they have responsibility for the daily operation of government schools.

Recommendation 11 -
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments which seek to supplement government funding to schools via sponsorship establish a centrally-managed Education Foundation for the negotiation of sponsorship deals, and for the equitable distribution across all government schools of any benefits which result.
Response-
The Government does not support this recommendation. An additional level of bureaucracy is not required.

Recommendation 12 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government require the State and Territory Governments to review practices involving the sale or rental of school land with a view to enabling any decisions and any benefits to be state wide.
Response-
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation. The disposal of assets is a matter for State and Territory governments. 5.

Recommendation 13 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State and Territory Governments
(a)	 develop as a matter of urgency a statement of national principles regarding computer based information technologies in schools, and
(b)	 determine the funding implications of providing schools with the technological infrastructure, training and support to ensure that those principles are realised.
Response-
Cooperation in technology between Commonwealth and States is already underway through OLTC and  Education Network Australia (EdNa) School Advisory Group. EdNA is a Commonwealth initiative where States and Territories and non-government authorities collaborate on all aspects of information technology across all sectors of education. Its aim is to maximise the benefits of information technology for Australian education and training. The EdNA Schools Advisory Group focuses particularly on collaboration about informa 
 tion technology in schools. It has developed a set of standards for content and management of websites on the EdNA Directory Service. The Government does not intend to dictate the schools funding priorities of State and Territory Governments. The Commonwealth will, however, seek the agreement of State and Territory governments to specific national objectives in schooling as set out in the Federal Government's policies for schools.

Recommendation 14 -
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government reappraise it Capital Grants program with a view to increasing the level of funding to enable government schools to implement technology to a standard jointly determined by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.
Response-
Funding under the Capital Grants Programme will be considered in the Budgetary context. Capital Grants funding for government schools for each year from 1997 to 2000 will be $211 million per year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,41,2,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The government's response to the Senate committee report Not a level playground—The private and commercial funding of government schools  is some nine months overdue. Effectively, they have had just under 12 months to prepare a reply, and they exceeded the normal three-month deadline by some nine months. In that time, they have come up with a startling revelation: that the concerns and the issues raised by the Senate committee on fees and charges being made by schools across this nation are in fact the responsibility of the states. They have attempted to dismiss the concerns of many hundreds of thousands of Australians by buckpassing this issue to the states.
This government tries to present to the Senate, in this most inadequate and totally unresponsive manner, its views which should best be summed up as `referring it to someone else to deal with', to basically pass it off to other people; to suggest that the volume of evidence presented by the Senate committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated; and to maintain the great myth, the great lie that this government seeks to assert, that it is maintain 
 ing its commitment to public education in this country.
The committee report demonstrated, over and over again, the substantial concern of many hundreds of thousands of Australians that the level of support by public education authorities is declining; that in recent years we have seen a devolution of responsibility to schools and, as a consequence, more and more, there is an expectation by governments that it is not governments' responsibility to take care of the legitimate concerns for the educational needs of this country, but that it is for individual parents to meet the funding shortfalls that arise from government policy decisions to reduce government expenditure.
The Liberal's own National Commission of Audit demonstrated that there was a decline in the level of government spending on school education. Expenditure by all levels of government on schools rose by 2.8 per cent of GDP throughout the 1970s; in the 1980s it rose by a slightly greater amount, but it declined under this government. During the period that this government has been in office, public education support has seen a massive reduction.
The government tries to maintain that it is increasing its spending, but the lie was revealed in an answer to a question in the estimates committee. In real terms, in the amounts of money actually being spent, in real dollars that are available for the education of the children of this nation, there has been a substantial decline in public support by the governments of this country. Answer to question No. 52 before the Senate education committee demonstrates in real terms that, in 1995-96, $1.338 billion was spent on government education, by this year the figure had fallen to $1.335 billion and in 1998-99 it will fall to $1.318 billion.
Those figures are quite clear, they are official statistics, yet this government seeks to maintain the lie that it is maintaining its level  of commitment to public education. It seeks to include the additional funds that would normally be applied for inflation or additional students enrolled in the system in the money spent; it does not acknowledge that it is 
 reducing the money spent on public education in real dollar terms.
The Victorian Commission of Audit demonstrated that, in Victoria today, between six and seven per cent of total education revenue is now being raised by parents at a local level; that is, $155 million is coming out of the pockets of parents as a result of so-called voluntary fees and charges. It is not just that people are being expected to put in a bit extra to fund their child's education, the fact remains that not all parents have equal access to money, not all parents have equal access to opportunity. But what you are seeing under this government is a reduction in the level of opportunity, a reduction in the level of real choice being made available to those who seek to use the public education system.
The Victorian Auditor-General demonstrated that 16.9 per cent of non-staff school operating costs was raised as a result of fees and charges being levelled by government schools in Victoria. This is a long way from the claims made in this shonky response that this government has presented to this Senate today, which says that there were `unsubstantiated allegations'—not unsubstantiated to the National Commission of Audit, not unsubstantiated to the Victorian Auditor-General. A number of submissions to the committee demonstrated that the real cost to parents of sending their children to government schools is now in the range of 33 to 70 per cent of the non-staff school operating costs as a result of the government cutbacks in that state. Again and again, you see the parents and teachers highlighting to the public that it is not just a question of people not having the capacity to pay.
Substantial educational issues follow from that. It has been demonstrated again and again that individual children of families who cannot pay these voluntary contributions—these so-called voluntary levies and charges—through various acts of what I would call humiliation, are being embarrassed and their educational opportunities in our schools diminished. Such examples include the withholding of academic reports; the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other functions; the withholding of education 
 al material such as photocopied handouts; the marking of students as absent so that Austudy and Abstudy payments cease; the linking of student enrolment or re-enrolment to the payment of levies; the sending out of accounts for payments of levies; the use of debt collectors on children in this country; the failure to provide school diaries to students; and the removal of various state government support payments—the school card provisions, for instance, in South Australia.
We see the denying of the use of books, the refusing of students access to computers and library; the refusal to allow students whose voluntary contributions have not been paid to attend excursions or camps; the withdrawal of curriculum materials from woodwork, cooking or photography classes and so on.
What the committee demonstrated, again and again, is the use of illicit and, I think, deeply ingrained attempts to humiliate students and force these so-called voluntary payments. The concerns that are raised by the committee go much further than just the question of educational opportunity; they go to some really basic questions about the level of civil rights within the schools in our system.
This is a situation that is becoming more and more intense as a result of the declining levels of financial support by governments for public education in this country and a retreat by governments from what was once accepted as the universal notion of the right of all children to enjoy access to high quality public education.
What you have seen is a rapid growth in the use of levies and charges to make up for the shortfalls in funding that are the result of these government policies. What you are seeing is an increasing use of practices by schools to conceal the so-called voluntary nature of these charges and to engage in what can only be described as bullying and heavy-handed tactics to enforce payment.
What you have here is a Commonwealth government that does not care. It is essentially a Commonwealth government dedicated to the promotion of an elitist view of education—a 
 notion of education that is essentially a 1950s idea—that those who have plenty of money can go to elite schools to enjoy the exclusive conditions of those elite schools and those are the ones who do well in our society. Those who do not have access to large sums of money and do not have access to large sums of disposable cash miss out on educational opportunity. This report is a disgrace.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,41,2,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-26,"—I think the comments of Senator Carr are a disgrace. What he is doing is totally misrepresenting evidence. What he is making out to be hard evidence on this matter in reality is just anecdotal evidence. The committee was enormously frustrated in terms of getting any sort of clear picture of what was happening, purely on the basis of a lack of evidence.
Let us look at what is happening broadly in the school system in this country in relation to funding levels. What we have had over a very long period of time is increasing expectations of parents as to what schools should provide. That is fine; we have no problem with that. The difficulty is with finding enough public money to fund such a proposition. Senator Carr makes out that this is a new problem but it is not a new problem, Senator Carr, as you realise. If you look at the minority report you will see a quote going back to the Schools Commission in the early 1980s. It raised a lot of the problems that you are raising in relation to there not being enough money in public schools. It is quite a reasonable proposition, we feel, that parents of children in these schools contribute something towards their education.
It is quite surprising, however, to find that, far from there being a shortage of public money in education in our public schools, in the case of New South Wales there is an absolutely massive surplus. Let us find out where that is. The Sydney Morning Herald article of 16 April—and as Senator Carr realises, our report was brought down in July last year so we have only the benefit of hindsight with this information; but it makes very interesting reading—lists the funds in reserve that public schools have in the high schools of New South Wales. Senator Carr, it 
 lists all 250 high schools. It has beside it the balances of those high schools.
We find, for example, that Bossley Park High—not exactly in your North Shore area of Sydney—has reserves of over $1 million. We find that Goulburn High School has $620,000. We can go through a number of areas in the western suburbs of Sydney: Blacktown High School has $250,000; Liverpool High has $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has $283,000; Wollongong High, in the steel belt, has $219,000; and Young High School has $432,000.
I found your figure for Victoria interesting, Senator Carr, when you said that parents were asked to chip in $155 million. I do not see any great problem with that: if you divide it by the number of school pupils it is not a huge amount of money. In comparison, in New South Wales, if you look at the total of what I have been talking about—and remember your Victorian figure was $155 million—reserves in New South Wales high schools are $285 million. That is just in the high schools, not primary schools—and that money is sitting there at the moment. It is a matter of great concern to the department's general manager of finance, Ken Dixon. He says that funds allocated to schools are to be expended in general in the year of allocation.
Senator Carr, you really have to answer this question: if there is such a shortage of funding in public schools, how come they can build up a quarter of a billion dollars in reserves in the state of New South Wales? It is good housekeeping, I am sure, but it does not really paint the poor picture that you are trying to put up.
The report that was brought down had dissent from the government senators. What we discovered, in listening to the evidence around the country, was that the extra funding of private money in public schools was not significant and that it came in two parts: sponsorships and fees and charges. We found  that in fees and charges these levels were not high and in many states, and in a vast number of schools, there was the opportunity for people who could not pay to make other 
 arrangements. Many of the schemes were voluntary in any case. In the case of sponsorships of schools we found that this was an opportunity for many schools—schools always have limited resources; they always have had and always will—to get extra funding from particular organisations.
We find totally unacceptable the recommendation of the opposition members of the committee that that sort of funding should be used outside the eight key learning areas only. Obviously schools should have the flexibility to use such funding across a much broader area. The idea of central sponsorships with big companies sponsoring events and the resulting funds spread across schools is attractive to us. But we were not drawn to the suggestion of opposition senators that this should be a centrally managed pool of funds.
The broad implications of what was presented in the report of the opposition members are basically unrealistic on a number of accounts. They are not based on any hard evidence. We really did not see any evidence, apart from a bit of anecdotal evidence—and systems will go wrong in particular places, obviously—that this is widespread across the system. We did not see any evidence that fees are an onerous burden on people. We did see evidence that there are mechanisms in place in most states to do something about that. We did not see evidence that sponsorships are causing that great a problem.
In summary, the situation in our schools is that there is quite a reasonable level of funding from the public sector. This is demonstrated by the fact that in New South Wales a quarter of a billion dollars of public money has been salted away. The level of fees is not too high. I think most people would agree that it is reasonable for parents who have children at school to contribute something towards their education. This is not a new idea, Senator Carr. Parents have put in contributions over the whole century.
The idea that absolutely everything should be free—that hospitals should be free, schools should be free and universities should be free—is very much a Whitlamesque type view. I thought we had left that behind in the seventies. We saw the economic disasters 
 when a government overspending approach applied. There is a feeling in the community that in all these areas the public should contribute, and that in particular the people who use these particular services should make some small contribution.
We found on the evidence that we have—as I have indicated, it is mostly anecdotal—that there is not a high level of this sort of funding in schools. It is not creating a significant problem. In his description today Senator Carr totally misrepresented what was found in the set of hearings. The evidence really is just anecdotal, but he is trying to make out that it is some sort of scientific evidence. We certainly do not have that. This is not a major problem.
The responsibility for dealing with the matters raised by the committee rests almost entirely with the states. In the response by the minister to this report he has put most of these matters back in their rightful place. They are things that should be considered by the states through the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,41,2,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I rise to make some comments about the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Not a level playground: private and commercial funding of government schools . There is a huge amount to be said about this, but first of all I have to say that at last we have one government response to one of the reports of this committee.
—Your record wasn't so good!
—Senator, what matters is that we wrote a report on early childhood education which was tabled in July 1996. There is still no word from the government. Senator Tierney has a commitment to adult education. This committee did a report on this matter, but we still have not had a response. I would have thought that Senator  Tierney would have been pleased to hear from the government.
There is a parliamentary convention in this place that governments provide a response within about three months of a report being tabled or at least provide an explanation as to why they cannot conform with that convention. Thousands of people have bothered to prepare submissions, attend as witnesses and put their efforts into making these reports  decent and fair representations of the issues that are out there. I think they are very disappointed and jaded when governments are so disregarding of their contributions. I am therefore pleased that we have a response—albeit way too late.
—It took Ros Kelly 18 months to respond!
—You are actually doing very well, Senator. You are over two years late in providing a response to one of the reports of this committee. I have never found it a persuasive argument to say that, just because you are wrong, it is all right to say, `You're wrong because we were wrong too.' Two wrongs do not correct the fault in your case. If I were you, I would urge your government to respond. This is one of those things that convinces people that we are serious about what we do in this place.
The government in its response starts off by saying:
The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.
The response is therefore very disappointing. As I heard my colleague Senator Carr say, the response by the federal government to most of the recommendations is, `That is a state and territory matter. We'll have nothing to do with it.' That is not what the community cares for. The community knows that the Commonwealth has a federal education minister who has an overarching responsibility for education services from schools to tertiary institutions in this country. The government has suggested that the minister's interest is of no relevance and that really it should be left to MCEETYA, which is no more than a council 
 of Commonwealth and state officials. It is not a council that actually responds to ministerial guidelines or directly implements policy. It does the work that allows the implementation of policy, but it is not the committee that should be given responsibility for the running of these things.
It is cavalier of the Commonwealth government to dismiss its own responsibility—and, I might say, to dismiss it in a contradictory fashion, because with some of the recommendations the government is saying, `It is a state and territory matter, and we have no responsibility,' but in other areas it is saying, `The Commonwealth and the states do work together on this.' What we know, and what everybody said in the committee, is that private funding is necessary for our public schools because government funding for public schools is no longer sufficient for the very many demands on those schools.
It may well be that the money has increased, but the demands on the schools have increased far more, and therefore there is an ever increasing gap between the funding provided to our public schools—charged, I might say, under state education acts to provide a free secular education. That retreat from `free' is causing major concern, and the committee picked up on this concern, because what it says is that in some areas of our community, particularly in what are short-handedly known as the Eastern Suburbs, schools are able to set fees and charges for parents using that school and that, in large part, those parents are able to meet those fees, but that, in many other areas of our country, people simply cannot find the wherewithal to pay those fees and charges.
Families creep around, embarrassed and afraid for it to be found out that they are not able to afford those fees and charges. There even are specific arrangements to assist families in hardship to get some extra funding from the schools but, once again, a lot of parents are mortified that they should have to register for this kind of assistance. We have actually made a lot of recommendations in the report about doing it so that the privacy and  decency of families are respected. We have state and territory governments and a 
 Commonwealth government which are all committed to providing education for all Australians but which are not, according to this response, committed to funding it. That is grossly insufficient.
Secondly, we also have that major point that I have just been alluding to, that the need for private funding has led to a gross inequity in the amount of funding going to schools. As I said, schools in the better-off areas are able to set fees and charges and get that extra assistance; schools in those same areas can also much more readily afford the new technology—computers and so on. They are more likely to have parents who can assist the teachers and the schools with getting sponsorship arrangements that also bring more wealth to those schools, while the schools in the so-called Western Suburbs, the tougher areas in our major states and regions, get further and further behind.
The number of schools that have access to computers in this country makes a very interesting little map, but certainly many of the schools in the western suburbs and in regional and rural Australia, isolated areas, do not have the same access. If time and time again we hear of the need for access to technology so that our children will at least be able to get the new jobs that require that technology and that kind of training and capacity, then what we are doing is simply writing a formula now for all those children to be further behind the eight ball when they leave their schools.
This is a report that I thought the government might take much more seriously, because it is a thoughtful and considered report and because, as I say, the committee had very many submissions from many people who were very concerned that the cost of education was pricing education out of affordability for many families. Many families told us, for example, that they had to choose between funding their children for special classes or funding their children for trips and tours. Many families could not afford both, and so their children were being dudded out of some of those visits and trips that the school curriculum decides are important. They also have to deal with the fact that their children are 
 very isolated, alienated, if they are not able to participate with all their school chums.
I find it an interesting thing too that the government seems to be rejecting any recommendation for decent research, for example, about hard data on the actual cost of education. What does it cost to educate a grade 4 pupil in Australia? We do not know. The government accuses us in this response to the report of saying that the evidence was anecdotal and unsubstantiated in many cases. We say that is exactly the case because we have not got the hard data and research, and we recommended that there be such hard data and research—in other words, that the Commonwealth fund that kind of investigation so that we could say in future what it does cost to educate a grade 4, grade 6 or grade 10 pupil, and then we would have a much better idea of what the level of state and Commonwealth assistance ought to be.
It is interesting that Senator Tierney was so dismissive of this report: `It is anecdotal; we are not going to worry; it is all made up, and parents out there in the community are not complaining about education.' I do not know where Senator Tierney has been, but the parents that I know are complaining. They are very concerned about the cost of education and they are very concerned that they will not be able to get the best for their children. That is what so many parents actually put their effort into. They will work at second and third jobs; both parents will work, and the highest priority for so many of those parents is to make sure their children get a good education. When people can no longer afford a so-called free secular education, it is time for governments very seriously to have a long hard look at this.
I find it very disappointing that a Commonwealth government education minister should put out a report that says, `It is not my responsibility.' In the past we have seen education ministers from the states brawling with the Commonwealth minister for education. It has had a very bad effect on the status of teachers, it has had a very bad effect on morale and it has had a very bad effect in  terms of sufficient funding for our schools. The state education ministers know that the 
 Commonwealth's involvement in education is particularly to make sure that they do have adequate funding distributed with equity, and that they get support, so that particularly our children from disadvantaged areas who are doing it tough do get that kind of consideration from the Commonwealth. The government response is a very big disappointment, and parents and families of Australia will judge the government very sternly because of it.

The statement read as follows—
On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I table the Report on the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 1998-99, in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Auditor General Act 1997.
The tabling of this report is an historic occasion for the Committee which has a unique role in oversighting the process of budgetary appropriation for the Australian National Audit Office. This measure is in itself a significant guarantee of the independence of the Auditor-General from Executive Government.
In its Report No. 346, Guarding the Independence of the Auditor-General , tabled in October 1996, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that it be given a statutory power to consider and report on draft budget estimates of the Audit Office as part of the then Auditor-General Bill. The Committee argued that the proper resourcing of the Auditor-General and the ANAO was:
'integral to the functional independence of the Auditor-General'. It also argued that it was the `role of Parliament and not the Executive to take responsibility for ensuring that audit functions are adequately resourced'.
Although under Section 56 of the Constitution it is indisputable that the Office
of the Auditor-General cannot be legally or financially independent from the Executive in any absolute sense, it has been possible to insulate the Auditor General's financing from Executive influence to ensure that the audit office cannot be starved of funds.
A process has been put in place whereby the draft budget estimates are considered by the JCPAA before the budget is handed down, and the Committee's report provided to the Minister for Finance to be tabled as soon as practicable after the budget. This process allows the resourcing of audit functions to be made transparent to the Parliament so that the Executive is held to account for the 
 level of resources appropriated to allow the Auditor-General to fulfil the statutory functions of his office.
With respect to the budget estimates for the 1998-99 financial year, the Committee accepts that the budget appropriation figure of $53.703m (as finally adjusted), is sufficient for the ANAO to carry out its functions.
The Committee acknowledges the response of the Minister for Finance who commented on the co-operative manner in which this unprecedented process of Parliamentary scrutiny was implemented by the JCPAA and the Australian National Audit Office.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—In the light of the debates we had in this chamber last night and discussions we have had today, I rise to make a statement about schedule 5 of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998  dealing with the choice of fund proposal.
Under the current superannuation rules, many employees have no choice about which superannuation fund is entrusted to invest employer superannuation contributions made on their behalf. This applies to many award employees and to non-award employees. It intrigued me in the debate which we had last night—which was not much of a debate, I have to say; it struck me as more of a filibuster—
—I have another hour.
—You have an hour, have you? That is exactly what I thought, Senator. It was interesting that it came through in that debate that somehow we can allow employees choices about whole aspects of their lives—their jobs, whether they get married, whether they have children; all those important things—but we dare not, apparently, according to some of the speakers, allow employees to make choices about their superannuation. The decision as to which fund invests their money seems at present to almost be a random accident of who happens to be their employer. Employees who want to entrust contributions to another fund cannot do so. We believe that this is undemocratic, uncompetitive, unfair and unAustralian. The government's bill brings in our view greater democracy, fairness and competition to Australia's superannuation industry.
The Australian Labor Party and the Democrats have put forward detailed alternatives to choice. These alternatives are unacceptable to the government. There are a number of reasons why they are unacceptable but one is paramount—neither the Democrats nor Labor guarantee employees any choice of a superannuation fund at all. The government believes employees should have the right to choose their superannuation fund, just like they have the right to choose their home loan, the sort of car they buy or what political party they vote for. We give employees all these rights, but I have always said that when it is a choice between trade union interests and worker rights it is always easy to see where the Labor Party will come down.
The government cannot accept choice of fund legislation that does not provide employees with a right to choose. Of course, the gov 
 ernment believes that it is important that employees are able to make informed choices and that is why we have worked hard to develop, in consultation with industry and consumer groups, a comprehensive disclosure regime and effective information campaign.
Sadly, our repeated offers of briefings and consultations with other parties have not been taken up. I regret that. However, I do congratulate the Greens, the Australian Consumer Association and others who have taken up the offer we have made. We would hope that the ALP and the Democrats will be able to accept the principle of allowing employees to choose once they—
—They already do.
—No they do not. We hope that on reflection they will show more confidence in employees—people whom, from time to time, they like to say they are representing.
The government remains committed to introducing legislation that provides employees with real choice of fund and to providing a disclosure and information campaign in support. However, I regret to say that the numbers in this place at this time appear clear. Monday night saw, quite frankly, utter filibustering by the opposition and what could only be described as an extended set of second reading speeches. Senator Conroy has already loudly and boldly made further threats to do exactly the same thing today.
—If you want choice then have a discussion about it.
—Senator, this is the constructive way you deal with these matters. It might suit you at Labor Party conferences to attempt to shout people down but you are in the Senate chamber now so why don't you just listen for a change?
After we went into the committee stage we did not even get around to debating any of the amendments put forward by the non-government parties on schedules in the bill. I regret to say that the end point of continuing in this vein is evident: we would use up a very large amount of Senate time—that was clearly the intention of the Labor Party senators—yet we would probably not have a 
 bill that would guarantee choice of fund and open competition, which is important from the government's perspective.
Such a course of events would jeopardise the prospect of a number of other measures in the bill, particularly the savings rebate, and I can see we are going to have an interesting debate on that as well. The government simply cannot accept this, and I wish to emphasise that the government will continue negotiations with all other parties in an attempt to reach an acceptable position on the choice measure. The government believes that if other parties put the interests of employees first, such an arrangement could be made so that a choice bill could be passed, hopefully in the these sittings of the Senate.
To this effect, the government will be seeking to introduce the choice bill in the other place as soon as possible and will be seeking consideration of this new bill at an appropriate time during these sittings. I have circulated some amendments that I would propose to move and which would, as I said, have the effect of excising the schedules on choice from this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-26,"—Firstly, I want to take up the allegation from Senator Kemp that my colleagues and I were engaged in a filibustering exercise last night. I totally reject that accusation. One of the frustrating things in dealing with this government and particularly with you, Minister, is that we do not get answers of substance to questions. I put on the record last night seven or eight questions relating to the issue of choice—and, indeed, the rebate issue—and the effect it has on private savings. This is a very important issue which I must say, Senator Kemp, you have done your very best to avoid since becoming a minister. You have done your very best to avoid direct, succinct, accurate and relevant answers to questions in respect of this issue. I reject the issue of filibustering.
I am not going to take up a lot of time but I want to briefly respond to a couple of the other points you made. You made the point in your comments, and you have made it on a number of other occasions, about what is wrong with Australians having the right to 
 choose. Superficially that is a statement of some appeal, but you neglect to acknowledge that, unlike purchasing a house, purchasing insurance or even getting married, superannuation in this country is compulsory. It is compulsory for employees to be members of a superannuation fund. They have to do it. You do not have to buy life insurance, you do not have to buy a house, and you do not even have to get married.
So we have a system, very similar to Chile's, where it is compulsory to have private superannuation. What you consistently fail to address are the failings of a system such as Chile's. It is a very good working example, with some horrific outcomes, of where superannuation is compulsory. There are very significant flaws in a model that forces choice.
I would like you at some stage—obviously not in this debate because you are withdrawing schedule 5—to attempt to explain how we are to overcome the problems of a choice model. As well as the problems of inducement and coercion in respect to people being forced into a particular superannuation product, there is the fundamental problem we have in this country of between two million and 2½ million people being functionally illiterate. How on earth are they to sit down with these key feature statements and analyse, in a compulsory superannuation savings environment, what is in their best interests when they cannot even read or write? You can have all the education campaigns in the world, all the television advertising, all the literature going out and people being bombarded with propaganda, but how are they to understand what they cannot read? That is one of the fundamental failures of a full choice regime.
Even in the United Kingdom, and I gave examples, where people were convinced that choice was good for them, about one million people withdrew from very good superannuation funds to join a model—wrapped in the rhetoric of freedom and choice—imposed on them by the then Thatcher government. Of the one million people who exercised choice, 900,000 of them got ripped off. These were not illiterate people, either. They were teach 
 ers, miners and public servants who could certainly read and write, as I understand it, but they got ripped off to the tune of £10 billion. This is a very good example of the Thatcher government's ideological obsession to impose compulsory choice—a contradiction in terms—and people who were well educated got ripped off.
The government has not attempted to explain, not only to the Senate but to the Australian people, how people will be better off under a choice regime. What I find most ironic, if not obnoxious, Senator Kemp, in your government's approach to its argument on choice is that when employers kicked up about the choice model, you backtracked. Employers did not want full freedom of choice. Employers did not want the employee to have the ability to say, `I want my superannuation paid into my particular fund' because employers feared the administrative difficulties that would emerge. Theoretically, if employers employ 100 different people, they would have to pay superannuation into 100 different funds.
When the employers pressured you and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, you quickly backtracked. You put a veto on choice, and the veto is: if the employer does not agree, there is no choice. You know that the employers were very concerned about the administrative difficulties of paying into a multitude of different funds on employee demand. So the very model that you were offering—in the guise of freedom and choice and the other rhetoric you surround it with—is in fact employer choice.
I am gravely disappointed, Senator Kemp. The ongoing debate about superannuation has convinced Labor that, where an employee wants to opt out of a particular fund and it is administratively convenient for an employer, and the employee and the employer mutually agree—this is your approach—at a workplace, that is not a bad thing. This is reflected in the Labor amendments. So it is a grave disappointment to me that you have got uptight and upset. The numbers do not look good for you, although we will see how the cards fall in the Senate. But you have started pouting and blowing out your bottom lip.
We want this debate on choice. We want debate on the amendments that Labor is proposing that provide fundamental employee choice—worker rights. We welcome that debate, and we want to see our amendments, which improve your choice model, passed by this Senate. We are very gravely disappointed that, in your fit of pique, you have withdrawn it. That is a grave disappointment. But we would still like answers to the questions that were posed last night by me and my colleagues Senator Conroy and Senator Hogg. I think they were very relevant questions for this debate.
I will conclude by saying that this issue of employee choice of superannuation, which is effectively the deregulation of the retail market, is one of the most radical prescriptions—economic changes, fundamental changes—that your government has proposed. We will agree on that, I suspect. It is one of the most radical changes, that will affect millions of Australians. The overriding principle must be: will it generate a higher retirement income for Australians who have superannuation? That is the overwhelming principle. It is not whether it is in the best interests of banks, life agents, the money markets, financial managers or life companies. It is what is in the best interests of Australian consumers, millions of Australians who have superannuation, and fundamentally your model fails the test.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-05-26,"—Firstly, can I thank Senator Kemp for withdrawing schedule 5. I think that is a victory for commonsense.
—That's not what Sherry said.
—Unfortunately, I suspect it has more to do with the legislative program that you are trying to push through in these last few weeks than actually responding to community concerns, because here again in today's papers we see headlines such as `Super fund choice has firms in a flutter' and `Employees' super choice is to opt out'. Today's papers are again pleading with the government to reconsider its choice regime—because it has not been initiated by employers; it certainly has not been initiated by employees. I would like to think it is not a 
 factor that you are struggling to get through your legislative program. I understand that MIB is also possibly not going to get before the chamber because of that legislative program. I really do hope that you are genuine when you say you would like consultations and you would like to try and find a choice regime that everybody in this chamber can support. I hope that is the case because a number of issues which Senator Sherry has already referred to really do illustrate what I believe is not actually a genuine position on the part of the government.
I asked yesterday about the details of the money tree program. I am still waiting. It would be three months since I first asked this question. I think I asked it in Melbourne—some of the officers here would be aware of the request that I put via the superannuation committee. But still to this day a simple thing like `what did the Labor government spend on the money tree program?' is unavailable from your office. Table it. Is it a secret?
—Don't you know what you spent on your own program?
—I actually do.
—Why are you asking me?
—The government wants to stand up here and say we are the ones filibustering and we are the ones delaying this legislation when in actual fact the information has been available to you for months and you have not supplied it to the chamber. So don't come in here and get pious and say, `The Labor Party is filibustering on choice.' You have had the waffle machine on full bore. You have not been prepared to answer the questions that many senators, including many on your own side, have asked about this. You have not been prepared to sit down and discuss the issues.
You have had an ideological barrow to push that is about attacking industry funds, that is divisive, that is reducing national savings, that does not have a serious education program to address ABS statistics—statistics that have not been made up by the industry, ASFA, the Labor Party, the Democrats or the Greens. You have not been prepared to discuss those issues. You have not been prepared to come 
 before the chamber and actually put those issues on the table—and that is disappointing.
I would like to thank Senator Murray and the Democrats, Senator Harradine, and Senator Margetts from the Greens for also being willing to say, `We don't think this is quite the right package. We think there should be further discussions and we think that a compromise could be reached on this issue.' The sides are not really that far apart if Senator Kemp and the government is interested in achieving choice for employees—not achieving choice for employers, which is what this bill does. There is not that much between us. So I would hope that everybody will be willing to sit down in the next few weeks and have some discussions about that, Senator Kemp. I hope that that is the case.
As Senator Sherry said, the key here is whether we will see retirement incomes for ordinary working Australians improved through choice. That is the bottom line; those are the key tests that the government has to be prepared to demonstrate to the Senate and to the broader Australian community. How do we address that? How do we give choice to people who cannot read bus timetables? How do we help them to understand the issues so that they can pick up the key feature statements and look at the earning rates and the crediting rates. Most Australians would not know that there is a difference between an earning rate and a crediting rate—a very important issue.
Super funds of all complexions—I include industry funds in this—should not be able to highlight a crediting rate to disguise their earning rate. It is very important that Australians know how their superannuation fund is performing, not what they are being credited, not what reserve is being brought into play. It is important that they know whether money is being syphoned off in the good years to pad out the bad years. Those are very important issues.
I know we have a busy schedule and that there is plenty of legislation before the chamber but, hopefully, we will have time to discuss issues such as these. We need to ensure that there is full and proper disclosure, that there is no third line forcing, that there is 
 no capacity for spivs to approach employers and say, `Here's the package. Here's how we'll do this: you put all your employees into my little package. Maybe we can talk about the Chile situation where they have kickbacks.' Everything from brown paper envelopes to lotteries, to free mobile phones, to cheap loans have come into play in Chile.
We have seen the shocking outcomes in England where many people have been convinced to leave their super fund and join a new super fund, which is far inferior, and then have not been able to switch back to defined benefit funds. These are the sorts of issues in the government's legislation and they desperately need to be addressed and desperately need further discussion. I hope they will also be part of the debate and discussions that we are going to have in the next few weeks.
I leave that with Senator Kemp because I know he will want to move onto the savings rebate. I know he is looking forward to telling us about how the savings rebate is going to improve national savings, despite what Ted Evans the secretary of Treasury said. I know he is looking forward to doing that. I know Senator Cook is ready to ask a series of questions. I hope the government and Senator Kemp are genuine about discussing the choice regime, because I will certainly be involved. I absolutely object to the suggestion that we have been filibustering.
I am passionately committed on these issues; anybody in this chamber will tell you that. I am passionately committed to making sure that ordinary working Australians have decent retirement incomes and that they are not being dealt with in a mean minded manner. I am passionately committed to choice for ordinary Australians, and genuine employee choice, not some bogus choice where employers get to pick. I will finish here and thank the government for seeing commonsense in withdrawing schedule 5.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—As has been noted by a number of speakers, a large number of questions were raised last night. In fact, I have never been in the chamber and seen people more keen to ask questions and less willing to receive answers. Senator Conroy chalked up about 30 questions, and he was backed up by Senator Bishop and Senator Hogg. They all came up with a fascinating series of questions. As we analysed them this morning, we noted the overlaps. Nonetheless, a lot of questions were put on notice, and I assume that at least some of them were put in with a degree of sincerity and want answers. Therefore, I shall respond to those that relate to the bill currently before the chamber.
One of the issues raised—I think this was touched on by Senator Conroy and Senator Jacinta Collins—was how the mere distribution of moneys from a trust contribute to the national savings when the moneys received by the beneficiaries do not have to be saved. If we cut through a lot of the comments, we can see that the question asked by Senator Jacinta Collins was similar to the question asked by Senator Conroy.
In response to the general comments, the government has examined the available evidence on the provision of tax concessions for savings. A great deal of work has been done in looking at the various savings vehicles, and particularly international experiences where the concessions have been offered on savings and specific savings vehicles.
The evidence points to increased savings in the particular vehicles without necessarily resulting in a net increase in national savings in the countries concerned. The upshot of this is that the least distortionary approach was to provide a broad based concession, as the government proposes to do. Trust distributions may not have been saved by the beneficiary but this is not the point. The distributions result from earnings on particular investments that the trustee has made, which is a form of savings. A broad based incentive is in our view— 
—It is not generating economic gain.
—Senator Conroy, you are not at a Labor Party conference or a faction meeting, you are in the Senate chamber. You jumped up and down all last night and all today, and a series of questions tumbled out and I am trying to give you the curtesy of responding to them. If you can keep quiet for about three minutes, I will deal with the first part of the question that you asked.
A broad based incentive is the best way to encourage an increase in national savings; the government does not want to merely change the composition of Australian savings. If you put extra conditions on the incentive, for example, only new savings—and I think that was one of the issues—or savings held for a certain period, you would, by definition, attract less savings.
There will always be people who do not want to accept the condition, whatever it is. The group of people who are encouraged to change their behaviour would be smaller. A condition of `new savings' only encourages people to shift to so-called new savings. The point is that a savings rebate with any design limitations will thereby suffer limitations in its chances for success. Accordingly, the savings rebate has been deliberately designed to reward current savers and encourage new savers.
As I have said, that was a question asked by Senator Conroy. I am pleased that he has been able to keep quiet for a few seconds so that he could listen to the response.
Senator Sherry asked me to outline in detail what the precise addition to private and national savings of the savings rebate is. I think that is probably a fair summary, Senator Sherry, of the question that you put to me. I will try not to pout, Senator Sherry, in giving my response to you. Of all the things you said, Senator Sherry, a lot washes over one's shoulder, but that rather surprised me.
Projections by the retirement income modelling unit, RIM, indicate that the government's superannuation policies, including measures announced in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets, will lead to an increase in net private 
 financial savings of 1.7 per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01, and 3.9 per cent of GDP by 2019-20; and an increase in national financial savings of 1.5 per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01, and 3.6 per cent of GDP by 2020. This projection assumes no behavioural response to the savings rebate.
If it is assumed that there is a 12 per cent increase in member superannuation contributions as a result of the savings rebate—for example, that is one-third of the response assumed for the former government's co-contribution policy—it would produce member contributions exceeding the cost of the savings rebate on undeducted member contributions alone. The potential increase in private savings is projected to be 0.1 per cent of GDP by 2000-01 and 0.2 per cent of GDP from 2019-20—
—It is the net effect.
—We have assumed no behavioural change, and now we are looking at making very modest assumptions. Because the public savings loss is negligible, this is also an increment to national savings.
If it is assumed, for example, that there is an effective increase in member contributions of 24 per cent in response to the savings rebate, there will be a projected additional increase in private savings of 0.2 per cent of GDP by 2001-02, and 0.45 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. National savings are projected to increase by a further 0.2 per cent of GDP by 2001, and 0.4 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. So these are some examples.
The projection of behavioural responses is very hard, as I think was discussed in Senate estimates hearings. I believe, Senator Conroy, you probably did not quite accurately quote Ted Evans's comments there because I think, resulting from an earlier intervention by you, he made some further comments—and I am sure that, if you want me to, we can read those to the chamber.
As I have said, the modelling by the retirement income modelling unit, referred to in my earlier response, takes account of the government's policy measures announced in both the 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets, including choice of funds and opting out of 
 the superannuation guarantee. With this modelling, you can feed various assumptions in.
—Will you table it so that we can look at the assumptions?
—We will provide you with some material that we can table. I am not quite sure whether it is in the appropriate form tonight, but we are happy to table that. We are always happy to assist the Senate, as you know.
Then the question was raised—and it was done I think by a number of speakers: what is the government's and the Treasury's view about how they imagine the bills will assist private savings? I think that summarised a number of thoughts which came through.
The savings rebate will reward existing savers as well as providing a significant incentive for potential savers. To the extent that individuals respond to the incentive to save provided by the savings rebate, private saving will increase. The design of the savings rebate is such that, if private savings increase as a result of the incentive, there will be a smaller offsetting decline in public saving and, of course, national saving will increase.
The government is confident that there is no question in relation to savings. I think there would be general agreement that there was a significant decline in national savings during the 1980s. There was no doubt that public savings—
—It has been going on for 25 years.
—It is a serious topic. Senator, you were in government for 13 years; we have been in government for two and a bit years—and I assume that will continue on. But there is no doubt that there is a savings issue in this country, and I would hope both parties would look constructively at how they can encourage private savings.
—National savings.
—Private savings and public savings, with an overall rise in national savings. There is no doubt that Australians in the last number of decades have been very 
 dependent on the savings of foreigners. I would have thought there was general agreement around that it was important to increase national savings. We believe that the savings rebate is one—
—Why does your budget show a reduction in national savings?
—What we have done in relation to public saving, as you would be aware—
—How can aggregate national savings go down in your budget?
—I think that is carefully explained in the budget papers. If you want me to read it out to you, I will. I would have thought it was unarguable that this government has moved very effectively and quickly to repair the problems in public saving. There can be no debate about that. Even the shadow Treasurer recognised there was a problem there.
—Four billion dollars in bracket creep.
—I think in the last four years of your government you racked up deficits of some $70 billion, which was quite significant, and left us with an overhang of some $10 billion, which the shadow Treasurer accepted.
I think Senator Sherry asked a question as to whether the medium term was three, five or 10 years. This referred to the discussion on page 3-11 of budget paper No. 1. It makes clear that the medium-term projection for private savings encompasses a number of factors. Some of these, such as the low and predictable rates of inflation and the superannuation guarantee, are already having an effect. Some of these, such as the savings rebate, will begin to take effect over the next one to two years. Some of these, such as demographic change, will take effect over the next decade or so. Perhaps that is not quite as simple as Senator Sherry might have assumed, but the medium term encompasses three, five and 10 years in looking forward.
I think another issue that Senator Sherry raised is how giving the savings rebate to self-funded retirees, who are people in the community most likely to dissave, is going to 
 encourage national savings. One of the great advantages of the savings rebate is that it does reward people for saving. Under the co-contribution, which I do not think Labor could have ever delivered—it certainly found it difficult to deliver while it had the levers of power—the savings rebate will reward those who have saved in the past, such as self-funded retirees, as well as providing an incentive to new savers. We think that is a good thing. We think it is important in a fair and equitable model.
—I would hate this to be nursing homes. It will not help.
—Senator Conroy, you were able to control yourself for at least five minutes. Perhaps I will sit down and see whether we can move on. Before I do, I move:
(1)	 Schedule 4, item 1, page 17 (lines 18 to 26), omit section 220AAF, substitute
220AAF  How amounts must be paid
		 A large remitter must pay an amount by a means of electronic transfer approved in writing by the Commissioner. If a large remitter pays an amount other than by electronic transfer, the large remitter will be liable for a penalty under section 220AAW.
I table an additional supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to this bill. This memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 26 May 1998. The amendment I have moved is of a technical nature. It ensures that there is a clear statutory obligation for large remitters to pay by electronic means, and this overcomes some of the constitutional doubts about the present drafting. Let me make it clear that it does not in any way change the substance of the measure.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I thank Senator Kemp for being a little more informative about the estimates of the contribution to private saving as a result of the savings rebate. I will read the material that you have provided to us with interest. There was one area that I did want to correct you on. You referred to my questioning the benefits of the saving rebate being given to retirees. I did not. What I did question—and it is in the Hansard —was an issue on page 3- 
11 of the budget paper No. 1. In the commentary it refers to a suggestion of an improved outlook for private savings. I did express my surprise that demographic changes over the next decade or so were likely to see a rise in the proportion of the population in age groups which historically have been high savers and a decline in younger low saving age cohorts.
The reason I asked that question which expressed surprise is that we have an ageing population, and people who are retiring are net dissavers. I would be very surprised if the rebate in the context of people who have already retired actually added to their saving levels. I would be very surprised. I would be very surprised if you claimed that the total level of saving amongst people who are retired will go up as a result of the rebate. The point is that it would seem to me that because of demographic changes there will be pressure towards a reduction in private saving because of demographic changes, not the reverse, which is claimed in budget paper No. 1. You might care to address that point at some stage in the debate.
The other question I was going to raise is that, when this measure was announced in the budget, I recall the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, being asked a day or two later in question time whether he was going to collect the rebate. As you would be aware, Senator Kemp, the rebate applies in respect of superannuation contributions, and I assume that is why the Prime Minister would be eligible for the rebate. I do not wish to know the Prime Minister's personal savings habits, but can you please explain to the chamber what is the latest position regarding the Prime Minister's acceptance of the rebate? It is an important question, because he did considerably undermine this measure and contribute to the lack of confidence in the rebate measure by declaring that he was not going to accept it. Can you inform the chamber whether the Prime Minister will be accepting the rebate or not?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—You raise a number of issues. One is an interesting debate, and seeing as you wish to pursue the nature of the demographics on savings—and it is of some value—I will provide you with a more de 
 tailed response to that. I believe it was canvassed in a serious manner so we will naturally respond in a serious manner. Always, Senator Sherry, when I think you are attempting to elevate the debate and my hopes start to rise, I find my expectations being dashed; of course you got back as quickly as you could into the politics. Senator Sherry, my memory is that the Prime Minister did make a statement on that; we will find that statement for you. I have a feeling that it may have been in question time.
—It was splashed all over the front page.
—No, you asked me what the latest position  is and I will provide you with the statement the Prime Minister made.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-05-26,"—I want to clarify something Senator Kemp said before. We recently dealt with the bill to do with trafficking in trust losses. I am sure you remember it—it was quite controversial for those battlers in Brighton. The principle that the government advanced, which we supported, was that the individual that incurred the economic loss should not be allowed to transfer it to another individual who did not incur. It seems to me that the same principle, therefore, says that the economic gain of the income/savings should be incurred and the recipient should be the person who incurs it, not using that structure of a family trust to open a couple of bank accounts for your kids and have a distribution to them, because the kids clearly have not incurred the economic gain. They are not the recipients of the economic activity.
When you talk about how proud you are of where you are at on the savings rebate, I am interested in trying to analyse whether or not the individual who actually earns the income that creates the ability to claim the rebate is then able to transfer the income to another party through that vehicle of the family trust, and therefore generate the capacity to make the claim. I am interested in trying to find the consistency between trafficking in trust losses and what is, in effect, trafficking in trust gains.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—You are really 
 stretching it now, Senator Conroy. I am not sure this has got all that much to do with the amendment before the chair.
—We're talking about the savings rebate in the bill.
—No, we actually have an amendment that is before the chair which has been moved, which I do not think you are even aware of. Do you know what it is about?
—Do you?
—Senator Conroy, as I thought, you do not even know what the amendment is about. There was a very extensive debate on trust losses in this chamber and we were always intrigued to see where Labor was going to come down on it, because there was a huge amount of huffing and puffing on this, Senator Conroy. There may have been some people out there, including those battlers you referred to, who thought the Labor Party was actually going to move one way and then it moved the other way. From memory, you found it very hard to fix a position on that issue, Senator Conroy. This is something entirely separate from this bill. I suppose Senator Conroy will raise every little issue in his kitbag and drag it out, as inevitably occurs in these things, but it has nothing to do with trading in trust losses.
—You didn't understand a word of it.
—I do not think you understand it, Senator Conroy.
—You can ask to take it on notice; we will be here tomorrow.
—No, it was explained to you, Senator Conroy. Senator Jacinta Collins raised an issue in relation to the distribution of moneys from a trust contributing to national savings. You have asked the same question again. You are entitled to, but I wish you had listened to the first answer, Senator Conroy. As I was reading through that I noticed some people were listening; some did not.
—I understood it, but you didn't.
—I could go through it again. If you can read, we will go through it all again.
—Just read it out again.
—I do not think I will. I will refer you to—
—They know more than you will ever know, Kempie.
—Madam Deputy President, what are you interjecting there? It does not seem to me to be behaviour that is appropriate to one in your high office. Seeing that you are Madam Deputy President, what did you interject then?
—You stop obfuscating and answer the question for a change!
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. The contribution from Senator Kemp at the moment is not relevant to the issue. We are discussing the rebate and the other related matters in this legislation. Senator Kemp should not be inviting interjections from the Deputy President. He should stop wasting the chamber's time.
—There is no point of order, Senator Sherry. That is a debating point.
—Indeed, Mr Temporary Chairman, what a fruitless and pointless point of order that was. The question was raised by Senator Jacinta Collins. It was a similar question to Senator Sherry's. Now Senator Conroy has come back to it and he has managed to get trust losses into all this—trust losses which the Labor Party did not do anything about when it was in government but which are now of huge concern apparently. The question was: how does the distribution of moneys from trusts contribute to national savings? Senator Jacinta Collins raised that question, then Senator Sherry raised that question, and now Senator Conroy has come back to that question.
The answer I gave was: we looked at the international experience. You will remember I said that we looked at what happened overseas, we looked at the problems of being discriminating in favour of particular savings vehicles, and we looked at the issue of new savings versus existing savings. Then I argued that, in the government's view, a broad-based incentive is the best way to increase national 
 savings. Then I went into some of the problems—the distortions if, say, you have a particular incentive for a particular savings vehicle. Senator, that was the point I was making. I suggest you read what I said. I am not happy to go over it again because it seems a bit tiresome and it seems to be holding up debate unduly, but, if you wish me to do it, I am in the hands of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-05-26,"—Minister, perhaps it may assist you if I rephrase my question. The crux is whether or not the individual who is holding the asset—bearing the economic risk—is to be the beneficiary of the savings rebate or not. The key is: who is bearing the risk of the economic activity, holding the asset, and is that the person you are rewarding? If that is the case, then at least you are achieving what you are setting out to achieve—whether we agree with that or not. But it seems that there is an ability to distribute through the trust to individuals who have not borne the economic risk, and they are then the beneficiaries without having generated the economic activity, held the asset or borne the risk. That is the crux of the matter.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-26,"—Bearing the economic risk came into the debates we had in relation to franking credit trading and dividend streaming, and I recall it came into some of the debates on trust losses. The savings rebate that you are finding difficult is quite a distinctive measure; the other measures were the subject of other debates at other times. For example, in relation to the savings rebate, the distribution of trust income qualifies because the distributed income would have resulted from the investment of funds by the trust in various forms of savings, such as shares, bank deposits, other property or a business venture. In this sense, of course, trust distributions are no different from interest earned on bank accounts or income earned by a sole trader from his or her own investment in business.
Senator Conroy, you are shaking your head. Your government put in place taxation measures which relate to trusts. We have taken some initiatives in relation to trusts, particularly relating to trust losses. But, as I have 
 said, the response to your question is that it is not whether the money is at risk. We have indicated that the savings rebate is widely available to most forms of savings. I think that is one of the merits of it; it is not a problem with it, as you seem to be implying. It is one of the pluses of the design of the savings rebate.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-26,"—Honourable senators will have noticed that underneath the government's amendment No. 1 on sheet B98AF338.WB is a Greens (WA) amendment that amends the government's amendment. I move:
(R1)	 Section 220AAF, omit ""If a large remitter pays an amount other than by electronic transfer, the large remitter will be liable for a penalty under section 220AAW."".
In my speech during the second reading debate, I briefly alluded to the reason this amendment is being moved. It relates to the aspect of the bill that requires remittances by electronic means. The government have created this odd situation in an attempt to rationalise and streamline the system of remittance. It seems that they may have ignored a number of negative or unfair implications. They may have turned a blind eye to the implications for businesses of the changes.
Forwarding payments by cheque has previously been a perfectly legitimate form of commercial transaction in this country; now it is not even an option for large remitters. I know that just about every time I go to my own bank they attempt to get me to transfer money by some forms of electronic means or to make payments by electronic means, and I consistently say that I am not interested in that option. Maybe the banks have got to the government and suggested that what is cheapest for them is what they want consumers to do—and not just consumers. We have seen that they have certainly got to the government over the retirement savings allowance. I am just wondering whether the banks have got to the government and said, `Look, this is going to be cheaper for us if these transactions all take place by electronic transfer, and then we won't have to worry about processing cheques.' I do not really think the use of cheques should suddenly be outlawed by 
 governments, even if it is for a limited group of people.
Beyond the expensive and time consuming compliance measures that business is faced with, the government is making failure to pay electronically into an offence with a penalty. These fines can be downright unfair and misguided. They are not aimed at what they are trying to prevent, that is, preventing large payers from deferring payment because the cheque is not cleared for some days. These fines are an unfair penalty on large remitters.
The legislation proposed in section 220AAW does not seek to penalise late remitters; it seeks to penalise large remitters who choose to use some other form of payment. So they are not penalising a late payment; they are penalising people who would choose to use cheques. So even if a large firm pays by cheque and it is cleared before the due date, the firm is still subject to a penalty of either $500 or 16 per cent per annum on the principal amount for a period of seven days. Many people might think that is a drop in the ocean for a large firm but, considering that large remitters may potentially remit twice per week, the liability for cheque payment, even if they were all on time, could be $52,000 per year.
Will it stop there? I just wonder whether, in the end, like analogue telephones and analogue televisions, we will have corporations more and more requiring the parliament to legislate to reduce their costs, the parliament legislating to take away consumer choices. In this case, it might start with business choices and may well end up with the ability of ordinary regular consumers, who may choose still to use cheques, being told that their choices no longer exist. Whilst I would probably like to get rid of the whole section, our amendment removes the penalty from it—and quite rightly so.
If, in the end, the government has a sensible way of dealing with late remittances, please come and talk to the Senate about it. I urge the Senate to accept the amendment to that. I am not saying that I necessarily support the government's first amendment on B98AF338.WB but if the government's amendment does not get up, I will be happy 
 to move our original amendment, which is still on sheet 1001 and which does the same thing outside the context of the government's amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech

I have listened to the contributions by the minister and by the Greens. I must say that I am disposed to support the government. I do not understand really what the penalty is on major businesses or big remitters here. There is a penalty for not doing it in the approved manner after you have sought written permission from the commissioner. Why there should not be a penalty is, to me, not a very clear argument and I am therefore disposed to support the government's amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-26,"—I would like to make the argument a little clearer. My objection to this is that it should not be a crime to pay by cheque. They are saying the problem is late remittances, but they are not penalising late remittances, they are penalising payment by cheque rather than payment by electronic transfer. I just wonder what the real rationale for it is. I am wondering whether it is the banks saying, `It is cheaper for us to be involved with electronic transfers, can't you put that in legislation?' I wonder about the unfairness; about not targeting late payment but targeting the form of payment—because there is no penalty for late payment, the penalty is for use of a cheque to pay it on time.
—That's a fair enough point for the government to answer.
—Yes. The basic question is whether or not in time to come we are going to get the government coming in penalising other consumers because the banks do not want to process cheques. They will say they want people to pay by telephone in the end and, maybe some time down the track, we will get people penalised for not wanting to make bank transfers by telephone.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the document.
This report has been prepared by the Australian National Line, pursuant to the requirement of the equal employment opportunity provisions, and its introduction says:
ANL Limited is pleased to present the annual Equal Employment Opportunity report for the period 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997. This report documents ANL's commitment to equal opportunities for all employees in the workplace.
This process was started by then Senator Susan Ryan. I would like to pay tribute to her foresight in getting the equal opportunity concept into employment. It has flourished and is generally accepted now throughout the workplace. There is a reference on page 16 of the report to section 6(c) of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. It relates to a responsibility of employers and states:
To consult with each Trade Union having members affected by the proposal for the development and implementation of the program in accordance with this Act.
The report is simply saying that employers are to consult with each trade union having members affected by the proposal for the development and implementation of the program in accordance with this act. It goes on to say:
.	 The ANL Limited Award 1996 was reviewed with the Australian Services Union. A consideration throughout discussions was to ensure that flexible work practices would be maintained and that no employee would be discriminated against by any new Agreement.
The Australian Services Union from its office in Melbourne gives great services to its members. It is just around the corner from my office. It is a union that carries out its duties 
 in the best tradition of its kind. Page 3 of this report says:
As one of Australia's major maritime related transport companies, ANL is involved in numerous commercial activities, both internationally and domestically.
It is good to see a company of this nature deal with unions on the basis that unions are organisations that make a proper contribution not only to their members but also to the economic development of the company itself and the community generally.
I note that this report is a report to the department of which Mr Reith is the head. It would be good if that department and the minister understood that this is what unions—including the Maritime Union of Australia—are about. I commend this report and the approach that has been taken by ANL to its obligations and to the unions with which it deals. It approaches them in a proper way, and in that way we get a good outcome for all Australians.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-05-26,"—In the adjournment debate this evening I wish to comment on the  current debacle in Sydney over the East Circular Quay development. The erection of a 15-storey building that obscures a view of the Opera House from almost every part of the city is an absolute outrage. Not surprisingly, it has prompted a public outcry. A public meeting last week attracted 1,500 protesters, including the playwright David Williamson, scientist Dr Tim Flannery and broadcaster Margaret Throsby. The meeting heard estimates of the cost to get the site back ranging from $250 million to Premier Bob Carr's touted figure of $700 million.
—He is trying to balance his budget.
—Yes, he is trying to balance his budget. Regardless of the cost, the meeting was unanimous in its decision that the building, dubbed the `toaster', has to go and it has the support of international figures such as Robert Hughes and the architect of the Sydney Opera House, Joern Utzon.
The depth of feeling locally, nationally and internationally means action must be taken. East Circular Quay is a site of great significance to Australians, as it is home for the building which many regard as our national icon and symbol, the Opera House. It also incorporates other Sydney landmarks: the harbour, the quay and the botanic gardens. Sydneysiders have great pride in the city, and they will not allow this building to ruin its appearance and its reputation. At the moment, arriving at a solution to removing the `toaster' poses great difficulty, as the whole issue—perhaps appropriately, given the site—has become something of an operatic event. The debate must be allowed to return to sensible levels of dialogue; emotion must be contained.
The role of the New South Wales Labor government in the fiasco is to be condemned, as is Premier Bob Carr's attempted sidestep to avoid tackling the issue and taking any blame. The fact of the matter is that it was Bob Carr who signed the approval for this building. This was 10 years ago, when he was the New South Wales minister for planning. Not only did he approve the development, he approved it to be 20 storeys high. The present building is 15 storeys high so, if Mr Carr had his way, it would be a third higher than it is now.
His approval has allowed a building that blocks out a view of the Opera House from most parts of the city. What great vision this man had, and has, for his state. He signed on the dotted line to allow a building which overshadows the Opera House. His actions have turned what was envisaged as an area for the people into a high-rise accommodation tower which only the very wealthy can afford. Mr Carr's signature has allowed an elitist tower, owned and developed by overseas 
 interests, to spoil an unparalleled icon of our built heritage.
Even as minister for planning, Bob Carr exhibited the traits which are all too apparent now: lack of vision, lack of leadership and lack of commitment to the people of New South Wales. Now that the project to which he gave the nod has spun out of control, guess what? He is appealing to the federal government to bail him out. Based on press reports, there are indications that a solution could be brokered with the building's owners, Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels. Pressed about this, Mr Carr showed how diminished is his own party's confidence in him. Mr Carr mentioned a figure of $700 million being needed to buy the site back from its owners. Perhaps his own government does not keep him informed because it now emerges that Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels held private talks with the New South Wales government as recently as last year, at which they reportedly said that they would vacate the site for something in the order of $250 million.
The public meeting in Sydney heard that the Save East Circular Quay Committee had received word from an intermediary for the developer that it was prepared to sell the site for $300 million. The total value of the development has been put at $600 million. One thing that must be avoided is a Dutch auction with the owners to buy the site back. Very detailed examination must be made of the true value of the undertaking to the owners. In October last year the site was valued at $85.8 million by the Valuer-General. The fact that only 22 of the 237 apartments in this gross complex have been sold—and all of those before 1996—indicates that the project is something of a commercial dud. Obviously, at prices starting from $700,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to $5.5 million for a sub-penthouse, the owners have priced themselves out of the market and this may be behind their willingness to vacate.
Mr Carr and his government have consistently failed to listen to the people of Sydney on this matter and have only taken the cotton wool out of their ears in recent weeks. In the face of continuing protest—local, national and international—Mr Carr, using his $700 
 million figure, tried to insist that the building was too expensive to buy back and that the whole thing was just beyond his government to fix. Once again, he failed to recognise the values and pride Sydney people have for their city. They will not just turn away from what they regard as a travesty which was foisted upon them against their will.
They fought on and, only hours before the protest rally, it was learnt that the Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels had expressed a willingness to quit the site for something in the order now of $300 million. Having been caught out on the figures, Mr Carr has the unmitigated hide to turn to the federal government to come up with the readies to get the site back. Mr Carr's ineptitude in this matter has meant that the obstacles to resolving the problem have not been addressed.
A land swap might simply move the problem, not solve it. In the past, there has been justifiably strong resistance to the notion of swapping land next to the Opera House in return for land elsewhere, on the proviso that permission would be granted to exceed height restrictions in other locations. Given Bob Carr's previous penchant for a 20-storey building, such a scenario is a frightening possibility.
The government has control of much harbour and foreshore land and it must be stopped from doing any deal which compromises these sites. But there is no doubt that the East Circular Quay apartment building is out of character with the site, with the city and with the wishes of the people, so the problem cannot be left unresolved. The critical question is: where would the funds come from to get rid of it? One suggestion which seemed to have some merit was to start a new lottery to help raise some of the money needed. After all, this was how the Opera House was funded, so it would be appropriate to at least help return East Circular Quay to the way it was envisaged through similar means. But the New South Wales government has poured cold water on that idea.
Another suggestion was a one-off fee in New South Wales. Raising $300 million would represent a cost of $67 to each New South Wales resident over the age of 20. This 
 would be in keeping with the desires of the people after a recent Bulletin poll showed people were overwhelmingly opposed to the idea of using taxpayers' money to solve the issue. However, Bob Carr has turned to the federal government and wants money from the Federation Fund to be used to solve the problem. Not one solution has come forward from Bob Carr on his own account. Bob Carr obviously did not confer with his federal Labor Party colleagues on that one.
The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has gone on record saying:
There are many priorities confronting that Federation Fund and I'm not sure that would necessarily be the highest.
Effectively he has told Bob Carr to abandon the idea. For once I agree with Mr Beazley. The Federation Fund was, however, not established to help remedy Mr Carr's colossal errors of bad judgment. The billion dollar fund was set up in the 1997-98 budget to fund projects of national significance as part of the activities to celebrate this nation's centenary of Federation. Mr Howard made it very clear the funds belonged to everyone. Announcing the plan, he said:
Everybody will be treated equally because the centenary of Federation does not belong to one or other side of politics. It belongs to all Australians and this is a practical demonstration of that commitment.
Giving money to Bob Carr hardly fits that scenario.
The Federation Fund projects are ones of major cultural, economic and social significance. As part of Mr Carr's logic, he claims the coalition government is not giving enough money to New South Wales and he has conveniently ignored the fact that the Corowa bridge on the New South Wales-Victorian border is getting $12 million and that there is funding for the Opera House of $32 million and other money for the cathedral refurbishments and other projects.
Mr Carr ignores, in relation to the Federation Fund, that it is up to state governments to develop and to submit proposals for funding of major projects that would have the support of all Australians. Bob Carr has to 
 find his own way to clean up the mess that he allowed to be created at East Circular Quay.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>East Circular Quay development</title>,Adjournment,52,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-26," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 6 April 1998:

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-05-26,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) Yes.
(2) Yes. The Government is aware of the environmental sensitivity of Jandakot Airport, including the areas of significant native flora and the significance of the Jandakot water mound.
(3) Yes, Soils Ain't Soils has a major interest in Jandakot Airport Holdings. However, under the proposed lease for the Airport the Commonwealth retains all rights to all mineral deposits. This point has been acknowledged by Jandakot Airport Holdings.
(4) Yes, in discussions with all Jandakot Airport bidders, advice was provided that under the lease agreement the Commonwealth will continue to retain rights to all mineral deposits.
(5) The Department of Transport and Regional Development will be undertaking detailed discussions on the regulatory requirements with all Phase 2 airport lessees in the transition period, prior to completion of the sale process by June 1998.
(6) Yes. The Commonwealth undertook probity checks of all bidders as part of the bid assessment. Post-lease the airport will operate under very stringent environmental and planning controls. On the day of transfer to the new owners the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 will cease to have jurisdiction over the operation of Jandakot airport and the Commonwealth Airports Act 1996 (the Act) and associated Airports (Environment Protec 
 tion) Regulations (the regulations) will come into effect.
The Commonwealth will retain regulatory control over land use planning, environment and building control at Jandakot airport through both the Act and the regulations. The Act and regulations provide a comprehensive and holistic environmental management regime in relation to air, water and land pollution, indigenous and heritage sites management and noise emissions.
An integral component of the environmental protection regime at Jandakot airport is the require ment for new Airport Lessee Companies to develop and implement environment strategies. These must be in place within 12 months of a new airport operator taking over a leased Federal airport, and cover a five year period.
Part 6 of the Act, and part 3 of the regulations set out the requirements of Airport Lessee Companies in relation to their environment strategies. In their environment strategy the Airport Lessee Company must identify objectives for environmental management of the airport, areas which are environmentally significant and possible sources of environmental impacts. In addition, the Airport Lessee Company is required to address any relevant recommendation of a body established in the State in which the airport is located, having responsibilities in relation to conservation of biota, habitat, heritage or kindred matters. Further, the strategy must be available for public comment for a period of 90 days prior to submission to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. The Airport Lessee Company must document and address in its strategy comments received through this process.
The regulations also implement a monitoring regime at the airport which promotes prevention of water pollution on the airport site. The regulations identify the forms pollution might take, acceptable standards and imposes a duty of care on all operators at the airport to prevent pollution as far as is reasonable and practicable. To monitor this duty, and if required enforce the regulations, the Department of Transport and Regional Development will appoint an Airport Environment Officer at Jandakot who will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of environmental controls.
(7) Yes. As previously outlined post-lease the airport will operate under the most rigorous and stringent environmental regime ever put in place at Australia's airports. The Commonwealth will retain regulatory control over land use planning, environment and building control at Jandakot airport through the Airports Act 1996 and the Airport (Environment Protection) Regulations. The Act and regulations provide a comprehensive and holistic environmental management regime in relation to 
 air, water and land pollution, indigenous and heritage sites management and noise emissions.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Jandakot Airport</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,54,1,answer
