"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-02-04,"—by leave—I wish to make a short statement in reference to the Senate return to order motion from Senator Joyce for the production of the final report on Australia’s future tax system. The return to order specified that the production of the final report of the Australia’s Future Tax System Review Panel be no later than 9.30 am today. The return to order relates to the independent tax review. The government is currently examining the report of the independent tax review and, as we have previously indicated, we will release it at a later stage in early 2010 after due consideration and with an initial response.
The independent tax review panel received over 1,500 written submissions, over 4,700 letters, held public ‘town hall’ meetings and a tax conference, and had many discussions with various stakeholder groups. As the Liberal-National Party opposition are very aware from their time in government, a report of this size and magnitude requires extensive consideration and releasing the review without an initial government response would only serve to unnecessarily cause public uncertainty.

It is of course no surprise that the opposition are playing what is a political game—this time in the Senate—with something as important as tax reform. The government has always said it will release the independent tax review in early 2010, and that is what we will do. The government has only had the report of the independent tax review for six weeks, and that includes the Christmas and New Year period. We also note that the Liberal-National parties refused to release a report they received in 2008 on a comprehensive examination of Australia’s tax system, commonly known, I think, as the Ergas review. So, at the same time as demanding the government release its important review, they refused to do the same.
As an aside, and to provide some useful information to the opposition shadow finance minister, who has complained he wanted immediate access to the independent tax review report so that he can ‘better understand the future revenue of the Commonwealth’, or words to that effect, for Senator Joyce’s benefit I have here copies of two important documents, the 2009-10 Budget Paper No. 2 and the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which set out the forward estimates of Commonwealth revenue, which would be of assistance to the senator. These are the base documents for government economic data, particularly revenue in this case, which is of importance to Senator Joyce. They have the most comprehensive, up-to-date and detailed information, and these are the documents on which, certainly to my direct knowledge, all oppositions have at least based the initial workings for the calculation of government revenue going forward.
In conclusion, I inform the Senate the government will not release the final report of the independent tax review panel at this stage.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA’S FUTURE TAX SYSTEM REVIEW PANEL</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-04,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
We have asked, and rightly asked, for the tabling of the document that shows to the Australian people the revenue capacity of our nation and that was delivered to the government before Christmas. I thank the senator for offering us the MYEFO documents, which we already have, and the budget papers, which we have spent an inordinate amount of time going over in estimates, but this is yet another stunt. What we want, what is required, what is only right to be asked for, is the tabling of the Henry tax review. The document is there. They have it. We need it. And they cannot carry any plausibility whatsoever in arguments about costings or in arguments about finding over $3.2 billion when they hold back the premier document for the revenue structure of this nation into the future.
What is it about the Henry tax review that they are hiding from the public? What is it about this document that has now gone into that nebulous position of ‘we’ll release it at some time in the future’? Is this another part of the Labor Party’s
Intergenerational report, so we will see it around 2050? We need that document, and until the Labor Party can table that document they do not hold any credibility whatsoever in being able to define the revenue structure of this nation and, by reason of that, to give us a position to start determining the costs.
This is all part of the Labor Party’s trajectory, the insanity, as they walk towards the largest debt—well, they are at the largest debt this nation has ever had. By reason of that debt, they are putting pressure for the future on all sections of expenditure. They have to acknowledge that as they walk forward past $120 billion, and on and on and on it goes. We hear Mr Swan talking about $315 billion peak debt. Now we hear a number of $256 billion peak debt. But they will not provide the document or say how we are going to finance it. Unless we understand where the money comes from and how we are going to finance it, then the debt is out of control. But I think that is the issue: the debt is out of control.
This government has got to be decisive. They lack decisiveness. They lack clarity. They lack transparency. And now they are sitting on the Henry tax review. Why? Is it unsavoury? What is in it? How can they come into this parliament in an election year and sit on the main document we have to deal with the major economic problem that this government has brought about, which is the debt of this nation. We have in excess of $1.4 trillion in expenses in the next four years.
—Trillion, billion, million—what is it?
—It is not a case of what is it. It is a case, Senator, of where is it. Where is the Henry tax review? Why don’t you have the capacity to be transparent and open and table the document? Why are you hiding it? Where is it? Is it in the top shelf of Mr Swan’s desk? Whereabouts have you put it? Why can’t you be decisive and tell us when you are going to table it? Why do you lack the capacity to be decisive in the financial affairs of this nation? It is not as if you do not have the information. All you have to do is walk to Mr Swan’s office, pick it up and bring it in. It is as simple as that. But you do not want to do that—no, this is too complicated. So we have to sit back here, while there is this veil of competence that you are in some way in control of where this nation is going, when the debt of this nation is just blowing out of the water and when you make statements asking, ‘How will you find $3.2 billion?’
Well, I put it back to you: how are you going to find the interest expense on your debt? If you are worried about $3.2 billion, then there are a lot of things out there that we should be concerned about. There are a lot of things that this nation is going to have a problem with if you, by your own statements, say that that is a problem. That makes Australians very concerned. The juxtaposition that you have the gall to talk about $3.2 billion of the coalition’s costings on our environmental policy—
—It’s a con job!
—but you spend $3.2 billion on ceiling insulation.
—It’s the biggest con job, an absolute con job!
—Order! Senator Cameron! Senator Joyce, continue.
—I will take the interjection from Senator Cameron. He talked about a con job. I will tell you what a con job is. A con job is sitting on the Henry tax review, it is not being transparent to the Australian people, it is hiding behind the numbers, it is not being upfront and telling Australians exactly where we are. It is the Labor Party that just does not have the capacity to be honest and open and transparent. It is the Labor Party that received this document—
—You’re the biggest con job!
—Order! Senator Cameron!
—Are you going to toss him out?
—Senator Joyce, continue.
—We are asking for something that has obviously been paid for by the Australian taxpayer. I think the Australian taxpayer has a right to say because they financed this document: ‘If you have this document that is vital for determining the finances of the nation, in this election year why don’t you table it? Why don’t you be upfront, honest and decisive?’
—You won’t last long.
—Your only mechanism for trying to abscond from the process of transparency is to send—
—The Libs will get you. You won’t last long.
—Senator Doug Cameron into the chamber to start carrying on like what you hear. Speaking there, people of Australia, is the financial brains of the Labor Party. Senator Doug Cameron is a great representation of the financial acumen of the Australian Labor Party. That is why we get so concerned about their lack of capacity to be decisive and their lack of capacity to be transparent. We are concerned about the arrogance they now have. They get a document that has been publicly paid for and they sit on it. They go forward with grand statements of fiscal prudence yet they do not have the capacity to table the premier document.
This is the same Labor Party that said they were fiscally conservative. What an absolute joke. They say there is a problem finding $3.2 billion. I put to you: how are you going to pay off the $120 billion worth of debt you have now? How are you going to finance that? Where is that going to come from? If you have a problem with $3.2 billion, what are you going to do with an interest bill somewhere between $6 billion and $8 billion now? How are you going to finance that? If $3.2 billion is a problem, why on earth did you spend $3.2 billion on ceiling insulation?
This is the financial acumen of a party that is taking us to Hades in a basket because they just do not have the capacity to manage the numbers. This is the party that went to the Australian people will all the marvellous rhetorical statements, the guile, the cunning and the smoothness, but they just do not have the capacity to deliver. They cannot deliver the outcome; they cannot deliver the document; they cannot table the Henry tax review. They just do not have financial management in their DNA. Now we are seeing them.
What we have here is a clear expose that the finances of this nation are out of control. The finances of this nation are out of control and the Labor Party have not got a clue how they are going to pay back the debt. They are sitting on the Henry tax review trying to work out how the numbers all stick together, but they have not got a clue. It is panic stations in the Labor Party and they will not table the review. It has been delivered by the head of Treasury; it has been delivered by Dr Henry. Don’t they think he is competent? Don’t they think he was up to the job? What are they hiding? I think he is an immensely competent person. Why don’t you table the review? What are you trying to hide? What is the problem? What are you trying to hide?
What are we going to get instead of the Henry tax review? Senator Doug Cameron. There is the epistle of economic clarity—Senator Doug Cameron. That is what we get in place of the Henry tax review. We can listen to Senator Doug Cameron any day of the week if we turn on the radio.
—How about some more gaffes? How about some more goofs? How about some more gibberish?
—Order! Senator Doug Cameron!
—You can hear him out the back barking like a rabid dog. So the metaphor of Labor Party management is Senator Doug Cameron. The Labor Party refuses to table the premier document on the revenue-raising capacity of this nation. The Labor Party refuses to engage in a proper, open and transparent debate about how we finance their massive debt. The Labor Party are hiding behind the fact that the finances of this nation are out of control. The Labor Party do not know how to finance $3.2 billion so you have no hope of financing your $120 billion of debt you have currently got. We heard Mr Swan, the Treasurer, last year talking about $315 billion peak debt. If you cannot manage $3.2 billion of debt how are you going to manage $315 billion? How are you going to do that?
Everything about the Labor Party is starting to mean we have absolutely no confidence in their deliveries and their projections. When it suits them or when they are scared of the truth they sit on the documents. These are the people who wanted transparency. These are the people who said they would be fiscally conservative. This is the management team that was going to deliver those outcomes. Before Christmas a document was handed to them yet they are still sitting on it. Did they give us a decisive answer? They love the rhetoric of ‘decisive’. I have a very simple question: when are you going to table the document? You know what you get? Like the answer to all of the economic questions: ‘Sometime in the future. Somewhere out there it will be tabled.’ That is just not good enough.
Senator Sherry and Mr Swan must do the right thing by the Australian people. They must be transparent and open. It is no good to say you are decisive when you are not. It is no good to say you are fiscally conservative when you are not. It is no good to say you are open and transparent when you are not. Unless you decide to table this document, that is the metaphor of your management. That is what the Australian people think.
You have no credibility, zero credibility, in any discussions about finances, budgets or the aspiration to reduce your massive debt because you do not even have the capacity to table a document that you have in your possession. The reason you do not table it is that you cannot make the numbers add up. The numbers just do not stack up. For the Australian people that is a massive concern, because as your debt marches ahead, getting bigger and bigger and bigger, you put pressure on all expenditure and on all aspects of budgetary appropriations into the future. You are doing that. This debt will start to manage our nation. You are not managing the debt; the debt is starting to manage our nation and you have brought that about. It is totally your responsibility. Unless we see the document, you have zero credibility, you are not transparent, you are not decisive and your economic management is a complete and utter farce.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA’S FUTURE TAX SYSTEM REVIEW PANEL</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-02-04,"—Just briefly, I remind the Senate that the Greens supported the opposition motion to have the Henry tax review tabled in the Senate. The minister, Senator Sherry, has said that the government has had this for six weeks now. There is no doubt that it was commissioned by the government, but that was on behalf of the people of Australia. Our job in the Senate is to ensure that government is not simply held by the executive. If you are going to discuss governance of the country you have to have the information upon which you base that discussion. As far as we are concerned, the Henry tax review is the property of the Australian people and should be available for analysis. If the government wants to take time to respond to the tax review—and I think that is in order—it simply has to say that. But the review should be available. For the minister to say, ‘Sometime in the early part of this year,’ without naming a date is totally unsatisfactory.
What we are seeing is a serial leaking of the contents, and presumably the recommendations, of the tax review by a government which is very closely managing the release of that information and is using it as a political mechanism for its own advantage, against the interests of the wider Australian populace. What the minister did not do was give the Senate any cogent reason at all for withholding this document—no reason whatsoever. The document should be available to the Senate. I take it as a great affront to the Senate that the government has said it is going to thumb its nose at a resolution of this Senate calling on that document to be tabled. The fact is that the government can sit on the document, but in doing so it is thumbing its nose not just at this Senate but at the Australian people. Sure, it is information control and management for political purposes, but I submit that it does the government no good. It is an affront to the Senate and the government is thumbing its nose at the Australian people. The government should reconsider this decision to ignore a resolution of the Senate and should produce the document.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-02-04,"—The Greens are seeking that these private health insurance bills not be put together because we have separate positions on each of the bills and we do not think it is therefore appropriate that the bills be taken together. We want the ability to be able to comment and vote on these bills separately because they are dealing with two separate issues. One is about means testing the rebate, which the Greens have been very clear about supporting; the other is about the increase to the Medicare surcharge levy, which the Greens have a different opinion on and would like to discuss separately. By putting these bills together, the government forces the debate to be taken together. I can see what they are trying to do; however, the Greens believe differently. We would like to be able to comment and potentially vote on the bills differently. We have made no bones about the fact—and I said this last time in the chamber—that we support the concept of means testing the rebate. We have a different opinion on the surcharge and we would like to be able to comment and vote on that differently. Rather than cause confusion during the committee process by debating these bills together, it would be better to deal with them separately. We are seeking to split the bills so that they can be dealt with separately.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-02-04,"—I understand the process. The Greens are seeking to split the bills and deal with them separately. I do not believe that that would then alter the way you would deal with it in committee, quite frankly. We would be able to deal with them. As we deal with all bills, we deal with them in seriatim and the Committee of the Whole process is designed to ensure that the questions are put separately in relation to amendments to each particular bill. So I think you would achieve the same objective. In dealing with them separately, it means that you would have three second reading debates and you would then extend the period because people could then choose to speak on each individual bill. You would then have three separate committees of the whole. It would take a significant time. The government does object to that. Where bills are related bills they can be dealt with concurrently and it is a more sensible process, in the government’s view, to deal with them in that way. You are now seeking to use up more of the time of the Senate—and we all know that the time of the Senate is precious to deal with the legislative program which we have before us.

Given the government’s concerns about having three separate committee stages and also the concerns of the Greens that there be a separate vote—given that they have, as I understand it, a different position in relation to one of the bills—is it possible under the standing orders for there to be a Committee of the Whole in respect of all the bills but then for there to be a separate vote with respect to the bills that are the subject of the Greens’ concerns?
—Senator Xenophon, it is a matter for the committee to determine how to handle them. They can determine that they are going to handle them together or individually. That is not a matter for me to determine from the chair. Senator Xenophon, you will need leave now.
—I seek leave to make a short statement.

—Thank you for your guidance, Mr President. Can you confirm whether, at the third reading stage, it is possible for there to be a separate vote on the various bills?

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-04,"—Mr President, to me the argument seems quite academic. If some senators—indeed the Greens and agreed to by us—want to deal with the bills separately, I do not see what the argument is about having the committee stage together. In any case, the committee stage will deal with each bill separately and, if there are amendments to each individual bill, they will be dealt with one after the other rather than all together. So I do not see that there is any problem with dealing with the whole three bills quite separately but one after the other.

The speech read as follows—
The
Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2009 [No. 2]
will amend various acts to give effect to the recent budget measure to introduce three new private health insurance incentives tiers.
The new arrangements will commence on the later of 1 July 2010; or the day on which the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Act 2009 receives royal assent; or the day on which the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 2009 receives royal assent. However, they will not commence at all unless both the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Act 2009 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 2009 also receive royal assent.
This Bill was previously introduced into the House of Representatives on 27 May, 2009 where it was passed on 2 June, 2009. This Bill was previously introduced into the Senate on 15 June 2009. On 9 September 2009 a motion moved in the Senate that this Bill be read a second time was defeated. This Bill is being reintroduced into the House of Representatives to make the private health insurance rebate fairer.
The government supports a mixed model of balanced private and public health services. The government is also committed to a sustainable private health system, and to ensure it remains sustainable, the government will rebalance support for private health insurance to provide a fairer distribution of benefits.
The new arrangements will make the private health rebate fairer. Firstly, singles earning $75,000 or less and couples and families earning $150,000 or less will received the same rebate as they currently enjoy and will not be adversely affected. Currently, however, approximately 14 per cent of single taxpayers who have incomes above $75,000 receive about 28 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles—or twice their population share. Under the government’s reforms, these singles will receive about 12 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles.
Similarly, approximately 12 per cent of couple taxpayers who have incomes above $150,000 receive about 21 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples—almost twice their population share. Under the government’s reforms, these couples will receive about nine per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples.
These reforms will bring government support for private health insurance in line with the principle underpinning the Australian tax-transfer system—that the largest benefits are provided to those on lower incomes.
Spending on the current private health insurance rebate is growing rapidly and is expected to double as a proportion of health expenditure within the next 40 years.
Clearly this presents challenges in this fiscal environment. These reforms will result in a saving to government expenditure of $2.0 billion over four years, which will help ensure that government support for private health insurance remains fair and sustainable.
From 1 July 2010 the government proposes to introduce three new private health insurance incentive tiers. The tiers will mean high-income earners receive less government payments for private health insurance but will face an increase in costs if they opt out of private health cover.
The government’s commitment to retaining the private health insurance rebate remains. Rebates for low- and middle-income earners will be unchanged with the government continuing to pay 30 per cent of the premium cost for a person earning $75,000 or less and couples and families earning $150,000 or less. The existing higher rebates for older Australians will remain in place for people earning below these thresholds: 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 years and 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over.
These people will continue to have no surcharge liability if they decide not to take out appropriate private health insurance.
The new tiered system will be introduced for higher income earners and will set three different rebate levels and surcharge levels based on income and age. The purpose of this is to reduce the carrot but increase the stick and ensure those who can afford to contribute more for their health insurance do so. The government does not believe it is appropriate for low-income earners to subsidise the private health insurance of high-income earners.
The first incentive tier will apply to singles with an income of more than $75,000 and couples and families with an income of more than $150,000. For these people the private health insurance rebate will be 20 per cent for those up to 65 years, 25 per cent for those aged 65-69, and 30 per cent for those aged 70 and over.
The Medicare levy surcharge for people in this tier who do not hold appropriate private health insurance will remain at one per cent.
Tier 2 applies to singles earning more than $90,000 and couples and families earning more than $180,000. The rebate will be 10 per cent for those up to 65 years, 15 per cent for those aged 65 to 69, and 20 per cent for those aged 70 and over. The surcharge for people in this tier who do not have appropriate private health insurance will be increased to 1.25 per cent of income.
Tier 3 affects singles earning more than $120,000 and couples and families earning more than $240,000 a year. No private health insurance rebate will be provided for people who fall within the third tier and the surcharge for avoiding private health insurance will be increased to 1.5 per cent of income for these people.
Annual indexation to average weekly earnings of the tiers will ensure that these changes remain equitable and can be maintained into the future.
The increased surcharge for people on higher incomes will help ensure that about 99.7 per cent of insured people remain in private health insurance. This is because those high-income earners who receive a lower rebate will face a higher tax penalty for avoiding private health insurance.
By retaining this system of carrots and sticks the reforms are unlikely to affect private health insurance premiums.
It is estimated that approximately 25,000 people may no longer be covered by private health insurance hospital cover, and that it might therefore result in 8,000 additional public hospital admissions over two years. When considered against the fact that public hospitals have around 4.7 million admissions per year, the impact of the measure will be insignificant. And the measure will be particularly insignificant for public hospitals given the government’s investment under the new $64 billion COAG agreement, where hospitals receive 50 per cent over and above the old Australian healthcare agreements negotiated by the previous government.
Further, the historic $872 million investment in preventative health will assist in keeping people out of hospitals in the first place.
In summary, this measure will make private health fairer and more balanced, more sustainable into the long term, and by maintaining a carefully designed system of carrots and sticks, have a negligible effect on both premiums and the public hospital system.
At the same time, low- and middle income earners who chose to have private health insurance will continue to enjoy the benefit of a significant government rebate.

Natural resources management and conservation challenges, together with the

record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report
Natural resource management and conservation are of great significance to a number of people across the country. We have a history of around three decades of Commonwealth investment in resource management. Firstly, I thank the secretariat for the work that they did in preparing the report. It was quite a lengthy period of inquiry and their attention to detail in working with the committee was very much appreciated. Also, I thank my colleagues. There was a very collective effort on this inquiry, as there is on many of our inquiries. I particularly want to acknowledge the expertise of Senator Ian Macdonald in this area and the contribution he made during the inquiry.
We looked at a range of areas. The terms of reference were rather lengthy, but we particularly looked at the history of Commonwealth involvement in the natural resource management area and the capacity of regional NRM groups and other organisations and networks to deliver the natural resource management outcomes they were trying to. We looked very closely at whether the Caring for our Country program was a comprehensive approach to meeting future NRM needs. The committee believed it fell well short in meeting those future NRM needs.
The Caring for our Country program has been described as aiming to ‘move to achieve an environment that is healthy, well managed and resilient’. The committee’s opinion is that falls well short in achieving those aims. The transition period to Caring for our Country really was a very anxious time for all involved in trying to work for better outcomes for natural resource management. It came through very clearly that there was a real struggle between trying to maintain the physical and human resources that had been built up over time in working in this area and trying to gain the financial resources to sustain them into the future. That created some real angst, because we are talking about people who cared very deeply about what they were doing in trying to reach these natural resource management outcomes. They felt that that transition period was not managed in an optimum way.
They worked very hard. It came through clearly that there had been a lot of hard-won gains out in the community in working with other groups and networks. They really believed that a lot of those project outcomes were going to be put at risk because of the disruption in the changeover to the program and the way the program itself was being managed. One real concern was around the business plan for Caring for our Country. Initially there was a delay in the release of the business plan itself. The program commenced on 1 July 2008 and the plan was not released until the end of November 2008. This created some real difficulties for people who were trying to put together those projects but did not have any kind of plan to work to. That created some real issues for them. Also, the priorities and targets that had been identified in the business plan had been developed in isolation, mostly with Commonwealth agencies. There was a feeling that those stakeholders who really had that practical, on-the-ground understanding of the best way strategically to make this work had not been consulted. There was a feeling that there had been a lack of a strategic approach and a lack of synergy between Commonwealth, state and regional bodies throughout all of this and that that had prevented an integrated landscape management approach.
There were nine recommendations in the end. We obviously felt that a more rigorous and comprehensive approach was important to make sure national priorities were identified that were going to be optimal in terms of Caring for our Country. There were a range of other recommendations that the committee believed would improve the management of these programs and ultimately lead to better delivery of natural resource management in the future. I will end with those brief comments. I know that my colleagues from the committee want to make some statements around this. I again thank the secretariat and my colleagues on the committee for the work that went into the inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-02-04,"—The Greens moved to refer national resource management and conservation to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport because we felt it was so important that Australia had a proud legacy of funding to the National Soil Conservation program, the Landcare program, the Natural Heritage Trusts 1 and 2 and various smaller funding systems under that. We have developed a very proud tradition of land care. In fact, there are 56 regional natural resource management organisations around the country, in various states and under different management regimes.
We were very concerned about what we started to hear from the bush, in particular about the Caring for our Country program. Unfortunately, through the inquiry, those concerns were validated. I hold very deep concerns for the future of natural resource management in this country if Caring for our Country continues without substantive review and amendment. There were many problems raised with us during our inquiry—which took longer than was initially anticipated because we kept getting more feedback and because some of the implications of Caring for our Country did not become manifest until further into the process, particularly after the first transition year. Regional organisations around the country are starting to feel the impact of reduced funding. Their funding has been very significantly reduced. Although the government persists in saying that 60 per cent of historical funding is going to regional organisations, it is not going to each regional organisation. In fact, that funding is going as a piece of pie to the regional organisations, and some regional organisations have taken massive funding cuts. There has been a massive loss of staff and, therefore, expertise and capacity from natural resource management organisations in the bush because they have not had the funding to keep the staff on. So we have seen a draining of that expertise. Those staff not only are important for those regional organisations but also provide capacity that we might not get back.
I have been travelling around the country, separate from the committee process, speaking to a wide range of natural resource management organisations. They are deeply concerned. They talk to me about the loss of staff, the loss of projects and, most importantly, the loss of volunteers, including long-term volunteers. People I have personally known in natural resource management for nearly 25 years are dropping out. That is a tragedy for natural resource management in this country. People who have worked on land care, water protection and water quality issues are giving up because they feel there is a lack of support and a lack of funding. These people, who have been expert at cobbling together grants and various funding sources for decades, have now said, ‘That’s it; I’ve had enough.’
We have also heard of trouble with the regional organisations. The traditional partners—groups that have worked together with agribusiness and with state, local and federal governments—are now finding themselves in competition. Instead of being partners in projects, they are now finding themselves in competition. So we have people competing for funds. In the past, we had groups cooperating to put in a joint funding application to get funding. But now they have to compete. So now they do not feel that they can talk to each other because the people they might be talking to may be competing for funds. Also, they cannot be involved as much in the consultation process, in the development of a business plan and in the development of targets because they may be applicants in the future and it will be claimed that they have a conflict of interest. That is a problem because the message from the ground is not getting through to the target centres or the people determining the business plan. So there is a very strong disconnect between the national targets for this program and the targets, programs and strategic plans of local and, importantly, regional natural resource management organisations.
In my home state of Western Australia the Northern Agricultural Natural Resource Management Group found it could apply for very little under Caring for our Country priorities. The essential priority in their region, salinity, is not a national priority. Salinity is still a priority in WA, despite the fact that the Commonwealth does not agree that it is a national priority. There is also the issue of wind erosion. They have a whole range of priorities that are not listed in the national targets, so they are unable to commit resources to those issues. That is a very significant fault in Caring for our Country.
One of the big issues is that the pie is being stretched further and further. The government committed the same amount of funding as was committed under NHT2. However, they made a series of election commitments that they squeezed into that pie, that they squeezed into that bucket of funding. In other words, it is being spread thinly. The term we used to use in natural resource management circles was that it was being ‘spread like vegemite’ over the landscape. What we are going back to is spreading like vegemite over the landscape a limited amount of funding so that the Commonwealth can feel good about doing stuff that does not actually achieve outcomes on the ground.
We also heard concerns around the application process. It is complex and lengthy. Thousands of hours are spent by voluntary organisations and volunteers generating applications that simply do not get funded, because there are thousands of applications for a very limited bucket of funding. So all those thousands of hours are for nought. So we need to change the application process and perhaps go to an initial expression of interest for those projects. People were very strongly concerned about the assessment process, saying that it lacks transparency and accountability. In general we have actually been able to find no rhyme or reason for some of the decisions that were made. The government said that they had to change the NHT2 process because of the Auditor-General’s report. They are seriously misusing, in my opinion, the Auditor-General’s report to justify going to a very centralised top-down approach that in itself lacks transparency and accountability.
The federal government and the department said that when organisations ask they give them a bit of a rundown on why their application was not successful. When you then ask regional organisations they say, ‘We got very little feedback. We did not get meaningful feedback. We do not understand why our application was not successful other than being told that we do not meet the targets.’ And, as I mentioned earlier, those targets are not able to be translated to the local and regional level. Again, this disempowers groups and undermines essential work.
What we are failing to do here is appreciate that unless we can get these people supported, unless we provide essential funding to those regional organisations and empower the community and regional organisations, we are never going to address the huge land degradation, the landscape repair job that we have to do. It is absolutely essential that we work with the community; otherwise, we will fail. The money that has been invested, the billions of dollars that this country very rightly has invested in natural resource management and biodiversity protection, will be lost because Caring for our Country does not build on that work—it undermines that work.
I am the first to say that NHT1 and 2 were not perfect. I do not even think that the coalition argues that they were perfect. But each time one of those programs was developed we learnt from the lessons of the past. We learnt that we need to work in better cooperation. We learnt that we needed to have integrated projects. We learnt that we needed to be working at the landscape scale. This new program, Caring for our Country, has thrown those lessons out. It is undermining regional organisations.
Again, no-one says that the regional organisations were operating perfectly in the past. I am probably one of the first ones to be critical of some of their operations and to think that they needed improvement. But here they are throwing the baby out with the bath water, undermining the regional organisations that we have invested millions of dollars in and have been supporting. We have spent money training staff and building up their expertise and it has all been thrown to the wind. That expertise is slowly draining out of the regional communities and we are desperately afraid that we are never going to get it back unless this government acts pronto to review Caring for our Country, putting more funding into it to better deliver those resources on the ground, to better work with the community, to change the evaluation process for the next round, to better consult with the community and take on board what they say.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-04,"—In addressing the tabling of this report on natural resource management and conservation, I agree entirely with the submissions made by both the chair and the deputy chair of the Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee before me in this debate today. Before I get onto the substantive part of the report, I congratulate the chair on the work she did with this committee and this inquiry. Senator Nash only came into the chairmanship of the group halfway through. Also, I might say, I congratulate the previous chairman—I think it was Senator Sterle—who operated the committee very well and ably. Senator Nash came in halfway through and picked up the idea of the inquiry very quickly and made a significant contribution not only to the report but also to natural resource management in Australia by her action on the committee. I also congratulate the deputy chairman, Senator Siewert, who has just spoken, and particularly thank the staff who were assiduous, as always, as we have perhaps come to expect. They were very professional in the way they assisted the committee in its hearings and in reaching the conclusions that the committee has made.
Senator Siewert is right: this whole natural resource management issue has had a long gestation period. It was an initiative of the coalition government in the Natural Heritage Trust program, which we initiated when we first came to government. NHT1, as it was eventually known, set the scene and went in the right direction, but it was not perfect. We then became involved in what was known as NHT2, where we did focus natural resource management on community groups who had a direct connection with the landscape and with the particular environment in their region. We recognised that in a country like Australia one size does not fit all. We realised that, if natural resource management was to be effective in Australia, it really needed to be a grassroots, ground up sort of approach to the management of our natural resources. I was one of the two ministers responsible for NHT2 and I remember we had many arguments and many discussions with the Public Service and the people involved. We eventually came to the approach that was adopted by NHT2. Then there was a long gestation period in getting business plans and investment plans.

At that time, I acknowledge, we did lose some expertise that had been in the NRM management area. But I think we eventually got it right and, whilst nothing is ever perfect, it was going pretty well. It was entirely a catchment based program where money was given to, in most instances, community based resource management groups who knew and understood what needed to be done and could coordinate all the various environmental and landscape groups and people wanting to assist in their particular catchment. It was really working quite well. Regrettably, politics then intervened. The new government came into power and thought we should have change for change’s sake. They adopted an ANAO report, saying ANAO had concerns about the operations of the NHT2 arrangement. If you looked at the ANAO report, sure, there were two or three instances where they raised some problems. But principally, as I read that report, they were indicating that the department needed to pull up its socks, not that the whole program needed to be changed.
Politics being what it is, the new government came in and did not like to pursue successful programs of the previous government. So they changed the name and changed the words and, at the same time, gathered back a bit of money so they could spend it on other promises the Labor Party had made when in opposition. So what we had was that Caring for our Country came into operation with great fanfare but, when you dug down beneath the spin and the hoo-ha, you found that there was actually less money going to natural resource management in our country. Other things that had been promised by the Labor Party were added into the Caring for our Country program, but what that did was diminish the money available for the NRM work.
Throughout this inquiry it became clear from talking to people who actually knew what they were talking about that the government through Mr Garrett had adopted this ‘we know best in Canberra’ approach. It became very much a top-down approach, which they disguised under the name ‘national priorities’. It was the minister and bureaucrats in Canberra telling everyone else in Australia what they needed to be doing. Senator Siewert is quite right in what she has said—there was an enormous amount of expertise that had built up around the country, and that expertise is now being put at risk as the money is now uncertain and people who can make a real difference are moving on because of fears for their own financial future. It is not only that; the whole process has had to be started again. I do not think the Labor Party or the bureaucracy intended the consequences of their change of direction. I think they were intending it to continue in a useful way, but what has occurred is enormous disruption to the contributions that have been made by thousands of committed individuals right around our country, many of them volunteers.
I urge the government to swallow their political pride and go back to a bottom-up approach to natural resource management, rather than the top-down approach that they have adopted. The committee heard concerns from many witnesses about the cost of applying for programs, the lack of feedback, the uncertainty and the fact that groups were now competing with each other whereas in the past they had cooperated, and almost cohabitated, to get a good result for the landscape, the biodiversity and ecology of a particular catchment.
My interest in natural resource management has been around for a long time, since before I was one of the ministers involved. I want to pay tribute to all of those thousands and thousands of people who believe in what they are doing, who know what they are doing in their own area and who have a real commitment to Australia and its landscape. In Queensland I have formed very good friendships with a lot of people in the natural resource management area. I will mention a few up my way in the north: the Northern Gulf NRM and their CEO, Noelene Goss, who has been a great advocate for the environment, the Terrain NRM in Far North Queensland, the Burdekin Dry Tropics NRM and the Whitsunday group. In Queensland they have a collective of NRM bodies which is very professional and does a fantastic job of promoting the environment and resource management. That has been duplicated right across Australia. In commending this report to the Senate and urging the government to carefully consider the recommendations and to act upon them, I want to pay tribute to all those thousands of people around Australia who make a genuine commitment to the future of our great country. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

People who have worked on land care, water protection and water quality issues are giving up because they feel there is a lack of support and a lack of funding. These people, who have been expert at cobbling together grants and various funding sources for decades, have now said, ‘That’s it; I’ve had enough.’
We have also heard of trouble with the regional organisations. The traditional partners—groups that have worked together with agribusiness and with state, local and federal governments—are now finding themselves in competition. Instead of being partners in projects, they are now finding themselves in competition. So we have people competing for funds. In the past, we had groups cooperating to put in a joint funding application to get funding. But now they have to compete. So now they do not feel that they can talk to each other because the people they might be talking to may be competing for funds. Also, they cannot be involved as much in the consultation process, in the development of a business plan and in the development of targets because they may be applicants in the future and it will be claimed that they have a conflict of interest. That is a problem because the message from the ground is not getting through to the target centres or the people determining the business plan. So there is a very strong disconnect between the national targets for this program and the targets, programs and strategic plans of local and, importantly, regional natural resource management organisations.
In my home state of Western Australia the Northern Agricultural Natural Resource Management Group found it could apply for very little under Caring for our Country priorities. The essential priority in their region, salinity, is not a national priority. Salinity is still a priority in WA, despite the fact that the Commonwealth does not agree that it is a national priority. There is also the issue of wind erosion. They have a whole range of priorities that are not listed in the national targets, so they are unable to commit resources to those issues. That is a very significant fault in Caring for our Country.
One of the big issues is that the pie is being stretched further and further. The government committed the same amount of funding as was committed under NHT2. However, they made a series of election commitments that they squeezed into that pie, that they squeezed into that bucket of funding. In other words, it is being spread thinly. The term we used to use in natural resource management circles was that it was being ‘spread like vegemite’ over the landscape. What we are going back to is spreading like vegemite over the landscape a limited amount of funding so that the Commonwealth can feel good about doing stuff that does not actually achieve outcomes on the ground.
We also heard concerns around the application process. It is complex and lengthy. Thousands of hours are spent by voluntary organisations and volunteers generating applications that simply do not get funded, because there are thousands of applications for a very limited bucket of funding. So all those thousands of hours are for nought. So we need to change the application process and perhaps go to an initial expression of interest for those projects. People were very strongly concerned about the assessment process, saying that it lacks transparency and accountability. In general we have actually been able to find no rhyme or reason for some of the decisions that were made. The government said that they had to change the NHT2 process because of the Auditor-General’s report. They are seriously misusing, in my opinion, the Auditor-General’s report to justify going to a very centralised top-down approach that in itself lacks transparency and accountability.
The federal government and the department said that when organisations ask they give them a bit of a rundown on why their application was not successful. When you then ask regional organisations they say, ‘We got very little feedback. We did not get meaningful feedback. We do not understand why our application was not successful other than being told that we do not meet the targets.’ And, as I mentioned earlier, those targets are not able to be translated to the local and regional level. Again, this disempowers groups and undermines essential work.
What we are failing to do here is appreciate that unless we can get these people supported, unless we provide essential funding to those regional organisations and empower the community and regional organisations, we are never going to address the huge land degradation, the landscape repair job that we have to do. It is absolutely essential that we work with the community; otherwise, we will fail. The money that has been invested, the billions of dollars that this country very rightly has invested in natural resource management and biodiversity protection, will be lost because Caring for our Country does not build on that work—it undermines that work.
I am the first to say that NHT1 and 2 were not perfect. I do not even think that the coalition argues that they were perfect. But each time one of those programs was developed we learnt from the lessons of the past. We learnt that we need to work in better cooperation. We learnt that we needed to have integrated projects. We learnt that we needed to be working at the landscape scale. This new program, Caring for our Country, has thrown those lessons out. It is undermining regional organisations.
Again, no-one says that the regional organisations were operating perfectly in the past. I am probably one of the first ones to be critical of some of their operations and to think that they needed improvement. But here they are throwing the baby out with the bath water, undermining the regional organisations that we have invested millions of dollars in and have been supporting. We have spent money training staff and building up their expertise and it has all been thrown to the wind. That expertise is slowly draining out of the regional communities and we are desperately afraid that we are never going to get it back unless this government acts pronto to review Caring for our Country, putting more funding into it to better deliver those resources on the ground, to better work with the community, to change the evaluation process for the next round, to better consult with the community and take on board what they say.

",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,19,2
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-04,"—In addressing the tabling of this report on natural resource management and conservation, I agree entirely with the submissions made by both the chair and the deputy chair of the Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee before me in this debate today. Before I get onto the substantive part of the report, I congratulate the chair on the work she did with this committee and this inquiry. Senator Nash only came into the chairmanship of the group halfway through. Also, I might say, I congratulate the previous chairman—I think it was Senator Sterle—who operated the committee very well and ably. Senator Nash came in halfway through and picked up the idea of the inquiry very quickly and made a significant contribution not only to the report but also to natural resource management in Australia by her action on the committee. I also congratulate the deputy chairman, Senator Siewert, who has just spoken, and particularly thank the staff who were assiduous, as always, as we have perhaps come to expect. They were very professional in the way they assisted the committee in its hearings and in reaching the conclusions that the committee has made.
Senator Siewert is right: this whole natural resource management issue has had a long gestation period. It was an initiative of the coalition government in the Natural Heritage Trust program, which we initiated when we first came to government. NHT1, as it was eventually known, set the scene and went in the right direction, but it was not perfect. We then became involved in what was known as NHT2, where we did focus natural resource management on community groups who had a direct connection with the landscape and with the particular environment in their region. We recognised that in a country like Australia one size does not fit all. We realised that, if natural resource management was to be effective in Australia, it really needed to be a grassroots, ground up sort of approach to the management of our natural resources. I was one of the two ministers responsible for NHT2 and I remember we had many arguments and many discussions with the Public Service and the people involved. We eventually came to the approach that was adopted by NHT2. Then there was a long gestation period in getting business plans and investment plans.

At that time, I acknowledge, we did lose some expertise that had been in the NRM management area. But I think we eventually got it right and, whilst nothing is ever perfect, it was going pretty well. It was entirely a catchment based program where money was given to, in most instances, community based resource management groups who knew and understood what needed to be done and could coordinate all the various environmental and landscape groups and people wanting to assist in their particular catchment. It was really working quite well. Regrettably, politics then intervened. The new government came into power and thought we should have change for change’s sake. They adopted an ANAO report, saying ANAO had concerns about the operations of the NHT2 arrangement. If you looked at the ANAO report, sure, there were two or three instances where they raised some problems. But principally, as I read that report, they were indicating that the department needed to pull up its socks, not that the whole program needed to be changed.
Politics being what it is, the new government came in and did not like to pursue successful programs of the previous government. So they changed the name and changed the words and, at the same time, gathered back a bit of money so they could spend it on other promises the Labor Party had made when in opposition. So what we had was that Caring for our Country came into operation with great fanfare but, when you dug down beneath the spin and the hoo-ha, you found that there was actually less money going to natural resource management in our country. Other things that had been promised by the Labor Party were added into the Caring for our Country program, but what that did was diminish the money available for the NRM work.
Throughout this inquiry it became clear from talking to people who actually knew what they were talking about that the government through Mr Garrett had adopted this ‘we know best in Canberra’ approach. It became very much a top-down approach, which they disguised under the name ‘national priorities’. It was the minister and bureaucrats in Canberra telling everyone else in Australia what they needed to be doing. Senator Siewert is quite right in what she has said—there was an enormous amount of expertise that had built up around the country, and that expertise is now being put at risk as the money is now uncertain and people who can make a real difference are moving on because of fears for their own financial future. It is not only that; the whole process has had to be started again. I do not think the Labor Party or the bureaucracy intended the consequences of their change of direction. I think they were intending it to continue in a useful way, but what has occurred is enormous disruption to the contributions that have been made by thousands of committed individuals right around our country, many of them volunteers.
I urge the government to swallow their political pride and go back to a bottom-up approach to natural resource management, rather than the top-down approach that they have adopted. The committee heard concerns from many witnesses about the cost of applying for programs, the lack of feedback, the uncertainty and the fact that groups were now competing with each other whereas in the past they had cooperated, and almost cohabitated, to get a good result for the landscape, the biodiversity and ecology of a particular catchment.
My interest in natural resource management has been around for a long time, since before I was one of the ministers involved. I want to pay tribute to all of those thousands and thousands of people who believe in what they are doing, who know what they are doing in their own area and who have a real commitment to Australia and its landscape. In Queensland I have formed very good friendships with a lot of people in the natural resource management area. I will mention a few up my way in the north: the Northern Gulf NRM and their CEO, Noelene Goss, who has been a great advocate for the environment, the Terrain NRM in Far North Queensland, the Burdekin Dry Tropics NRM and the Whitsunday group. In Queensland they have a collective of NRM bodies which is very professional and does a fantastic job of promoting the environment and resource management. That has been duplicated right across Australia. In commending this report to the Senate and urging the government to carefully consider the recommendations and to act upon them, I want to pay tribute to all those thousands of people around Australia who make a genuine commitment to the future of our great country. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,19,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-02-04,"—I rise to speak on the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009
and the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2009. These bills are very important and are intended to implement a national response to organised crime. All members of the coalition are acutely aware of the great cost, including the great human cost, that organised crime imposes on society. Our record is a proud one of developing and implementing innovative methods to defeat this national scourge. However, we are also conscious that the measures used to combat organised crime have the potential to sweep up the innocent in their net. Great powers given to our law enforcement authorities, despite our best intentions, are also capable of producing injustice and oppression if the use of those powers is not properly circumscribed and subject to effective oversight. When introducing significant new anticrime measures we as legislators must always weigh up the potential for, and consequences of, the abuse of those measures. The key proposals of the bills are criminal asset confiscation and unexplained wealth.
Schedule 1 amends the Proceeds of Crime Act by introducing unexplained wealth orders for the confiscation processes. This targets wealth that a person cannot demonstrate to have been lawfully acquired. If a court is satisfied that an authorised officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person’s total wealth exceeds the value that has lawfully been acquired, it can compel the person to attend court to prove on the balance of probabilities that the wealth was not derived from offences with a connection to Commonwealth power. If the person fails to meet this onus, the court may order them to pay to the Commonwealth the difference between their total wealth and their legitimate wealth. Restraining orders are available in aid of this order and in advance of such an order—such orders being, by way of analogy, with injunctions available in civil proceedings.
At the time of applying for a restraining order, the DPP need not prove that the property is subject to the person’s effective control but must state the grounds for such a suspicion. If these requirements are met, the restraining order must be made even if there is no risk that the property will be disposed of or otherwise dealt with. It may also apply in relation to property that is not yet in the possession of the suspect. Property may be excluded from the scope of the order if the court is satisfied that it belongs to another person and is not under the suspect’s effective control.
A restraining order will cease to apply if the DPP has not applied for an unexplained wealth order within 28 days or if an unexplained wealth order is refused and avenues of appeal are closed or otherwise disposed of. The bill also provides for time limited asset-freezing orders in aid of the Proceeds of Crime Act—as, again by way of analogy, with civil injunctions. These apply for three days and are directed to accounts held by financial institutions.
Schedule 2 amends the regime applicable to non-conviction based orders. Currently there is a limitation period that precludes confiscation if offences are not detected until more than six years after the offence was committed. The review recommended extension of the limitation period to 12 years, but the bill proposes removing this time limit altogether. Amendments are also proposed to ease the recovery of legal costs by legal aid commissions from restrained assets.
Secondly, the bills deal with controlled operations, assumed identities and witness identity protection. The bills propose amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 in response to the High Court’s decision in Gedeon v the Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission in 2008, which placed in doubt the protection of participants in a controlled operation. A ‘controlled operation’ is one in which undercover law enforcement officers are authorised to do certain things that would otherwise be illegal in order to obtain evidence of a serious offence. The amendments to the assumed identities regime will introduce mutual recognition provisions to permit undercover officers lawfully to obtain identity documents in other jurisdictions. The witness identity protection scheme applicable to undercover officers will enable certificates issued in one jurisdiction to be recognised in other jurisdictions.
Thirdly, the bills cover telecommunications interception and criminal organisations. The bills propose to amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to include in the definition of ‘serious offence’ associating with, contributing to, aiding and conspiring with a criminal organisation or a member of that organisation for the purpose of supporting the commission of prescribed offences. The prescribed offences are the recently introduced state and territory offences commonly known as the bikie laws. Telecommunications interception will be made available to state and territory law enforcement agencies for investigation of these offences.
The provisions of the bills relating to undercover operations and joint commission of offences make relatively technical amendments. However, the provisions relating to unexplained wealth do raise significant civil liberties concerns and have generated substantial criticism. The unexplained wealth provisions are invasive. These bills have been placed under close scrutiny to ensure that adequate safeguards exist and that the arguments in favour of the proposals are properly articulated and justified. I can tell the Senate that the bills were considered by the shadow cabinet no fewer than three times and by the coalition party room on no fewer than three occasions, so concerned were we to ensure that the government got the balance right between effective law enforcement and empowering law enforcement agencies with sufficient apparatus to deal with serious and organised crime in the more sophisticated culture of the early 21st century on the one hand and protecting the citizen from invasive and arbitrary exercises of policing power on the other hand.
The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which delivered its report on 17 September. The evidence to the committee included detailed submissions from the Law Council of Australia and all of the principal Commonwealth law enforcement and prosecution agencies. Significant concerns were expressed in particular about the unexplained wealth provisions by the Law Council, Civil Liberties Australia and members of the committee across party lines. Particular concerns were that an unexplained wealth order was mandatory rather than discretionary, which is in the initial draft of the bill; that the only link to any wrongdoing was an authorised officer’s suspicion that a person’s wealth was linked to a Commonwealth offence, a state offence with a federal aspect or a foreign offence; and that the safeguards against abuse of these powers were very limited.
The committee recommended extensive amendments to the bill. The most important of the committee’s recommendations were as follows. Firstly, a court should have a discretion to refuse to make an unexplained wealth order. In the initial iteration of the bill there was no discretion and, upon the court being satisfied as to certain stated criteria, the making of such an audit was mandatory. Secondly, the grounds upon which an officer suspects that a person’s wealth exceeds his or her lawfully acquired wealth must be specified in any supporting affidavit—a safeguard that was absent from the initial iteration of the bill. Thirdly, in relation to the joint commission of offences, there should be safeguards where an accused person terminated his or her participation and took reasonable steps to prevent the commission of an offence. The government has circulated amendments which purport to give effect to some of these recommendations. However, the coalition does not believe that those amendments are adequate. The sole ground for the exercise of any discretion by a judge to make an unexplained wealth order, as the bill stands at present, is that it is not in the public interest to do so.
Despite the coalition’s heartfelt support for measures designed to combat organised crime and the fact that these measures will undoubtedly assist our law enforcement agencies in that vital task, there is still a real risk that these laws could be open to abuse if not amended. In the course of consultations on the bill, we have had many examples of the great benefit the measures would have in the investigation of the kingpins of organised crime. That is not in dispute. We could hear many more examples and we would agree in each case that unexplained wealth orders would be extremely useful. What we need to hear is what would happen if the innocent were caught up in the process by an overzealous prosecutor. These things can happen. Those of us who have practised law, as I did for many years, have seen them happen. We live in a society where the right to privacy is respected and where ordinary people have the right to live their lives without explaining their lifestyle to the authorities or anyone else, or having their assets frozen or confiscated on nothing more than an officer’s suspicion. This is a society which operates on the rule of law. We on the coalition side will ensure that the rule of law is respected. Organised crime must and will be brought to heel, but it must not be done at the cost of ruining innocent lives.
We are confident that the appropriate balance can be struck. The government amendments are a welcome start. The coalition has further amendments. I am pleased to say that I had a very useful meeting with the Attorney-General, Mr McClelland, and I want to take this opportunity to thank him for his courtesy and the spirit of cooperation with which he dealt with the coalition. The coalition’s amendments, which I foreshadow, are directed to ensuring that the court has a discretion in relation to any unexplained wealth application. This is the single most important safeguard against abuse. In November, in the case of International Finance Trust Company Ltd & Anor v New South Wales Crime Commission & Ors, the High Court struck down the provisions of the New South Wales Criminal Assets Recovery Act, in part because the act provided no discretion in relation to orders similar to those we are considering here. The High Court’s decision in the IFT case illustrates, as well as one could imagine, the importance of ensuring that there are safeguards in this legislation, not merely to protect the rights of the innocent but also to ensure that the legislation is efficacious in its objective of combating serious organised crime. Further amendments will provide for cost orders and undertakings as to damages as a deterrent against bringing ill-founded applications or applications for insufficient reason.
The regime introduced by this bill will be expressly subject to the supervision of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. I understand that the government will not oppose these amendments, and I thank them for taking that course. In addition, I will propose amendments that would permit a court to quarantine assets from the scope of an unexplained wealth order or a restraining order so that the respondents can meet reasonable legal costs of resisting an application. The regime proposed by the government would permit only legal aid representation if an order left insufficient funds to pay for the lawyer of a respondent’s choice. I appreciate that the amendments which I am foreshadowing differ from that regime, which is also applicable to general proceeds of crime matters. However, in the coalition’s view, unexplained wealth applications are very materially different in that no specific crime needs to be alleged. Let me emphasise that point: for a person to be subject to an order under this legislation, no specific crime needs to be alleged. That is why the coalition, while of course supporting the sentiment and objective of the bill, approaches the issue of safeguards with particular caution. In these circumstances, where a person is compelled to explain their financial affairs on pain of forfeiture, justice demands that appropriate legal assistance be reasonably available. Subject to those matters, on which I will speak further at the committee stage, the coalition supports the bill.
I will say a word now about the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2009. This bill contains a large number of amendments covering proceeds of crime, search warrants, witness protection, criminal association, money laundering, Australian Crime Commission powers, bribery and drug trafficking. Time will not permit me to discuss these in any detail at this stage of the debate. A significant number of the proposed amendments have their genesis in reports commissioned by the previous government and have the coalition’s support.
However, certain provisions do raise misgivings. For example, as the bill is drafted, the fact that an impugned relationship is that of lawyer and client is only a defence to a criminal association charge in limited circumstances. That is clearly oppressive. There is also provision for the operation of electronic equipment to obtain access to data on premises entered under a warrant, whether or not the officers suspect that the data contains evidential material. Perhaps most importantly, the offence of criminal association in support of serious organised criminal activity may include facilitating an offence by another person without any intention of doing so, so that the requirement of subjective guilt is absent from the offence.
This bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee in its report of 16 November last year. The committee identified certain matters that required amendment, including those to which I have referred. I am pleased to observe that the government has adopted a number of the committee’s recommendations. The coalition will therefore support the government amendments in the committee stage. However, as the Liberal senators on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee pointed out, the amendments proposed by these bills ‘ought to be viewed as being at the outer limits of the powers the parliament will countenance for law enforcement agencies’.
The coalition is acutely conscious of the very real danger posed to our society by organised crime. The relevant agencies are convinced that these powers are necessary to tackle that threat. That may well be the case. Coalition senators will be watching carefully, including through close scrutiny at estimates, to ascertain whether that concern is verified in practice so as to justify the unprecedented expansions of police power which this legislation prescribes.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SERIOUS AND ORGANISED CRIME) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-04,"—I rise to add some comments to those of Senator Brandis on the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009
and the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2009. I listened to his speech with interest and find that the Greens share many of the concerns that the shadow Attorney-General has just expressed. The Australian Crime Commission estimates that organised crime costs Australia in excess of $10 billion every year, placing an enormous burden on our economy and community. Those raw numbers expressed as financial resources go no way towards hinting at the extraordinary human and social cost of organised crime in this country. We share the concern of all parties in this parliament that organised crime should be pursued to the best of our resources and expertise.
We must therefore continually investigate and debate new approaches to combating organised crime. We know that these organisations and networks are continually evolving in line with developments in technology and communications. Our law enforcement agencies must obviously be equipped to respond to these developments and, as such, law reform is warranted to take an adaptive approach to the evolution of criminal networks.
Of course, the severity of organised crime does not warrant undue encroachment on judicial discretion or on fundamental legal principles such as the presumption of innocence, the right to silence and the onus of proof. Nor does the severity of organised crime justify inadequate consultation and rushed reform. Instead, the seriousness of organised crime should provoke model reform practice like that which led to the initial drafting of the Criminal Code.
As everybody in here would agree, we need to strike the right balance. It is just a matter of to what degree we agree on whether that balance has been struck. The fundamental importance of our criminal law principles and the threat of organised crime require adequate debate and consideration by the parliament and indeed in the broader community.
The scope of the reform proposed in this legislation is too broad to be adequately dealt with in a single bill. That is why there is not one but two very complex, detailed and extremely long omnibus bills. They make amendments collectively to the Crimes Act 1914, the Criminal Code Act 1995, the Customs Act 1901, the Family Law Act 1975, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. There is nothing really that collectively binds this legislation together. It is a loose umbrella grouping of a range of unrelated provisions within the undefined rhetoric of ‘organised crime’.
The proposed amendments alter the core of Commonwealth criminal law and criminal responsibility. In my view, quite inadequate justification has been given for why some of these reforms are needed and why the current law is inadequate. Obviously, with a range of provisions like this coming before the Senate, some of these amendments are technical, some of them are entirely appropriate and innocuous and some of them make good sense. Those are not the ones that I will be concentrating on this afternoon.
The importance of the Senate committee process was demonstrated with the referral of the bill to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. We received 13 submissions from diverse groups and we held a public hearing in Melbourne. In our final report, the committee made 13 recommendations. It is disappointing to see the continuation of what is emerging as fairly common practice, in that the government has cherry-picked recommendations of the committee. It has taken up some of them—and we see some of them as amendments today—and it has ignored some of the others.
Since the committee process, the government has introduced 64 amendments to the bill. Some of these are very substantial amendments that require attention and review. A handful of the amendments that the government has brought forward do relate to the work of the committee. Many of them come completely out of left field. The committee has not had time to review them, and now the Senate will be considering and debating these extremely complex provisions that came out of the blue without being subject to the dignity of review by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. This has left several key recommendations of the committee completely unaddressed.
I will speak briefly to some of our particular concerns. We welcome supplementary amendments (27) and (28), which require the authorising agency of a controlled operation to provide additional information in its reports to the Ombudsman and to the responsible minister. That is a sensible transparency measure which we support. However, these amendments ignore recommendation 6 in the committee report. This would have required the principal law enforcement officer with respect to a controlled operation to make a report to the chief officer of the law enforcement agency within two months of the completion of the operation. This has not been taken up. This additional reporting requirement would have been an important safeguard and would have better reflected the fact that police corruption is a real issue—it does exist in this country—par-ticularly where controlled operations involve law enforcement officers dealing with illicit drugs or large amounts of money.
The government has also ignored recommendation 10 of the committee’s report, which responds to the joint commission of an offence. Senator Brandis raised this, and it is one of the most important and gravest concerns that we have expressed about this legislation. The committee recommended that an individual not be liable for the joint commission of an offence provided that they have terminated their involvement in the agreement and taken reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence. A key part of our concern is that schedule 4, part 1, of the bill, the ‘Joint commission’ chapter, alters chapter 2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. This bill therefore alters criminal responsibility at the Commonwealth level, which has flow-on effects for every offence in the Criminal Code, not simply matters limited to organised crime.
These provisions have extremely far-reaching consequences for how the code will be used and interpreted from this day forward across the entire range of offences contained in the code. This is a fundamental alteration of the Criminal Code. It requires further consultation. The government is well aware of the range of highly reputable expert organisations that submitted their concerns on the way through the committee process and outside that process. The proposed amendments go beyond the common-law interpretation of ‘joint criminal enterprise’ and, as such, the significance of these amendments should not be dismissed. I suspect, as we see this debate go forward, that the concerns of those organisations will be dismissed by the government. They are concerns that the government ignores at its peril.
With regard to the threshold for obtaining a preliminary unexplained wealth order, the bill proposes that the court must simply be satisfied that the authorised officer has reasonable grounds to suspect the person has unexplained wealth. It has been suggested that this threshold be raised to ‘reasonable grounds to believe’. This is a strong recommendation, given that the person subject to the order has the burden of proving that his or her wealth was not derived from criminal activity. The supplementary explanatory memorandum states the amendments respond not only to the committee report but to ‘issues identified as a result of ongoing discussions between the Attorney-General’s Department and portfolio agencies’. The parliament is not privy to those discussions that go on behind closed doors and neither is the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee nor the community. So many of those amendments have not been through any process of review, and we are now confronting them for the first time.
We have seen a pattern of the Rudd government—and it probably is a holdover from past governments—where on the really difficult issues, whether they be organised crime networks, international terrorism or issues that we will confront when we debate the Crimes Amendment (Working With Children—Criminal History) Bill, there has been a disturbing trend towards the almost casual erosion of fundamental principles of the rule of law. It is the work of this parliament and the work of law reform agencies to confront those difficult issues without necessarily eroding the principles of the rule of law in Australia. I foreshadow support for the opposition amendments. The Greens do not believe that they go far enough, but they have been thought through and I do believe they go some way to addressing some of the concerns we have raised here. As the debate progresses, I just indicate that we will be supporting those opposition amendments. Lastly, I would like to thank the Attorney-General and his staff for briefing us in late 2009. That was greatly appreciated and I look forward to the conclusion of the debate.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SERIOUS AND ORGANISED CRIME) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-02-04,"—Organised crime is becoming more and more difficult to detect as crime bosses learn and find new ways to outsmart the law. Over 200 years ago Edmund Burke, the great English philosopher and statesman, said, ‘The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil over good is for good men to do nothing.’ The
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009
and the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2009
do something, and I indicate my support for them. During my time in the South Australian parliament I was regularly approached by police officers who were frustrated because South Australia’s weak asset confiscation laws were allowing too many criminals to get away with profiting from their crimes.
As far back as June 2007 I called for the South Australian government to get on its bike and to move for asset confiscation laws that were closer to the Western Australian and Northern Territory legislation, which would make it easier for unexplained wealth declarations to be made. Effectively, this is what the government is doing. I note your role, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, in the fine work that your committee, the Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, did in analysing and robustly looking at these proposals. I note at the time, back in June 2007, I was supported in this by the now opposition leader in South Australia, Isabel Redmond, who joined me in a media conference calling for reforms. It is good to see that the South Australian government has recently moved to reform the law on this.
I think it is important in dealing with organised crime that these laws are not only enacted but enforced. I do note with interest that in a report in the
Australian
last Monday the AFP will be reorganising a push to fight organised crime. One of the concerns that has been expressed is that AFP resources have been diverted as a result of the emphasis on the fight against terrorism, which is entirely appropriate, but it is clear there have not been the resources to fight organised crime. Unexplained wealth declarations are an important tool and an important weapon to attack organised crime in this country.
These bills also grant the police power to seek unexplained wealth orders based on reasonable suspicion. Some would argue that, when it comes to dealing with organised crime, it is as big a problem and as big a threat to the community as terrorism. In fact, it is more of a real and present threat when you consider the pernicious effect of some of these organised crime gangs, the outlaw motorcycle gangs and those that deal in illicit drugs, particularly crystal methamphetamine and heroine, and the way they can hide their wealth and get away with what they do.
I am pleased to see that the government has addressed the concerns from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in this area by stating that an officer must include his or her reasonable suspicion in an affidavit. Reasonable suspicion allows police to obtain an unexplained wealth order against someone who may not be obviously involved in criminal activity but who is reasonably expected to be. This will cover, for example, major crime figures who leave no trace of their criminal involvement but who, through their associations or actions, can reasonably be linked to illegal activity.
The committee’s recommendations also included that the courts should have the discretion to revoke or refuse a preliminary unexplained wealth order if it is in the public interest to do so. I am pleased to see that the government has also included this recommendation because, while it is necessary for police officers to have the option of using the orders, it is equally necessary to ensure that they are not abused.
I note the comments of Senator Ludlam expressing his reservations and the reservations of the Greens about corrupt police officers. I think what Senator Ludlam says is important in the context of ensuring that, given the enormous amounts of money involved and given the potential for corruption, we have effective controls to monitor corruption and it is weeded out in our law enforcement agencies. I do not think that in itself is a reason not to ensure that we go down this path in respect of unexplained wealth orders. Senator Ludlam is right in the sense that, if you have legislation such as this, it is important that we also have strong measures in place to deal with the issue of the potential for police corruption and the actuality of it occurring. I know that in my home state many years ago the former head of the South Australian drug squad spent a considerable period of time in jail—some would say not enough—for trafficking in heroin and behaving corruptly.
I believe the freezing orders included in these bills are another important tool for investigators. The shortened application process is important when it is likely that a suspect will move or transfer the funds or other proceeds of their crimes. These bills also allow property that is either used or intended to be used in a crime to be confiscated and used as evidence. It is important to note that property from indictable offences can only be confiscated after a person is convicted.
I support these changes but I believe that we may need to go further, depending on how effective they are. I appreciate the contribution of the shadow Attorney-General in relation to this. I would like to put these questions on notice to the government. Perhaps they can be dealt with in the committee stage or be put on notice. What is the government proposing to do in the context of monitoring the effectiveness of this legislation? To what extent does this legislation differ from legislation overseas in relation to unexplained wealth orders and in its effectiveness in dealing with organised crime? When does the government propose to report back to the parliament? Does it have any proposed reporting mechanisms to look at the efficacy of this legislation?
Essentially, the question is: are we doing everything possible to deal with unexplained wealth in the most effective way possible, taking into account the concerns expressed by the committee, and are we doing it in a way that will actually make significant inroads into unexplained wealth declarations? Unless this is an effective law, we will continue to see organised crime syndicates. The outlaw motorcycle gangs will continue to prosper and continue to have their corrosive and destructive influence on society.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SERIOUS AND ORGANISED CRIME) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-02-04,"—Serious and organised crime costs Australia more than $10 billion a year. Serious and organised crime also undermines the safety and security of all Australians. Everyone here would remember clearly the horrific incident at Sydney airport last year, when two motorcycle gangs had a violent brawl and a man was bashed to death. This violence took place in front of innocent bystanders, with many women and children caught up only metres from the violence and only a few steps away from where the bikie member was killed. If ever the government needed a wake-up call that it was losing its grip on the fight against organised crime then that violent brawl in Sydney airport was it. Family First believes that outlaw motorcycle gangs are serious criminal organisations; to believe otherwise is a dangerous misconception. Outlaw motorcycle gangs are a major player in serious and organised crime in Australia, particularly in the illegal drug trade, but the Rudd government has decided to go soft on outlaw motorcycle gangs as it refuses to act on anti-association laws and/or laws aimed specifically at dismantling organised crime groups. Family First strongly believes that anti-association laws and/or laws specifically aimed at dismantling organised crime groups are a crucial element of legislative arrangements to control organised crime groups involved in serious and organised crime.
Internationally, laws targeting criminal associations have been used with great effect. In Italy anti-association laws in conjunction with unexplained wealth provisions have been pivotal in prosecuting major figures in the Mafia. In the United States the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the RICO Act, has been used effectively to prosecute major figures in organised crime, including the heads of the Gambino and Genovese crime families and their known associates. In Canada the Royal Canadian Mounted Police used very effectively laws targeting specific offences for participating with a criminal organisation in order to control outlaw motorcycle gangs, in particular the Hells Angels. In Hong Kong anti-association laws were used with great effect against the triads.
Whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, organised crime is a national issue that does not recognise state boundaries, but instead of dealing with this very real problem the Rudd government has left it up to the states. The Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008 in South Australia includes anti-association provisions, as does the Crime (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2009 in New South Wales, and the Queensland government has signalled its intention to implement similar anti-association laws. The Rudd government has missed a good opportunity to tackle organised crime groups. Family First strongly supports national anti-association laws that would target known criminal associates involved in organised crime. For too long, the police have been fighting with one hand tied behind their backs because of outdated laws that do not give them enough power to take these violent criminals off our streets and put them into the jails where they belong. Australians want to feel safe and secure when they leave their homes and go outside. They do not want to feel like they could be walking to the next crime scene, as we saw at Sydney airport.
Australians must not be terrorised by outlaw gangs that refuse to operate within the boundaries of our society. The two bills before us today, the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill
and the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2), are an important step in the right direction and finally deliver national unexplained wealth laws in Australia, which Family First strongly supports. Family First believes that both anti-association laws and unexplained wealth provisions are necessary in targeting serious and organised crime.
Organised crime does not just include outlaw bikie gangs; it includes other sophisticated groups that engage in criminal activity and cost this country billions of dollars each year. As I said, the Australian Crime Commission estimates organised crime costs Australia more than $10 billion a year. That is $10 billion dollars this country is losing because of criminals who believe that, unlike all other Australians, they do not have to play by the rules. That is $10 billion dollars that could be spent on improving our health system, on securing our water supplies or on investing in the education system. We are not talking about some petty thieves here. These are well organised criminals who engage in all sorts of activities: drug trafficking, money laundering, identity theft and cybercrime. These are people who have no respect for the law and who inflict substantial harm on our community.
As a kid growing up in Reservoir I saw a lot of things, but the one thing that riled me the most was seeing people not playing by the rules and taking advantage of those weaker than themselves. That is why I made a point of becoming a full member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. I see how serious organised crime is like a social cancer that undermines the safety and security of all Australians.
The bills that we are debating contain a number of important measures, particularly those regarding unexplained wealth. The laws about unexplained wealth should be pretty simple and easy to understand. If you are involved in or connected to crime and you have unexplained wealth then you cannot keep it. I think that is a very good message. Of course, some people will be concerned about how unexplained wealth laws are against people’s civil liberties, but I do not see that as a problem. Unexplained wealth laws are straightforward and simple. If you have not done anything wrong then you have got nothing to worry about. There are serious criminals out there making millions of dollars from illegal activities, and some of them flash it around with fancy cars and fancy houses. It is outrageous. There are idiots out there, and some people are concerned about their civil liberties—what a joke! Who are these people trying to protect? Sometimes I think people forget which side they are supposed to be on.
Family First supports measures to crack down on unexplained wealth because this is another powerful weapon that the police can use to stop organised crime happening in Australia. Family First believes that both anti-association laws and unexplained wealth provisions are necessary and vital in targeting serious and organised crime in Australia and also in making sure that Australians are safe and secure. I believe that most Australians would be pretty peeved with the Rudd government if they knew that the government did not have the guts to introduce national anti-association laws when it had the chance to do so at this time.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SERIOUS AND ORGANISED CRIME) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-02-04,"—I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate on the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009
and the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2009.
I note also that the opposition, through Senator Brandis, has indicated the coalition’s support for the bills, and I thank the opposition for taking that view.
There were some issues raised in the debate that we may deal with in more detail in committee, but I did want to briefly respond to some of them now. In relation to some comments made by Senator Brandis in which he raised the issue of appropriate safeguards for unexplained wealth orders, the government believes that it has included checks and balances that ensure that these measures operate safely. There is a gatekeeping requirement to trigger the application of the provisions, and a preliminary unexplained wealth order cannot be made unless law enforcement agencies satisfy the court that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person’s total wealth exceeds the value of lawful earnings. I am also advised that there are potentially some amendments from the opposition on this matter, and I understand there have been satisfactory negotiations on that point.
Senator Ludlam raised concerns about the consultation on and time for consideration of the bills. I would make the point that these bills were introduced into the parliament last year, in June and September. The parliament has had some months to consider each of them and the Senate committee has also inquired into and reported on the bills. Public hearings were held in the context of these hearings, and the government has given careful consideration to all of the recommendations of the committee. The senator also raised the concern that the joint commission provisions go further than the common law. The government’s view is that the provisions are consistent with the common law and ensure that the Commonwealth Criminal Code reflects that common law.
The senator also questioned why the government will not be implementing one of the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, namely recommendation 6, in which the committee recommended that principal law enforcement officers be required to report to the chief officer on each operation within two months of its completion. I am advised that these reports would largely duplicate information, recording and reporting requirements set out under other provisions. For example, details about the nature and quantity of illicit goods and the route through which they are passed are already required of both chief officers’ reports and the general register. To address the Senate committee’s concerns, the amendments will ensure law enforcement agencies are required to include information about the controlled conduct engaged in, the outcomes of each operation and both chief officers’ reports and the general register. The government has also made amendments in the other place to require additional reporting to be undertaken if an operation involves narcotic goods.
This government takes very seriously its responsibility for ensuring a safe and more secure Australia. These bills are a significant step toward that goal. As senators know, organised crime inflicts substantial harm on our community as well as on business and government. Organised crime networks are extensive, entrepreneurial and adaptive. They are involved in a range of criminal activities, from illicit drug trafficking and money laundering to identity theft and cybercrime. The increasingly aggressive nature of organised crime requires a more aggressive response. It is important that there are strong laws in place to combat this national security threat.
Passage of these bills will represent a significant advance in the tools available to fight serious and organised crime. The bills implement resolutions agreed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in April and August of last year for a comprehensive national response to organised crime. At that meeting, Commonwealth, state and territory governments committed to decisive action to address the threat of organised crime and to ensure that there were no safe havens in Australia for organised criminal groups. These bills also deliver on the Prime Minister’s assurance in his inaugural National Security Statement, delivered at the end of 2008, that the government would act to address the threat posed by organised criminal activity by further strengthening the laws necessary to combat organised crime.
There is a range of government amendments which will be moved in the committee debate and I propose to address them at that stage. They are amendments that are designed to clarify and ensure that the provisions in the bill and existing legislation operate as intended, as well as more substantive amendments. The measures in both the bills as amended represent another significant step as part of a coordinated national effort to more effectively prevent, investigate and prosecute organised crime activities in this country and to improve laws that target the proceeds of organised crime groups. Both sets of reforms are an important part of the government’s commitment to keeping Australia safe and secure, and I commend the bills to the Senate.

Schedule 2, item 4, page 15 (after line 23), after paragraph 21A(1)(a), insert:

         

(aa)
 

employ or engage only an agent who is:

                 

(i)
 

a Qualified Education Agent Counsellor who has completed the Education Agents Training Course or a recognised equivalent as specified in the regulations; and

                

(ii)
 

a member of a professional body for education agents if such a body has been specified in the regulations in relation to the area in which the agent operates; and
I previously explained what we are seeking to achieve with the amendment. The opposition is of the view that education agents should at least have a requirement to receive training and be aware of Australian requirements regarding matters such as attendance, work permits, migration et cetera—in fact, that there ought to be a more professional approach than is currently the case. With those few words, I commend the amendment to the Senate.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-04,"—The minister is quite right: the Senate does now have a speaker who is able to highlight the problems with this legislation. I indicate at the outset that we as a coalition will continue to oppose this legislation, which is designed to remove the key means for achieving that which the Building and Construction Commission was initially set up for. It is vitally important that the Australian people be reminded why the Australian Building and Construction Commission was set up: corruption, illegality, and thuggery were rife throughout the building and construction sector in Australia.
Indeed, in my home state of Tasmania, having listened to the plight of small business contractors, who have to try to do deals with trade unions and big builders so that they could come on site, I was convinced—as were many other Australians—that a royal commission into this sort of behaviour was necessary. That royal commission was held. It was the Cole royal commission. When I read its findings, I was horrified to learn that that which I thought was horrific in my home state of Tasmania was in fact like a Sunday school picnic in comparison to what was occurring elsewhere, especially in Victoria and Western Australia.
The people of Australia, quite rightly, fully supported the Howard government’s establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We said we needed somebody to enforce law and order so that law-abiding citizens could actually get onto building and construction sites all around Australia. The Labor Party were shamed into basically saying at the last election: ‘Well, yeah, somehow, sort of, we’ll keep that legislation; we’ll keep a tough cop on the beat.’ But it is very interesting to have a look at some of the donations made to the Australian Labor Party before the last election. We had the CFMEU meeting with the now Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, with them believing that they had walked away with an assurance that the ABCC would be emasculated. As a result, it is interesting to learn, $500,000—half a million dollars—went from that union’s kitty to the Australian Labor Party to help fund those dishonest advertisements about the Howard government. Of course, this bill before the Senate today, the
Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009
is the reward to the CFMEU for that payment and support at the last election.
Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd are past masters at this. The Prime Minister says one day, ‘I’ve never been a socialist,’ and then the next day is able to say, ‘Well, I’m a Christian socialist.’ In his very first speech to the parliament he said that Margaret Thatcher’s economic policies were horrific and then a few years later appeared on pay-TV advertisements, hand on heart, saying, ‘Guess what—I’ve always been an economic conservative.’ The man will do anything for the sake of power. The man who promised the Australian people he would retain the Australian Building and Construction Commission as a tough cop on the beat quietly, behind the scenes, accepted the invitation for a meeting from the CFMEU—
—And took their money.
—and took their money—Senator Fierravanti-Wells, you are quite right—and we are now seeing the legislation. So I suppose anybody around Australia can now buy this government for half a million dollars—
—Or less.
—or less, indeed, Senator Fierravanti-Wells—for a change in legislation.
Having said all that, this bill is designed to restrain the activities of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Indeed, there are senators in this place that have little posters up in their windows condemning the ABCC. Let us just put it on the record: the man that is in charge of the ABCC has had to put up with people spitting at him in public, and I do not hear many public statements from those opposite condemning that sort of behaviour. They have to be asked; it has to be probed out of them. They do not voluntarily say, ‘This is the sort of activity which we want to outlaw and get rid of.’ My view is that that sort of behaviour has no place in Australian society. In particular, the thuggery, the vandalism and the assaults—you name it—that occur on building and construction sites in Australia, especially in Western Australia and Victoria, need a tough cop on the beat.
So what does Labor want to do? Instead of having an independent body administering these laws, an independent policeman, or an independent, tough cop on the beat—listen to this—the independence is going to be removed by giving the minister the capacity to issue directions to the director about the policies, the programs, the priorities and the manner in which the powers and functions of the building industry inspectorate are exercised and performed. Would that be acceptable for any other police force in the Western world, for a police force that exists in a society where the rule of law should be in prime position? Just imagine it: halfway through an investigation, the minister could say, ‘Well, I’m sorry, Mr Building Industry Inspectorate, but I’m going to change your priorities and the way you exercise your powers and functions.’ That is the rule of law, that is the tough cop on the beat according to Mr Rudd, the economic conservative—say one thing and do another, and this is a classic case.
The Australian people have just recently witnessed what the trade union movement is willing to do in Western Australia with the Maritime Union of Australia.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-02-04,"—I rise to speak on the
Health Insurance Amendment (New Zealand Overseas Trained Doctors) Bill 2009. This bill proposes to modify the operation of section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973. This section of the Health Insurance Act came into force through an amendment made to the act in 1996. In the early to mid-1990s the prevailing view within the Hawke-Keating government was that Australia produced enough medical graduates to meet the nation’s health needs. Indeed some, including the then health minister, Graham Richardson, thought that there were too many doctors when in fact shortages were emerging.
When the Howard government came to power in 1996 it set out to correct those problems and section 19AB was one of the changes implemented. The change meant that overseas trained doctors who started work in Australia from 1 January 1997 and who wished to access Medicare benefits for their services needed to practise in rural and remote areas, areas of health workforce shortages, for a period of 10 years. It became known as the 10-year moratorium. The purpose was, and remains, to influence distribution of the medical workforce in rural and remote areas of Australia, ensuring communities in remote locations have access to a GP.
It is generally agreed that the requirements have been successful and have had significant and beneficial impacts on workforce outcomes. Indeed, overseas trained doctors have been fundamental to the continued delivery of healthcare services in many remote communities and have become valued members of those communities. The government’s audit of the rural health workforce showed that this policy had made a difference to health services being provided in the bush. Many communities are reliant on these medical practitioners and would not have practising GPs without the action of the Howard government.
The main provision of this bill will make it easier for New Zealand doctors to work in Australia. It will remove the 10-year moratorium restrictions on New Zealand citizen and permanent resident doctors trained at New Zealand or Australian medical schools. The change effectively removes these doctors from the classification of ‘overseas trained doctor’ and ‘former overseas medical student’ in section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act. The other significant change in this legislation is to the commencement date of the 10-year moratorium on overseas trained doctors. It will also remove the requirement for overseas trained doctors to have both Australian permanent residency or citizenship and medical registration in order for the 10-year moratorium period to commence. The changes will see the moratorium commence from the time a medical practitioner is first registered, to recognise that some overseas doctors work in Australia for several years on a visa before seeking residency or citizenship. The government makes these changes at the same time as it intends to scale back the moratorium, with 3,600 overseas trained doctors able to shorten the term of the moratorium from July by serving in the most remote locations. The coalition will be watching the impact of this measure very closely.
The coalition has long been concerned with ensuring the provision of medical services in regional and remote areas of Australia. The Howard government established essential and innovative programs to encourage medical professionals to train and establish practices in regional areas. Indeed, in the first budget of the Howard government in 1996-97, the then government established University Departments of Rural Health programs. They exist now in 11 regional locations, and an evaluation showed that they have made a significant contribution to rural health outcomes and influenced rural and remote practitioners to remain in practice.
The Rural Clinical Schools Program followed in 2000, and 10 of these schools were established in that first year. Another four were launched in 2006-07. Clinical schools enable medical students to undertake extended blocks of training in regional areas. Again, the review of these programs commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing found that the RCS Program has delivered convincingly and with the university rural health program was contributing to enhancing the rural health workforce. The full worth of the RCS Program will only start to become evident in the next few years as its early cohort start establishing themselves in medical practice. The rural health workforce will also be boosted by students assisted under the Bonded Medical Places Scheme. Hundreds of medical students have been provided with financial help, which will see them work for six continuous years in rural and remote areas.
The current government, as much as it seeks to denigrate the former coalition government, will in fact reap the benefits of the forward-thinking policies of the Howard government. Generally across the health workforce increasing numbers of health professionals will be graduating from the nation’s medical schools over the next few years. All of these students will have begun their career path under the coalition government. It is hoped that significant numbers of them will consider practising in regional Australia and thus contribute to alleviating the uneven distribution of the health workforce which unfortunately disadvantages those living outside major centres. This bill has wide support across medical representative bodies. The coalition supports these changes to the legislation.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (NEW ZEALAND OVERSEAS TRAINED DOCTORS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-02-04,"—In summing up the debate on the
Health Insurance Amendment (New Zealand Overseas Trained Doctors) Bill 2009, I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells and other speakers in the debate. I want to make some short points about this particular piece of legislation to remind those listening to the debate of what we are actually doing here under this bill. It does, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells so rightly said, actually have an impact on and give effect to some changes to the 10-year moratorium. The reasons for that are very clear. Ours is a government that is determined to ensure that we develop a more transparent and fairer and consistent health system. That includes all of those considerations that are given to our rural health workforce. Those who were affected by the 10-year moratorium, which was put in place in 1997, and have been restricted from providing professional services that attract Medicare benefits for that period of 10 years are now coming out of that cycle and so the government is considering how we can continue to manage this issue. That is what this bill is all about.
I do want to say, though, that the way in which the 10-year moratorium is currently counted actually excludes years of tenure as a temporary resident, so overseas trained doctors may be prevented from providing professional services which attract Medicare benefits for longer than 10 years, which hardly seems fair. So the amendments propose that the 10-year restriction will commence from the time that a medical practitioner is first registered as a medical practitioner in Australia and will cease after that 10 years, providing that the medical practitioner has gained Australian permanent residency or citizenship during that period. The 10-year moratorium will continue to be used, along with the other reforms that are being implemented under the Rural Health Workforce Strategy, to recruit GPs for and retain GPs in rural and remote Australia. But, as I said, the measures make sure that the system is much fairer and recognises the services to districts of workforce shortage. So, as part of our $134 million rural package in the 2009 budget, the 10-year moratorium will also be scaled so that the more remote you go the shorter the moratorium. From 1 July 2010 more than 3,600 overseas trained doctors who have restrictions on where they can practise now will be able to discharge their obligation sooner according to the remoteness of the locations in which they choose to work. This is the way in which we want to incentivise overseas trained doctors to actually come into some of the harder to service areas of our country. The 10-year moratorium therefore will not be as stringent as it has been since its introduction under the previous government in 1997.
The package of reforms to this section of the act completes the significant workforce reforms already underway, as I have said, and to date it has delivered the biggest investment in our workforce through a $1.6 billion Council of Australian Governments partnership that will help to deliver training for the huge increase in Australian-trained graduates, which will actually increase from 12,700 this year to 14,700 in 2013. That funding will also help support undergraduate clinical training for 13,800 medical students and, importantly, 38½ thousand nursing students and 18,000 allied health students in 2010. We are also providing $28 million to help train around 18,000 nurse supervisors, 5,000 allied health and VET supervisors and 7,000 medical supervisors. Along with this we are increasing the availability of specialist workforce places by boosting the total number of GP training places to more than 800 from 2011 onwards, a 33 per cent increase on the cap of 600 places imposed by the former government, and we are providing specialist training places outside of the traditional public hospital settings.
This year’s budget delivers more than $200 million to help tackle the shortage of doctors and health workers in rural and remote Australia and to improve the access to health and medical services of the seven million Australians who live in regional and remote Australia. At the same time we are streamlining the multiplicity of rural health programs to make it easier for doctors and, much more importantly, easier for communities to understand and access the initiatives that will help to build the rural health workforce of the future. New access to choices as to maternity services and nurse practitioner services will also be enabled through bills which are currently before the Senate. The commencement date for the provisions is 1 April 2010 or on royal assent, whichever is the later date. It is very pleasing to have this particular bill before the Senate today. It complements, as I have said, significant workforce reforms and commitments by this government. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2010-02-04,"—The coalition support the
Higher Education Support Amendment Bill 2009. This bill provides for some new minor administrative efficiencies in the operation of FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP, the assistance schemes for students attending university or vocational education and training courses. Specifically, the amendments will allow higher education and vocational and education training providers to lodge their applications for approval to offer FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP before having their tuition assurance arrangements in place. This will speed up the approval of providers and access to loans. According to the government, the implementation of this bill will result in the streamlining of the application and assessment process as well as the elimination of current duplications between the Commonwealth and state and territory agencies. It is good news for the providers and also for the students. The amendments also broaden the conditions under which the minister may be satisfied that a VET provider is able to meet the VET quality and accountability requirements and so qualify to offer VET FEE-HELP. The new conditions include that the minister may be satisfied by a recommendation of a body that is approved under the VET provider guidelines. The coalition are always happy to support greater administrative efficiency in every aspect of government work and service delivery. We support this bill.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-02-04,"—I thank Senator Mason for indicating the opposition’s support for the
Higher Education Support Amendment Bill 2009. As he so clearly outlined, this bill provides for technical amendments to further streamline the operation of FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assistance schemes. The amendments deliver efficiencies in the administration of the schemes and ensure faster access to financial assistance for students choosing to pursue higher levels of qualifications. On that note, I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-04,"—The coalition does not oppose the
Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009. In saying that, the legislation does prevent non-government employers from seeking access to the Comcare scheme. That is a matter of concern to us in the coalition, because it removes an option for employers in their ability to access safety rehabilitation and compensation type schemes and, especially, requires employees to go back to their state schemes. It seems that Labor simply dislikes flexibility and options—everybody has to fit into their straitjacket. Of course, we now know what happens with these sorts of straightjackets in state jurisdictions, and one wonders what the pressure was on federal Labor not to allow employers into the Comcare scheme if they wanted to so move, given that the scheme was providing appropriate support and protection. Indeed, to all intents and purposes it is run by the Commonwealth government. So why would you try to get private employers out of this scheme and back into their state jurisdictions? I have no doubt where the pressure came from on this: it clearly would have been New South Wales Labor, against whom, thank goodness, the High Court of Australia yesterday ruled seven to nil while making very condemnatory comments about their occupational health and safety scheme. Indeed, one of the judges, Justice Hayden, went so far as to say that the authority that sought to prosecute a Mr Kirk and his company did so ‘very unjustly and in a manner causing them much harm’. His Honour also said:
It is absurd to have prosecuted the owner of a farm and its principal on the ground that the principal had failed properly to ensure the health, safety and welfare of his manager, who was a man of optimum skill and experience—skill and experience much greater than his own—and a man whose conduct in driving straight down the side of a hill instead of on a formed and safe road was inexplicably reckless. It is time for the WorkCover authority of New South Wales to finish its sport with Mr Kirk.
Those are pretty damning comments about a New South Wales scheme set up by New South Wales Labor in 2001. As an aside, I say to some of the employer organisations in this country that it may be worth while to get a bit of backbone and stand by your principles. This corrupt scheme started in 2001, but it took one man—a small business man, Mr Kirk—to have the courage to take this all the way to the High Court to finally get the result that all of us who believe in the rule of law, natural justice and fair procedure wanted.
Where were these organisations in championing the rights of small business especially against this sort of outrageous authority and the actions referred to by His Honour Justice Hayden? Where were they? Indeed, where were the civil libertarians? You know the ones: those who always have so much to say about our border protection policies but who are deafeningly silent when it comes to Australian citizens being abused by a New South Wales Labor authority—and, might I add, with unions as well, because unions themselves could bring prosecutions under this legislation. Quite frankly, some of those civil libertarians are only civil half the time, and I am not sure about their libertarian nature the other half of the time, but I say to those employer organisations—
—On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that the bill before it today is a non-controversial bill called the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill and that it relates to harmonisation in the Commonwealth jurisdictions and to the issue of Comcare; it does not relate to civil libertarians and Senator Abetz’s nonsense about New South Wales.

(Senator Troeth)—There is no point of order, Senator Stephens.
—In case the minister at the table—who is very sensitive, having come from New South Wales Labor herself—does not understand that the legislation that we are debating does in fact to get into the area of occupational health and safety, what this legislation does is to deny private employers the chance to get out of that corrupt system that her state Labor government had in New South Wales and into the Comcare system. So I can understand the sensitivity.
Getting back to these civil libertarian organisations, I suppose one should not be surprised, because they always come out on one side of the ledger—there is no balance to their concern. If I were to really think about it, that would not surprise or concern me, but the thing that does concern me is that it took so long for a group of organisations and others to come together to back Mr Kirk all the way to the High Court. That this legislation was allowed to exist in Australia for nearly a decade is, I have to say, a disgrace and it will be seen as a blot on the Australian industrial landscape, and New South Wales Labor and their trade union movement have nothing to be proud of. I simply say to people, ‘If you think Senator Abetz and the coalition are ranting a bit about this, fine—believe that—but just read the judgment of Justice Heydon of the High Court and you will see what New South Wales Labor presided over for so long.’ I have to say I am astounded that so many business organisations did not come together for a High Court challenge immediately and I wonder why it had to wait for nearly a decade before the outrageousness of some aspects of the scheme were knocked out by the High Court, which happened only yesterday.
Labor, for whatever reason, does not want small businesses or other businesses to opt out of their state schemes into the Comcare scheme. This is, once again, ideologically driven—union driven. It does not make any sense, but we accept the reality in this chamber. Therefore, I indicate that the coalition will not be opposing the legislation.",SENATE,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-02-04,"—in reply—I thank Senator Abetz for his contribution to the debate and for stating the opposition’s support for the
Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009. In summing up this debate, I want to remind people, in case they were listening to Senator Abetz and wondered what this legislation is all about, that its purpose is actually to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to maintain the moratorium that was put in place while the Commonwealth, states and territories have been working towards the harmonisation of national health and safety legislation. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that we would have a uniform system of occupational health and safety laws and a nationally consistent approach for those people who are employed in our country. The extent to which this work can reduce the number of workplaces where dual jurisdiction exists seems to me to be common sense prevailing. With those comments, I commend the bill to the Senate.

Statute Law Revision Bill 2009
corrects technical errors in a number of acts, modernises language and repeals a number of obsolete acts. Bills of this nature are traditionally non-controversial and receive the support of parliament because they are regarded as an essential tool in the process of keeping the Commonwealth statute books accurate and up to date. The acts to be repealed are self-evidently obsolete and have been superseded by other legislation. Of the acts to be amended, most of the proposals relate to spelling, grammatical and technical errors and the removal of gender specific language. Schedule 1 to the bill contains amendments to 33 principal acts. Schedule 2 amends 22 amending acts. Schedule 3 repeals five acts. The remainder of the bill makes bulk amendments in respect of spelling and capitalisation.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-04,"—Before the debate on the
Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009
was adjourned, I was about to get onto the Maritime Union of Australia case in Western Australia, which highlighted that certain unions were, yet again, on the rampage. What the unions got was a $50,000 per annum wage increase for people already earning $130,000—so they will now be taking home $180,000.
Yesterday at question time I asked about that outcome and Senator Arbib in this place said that federal Labor welcomed the outcome, even though there were no productivity offsets. We in the coalition are all in favour of wage increases, especially if there are productivity offsets, because that way everybody is a winner. But when a trade union uses raw industrial muscle to force outcomes that are just unconscionable—and Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd sit idly by—one does fear for the future industrial relations culture of our country.
How can such a wage increase be justified, and what do we know about those sorts of wage increases? They lead to wage inflation. Wage inflation leads to cost of living increases, which lead to job losses. When that was put to Senator Arbib, Labor repudiated it. They rejected my analysis. Well, it was a former Labor Treasurer, Mr Frank Crean, who said that one man’s pay rise is another man’s job. He said that in the context of discussing wage inflation such as we have just witnessed in Western Australia.
So not only do Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard barrack the MUA to get these outrageous decisions, they also pull the teeth from the industrial watchdogs to make sure that they become toothless tigers and ineffective so that the unions can go on the rampage—as the MUA has done in Western Australia. Of course, Western Australia is the hotbed of corruption and illegality, with the likes of Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald. They are there, and they are so happy that they are back in town courtesy of Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard.
So what is Labor going to do with this inspectorate? As I indicated previously, the independence of the inspectorate will be removed and Ms Gillard will be able to pull the strings when and as she likes. Labor will be tying up the watchdog in red tape, which goes against the independent report which they commissioned—the Wilcox report. So, in hoping to get the right answers they commissioned somebody—and I must say I was concerned and still have some concerns about the recommendations—but even on this Justice Wilcox could not agree and said that they should not be tied up with red tape. But, no, Ms Gillard knows best; she will even overturn Mr Wilcox’s considerations!
They want to impose a five-year sunset clause on the compulsion powers, without review. There are some compulsory powers that the inspectorate can use. They are needed to shift the culture, but Ms Gillard is going to remove them irrespective of whether or not there has been a sufficient change in culture—which means, of course, that the government never had any intention of keeping its promise to keep a strong cop on the construction beat.
What did Labor promise? They promised: there will always be a strong cop on the beat. Well, not if this bill gets passed—another broken election promise—because they are proposing to switch off, site by site, the coercive powers of the construction cop. So some sites will be removed from the scope of the inspectorate.
This broken promise is supported by an ALP national conference resolution that Labor ‘does not believe these powers should have a continuing role’. So Ms Gillard is confronted with a solemn promise that she made to the people of Australia and a dictate from the national conference of the ALP dominated by the trade union movement. Guess who wins. Each and every time it will be the union dominated Labor Party national conference and not the promise she and Mr Rudd made so solemnly to the Australian people.
If you are concerned about what she is doing wait for this: all the penalties will be reduced by two-thirds. The penalties are going to be like petty cash, especially for those unions like the CFMEU, which gave Mr Rudd and the Labor Party $500,000 during the 2007 federal election campaign. They will now think that these fines are just laughable. What is a $6,600 fine to a trade union official or individual when he is handing over $500,000 cheques to the Labor Party for their use in election campaigns? They will be laughing all the way, and Ms Gillard knows it.
Then, just to make sure that this so-called tough cop on the beat has absolutely nothing left to do, they have also narrowed the definition of ‘industrial action’. The bill also removes the coercion and undue pressure provisions which provide protection from such behaviour greater than under the Fair Work Act 2009. These provisions are designed to stop bullying of companies and workers. Why would you remove those sorts of provisions? Everybody knows that bullying occurs on the work sites. The stories are there for all to read in the
Herald Sun
and other newspapers as to what happens at the West Gate Bridge and the Royal Children’s Hospital construction site in Victoria and what happens in Western Australia. We know what goes on. We know that bullying occurs. So why would you remove provisions that deal with exactly that issue? It is so that people like Joe Macdonald and Kevin Reynolds can do as they want in exchange for the policy considerations that they obtain, no doubt, in their discussions with Mr Rudd, after Labor’s $500,000 gift from the CFMEU.

This means that a building company or their employees can be subjected to coercion or undue pressure from militant unions without that behaviour being illegal. In other words, the culture of bullying will be allowed to exist by removing this provision from the legislation. You have to ask why Labor wants to give a green light for these practices to return. Why do they say that bullying people in workplaces should be acceptable? It is because the people who do the bullying are the people who bankroll the Australian Labor Party. Sure, Mr Rudd was meek and mild. He appeared on these TV advertisements saying, ‘I’m an economic conservative.’ But what we did not see on those TV advertisements was the secret meeting that he had with the CFMEU where certain undertakings were given. Nor did we find out before the election that the CFMEU had quietly slipped $500,000 to the ALP campaign kitty. I trust that this year, an election year, Mr Rudd will have TV advertisements showing that secret meeting with the CFMEU and the handing over of the money, with him saying, ‘Yeah, I’ve changed my mind on all that.’ But of course he will not. He just hopes that these issues will go away.
We on the coalition side will stand up for individual workers and will stand up for the small contractors. It has been interesting in this debate on the ABCC that in general terms big business and big unions do not seem to mind that sort of a culture. They are big and ugly enough to look after themselves. There is an African proverb that says that when two elephants mate the grass gets trampled. When big unions and big business get together, it is the individual workers and the small business contractors who get trampled. We in the coalition stand on the side of individual workers. We stand on the side of small, independent contractors. That is why we will be opposing this bill with all the vigour that we can muster. We invite the crossbenchers, especially Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon, to join with us in the rejection of this legislation, which is a complete and utter breach of the election promise taken to the Australian people by Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard and which will see the reintroduction of even worse bullying and thuggery and the sorts of items that the MUA have been able to force out of employers. We will be opposing this legislation every step of the way.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FAIR WORK) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-02-04,"—The Australian Greens have been consistent in our opposition to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act and the operations of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We do not accept that it is necessary to have workplace relations laws that take away the right to silence, deny people their choice of lawyer, provide powers to compel evidence with the penalty of jail for non-compliance and impose strict restrictions on the rights of workers to organise and bargain collectively. We have been utterly consistent in that stance. We remain committed to these principles and to the principles that there should be one workplace relations law and that building and construction workers should not be singled out for more punitive treatment. People who work in the building industry are not so different from workers in other industries that they should be singled out by laws based on the presumption of criminality and the need for a tough cop on the beat.
Building workers have a strong sense of acting collectively. They have needed to. They work in one of our most dangerous industries, with a high rate of fatalities and serious injuries. Building workers rely on each other and have fought hard for and won rights to safer work places. The BCII Act, including the act as amended by the
Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009, is a direct attack on the rights of building workers to act together for their collective interests.
At the core of this act and this bill lies an assumption that individual workers in the building industry are inherently bad, cannot be trusted, have no integrity and en masse deserve to be considered criminals for sticking up for their mates. This is a belief that the ALP government and the opposition apparently share. This is the belief that justifies in their minds the use of coercive powers in relation to civil workplace relation matters. It is not a belief shared by the Australian Greens. Our position always had been and continues to be that the ABCC should be abolished immediately and that coercive powers of the nature contained in the BCII Act and in this bill have no place in our workplace laws. In line with our position, I introduced a private senator’s bill to repeal the BCII Act last year.
We do not accept that the government’s continued rhetoric about a tough cop on the beat for the building industry justifies the continuation of coercive powers. Universal industrial, civil and criminal laws should be complied with and enforced on building sites as in any other workplace. Unlawful industrial action should be dealt with under our workplace relation laws with an emphasis on resolving disputes, not criminalising workers for their collective actions. As the commissioner reminded us in the committee hearings on this bill late last year, the coercive powers at the heart of this bill are not directed at wrongdoers but at people who are not suspected of doing anything unlawful. This is an important point. The BCII Act and this bill provide for persons to be imprisoned for not complying with directions to attend interviews or produce documents in relation to suspected breaches of industrial laws committed by someone else.
We note the comments of Dave Noonan of the CFMEU that these laws are not directed at the types of behaviour that are used to justify their application. He said:
The argument that is made in favour of these laws constantly reverts back to often unsubstantiated and hysterical allegations about criminality, violence, corruption and so on ... yet these laws have absolutely nothing to do with any of those matters and are incapable of being used to prosecute any of those matters, and my view is that those who are the proponents of these laws continue to refer to those matters because they are unable to articulate an argument as to why industrial laws should require the removal of the right to silence and the imprisonment of working people for six months for attending a union meeting. If people could justify that, they would not be continually returning to matters which are unconnected, unrelated and incapable of being prosecuted under this law.
These laws are about bullying, harassing and intimidating building workers and damaging and eventually destroying the building unions. Such an aim has no place in a democratic nation that recognises the fundamental right of freedom of association.
But more than that, the act and the ABCC targets the unions through their members—ordinary Australian workers. Back in November 2005 I moved a motion to disallow the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Regulations. In the course of that debate I outlined some of the ways in the ABCC was using its powers to intimidate workers and their families, for example, inspectors who appear to have waited until a worker has set off to work to serve his wife or partner with a notice, putting out in a heavy-handed manner that they are liable to a large fine or a jail term if they do not fully cooperate. I have heard stories of apprentices of migrant workers for whom English is a second language, being picked on, intimidated and tricked into answering questions without being informed of their legal rights. I have heard about workers being invited to have an informal conversation by an ABCC inspector only to learn that the discussion has been recorded without their knowledge or consent.
Such behaviour in this country is unacceptable. Workers have been and are being denied the basic democratic rights to procedural fairness and natural justice that all of us take for granted. These workers, who have not been charged with anything and may only be suspected of knowing about a criminal offence by somebody else, are being treated with fewer rights than someone who has committed a very serious criminal offence. While we appreciate the safeguards that the government is seeking to introduce to this bill in an attempt to ensure greater probity in the use of the coercive powers—such as the need for a presidential member of the AAT to approve the use of coercive powers, the oversight of the Ombudsman, the specific provisions allowing people a lawyer of their choice, and the addition of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity—and while we understand the intention behind the ‘switching off’ mechanism and the role of the independent assessor, all these measures do not solve our fundamental objection that these coercive powers have no place in the regulation of industrial relations matters. As Professor Williams and Ms McGarrity concluded in their article on the investigatory powers of the ABCC:
It is wrong as a matter of legal policy to confer a draconian, overbroad and inadequately checked investigatory power on a body whose principal function is to investigate civil breaches of federal industrial law in a single industry ....Given such fundamental concerns, our view is that the ABCC should be abolished. We further believe that it is inappropriate to create

any other body to deal only with the building and construction industry. Contraventions of industrial law by participants in that sector should be investigated by a single body with a brief to apply its powers in a non-discriminatory manner to all employers and employees across all industries.
We consider that the potential for a penalty of imprisonment for a worker not complying with a request under the coercive powers remains objectionable. We agree with the ACTU, which said:
Our view is that, before imprisonment could become a penalty, you would have to be found to be in contempt of either a court or an institution. The problem with the regime, even with the safeguards that are proposed, is that the person is not heard until they are prosecuted for failure to appear, with a penalty of imprisonment hanging over their head. In industrial law, for all other workers in the country, there is no prospect of imprisonment unless you are in contempt of court. We think that the same regime should apply to construction workers and construction employers and that imprisonment should only be an available, as it is to all other citizens, if they are in contempt.
The problem with this regime is that you move to imprisonment without having an opportunity to be heard or having an opportunity to explain why you do not wish to comply with the orders.
We believe that if these powers are to remain, the penalty of imprisonment must be removed, and we will move an amendment to that effect.
The Australian Greens do not accept the argument that the BCII Act, and the retention of the coercive powers by the bill, is justified on the ground of perceived economic benefit. Professor David Peetz comprehensively demolished the argument that the operations of the ABCC contribute to productivity gains in his submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill. He concluded:
... if there are to be any economic effects from the operation of the ABCC, they are more likely to be increasing profits than increasing productivity.
Profits above people is not something the Greens can support. We do not believe that economic gains can justify the assault on fundamental human rights that the BCII Act perpetrates.
A key concern for me in the operation of the ABCC has been its impact on occupational, health and safety in the building and construction industry. This is an industry that suffers around 50 deaths a year—and many more serious injuries. The intimidating tactics of the ABCC have a detrimental effect on safety. Workers are less likely to report unsafe situations and they are less likely hold meetings to discuss safety issues or stop work in dangerous circumstances for fear of a heavy-handed visit from the ABCC. It is unacceptable in an industry as dangerous as the building and construction industry for legislation to act counter to achieving the highest possible standards of health and safety practice. The provisions of the bill before us do not satisfy my concerns about occupational health and safety. It is the presence of the coercive powers that cause this concern.
Having outlined our continued opposition to the very existence of the coercive powers, I do want to briefly mention why we will be supporting the bill at the second reading stage. The bill does introduce important safeguards on the use of the coercive powers, which we hope will go some way to ensuring the new inspectorate does not behave in a similar way to the ABCC. We welcome the explicit acknowledgement for the rights of people to be represented by a lawyer of their choice. We labelled the ABCC as a ‘star chamber’ from the beginning; the restoration of the basic rights of legal representation is long overdue.
Importantly, the bill removes chapters 5 and 6 of the BCII Act. These chapters provide specific and harsher prohibitions on industrial action and increased penalties for unlawful industrial action and coercive behaviour in the building industry. The removal of these provisions means that building and constructions workers are covered by the same prohibitions as all other workers and, importantly, the same penalties as other workers.

Building and construction workers will still face unnecessary restrictions on collective bargaining and freedom of association through the application of the Fair Work Act. The Australian Greens believe strongly that freedom of association is a fundamental right and that an integral part of that right is the right to take industrial action. With the Fair Work Act now containing the substantive rights and obligations for all workers, the logical step is for all breaches of those laws to be dealt with by the Fair Work Ombudsman, without a separate compliance agency for one section of the workforce. This would also go a long way to changing the culture of enforcement in the building industry.
It has become clear that the ABCC has not been impartial in exercising its responsibilities and in fact has been turning a ‘blind eye’ to unlawful employer actions. The Federal Court has found in a particular case that the ABCC turned a blind eye to dishonest employer behaviour and failed to act in an even-handed way in its pursuit of the plumbers union. In fact, 66 per cent of its investigations have been targeted at unions while only 25 per cent have been targeted at employer actions—and many employers have been contacted by the ABCC because of their relationships with unions. An impartial enforcement culture is critical to the success of the new inspectorate, particularly if it is to carry out its functions with regard to ensuring compliance by employers with their obligations.
I also take this opportunity to note that the bill will still be in breach of Australia’s international obligations. There is little doubt that the retention of the coercive powers will breach the labour inspection and the freedom of association and right to organise conventions. Australia is a signatory to these conventions which signals that we as a nation accept the principles found in those documents. The ILO conventions are important as representing the framework for fair and balanced industrial relations. If we are in breach of these conventions we are falling outside what is acceptable international practice.
The Australian Greens believe that the government should endeavour to ensure we live up to the international standards that we have signed on to, not ignore them. The Greens will not shrink from defending the basic human rights of workers in the building and construction industry. The bill before us today is an inadequate compromise. We will continue to advocate to ensure that the building industry is regulated just like any other industry—in a fair and just manner that balances the needs of productivity and the economy with the health, safety and democratic rights of workers.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FAIR WORK) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-02-04,"—I rise to contribute to this debate on the
Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009
and to state what is obvious to everyone, with the possible exception of this Labor government. If ever there was legislation which should be defeated, it is this legislation; and if ever there was a time when the ABCC should remain firmly in place on the Australian industrial scene, it is now. Only this week have we seen the Treasurer, Mr Swan, make the astounding statement that Australians need to increase our productivity in the workplace, as if he suddenly discovered this fact. Already, Labor’s new so-called fair work legislation is failing miserably to deliver on this demand of the Treasurer, and any attempt to water down the ABCC will only serve further to decrease productivity.
Why was it necessary in the first place, contrary to what we have just heard from my learned colleague Senator Siewert, for the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act to come into existence? As we all know, it had its origins under the last government, the Howard coalition government, as a result of thuggery, poor productivity, corruption and everything that went with it in the building industry. It was this that led to the Cole commission of inquiry in 2003, and it was from that inquiry that the BCII Act came into existence. What led to that inquiry was the widespread sabotage of industry productivity through strikes, intimidation, illegal payments, violence threats, failure to honour binding agreements, contempt for the commission and court rulings, regrettably in my state of Western Australia, where it was made into an art form, and also principally in Victoria.
Clearly what was needed then, and is needed now even further, was structural and cultural change. That has been delivered to the benefit of everybody: workers, employers, investors in the building and construction industry, and the wider community. In Western Australia, following new Labor legislation, it is already evident from a series of industrial events that that culture returned in spades late last year and in the last few days.
The Howard government inherited a problem and it devised a solution which has stood us in good stead. We all know that the outcome of that solution was a spectacular success for all concerned including, of course, for the workforce, but with the exception of the militant unions and the potential union donations to this Labor government. By contrast, we have seen the Rudd government inherit that solution and now set about dismantling it. We are heading inevitably back to the problem—and at what speed, as we have seen only in the last few days.
Let us examine the indicators of industrial action over time, and remember that the ABCC came into existence in 2005. In 2004 there were 550,000 working days lost in that industry. In 2005 it halved, to 243,000. By 2006, it was 188,000. By 2007, it was down to 88,000. Then we saw this government come into existence in 2007. By 2008 it had increased to 165,000. In Victoria, one building company alone in 2003 saw 20,000 hours lost in productivity from strikes in that company. In the next year, 2004, 26,500 hours were lost. In 2007, zero hours were lost. For the first two months of 2008, the figure was 1,840. The writing is on the wall. The figures are there for everyone to see.
Failure to retain a tough regulator with strong investigative powers sees a return to the non-productive and undesirable behaviour which was the necessary beginnings of the royal commission in the first place. What would be the effect on the Australian economy if the ABCC is neutered and the amendments to the legislation go through? Let me give you an indication of history, because the best predictor of future behaviour, as we all know, is past behaviour.
What did we see as a result of that legislation coming into place in 2004 and being implemented in 2005? A 7.3 per cent productivity gain in commercial building compared to residential building since 2004—there is that word ‘productivity’, Treasurer, Mr Swan—a 10 per cent addition to labour productivity in the construction industry as a direct result, 10.5 per cent increased performance in the construction industry labour productivity compared to predictions that were made in 2002 and, most importantly, an increase in average weekly earnings per worker in that sector between 2004 and 2007 of 25.5 per cent compared to 15 per cent in all industries. The workforce enjoyed a 10 per cent increase in income over all industries.
In the 2008 report the ABCC’s role in improved productivity was estimated to yield: a 1.5 per cent increase in Australia’s GDP, a 1.2 per cent reduction in the CPI, the price of dwellings driven down by 2.5 per cent, and a gain of $5.1 billion for the economy. Why would anybody be contemplating a change in that circumstance? Costly strikes on industrial action had all but disappeared. Projects were being completed on time and on budget. Once again we were enjoying our international reputation, to which I will return. Importantly again, aggregate earnings by workers increased during that period by $18 million per annum. Of course, we ended up with a far more harmonious industrial relations environment, and we have the Treasurer calling for increased productivity.
Why would the government want to dismantle or to neutralise the ABCC? There are three reasons: first of all, payback for the unions—GST or ‘get square time’, as we were told by Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald in 2007-08—secondly, to weaken the highly effective penalty process; and, thirdly, to emasculate the investigative service, to which I will respond.
The amendment bill proposes a switching-off clause under the new investigative powers of the commission. That means that, if an individual union does not misbehave for a certain time, it will no longer be subject to investigation by the investigators. What is the point of having that sort of legislation in place? If it is to prevent unlawful industrial action, why is there the capacity to switch it off? There is no precedent in Westminster law for the switching off of that provision. Is the government contemplating it for the ATO, for ASIC or for the ACCC? Of course, it is not. Why would it be creating a precedent by introducing a switching-off clause in this legislation?
As we can all see, all of these changes, as pointed out earlier by my colleague Senator Abetz, are simply the Rudd Labor government paying the piper. We know, therefore, who has been calling the tune. Regrettably, this government is inextricably linked to the trade union movement and it has a vested interest in seeing once again an increase in union membership. The union movement provided some 25 per cent of the funds of the ALP in the financial year 2007-08, and they will be looking once again for a return on that investment.
What have we seen in Western Australia in the last couple of months? People tend to forget that this state is the economic powerhouse of the nation. We have seen this month a return to union thuggery in the maritime industry. Companies have been forced to pay increased incomes of up to $50,000 per year with no increase—I stress ‘no increase’, Mr Swan—in productivity. On the Woodside Pluto project we saw before we rose at the end of last year workers going on strike, and they have resumed that strike—this time with the intervention of the CFMEU. People on salaries far higher than we in the Senate enjoy are demanding that their accommodation be left vacant when they are not working. Imagine the scenario where any one of us here in Canberra say to the hotel management as we leave to go back to our own state, ‘Don’t rent out my room because I need it on my return.’
I want to refer to and quote former Labor finance minister and Western Australian senator Peter Walsh. Mr Walsh believes that the $50,000 pay rise without productivity trade-offs won by offshore oil and gas workers could lead to a repeat of the 1974 wages outbreak. Mr Walsh, a finance minister in the Hawke government, said that the agreement could lead to a wages outbreak similar to that experienced in the last years of the Whitlam government. He stated:
I think it’s potentially very dangerous, leading to a more general wages breakout like 1974-75.
If they get away with a wage increase of that size with no offsets, it is potentially dangerous.
You do not need our side of the chamber to be telling people what will inevitably happen in this scenario. We in the west watched with concern last week as we saw the MUA and others undertake this bullying activity. We looked to see what the minister, who has this fresh new legislation in place, would do. I heard her to say that she believed it was the legislation working at its best. If the minister thinks that workers getting a $50,000 a year increase, staggered in over a three-year period, is legislation working at its best, one can only despair about what will happen in the industrial scene in our state and across the nation. If ever there were a time that the ABCC should continue in its present form it is now.
I would like to draw attention to some of the comments made by the previous speaker, Senator Siewert. I refer now to the occupational health and safety fears of the union movement when the ABCC came into place. There was an assertion naturally that we would see an increase in occupational injuries et cetera. It is a well-stated fact that no unlawful act has ever led to increased safety on a workplace. There are many mechanisms which employers and employees can use. I can assure you as an employer of some 30 years experience that a harmonious workplace—where there are good relations between employers and employees—is the way to increase occupational safety and wellbeing, and it is to the benefit obviously of all parties.
Let me quote some of the statistics and put them on the record. These are stats from Safe Work Australia, from only August of last year. They show that not only has there been no increase in injuries in the building and construction industry since the ABCC’s inception; they have in fact gone down. Per 1,000 workers, in 2003-04 there were 27.7 incidents of injury to construction workers. That went down in 2004-05 to 26. It went down further in 2005-06 to 24. It reduced again in 2006-07 to 22. In 2007-08, the last year for which I have statistics, it was 21. That debunks the theory that the introduction of the ABCC would increase unsafe practices in workplaces. It has not. Neither should it and neither would it.
I will speak, if I may, on the concept of industrial harmony. I made the observation earlier that, as an employer of some 30 years experience, in two states of Australia, I know that we must have a harmonious workplace to get productivity gains and to reduce any sort of industrial accident. I have always taken the view that any accident in a workplace is preventable. It should always be the case that employers and employees, management and workers, sit down together to ensure that practices are such that accidents will be minimised.
It was only in November of last year that Westpac produced very, very interesting figures relating to the preceding 12 months, when there was obviously a downturn in employment. Their figures indicated that in the Australian workplace, and in industry in particular, there had been a decrease of only 0.1 per cent in employment whilst there had been a decline of some 2.3 per cent in hours worked. What this indicates is that employers were doing their best to keep employees in the workplace, and because of good bargaining, good relations and industrial harmony they were able to negotiate for people to work fewer hours. That is exactly what we should be looking for in Australia. Nobody wants to put competent workers off, particularly at a time when—as in our state and, I hope, the rest of the nation—we are starting to see an increase in demand.
Speaking again of industrial harmony, I note that surveys undertaken by the Australian Constructors Association four years after the introduction of the building and construction industry improvement legislation indicate that three-quarters, 75 per cent, of employees had a positive reaction to the changes in that industry, 15 per cent indicated no change and only 10 per cent—one in 10—indicated that the changes had been negative. I cannot see why we need to modify or water down this legislation. It has never been my experience that industrial ill will in a workplace has done anything for employers, workers or the bottom line. I can point to innumerable instances in industries with which I have been associated where the reverse is true and where good negotiation, liaison and confidence in a workforce have led to immeasurable gains for everybody.
I conclude with the concept of encouraging overseas investment in Australian industry. The industry in which I was engaged prior to coming into the Senate was the oil and gas industry. It is of enormous importance to our productivity and our long-term commercial wellbeing that we are judged internationally to be responsible in our industrial relations. One need only look at when there was industrial turmoil in the Pilbara. Our overseas trading partners had enormous concerns. I refer also to the lamentable situation in the construction industry in Melbourne when the Japanese company Saizeriya walked away from its intention to invest in that industry. That resulted in the loss of tens of millions of dollars and up to 3,000 jobs.
I know from my own contacts in the oil and gas industry offshore that at this very moment they are watching with increasing concern what is happening in the Maritime Union situation in Western Australia and of course the situation in the Pilbara. These are the people who are shipowners. These are the people who may or may not allow the use of their vessels in our waters. I hope the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is listening, because they are also the people who may or may not bid on contracts involving our oil and gas industry in our waters. I can tell you from personal experience of the last few days that they are increasingly saying, ‘We are not interested,’—

Senator Marshall interjecting—

—I say to my colleague Senator Marshall that they are not interested in placing their vessels or their personnel in Australian waters if indeed we see the industrial action that is likely to happen. I request that Senator Sterle take his colleague to Western Australia, where he can see the powerhouse of the nation and where he can see all of this falling apart.
I conclude with the comment that these amendments must be defeated, the BCII legislation must remain in place unchanged and the commission must be allowed to continue its excellent oversight of the construction industry and related industries. It is regrettable that my Western Australian colleague Senator Siewert did not see what happened in the building and construction industry to cause the Cole commission to come into existence in the first place.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-02-04,"—Mr President, I have checked the record Senator Birmingham so helpfully pointed out, and he is correct. I misspoke yesterday in answer to a question of his. I got excited, obviously, and in my enthusiasm to answer Senator Birmingham’s question on one occasion I used the words ‘fully compensated’ and on the other occasion the term ‘full compensation’. Both are wrong, as I have indicated to him, in terms of the compensation. So describing it as ‘fully’ compensated and ‘full compensation’ was not right. I should have used the word ‘compensation’ without those two words. I apologise to the Senate and therefore seek to correct the record.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,30,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-02-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Senator Birmingham and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Minchin) today relating to the emissions trading scheme and to the proposed national broadband network.
What we have had confirmed today is that the NBN tender process was entirely flawed. In addition to that we have seen that Minister Conroy has misled the Senate. The evidence is on the record—it is on the
Hansard. This process went for some 18 months and we know that it was canned as of April last year. We also know that in February last year the minister, Senator Conroy, misled the Senate when he specifically said that the process was going well. He specifically said that the process was successful. He specifically said, ‘I am very confident it will be successful.’ The minister knew in February last year—this is on the public record—that the process was flawed and yet he came into this chamber and said specifically that the process was in fact not flawed but successful and that, indeed, the outcome would be successful. We know exactly what happened some two months later—it was canned.
As a result, $30 million of taxpayers’ money has been wasted. It has gone down a big black hole, down the gurgler in Canberra, so no taxpayers, no Australian people, will benefit from that whatsoever, apart from of course the many consultants and lawyers—and we do not know how many lawyers’ opinions have been obtained in this process.
The process is set out in this Auditor-General’s report—and as a member of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I know that the Auditor-General’s reports are held in high regard. The Auditor-General is a man worthy of great respect and, indeed, those in the Auditor-General’s office know what they are doing. They are credible. This report I have in my hand right now is a damning indictment of Senator Conroy. It confirms that he has misled the Senate and it also confirms on the public record that $30 million has gone down the drain.
Government senators interjecting—
—It says that the process is flawed.
—It doesn’t say that! Where does it say that?
—It does not say specifically that Senator Conroy has misled the Senate.

Senator Ludwig interjecting—

—Order on my right!
—What we can say based on the
Hansard
of what he said in this parliament in February, that the process is successful and will be successful, is that it has been confirmed today that he misled the Senate. Senator Conroy should come in here and apologise to the Senate. He should say sorry to the Australian taxpayers for the $30 million that has gone down the tube and specifically for misleading the Senate.
In this National Broadband Network process, the $30 million was over an 18-month period. In terms of the costs, that is simply disgraceful. The report talks about the costs and the possibility that, if the process continued, there would be a potential payment of just terms compensation to Telstra for the compulsory acquisition of the right to use its assets, should a non-Telstra proposal be successful. That is set out in the report at page 18. So it was flawed from the beginning, and we know that billions of dollars may have been required to be paid to Telstra as a result. The process was flawed from the beginning, yet it was not canned until 18 months later, in April last year. We know that much.
What else do we know? We know that the government have a history of waste and mismanagement—this comes on the back of GROCERYchoice, Fuelwatch and the schools stimulus debacle in terms of the blow-out in spending. We know that they have spent $1 billion—in fact, it would be in excess of $1 billion now in their more than two years in government—on consultants, when they said they would be cutting consultant expenditure by hundreds of millions of dollars over those years. So the waste and mismanagement is shocking. But today what has been revealed, thanks to the questions from Senator Minchin, is that Senator Conroy has been unable to answer questions put to him in the Senate. It is a great shame. He should hang his head in shame and apologise to the Senate for misleading the Senate and for the gross waste of taxpayers’ money.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,31,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-02-04,"—I am glad that the opposition has chosen to take note of the answers to these two questions because it demonstrates that this new opposition under yet another new opposition leader has not really changed that much. We saw a demonstration in question time today of the climate change sceptics, reinforced again by the behaviour of the new opposition leader, not only with his new policy but by the sceptics with whom he is still happy to associate. We also saw the same global financial crisis scepticism they have demonstrated for the last 12 months. Despite the fact that about half of the opposition’s front bench in the Senate were with us here today, we still saw that very sloppy and audacious approach to policy, and I will deal with part of that when I deal with Senator Evans’s discussion about the issue of compensation that was before us in the Senate today.
Looking at the week, we have had the very sloppy approach to policies that this opposition might take forward in an election year. We have had talk about the very successful My School website, yet a very unclear position and, if I recall the behaviour of the shadow parliamentary secretary for education, some disquiet as to how the nature of the questions being asked in this place reflects the ultimate policy position that this opposition may take. The next day we dealt with workplace relations, and once again there was the approach of trying to have it both ways about how industrial relations arrangements should work in this country. Finally, today, there was again the approach of trying to have things both ways about how we tackle and deal with climate change. There was a failure, as Senator Wong highlighted, to accept what even the previous Prime Minister accepted, that there is a cost that needs to be managed, and that the lack of any compensation arrangements in the coalition’s policy means that cost will need to be borne elsewhere. Even Senator Fielding has acknowledged that it is going to be a cost to our schools, to our education system, to our health system, if we go down the path that is being proposed by Mr Abbott.
Let me deal briefly with the NBN issue. What the audit report did highlight, as Senator Conroy pointed out when he welcomed the report, was that the global financial crisis was a factor in the aborted request for proposals process. This was something Senator Barnett failed to mention at all when he sought to pretend and put into the report comments that simply do not exist. The report does not at all indicate that Senator Conroy misled the Senate. As was highlighted this morning by the Prime Minister when he also dealt with this report, the $17 million needs to be considered not only in the context of what occurred last year with the global financial crisis—which this government has managed in a world-first, successful and enormously creditable process—but also in the context of the overall cost of this program. These are again points that Senator Barnett did not raise.
Let me conclude briefly with some points about the compensation arrangements. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is designed to limit Australia’s carbon emissions—something that Tony Abbott’s program will not be able to do, and certainly not to the magnitude necessary to reach our targets. It does this by making polluters pay for the pollution they produce and rewarding those who reduce their carbon pollution. The scheme includes direct cash assistance for nine out of 10 Australian households, and low-income families are expected to receive 120 per cent of any anticipated costs in direct cash assistance. So there is not only full compensation but more than full compensation. What the opposition failed to understand today was that you can have a tandem approach in relation to compensation. You can have this direct cash assistance but also an ongoing process, which is the annual review of household assistance packages as part of the budget process. So we are saying that not only have we made assessments that we believe will be able to provide adequate compensation but we have also built in a mechanism which will enable us to review that and ensure that Australian households, Australian families, are properly compensated into the future.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-02-04,"—I am pleased to take note of the answers given to questions today by Senator Conroy and Senator Chris Evans. These answers demonstrate that, when it comes to the big issues and when it comes to their massive expenditure, this government does not understand the detail of its own plans or policies. They have no idea how to administer them. They have no idea how they work. They simply waste taxpayers’ money time and time again and hurt the Australian public in the process.
With the release of the Auditor-General’s report yesterday we have seen yet more damning evidence that Senator Conroy and the government have messed up the implementation of the National Broadband Network. It was their big election policy promise. They promised at the time to build a $4.7 billion fibre-to-the-node network and they promised that construction would start within 12 months of their being elected. Instead, we saw delay upon delay upon delay in the way the network tender process was handled. We saw a blow-out in all of the costs related to that network tender process.
We have seen some $30 million of taxpayers’ money wasted by the tender process, a damning report from the Auditor-General and the government in a humiliating backdown saying it would not back down from a policy that it could not achieve but it would up the stakes—double or nothing; in fact, in this case it was 10 times or nothing. They turned it into a $43 billion promise to build a fibre-to-the-home network. That is right: they could not get a tenderer, they could not get the project off the ground to actually build fibre to the node in a $4 billion to $5 billion promise so they times it by 10, decided to roll it around the country and are going to spend $40 billion plus. It is unbudgeted and has no business plan. Quite clearly, this will end up being as unsuccessful as their first failed attempt and will waste many millions of dollars more of taxpayers’ money on lawyers, accountants, consultants and all of those people who did very well out of the tender process—everyone except the Australian taxpayer.
We have evidence within this that Senator Conroy, in promising they would deliver a successful tender right up until the time when it was revealed that they could not, in effect misled this house. He said, ‘We will announce a successful tenderer within the month,’ when he knew full well at that stage they had no capacity to announce a successful tenderer.
We then had Senator Evans having to come in here in a humiliating way at the end of question time and confirm that he too misled the house. Just yesterday he misled the house when he tried to tell the Australian people that 92 per cent of all households would be compensated under the government’s great big new tax, the emissions trading scheme. He said yesterday ‘92 per cent of all households’, claiming of course that basically everyone would be fully compensated. Well far from it that everyone will be fully compensated—far from it indeed. Under the government’s own rather dodgy estimates we will see at least half of all Australian households left worse off as a result of the big new tax, having to fork out more from their own pockets to maintain their standard of living and to pay for their electricity and for all of the consumer goods that that will flow through to.
This government does not know how it is administering its own policies. Senator Evans was deliberately misleading the house, attempting to mislead the Australian people or simply did not understand his own policy. That is the reason he was caught out today and had to come into this chamber and acknowledge that he said the wrong thing yesterday, that he got it wrong.
Then we have the Prime Minister himself being caught out. The Prime Minister in his usual morning television appearances tried to convince the Australian people that he understands the detail of the scheme. He said there would be a one-off adjustment to the price of consumer goods. What rot. If you are having a market system with a variable price for carbon, surely there will be a variable impact flowing through to the price of consumer goods. That is why the government has not promised an annual review of its compensation. It is yet another example of this government—Senator Conroy, Senator Evans and the Prime Minister—getting it wrong on the details of their big picture policies.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-02-04,"—I welcome the opportunity to take note of the answers given by Ministers Chris Evans and Conroy today. I begin by highlighting that Senator Evans’s response was quite clear that we recognise the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will indeed have a modest impact on prices but the government is providing substantial assistance to help households adjust. In contrast, what the coalition has put before us is a giant climate change con job. We know that sceptics have beaten a path to their door. The coalition have tried to argue that the CPRS is a giant tax on households. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The coalition’s policy is certainly a tax. How will it get funded? Certainly that revenue will have to come from the taxpayer. The coalition’s policy completely fails the test. It does not reduce pollution. We know that pollution may indeed grow under the opposition’s policy while billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money—money the government will have to find and taxpayers will have to pay—will be spent on this scheme, and for what? For no outcome. It is a Liberal climate change con job. There is no cost-free way of tackling climate change, as Senator Evans highlighted in question time today.
Who should pay: the taxpayer or the polluter? You say the taxpayer; we say the polluter. Australian emissions under the coalition’s plan will grow and Australian households, who you purport to be so concerned about, will be no better off. Unless you put a hard legislative limit on carbon pollution, polluters will keep polluting and climate change will just get worse. That is why the CPRS puts a limit on emissions. That is why the CPRS charges polluters. If they in turn need to pass costs on to consumers then we compensate them.
By contrast, the climate con job put forward by Mr Abbott does not put a limit on pollution. Mr Abbott thinks climate change is crap, and he has confirmed that again and again. The opposition leader’s climate change plan is nothing more than a climate con job. It does less, it costs more and it will mean higher taxes for Australian families. The opposition’s scheme has three key problems. Firstly, it does not work, it does not require anything of the polluters and it has no cap on pollution. Secondly, it will slug taxpayers instead of big polluters. Thirdly, it is unfunded and it will mean big cuts in services, or higher taxes.
To tackle climate change we know that we need a CPRS or an ETS to transform our economy and to drive pollution down. We have to get on with the job of getting our pollution sources under control, for a greener and more sustainable Australia. The sooner we do this, the less it will cost Australian households. Abbott’s plan will cost this country. Why? Because big polluters will not have a framework to drive down their emissions. Our industry will fall behind what the global effort requires. The coalition has shown that it is out of touch on this issue. The sceptics have beaten a path to the coalition’s door.
We know that more than 30 countries already have emissions trading schemes like the CPRS in operation, and others are working towards schemes of their own. Why? Because they know that these schemes are the most efficient. These schemes will reduce costs for their citizens and their families. We are in step with the rest of the world. There is one lone wolf in this scenario, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. His approach is not being taken by anyone in the world. On the other hand, the Rudd government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is fully costed and funded. We know how much it is going to cost: $3.3 billion over 10 years. The cost is to be met by polluters and, where the cost is passed on to consumers who buy those goods and services, the Commonwealth government will compensate the consumers. By contrast, Mr Abbott’s costings, his climate con job—

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2010-02-04,"—With some pleasure, I rise to take note of answers given by Minister Conroy to questions asked by Senator Minchin. The Auditor-General’s report released yesterday unfortunately shows that not only did the Rudd government waste money with round 1 of the National Broadband Network promise but they deferred getting the expert advice that would have told them that the process was essentially doomed to failure from the start. So they got away with doing just that—wasting money—for a period of time. What has happened? In the process, millions of dollars have been wasted and Australians have come to expect from the Rudd government promises without delivery. Look at the waste of money: megabucks for not one extra megabit under NBN round 1. Unfortunately, history is repeating itself with NBN round 2.
The Auditor-General said of NBN round 1 that the one-stage tender process was ‘not conventional for a competitive assessment process of this size, nature and risk’ and made a complex commercial transaction considerably more complicated. The Auditor-General criticised the prescription of fibre-to-the-node technology in NBN round 1 and noted that it was ‘limited in potential scalability’. The Auditor-General concluded that, while the Rudd government was made aware of key risks and their broad significance in early advice that it received from the department, the consequences of some of these key risks were not fully assessed until late in the request for tender process.
History is repeating itself. The best that the minister can say about the Auditor-General’s report is, ‘No recommendations.’ The minister is like a naughty schoolboy who has been rapped over the knuckles. In fact, he has had ‘the cuts’. The Auditor-General has given Minister Conroy the cuts, but Minister Conroy is trying to say, ‘But it’s okay. He didn’t expel me from school, so I should be able to chance repeating the same mistakes with NBN round 2.’ And NBN round 2 is repeating the same mistakes: mega-bucks for not one new megabit. There is not one new customer under NBN round 2. There is not one new internet connection. But there is a CEO of NBN Co. who is being paid $1.95 million a year. There is a government relations manager who is being paid almost $500,000. The company has not yet delivered one new internet connection, one new megabit, one new customer or one new service. History repeats itself.
History repeats itself again with the minister deferring getting expert advice until it is arguably too late. The minister has again and again deferred answering questions about who will get what, when they will get it, where they will get it and how they will get it under NBN round 2 until the implementation study is delivered. We are led to believe that that will be delivered at the end of February this year. The government is again seeking to defer the gaining and release of independent and external advice as to the risks of its NBN round 2. So history is repeating itself with NBN round 2. Megabucks were spent for not one new megabit under NBN round 1. Thus far the situation is exactly the same under NBN round 2: megabucks being spent and not one new megabit. We look forward to seeing history not being repeated post the receipt of the implementation study. We look forward to seeing Australians getting the national broadband network that they deserve.

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND EXTERNAL TERRITORIES


INQUIRY INTO THE IMMIGRATION BRIDGE PROPOSAL


MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS


JANUARY 2010


Introduction

On 25 February 2009, the then Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Bob Debus MP, requested the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories to inquire into and report on:
1. The process adopted by Immigration Bridge Australia (IBA) to settle the design for the Immigration Bridge (the Bridge) taking into account:
the heritage values of Lake Burley Griffin and its foreshore, and
the interests of users of the Lake.
2. The process that has been adopted by IBA to raise funds for the construction and ongoing maintenance of the Bridge.
3. The approval process required under the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 if an application for approval of the Bridge were received by the National Capital Authority.
The Committee tabled its report on 29 May 2009.

Government Response


Recommendation 1


The Committee recommends that in the interest of improving its transparency and accountability Immigration Bridge Australia:
clarify its refund policy in relation to the History Handrail program; and
make its financial documents publicly available on its website.
The Government notes this recommendation.


Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that if the proposed IBA bridge is ceded to the Commonwealth, then the government should ensure that agreement to receive the bridge is met by increased funding to the NCA to manage its ongoing maintenance
The Government notes this recommendation. If the IBA proposal proceeds and the Commonwealth Government were to agree to accept the proposed bridge as an asset gifted to the nation, any financial implications would be considered as part of the normal budget processes.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that Immigration Bridge Australia seeks to reconcile competing issues relating to Lake users, vista and heritage value of the Lake and its foreshores.
If IBA finds that this challenge cannot be met or its development application for the proposed bridge is unsuccessful then IBA should consider:
changing the location of the proposed bridge; or

proposing an alternative memorial to migration.
The Government notes this recommendation.

JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO REPORT 413


‘THE EFFICIENCY DIVIDEND AND SMALL AGENCIES: SIZE DOES MATTER’


JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT


(JCPAA) REPORT NO. 413


‘The efficiency dividend and small agencies: size does matter’


Recommendation No. 1


The Committee recommends that, in addition to being adequately funded for other assurance activities, the Australian National Audit Office be funded to conduct the number of performance audits that is determined by the Auditor-General and endorsed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.


Not agreed.


In the 2009-10 Budget, the Government announced that it will provide an additional $20.1 million over four years to increase the resource base of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). This will allow the ANAO to enhance its auditing activities, including performance audits, information technology audits and other specialist audit activities and increase technical support and quality assurance capability.




The Government considers it appropriate that decisions on the future funding for the ANAO continue to be subject to the usual budgetary processes in which proposals for additional funding are considered against other competing priorities.


Recommendation No. 2


The Committee recommends that the Government establish a parliamentary commission co-chaired by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate and comprising elected representatives to recommend funding levels for the parliamentary departments in each Budget


Noted.


The Government considers it appropriate that decisions on the future funding for the parliamentary departments continue to be subject to the usual budgetary processes in which proposals for additional funding are considered against other competing priorities.


The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate are, of course, still able to put forward funding proposals in accordance with the budgetary rules and processes in place at the time. It is open to the Speaker and President to make arrangements to increase the input by elected representatives into such proposals as they see fit.


Recommendation No. 3


The Committee recommends that the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the Australian Public Service Commissioner and each cultural agency jointly develop a new funding model for cultural agencies. This model should recognise the importance of funding the mandate for growth and development of collections and the proportion of their expenses apportioned to depreciation.


The Committee notes that recommendation 8 will also apply to these agencies


Agreed in principle.


The Minister for Finance and Deregulation announced on 9 December 2008, as part of Operation Sunlight, that the Government would phase out funding of depreciation and other non-cash items and introduce the appropriation of general government sector agencies on the basis of net cash requirements. The new arrangements have been introduced from the 2009-10 Budget for Collecting Institutions (such as the National Library of Australia, the Australian War Memorial, and the National Gallery of Australia) which have been provided with a Collection Development Acquisition Budget for Heritage and Cultural assets.


This revised funding model provides greater transparency of appropriations to agencies and their use in the acquisition, maintenance, replacement and disposal of assets.


The Government does not consider that the development of funding models for cultural agencies requires the direct involvement of the Australian Public Service Commissioner.


Recommendation No. 4


The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General establish an independent body to recommend funding levels for the Commonwealth courts. The courts should be treated as a separate ‘portfolio’ under the Attorney-General in the Budget process and in the Budget papers.


Not agreed.


The Government considers it appropriate that decisions on the future funding for the courts continue to be subject to the usual budgetary processes in which proposals for additional funding are considered against other competing priorities and in light of prevailing budget constraints.


The Government notes that ‘courts and tribunals’ are one of fifteen matters listed under the mantle of ‘law and justice’ within the Attorney-General’s Department (according to the Administrative Arrangements Order dated 25 January 2008). The Government does not consider there to be a case for the excision of this one function over the fourteen others for the purposes of the budget process. Such action could also set an undesirable precedent in relation to the functions of other Departments of State. Furthermore, as the courts are already appropriated on an individual basis within the Attorney-General’s portfolio, the Government is unable to discern that any advantage would be achieved by treating the courts as a separate portfolio under the Attorney-General.


Recommendation No. 5


The Committee recommends that the Government investigate whether the courts’ appropriations should be included in the appropriation bills for the ordinary annual services of the Government.


Noted.


The Government considers that establishing separate appropriation bills for the courts would not, in itself, lead to increased efficiency or enhanced transparency nor provide any additional financial benefits to the courts. The courts would remain subject to the Government’s normal budgetary processes and practices, including the new policy proposal process, the efficiency dividend, and parameter indexation arrangements.


This recommendation is being further considered by the Government in relation to the High Court.


Recommendation No. 6


The Committee recommends that, where Finance generates savings through coordinated procurement, 50 per cent of the savings should be made available to the agencies for investment in projects designed to lift their efficiency and effectiveness.


Noted.


The Government realises savings through both agency and program specific measures, and through whole of government measures. It determines the allocation of all resources, including those savings generated by coordinated procurement in the context of its overall fiscal strategy and objectives.







For example, in January 2009, the Government established a Volume Sourcing Arrangement (VSA) with Microsoft, as the first of several initiatives to be completed under the Government’s Coordinated Procurement Contracting Framework. The Microsoft VSA is expected to deliver annual savings of at least $15 million, for four years commencing in July 2009. Under the VSA, agencies retain any savings made, less a small administration fee.


Similarly, the Government has developed Guidelines on Recruitment Advertising that will specify the maximum size and placement of recruitment advertisements. The use of these guidelines is expected to result in more efficient recruitment advertising expenditure across FMA Act agencies, delivering value for money for taxpayers. The Government has decided that any savings achieved by a department or agency from applying the Guidelines on Recruitment Advertising may be retained by the relevant department or agency.


Recommendation No. 7


The Committee recommends that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet convene a taskforce with membership from key agencies, including the Australian Public Service Commission, to conduct and publish further analysis on:

the relationship between gender wage disparities and agency size and function;
the relationship between wage disparities generally and agency size and function; and
whether staff classifications continue to represent equivalent levels of skills, responsibility and experience across agencies.

If collecting further data or enhancing databases is required, the agencies involved should receive supplementary funding.


Agreed in part.


A Working Group, comprising the Departments of: the Prime Minister and Cabinet; Education, Employment and Workplace Relations; Treasury, and Finance and Deregulation; and the Australian Public Service Commission will undertake further work in this area including an examination of the relationship between wage disparities and agency size and function and the adequacy of classification management arrangements (within and across agencies).


Consideration will be given to the publication of the Working Group’s findings following completion of this work. Any need for supplementary funding for additional data collection by Australian Public Service agencies will be considered as part of the normal budget processes and subject to budget constraints.


Recommendation No. 8


The Committee recommends that the Government either:

exempt the first $50 million of all agencies’ appropriations from the efficiency dividend, excluding departments of state (the preferred option); or
exempt the first $50 million of the appropriations of all agencies that have departmental expenses of less than $150 million, excluding departments of state.

These benchmarks to be indexed over time.


Not agreed.


While the Government appreciates the work of the Committee in the formulation of the above recommendations, it notes that the efficiency dividend framework has been an integral part of successive governments’ efforts to introduce an effective mechanism to secure public service efficiencies, thus allowing the Australian taxpayer to share in these gains. It also reiterates that the efficiency dividend is intended to provide an ongoing incentive for agencies to operate efficiently and make further productivity gains, irrespective of their size.


The Government considers that it is reasonable to expect agencies to pursue efficiencies which enable the Government to consider priorities for reallocating resources. In response to the claim that efficiencies have generally been delivered by small agencies and that the impact of the efficiency dividend is now resulting in reductions in outputs, the Government considers that the pursuit of efficiencies is an ongoing process, and there is an imperative for both small and larger agencies to contribute.


The Government accepts that, from time to time, circumstances may arise in individual smaller agencies that magnify the impact of the efficiency dividend. The Government believes that, where this does occur, the situation should be addressed individually on its merits, rather than by a blanket exemption. To this end, in the 2009-10 Budget the Government provided an additional $20.1 million over four years (including capital funding of $0.9 million) to the Australian National Audit Office for enhanced professional capability.

Government Response to Report 91 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties regarding Treaties between Australia and the United Arab Emirates on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters


The Extradition Treaty


General comments

The Government thanks the Committee for its consideration of the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the State of the United Arab Emirates. In expressing its conclusions on the Extradition Treaty, the Committee stated ‘it has concerns in relation to the general operation of Australia’s current treaty model for extradition’. It said that ‘Australia’s responsibility for persons extradited from Australia should not end at the conclusion of the extradition process, but should extend to monitoring the detention of extradited persons, the judicial proceedings they are subject to, their sentencing and their imprisonment.’
The Government appreciates the Committee’s views on this issue. However, the imposition of a general monitoring scheme for Australia’s extradition arrangements as proposed by the Committee would represent a significant and substantial change to such arrangements, and would significantly alter the basis on which extraditions are conducted in terms of both Australian and international practice.
Australia is currently a party to 34 modern bilateral extradition treaties and more than 20 multilateral treaty instruments which include extradition obligations, and also participates in various non‑treaty arrangements based on understandings of reciprocity. None of the existing arrangements provide for monitoring of persons following extradition, and the Government is not aware of any international extradition agreements which contemplate such measures.
Australia could seek to have such measures included in extradition treaties. However, given the novelty of the proposed measures in the context of established practice, attempts to impose such measures, whether by treaty provision or otherwise, are likely to be strongly resisted by our existing and potential extradition partners, including on the grounds the measures would infringe the criminal justice processes and sovereignty of the requesting State. Insistence on such measures as a general condition of extradition is likely to preclude effective extradition relationships with a significant number of existing and future extradition partners. This would risk Australia becoming a safe haven for fugitives from many countries.
In general terms – and as a matter of international practice – the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which to a large extent codifies customary international law, provides for a State’s right to directly monitor proceedings against its nationals who are subject to detention or prosecution in another State. Accordingly, while Australia may implement monitoring measures in relation to Australian nationals extradited overseas (and has done so), the Vienna Convention does not provide any right to access citizens of other countries. There are also practical obstacles to extending this type of arrangement to all persons extradited from Australia, including the resources and expertise that would need to be deployed.
To the extent the Committee’s concerns relate to the potential abuse of the human rights of persons who are extradited from Australia, the Government considers such concerns are more appropriately addressed in the context of the extradition process, rather than through the establishment of a detailed monitoring mechanism. Such a mechanism could only come into effect after the event, would be dependent on the preparedness of the government of the relevant country and the relevant local legislation to allow such monitoring and could not provide any legal basis for Australia to act on concerns in relation to the person surrendered. Thus, for example, if there is a real risk that the person may be subject to the death penalty or torture upon surrender, then extradition must be refused as a matter of law, according to subsection 22(3) of the Extradition Act 1988. This approach is consistent with Australia’s settled approach to the removal of persons through other processes, such as under the Migration Act 1958, and with Australia’s obligations under international human rights treaties. Under those treaties, any assessment of whether a person may be subject to the death penalty or torture must be carried out before their removal from Australia, not after.

Recommendation 1

The Committee supports the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the State of the United Arab Emirates and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.
The Government accepts this recommendation, and will arrange the making of regulations under the Extradition Act 1988 in order to implement the treaty.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that new and revised extradition agreements should explicitly provide a requirement that the requesting country provide annual information concerning the trial status and health of extradited persons and the conditions of the detention facilities in which they are held.
The Government does not accept this recommendation. It is not aware of any precedents for such a requirement in existing bilateral and multilateral extradition agreements. Many current and potential extradition partners would not be prepared to accept explicit obligations of this nature in extradition agreements. A requirement to provide such information in relation to all persons who have been subject to extradition to or from Australia would also impose significant and unwarranted administrative burdens on the justice and correctional authorities of the relevant jurisdictions.

Recommendation 3

That the Australian Government develop and implement formal monitoring arrangements for Australia’s bilateral extradition treaties which include the following elements:
The Attorney-General’s Department informs the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of each extradition, including the terms of the relevant extradition agreement and any special conditions applying to the case.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would be expected to formally monitor all extradited Australians through the consular network.
In the event that a foreign national is extradited to their country of citizenship, the extradition should be made on the understanding that the Australian Government will be informed through its diplomatic representatives of the outcome of the prosecution and the ongoing status of the person while in custody as a result of a conviction. The Australian consular networks would be expected to monitor and report on the condition of the extradited person until they have served their sentence and were released.
In the event that a foreign national is extradited to a third country, the extradited person’s country of citizenship should be informed and asked to monitor that person’s trial status and health and the conditions of the detention facility in which they are held and report to the Australian Government if it has the capacity and is willing to do so. In the event that an extradited person’s country of citizenship does not have the capacity to monitor the extradited person or is not willing to do so, then the Australian Government should monitor the person’s trial status and health and the conditions of the detention facility in which they are held through Australia’s consular network until that person is acquitted or, if convicted and imprisoned, their sentence is served, they are released and leave the country.
The Government does not accept this recommendation. As outlined above, Australia is able to implement monitoring mechanisms in relation to Australian nationals detained overseas (including persons who have been extradited from Australia), and has done so. However, this does not apply in relation to foreign nationals. The Government recognises it has a specific role in relation to the welfare of Australian nationals, and this accords with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which provides an exception to the general rule of non‑interference in relation to monitoring the welfare of nationals.
Australia’s ability to introduce monitoring regimes for non-Australians extradited overseas would depend, in the first instance, on the consent of the requesting country. As outlined above, we assess that many foreign countries would not be prepared to accept such arrangements. There is no provision for such regimes under our extradition treaties or other international instruments, so it would not be lawfully open to Australia to insist on such arrangements as a condition of extradition.
As a matter of practice, the provision of such assistance to foreigners who have been extradited overseas would place pressure on the limited resources of Australia’s consular network, which has been established to assist Australians overseas.
In summary, the Government will maintain the following measures:
(a) The Attorney-General’s Department will continue to inform the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of each extradition of an Australian citizen and permanent resident, including the terms of the extradition and any special conditions applying to the case.
(b) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to monitor all extradited Australian citizens and permanent residents through the consular network, to the extent that this is practically and legally possible (the Vienna Convention only specifically refers to consular rights in relation to Australian citizens, and in any case, Australian citizens or residents may at any time refuse assistance or withdraw their consent to being monitored).
(c) In relation to foreign nationals sought for extradition from Australia by a third country, the question of monitoring the person following extradition is fundamentally a matter for the person and his or her country of nationality. When foreign nationals are detained in Australia (e.g., in the context of extradition proceedings), law enforcement officers must inform them that they are entitled to request that their consular authorities be informed of their detention, and the consular authorities are entitled to visit and communicate with the relevant person, including in relation to the extradition. Once an extradition has taken place, it is the responsibility of the requesting country to enable consular access to the foreign national as appropriate.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General’s Department and/or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade include in their annual report to Parliament the following information concerning the operation of Australia’s extradition agreements:
the number of extradition requests made, granted and refused including the countries making the requests and the alleged offences involved;
whether any waivers to provisions in an extradition treaty have been sought by any country and, if so, whether they were granted;
the number of persons extradited (Australian citizens, permanent residents of Australia, foreign nationals); and
whether any breaches of bilateral extradition agreements have been noted by Australian authorities and what action was taken.
Also, in respect of each extradited person the following details should be reported:
their name, nationality and the country to which they have been extradited;
the person’s trial status, i.e. whether they have been tried and sentenced, and the period of detention prior to trial;
the means of monitoring the trial status and health of extradited persons and the conditions of the detention facilities in which they are held, i.e. through the Australian consular network or by some other means; and
the outcome of the trial, if applicable, including convictions and sentencing.
The Government accepts this recommendation in part. The Attorney-General’s Department has provided information on extradition matters in its annual reports to Parliament dating back to the late 1980s. This information currently includes the number of requests made, granted and refused, the countries which have made extradition requests (except in limited circumstances where the existence of a request prior to arrest of the person may alert the person to pending law enforcement interest), the number and nationality of persons who have been extradited, and the categories of offences for which extradition has been granted.
In response to the Committee’s recommendation, the Government will include the following additional information in annual reports of the Attorney-General’s Department:
(a) in relation to extradition requests granted by Australia, future reports will identify the categories of the relevant offences by reference to the countries which made the request
(b) information on the number of Australian permanent residents extradited, and
(c) information on any breaches of substantive obligations under bilateral extradition agreements noted by Australian authorities.
The Committee’s recommendation for the inclusion of information on requests for ‘waivers to provisions in an extradition treaty’ appears to relate to requests for waiver of the speciality rule in accordance with the provisions of the relevant treaty (e.g., as provided for in Article 14 of the Extradition Treaty with the United Arab Emirates). The Government agrees to include such information in future annual reports for the Attorney-General’s Department.
In relation to the proposed reporting of details in respect of each extradited person, the Government does not support the inclusion of any details expressly identifying the individuals (including the person’s name). Although proceedings to determine eligibility for extradition are generally open to the public, this does not apply to subsequent stages of the extradition process. The ongoing and widespread publication of details regarding identifiable individuals through reports to Parliament would represent an unwarranted intrusion into their privacy.
As outlined in our response to recommendation 3, the Government will maintain monitoring measures in relation to extradited Australian citizens and permanent residents, to the extent this is practically and legally possible. The relevant details regarding such persons (without expressly identifying the persons) will be included in annual reports for the Attorney‑General’s Department.

The Mutual Assistance Treaty

The Government thanks the Committee for its consideration of the Treaty between Australia and the State of the United Arab Emirates on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.

Recommendation 5

The Committee supports the Treaty between Australia and the State of the United Arab Emirates on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.
The Government accepts this recommendation, and will arrange the making of regulations under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 in order to implement the treaty.

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security be asked to undertake a general review of Australian policy and procedures concerning police-to-police cooperation and other information exchanges, including intelligence sharing arrangements, with a view to developing new instructions to regulate police-to-police and other assistance arrangements not governed by agreements at the treaty level. The instructions should prevent the exchange of information with another country if doing so would expose an Australia citizen to the death penalty.
The Government does not accept this recommendation. The functions of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) are defined by statute and limited to certain reviews in respect of Commonwealth intelligence and security agencies. The functions of the PJCIS do not extend to review of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The proposed inquiry would fall largely outside the statutory terms of reference for the PJCIS.
In May 2008, prior to the release of the Committee’s report, the Attorney-General directed the Attorney-General’s Department and the Australian Federal Police to review procedures for assistance in foreign investigations and prosecutions which may involve the possible application of the death penalty. The Government will announce the outcomes of the review once it has been completed.

Government Response to Report 91 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties regarding Film Co-production Agreements with China and Singapore.


Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that where the subject matter of a treaty has bearing upon freedom of expression issues, the Australian Government broaden its consultation to include relevant human rights organisations.
The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) will consult with relevant human rights organisations, particularly those with an interest in freedom of expression issues, as part of the process for assessing potential film co-production treaty partner countries.
The Attorney-General’s Department has provided DEWHA with a list of relevant human rights organisations which could be consulted as part of this process. DEWHA will also consult with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to identify any freedom of expression issues in a potential treaty partner country.

Recommendation 9

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government utilise any opportunities to make representations to the Chinese Government to lift its 20 foreign film quota significantly higher, with a view to eventually abolishing the quota.
The Government accepts Recommendation 9.
With China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001, the Chinese Government undertook to allow the importation of 20 foreign films per annum as one of its audiovisual commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The commitment provides for the theatrical release of these films on a revenue sharing basis, and reserves the right of the Chinese Government to regulate services associated with their distribution.
As noted by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts at the Committee hearings, film projects approved as official co‑productions under the Australia-China film co-production agreement will be treated as national films affording them preferential access to China’s distribution and exhibition sectors, effectively bypassing the foreign film quota to which other countries remain subject.
The Government will endeavour to facilitate the further opening up of China’s audiovisual sector.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,33,1

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-02-04,"—I seek leave to move a motion to provide for the
Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Re-registration of Providers and Other Measures) Bill 2009
to be recommitted immediately to enable the reconsideration of amendments and consideration of further amendments.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Re-registration of Providers and Other Measures) Bill 2009 be recommitted immediately and that the committee reconsider amendments and consider further amendments
I thank the minister for allowing this to take place. Earlier today this bill proceeded to its third reading stage. Because of a misunderstanding in the minister’s office—which we understand; there are busy times in ministers’ offices—regarding the nonmovement of an amendment by Senator Xenophon and an indication that we would not divide on a particular amendment moved by the coalition, we feel it necessary to recommit the bill. I understand the government are going to cooperate and be understanding with the recommittal. Once we move back into the committee stage, Senator Cormann will be asking the chamber to consider schedule 1, item 11, as per sheet 5969 revised. Senator Xenophon will be moving amendments that he did not have an opportunity to move in the earlier session. They will be amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 6041 revised. I believe he will be seeking leave to move those together.
The rearrangement of the order of business today was done quite rapidly at times and that did not facilitate the smooth passage of the legislation. We understand the government needs to do that from time to time. That would be a fairly significant reason as to why the government is cooperating with the recommittal of this bill. Because of the misunderstanding and because of the confusion that has arisen, mainly emanating from the minister’s office, we feel this is the best course of action so that the full function of the Senate is preserved and the will of the Senate in relation to all amendments is properly considered and properly voted on.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT (RE-REGISTRATION OF PROVIDERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,37,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2010-02-04,"—I would like to speak to that proposition, Mr Deputy President. There is no confusion in the minister’s office, none whatsoever.
—Don’t go there.
—Order!
—I will be very clear about this, Senator Parry. The government are agreeing to the recommittal of this matter because we have a longstanding principle here that there is no point carrying a proposition which does not reflect the will of the Senate. But let us be clear about the circumstances. This morning Senator Xenophon and the Greens were not present in the chamber when the matter came before the chamber. Senator Cormann was asked whether he wished to move the amendment in their stead. He chose not to. I understand that senators are busy; I understand that they may well have other commitments. But there was no confusion, on behalf of the government, about this matter. There was none whatsoever. We do not support this amendment. We still do not support this amendment. If this amendment is carried, which I believe it will be according to the numbers people have indicated, this bill as a consequence will have to return to the House of Representatives and the international student colleges and the international providers will not have the protection of this bill.
—That is your issue.
—It might be your attitude that it is our issue. It is your irresponsibility that is going to force this industry to be without protection. That will be the point that we will make very loudly and very clearly. There will be no confusion on our part about your responsibility in this fiasco.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT (RE-REGISTRATION OF PROVIDERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,37,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-02-04,"—I am surprised that I am now in a position where I have to participate in this debate at this point in time. The opposition was going to facilitate, as we were keen to facilitate this morning, the easy passage of this legislation in the public interest. Senator Parry was very generous with the minister. Talking about confusion in the minister’s office was a very generous way of describing what happened today. If I can advise the Senate, I received a call from the minister this morning and he advised me that this legislation would come up after non-controversial legislation. But, rather than coming up after noncontroversial legislation, it came up at 12.30 pm, when neither Senator Hanson-Young nor Senator Xenophon were in the chamber. I understand that both Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Xenophon had been advised the same. Now I see them nod so I assume that they were advised by the government along the same lines.
Not only that but in that conversation this morning Senator Carr told me that Senator Xenophon would not be supporting our amendment. On that basis and in the spirit of facilitating passage of this legislation, given that the Greens had given me an indication that they would not be supporting our amendment, I did not call for a division because I did not want to waste the Senate’s time. That was based on the advice from Senator Carr in the conversation this morning. When I arrived in this chamber at 12.30 it was a coincidence. I did not know that this legislation would be coming up at 12.30 pm, because we had been advised that it would be coming up sometime after non-controversial legislation and that it should come up at a quarter past one. I had a private conversation across the chamber with Senator Carr, during which he advised me very explicitly that Senator Xenophon would not be proceeding with his amendment either. As it turns out that was untrue.
That is why I am putting it to the chamber that Senator Parry was being very generous by talking about the misunderstanding. We have had a history of this. This minister is so arrogant, is such a bully and is so aggressive that he cannot help himself. Even today, when we are here to help him facilitate this, he has come in as a bully boy again. Yesterday he was abusing my staff from this chamber. He was talking about people in my office not returning phone calls. That was untrue. I went back to my office and confirmed this, and I was very surprised but I was not going to pick on it again.
The first conversation my office had with anybody from the government on this legislation was on Tuesday night this week, when a lady called Rhonda—and I cannot remember her surname—called my office and ended up talking to an electorate officer. Because the electorate officer was not able to give a detailed explanation on the intent and breadth of the amendments we were about to make, she became quite rude and offensive and off she went. My chief of staff rang her back and there was never any suggestion that we would not be proceeding with the amendments, like the minister suggested. There was never any suggestion that we would be dealing with this matter in non-controversial legislation, because we think the amendments that we are moving and the amendment that Senator Xenophon is moving are important amendments that have to be properly considered. So there have been a lot of dodgy conversations going on, a lot of dodgy misrepresentation going on and a lot of bully tactics going on.
Minister, this is not the way to get cooperation in this chamber. We think it is an important piece of legislation. We are surprised that you are not prepared to entertain amendments that will make this better legislation. We understand that the way this legislation was introduced, all the way back in August last year, was as part of a political strategy for the Deputy Prime Minister. That legislation was introduced two days before she announced her trip to India. We know that was part of the political strategy. You have not progressed this over the last six to seven months. You have wasted weeks and weeks in this chamber with legislation you knew would never have the support of the Senate when you could have been dealing with this, which was much more important.
These are amendments which will be quite important to improve this piece of legislation. Clearly, your attitude to all of this is that you want to pass this legislation so you can be seen to be doing something without doing anything. The reason you will not be supporting these amendments is that you think it is going to cost us some money. You do not want to do anything that is going to cost the government some money. This is going to make a difference and protect overseas students who are stranded across Australia because of colleges that are collapsing on your watch, Minister. You do not want to put anything into this legislation that will actually make a tangible difference and ensure that the education providers out there are proper, professional providers—and not those cowboys that seem to collapse every couple of months—or to ensure sure that students who are caught up with cowboys are properly protected.
Minister, you can carry on with your bullying tactics. We were going to deal with this quite nicely, quite gently and in a speedy fashion; but if this is the way you want to play it, keep on playing and we will keep on playing with you. But I do not know that it is going to do you any favours and I do not think it is in the interests of the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT (RE-REGISTRATION OF PROVIDERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,37,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-02-04,"—I do not intend to take more than about two minutes of the Senate’s time and I hope that what I have to say is seen as conciliatory by both sides of the chamber. I think it would be fair to say that, through a series of unfortunate events, the will of the Senate was not properly reflected in the vote in respect of this bill. I am not criticising anyone for that. I can say in relation to my not being in the chamber that I wrongly assumed that this matter was coming up after non-controversial business. I am not criticising anyone for that. I have learnt some lessons from today about trying to manage things better but I think there were some genuine misunderstandings all round and I do not ascribe any malice or bad faith on the part of anyone in this chamber leading to that series of events.
I respect Senator Carr’s position—that he does not agree with these amendments—but I think the process is important, that we deal with this. Also, as Senator Carr acknowledged, I think, quite fairly, this is about reflecting the will of the Senate and that is why the government has not taken issue with this. I hope we can move on with this debate without ascribing any blame, so that we can deal with the substance of the amendments; then, of course, the government is entitled to reject them and we will deal with them in two or three weeks time.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT (RE-REGISTRATION OF PROVIDERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,37,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-02-04,"—I do not intend to take up too much of the Senate’s time this afternoon either. I thank the Senate for its cooperation in allowing this discussion and, hopefully, recommitting the bill to the committee stage so that we can have the will of the Senate reflected appropriately. It was very clear, in this chamber last night, where the Greens stood on all the amendments. I made that very clear in my speech in the second reading debate and I made that clear in the last committee stage.
I must say that the Greens have had a good relationship with the Deputy Prime Minister’s office through negotiating on this bill, trying to strengthen it, and that is why I tabled the agreement that I did yesterday. There was always the option of being able to strengthen the bill beyond that, and that is what the amendment put forward by Senator Xenophon and me is doing. I am sad, I must say, to hear that the same type of cooperation and good faith was not necessarily presented to us here in the chamber this afternoon when it was assumed across the chamber, whether it was in a private conversation or not, that perhaps Senator Xenophon and I were withdrawing that amendment. We were very clear last night that we would not be doing that and there was no indication that we would be doing that. In reconciliation, wanting to step forward and give international students the protection they deserve, let us move forward in good faith, recommit to the committee stage and get on with it.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-02-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In relation to that report honourable senators will be aware of my comments earlier in the week about the influence of the trade union movement on the ALP. The figures released by the commission on Monday showed that a staggering $4.65 million was paid by unions directly to ALP coffers. On top of that massive $4.65 million there was a further $6.1 million spent on direct political campaigning by the unions on behalf of the Labor government.
I have done a bit of work in relation to this and I have been asking myself for some time, ‘What’s the relationship between the Labor members and senators and their particular unions?’
Honourable senators interjecting—
—It was actually $5.1 million directed to the ALP. I looked at where the greatest union representation was in these chambers and where the dollars from the unions came from. The only one, interestingly, that seems to be getting a pretty fair deal is the TWU; the TWU is getting a lot of representation for not many dollars. But if you look at the graph it is quite remarkable; you can see the similarity between the graph showing the donations and the graph showing the membership of the trade unions. If you have a look at it you will see the shoppies, the TWU, the miscos, the AWU, the AMWU and the ASU and you will see that the two graphs are almost identical. So what this is telling us is that the influence of the union movement is directly related to the membership of the unions in this place. As I said, it seems that the TWU, for some particular reason—I am not entirely sure why!—is getting a fairly free run.
I want to talk about media reports on the influence of the trade union movement in relation to campaign finance reform. Just before I get onto that, the research that I did showed that the unions which have the largest number of affiliated senators in this place are the ones making the biggest donations.
I want to talk about the influence of the trade union movement on the Australian Labor Party, particularly in reference to the matters shown in that AEC report and in a general sense. Everyone, in this place and outside, knows that the Australian Labor Party owes—o-w-e-s—the trade union movement. And everyone knows that the Trade union movement owns—o-w-n-s—the Australian Labor Party. They are a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Labor Party. And the line that is run—that historically the corporate sector were bigger donors to the conservative side of politics, and that that was squared up by the donations of the unions—is now simply not true. If honourable senators want to look at the report they will see that it shows a consistent trend over recent times that the corporate dollars are flowing almost equally to the conservative side of politics as they are to the Labor Party.
During January it was reported, quite clearly, that something is going on in relation to campaign finance reform. Someone is trying to stop this occurring. There is a lot of media speculation—not driven by me but certainly supported by me—that the union movement had stepped in to ensure that campaign finance reform was put on the backblock because the union movement is not prepared to see its influence diminished by campaign finance reform.
I just want to quote from Eric Roozendaal, who was then the New South Wales Labor Treasurer. He said:
Severing financial ties would be a prelude to severing institutional ties between the Labor Party and unions. Unions and the Labor Party were forged together and we will stand together—no matter what.
He went on to say:
I understand the need to reform political fundraising and deal with the challenge of corporate donations ... but I’m concerned that when you start tampering with the relationship between the union movement and the Labor Party—

(Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Ronaldson, your time has expired. I was trying to understand your earlier joke so I let the time run on a little bit. I am sorry. There are a lot of documents on the
Notice Paper, and I understand there may be other senators wishing to speak. You can seek leave to continue your remarks, which keeps it on the
Notice Paper.

—I seek leave to continue my remarks for a period of no longer than one minute.
Leave granted.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I thank those opposite. It is the first week, and I think it is a marvellous gesture. I want to finish on this basis—and I will requote Mr Roozendaal:
I understand the need to reform political fundraising and deal with the challenge of corporate donations, but I am concerned that when you start tampering with the relationship between the union movement and the Labor party it becomes a precursor to eventually dismantling that relationship.
These, as well as my earlier quote about the severing of the financial ties, are the key words. The trade union movement is not prepared to sever these ties. Mr Roozendaal is happy to attack corporate donations but is not prepared to attack union donations. This is dangerous. We are now seeing campaign finance reform potentially being put on the backburner because the trade union—(Time expired)

Response by Vicki Dunstan on behalf of the Church of Scientology


Pursuant to Resolution 5(7)(b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988


Reply to comments by Senator Nicholas Xenophon in the Senate –


17 November 2009

Pursuant to resolution 5 (7) (b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988 I make this submission on behalf of the Church of Scientology regarding comments made in the Senate concerning the Church by Senator Nicholas Xenophon on the evening of 17 November 2009.
At the outset, the Church of Scientology notes that Senator Xenophon’s statements under Parliamentary privilege were false and unsubstantiated, and that they were apparently designed to adversely affect the reputation of the Church of Scientology, its staff and their association with others.
The Church of Scientology is a worldwide religion comprising over 8,000 Churches, Missions and affiliated groups, made up of millions of members in 165 countries of the world. The Church and its members are globally recognized sponsors of successful humanitarian programs addressing societal ills such as drug abuse, illiteracy, human rights and intolerance.
The Church’s more than 200,000 Volunteer Ministers are an active force in disaster relief efforts worldwide. Scientologists volunteer their help, both in times of major disasters, such as the Victoria Fires, and in times of more personal disasters that befall all of us. The Church’s bright yellow Volunteer Minister tents can be seen in such diverse locations as the Sydney Metropolitan area to Alice Springs. When the devastating Asian Tsunami of 2004 struck, more than 500 Volunteer Ministers worked for six months in India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand. When huge bushfires occurred in the Blue Mountains in January 2002, our Volunteer Ministers worked 24/7 assisting community authorities and helping victims and disaster relief workers cope with the trauma associated with such a major event.
This amount of growth in a religion only a little beyond its first half-century of existence has only been possible through the dedicated support of members of the religion. Scientologists sincerely believe in their religion and they are active supporters of the Church and it humanitarian initiatives.
Courts and governmental agencies in the United States, Europe and other countries have repeatedly acknowledged Scientology’s religiosity. In October 1983, The High Court of Australia in Church of the New Faith v. Commissioner of Payroll Tax (Vic) recognised Scientology.
That decision adopted criteria for determining religiosity that have since become generally accepted by courts and religious scholars around the world:
a belief in some Ultimate Reality, such as the Supreme or eternal truth that transcends the here and now of the secular world;
religious practices directed toward understanding, attaining or communing with this Ultimate Reality; and
a community of believers who join together in pursuing this Ultimate Reality. These criteria have become the standards for determining religiosity throughout Australia and New Zealand.
In April of 2007, and again in October 2009, the European Court of Human Rights held that Scientology churches must be afforded the same rights as any other religious institutions throughout the 47 countries that comprise the European Community.
Senator Xenophon’s 17 November presentation misrepresented Scientology’s true status while ignoring the above decisions and acknowledgements. Instead, the presentation focused on unfounded and unproven allegations from overseas newspaper reports and other sources whose accuracy cannot be confirmed and in many instances have been proven as false.
The bulk of the Senator’s presentation relied on letters containing unsubstantiated allegations made by a few disgruntled apostates. No religion can possibly satisfy everyone, and the Church regrets that these individuals did not find what they were seeking in Scientology.
Such bitter testimonials have at their root a common phenomenon attributable to apostates of any faith. An essay on apostates by Lonnie D. Kliever, Ph.D., Professor of Religious Studies Southern Methodist University, describes it as follows:

“There is no denying that these dedicated and diehard opponents of the new religions present a distorted view of the new religions to the public, the academy, and the courts by virtue of their ready availability and eagerness to testify against their former religious associations and activities.


“Such apostates always act out of a scenario that vindicates themselves by shifting responsibility for their actions to the religious group. Indeed, the various brainwashing scenarios so often invoked against the new religious movements have been overwhelmingly repudiated by social scientists and religion scholars as nothing more than calculated efforts to discredit the beliefs and practices of unconventional religions in the eyes of governmental agencies and public opinion.


“Such apostates can hardly be regarded as reliable informants by responsible journalists, scholars, or jurists. Even the accounts of voluntary defectors with no grudges to bear must be used with caution since they interpret their past religious experience in the light of present efforts to re-establish their own self-identity and self-esteem.”

Many of the apostates upon whom the Senator relied have gone even further and have publicly supported the cyber-hate group, Anonymous, a group whose members boasted about their unlawful attacks on the Australian Prime Minister’s website earlier this year, and whose members have been prosecuted criminally in the United States for illegal attacks on Church of Scientology websites.
The Church has no desire to air in public the personal experiences of members of the Scientology religion–even former members such as these who have chosen to attack their previous faith. That said, nevertheless, the Church vigorously denies the claims of these former members. Had Senator Xenophon sought confirmation of any of the allegations with the Church, we would have provided to him factual documents, including coronial reports, refuting them and endorsements of the Church by numerous community groups and countless individuals, including former members.
For example, Kevin Mackey stated publicly that he attributed his success in life to what he learned from Scientology. Dean and Anna Detheridge similarly voiced positive opinions of their Scientology experiences. Such positive statements are consistent with the experiences of millions of other parishioners of Scientology. That these people now hold a different view is entirely their own personal affair.
The allegations of Aaron Saxton and Carmel Underwood regarding forced abortions are untrue. The Church of Scientology does not counsel expectant mothers to have abortions and has never forced anyone to obtain one. Sworn statements have been obtained from numerous female Church staff members who served during the same time as Carmel Underwood, all of whom became pregnant while on staff, some as many as three times, and all of whom state that they were never encouraged, pressured or even suggested to have an abortion. They all state that they were well cared for and given time off as needed to care for their children, as was Carmel Underwood.
The Church is very reluctant to bring the Schofield family more pain than they have already suffered over the loss of two of their children, but public records in both cases starkly contradict Senator Xenophon's claims. Both deaths were determined by the proper authorities to have been tragic accidents. Moreover, sworn witness statements confirm that, in the case of the first daughter, Paul Schofield was himself looking after his child and was a short distance from her when she accidentally fell down a flight of stairs at the Church and was mortally injured.
In the case of his second daughter, she was in the full care of both parents at home when she ingested over 30 tablets of a potassium chloride supplement called ""Slow K"" that her parents kept in the home within reach of the child. Potassium chloride is not part of any Church program or service in Australia or internationally.

The subsequent coronial inquest found that the parents' misunderstanding of the risks accompanying an overdose of ""Slow K"" led to the girl's death and recommended greater precision in the product's warning label. In both instances, the Church assisted the family during this time of great loss.
Aaron Saxton and Peta O'Brien claim they were denied medical treatment. They both know it is a fact that all Scientologists are not only encouraged to seek medical attention to address physical ailments and injuries; they are required to do so by Church policy. And without going into the nature of their medical problems, records indicate that both of them received extensive and regular medical treatment while on Church staff.
Aaron Saxton went so far as to falsely allege he participated in a ""cover up"" of financial misdealing by an individual whom Church executives not only dismissed from staff when they discovered his activities but diligently reported to the police and successfully prosecuted.
All of these matters are the subject of documented evidence and sworn witness statements that the Church was prepared to provide to Senator Xenophon had he asked for them. Yet, Senator Xenophon never responded to the Church's request for a meeting with him prior to his parliamentary speech on 17 November 2009.
We regret that this matter has come before the Senate in this manner and seek only to correct the record.

Reply to comments by Senator Nicholas Xenophon in the Senate –

Pursuant to resolution 5 (7) (b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988 I make this submission on behalf of the Church of Scientology regarding comments made in the Senate concerning the Church by Senator Nicholas Xenophon on the evening of 17 November 2009.

In April of 2007, and again in October 2009, the European Court of Human Rights held that Scientology churches must be afforded the same rights as any other religious institutions throughout the 47 countries that comprise the European Community.
Senator Xenophon’s 17 November presentation misrepresented Scientology’s true status while ignoring the above decisions and acknowledgements. Instead, the presentation focused on unfounded and unproven allegations from overseas newspaper reports and other sources whose accuracy cannot be confirmed and in many instances have been proven as false.
The bulk of the Senator’s presentation relied on letters containing unsubstantiated allegations made by a few disgruntled apostates. No religion can possibly satisfy everyone, and the Church regrets that these individuals did not find what they were seeking in Scientology.
Such bitter testimonials have at their root a common phenomenon attributable to apostates of any faith. An essay on apostates by Lonnie D. Kliever, Ph.D., Professor of Religious Studies Southern Methodist University, describes it as follows:

“There is no denying that these dedicated and diehard opponents of the new religions present a distorted view of the new religions to the public, the academy, and the courts by virtue of their ready availability and eagerness to testify against their former religious associations and activities.


“Such apostates always act out of a scenario that vindicates themselves by shifting responsibility for their actions to the religious group. Indeed, the various brainwashing scenarios so often invoked against the new religious movements have been overwhelmingly repudiated by social scientists and religion scholars as nothing more than calculated efforts to discredit the beliefs and practices of unconventional religions in the eyes of governmental agencies and public opinion.


“Such apostates can hardly be regarded as reliable informants by responsible journalists, scholars, or jurists. Even the accounts of voluntary defectors with no grudges to bear must be used with caution since they interpret their past religious experience in the light of present efforts to re-establish their own self-identity and self-esteem.”

Many of the apostates upon whom the Senator relied have gone even further and have publicly supported the cyber-hate group, Anonymous, a group whose members boasted about their unlawful attacks on the Australian Prime Minister’s website earlier this year, and whose members have been prosecuted criminally in the United States for illegal attacks on Church of Scientology websites.
The Church has no desire to air in public the personal experiences of members of the Scientology religion–even former members such as these who have chosen to attack their previous faith. That said, nevertheless, the Church vigorously denies the claims of these former members. Had Senator Xenophon sought confirmation of any of the allegations with the Church, we would have provided to him factual documents, including coronial reports, refuting them and endorsements of the Church by numerous community groups and countless individuals, including former members.
For example, Kevin Mackey stated publicly that he attributed his success in life to what he learned from Scientology. Dean and Anna Detheridge similarly voiced positive opinions of their Scientology experiences. Such positive statements are consistent with the experiences of millions of other parishioners of Scientology. That these people now hold a different view is entirely their own personal affair.
The allegations of Aaron Saxton and Carmel Underwood regarding forced abortions are untrue. The Church of Scientology does not counsel expectant mothers to have abortions and has never forced anyone to obtain one. Sworn statements have been obtained from numerous female Church staff members who served during the same time as Carmel Underwood, all of whom became pregnant while on staff, some as many as three times, and all of whom state that they were never encouraged, pressured or even suggested to have an abortion. They all state that they were well cared for and given time off as needed to care for their children, as was Carmel Underwood.
The Church is very reluctant to bring the Schofield family more pain than they have already suffered over the loss of two of their children, but public records in both cases starkly contradict Senator Xenophon's claims. Both deaths were determined by the proper authorities to have been tragic accidents. Moreover, sworn witness statements confirm that, in the case of the first daughter, Paul Schofield was himself looking after his child and was a short distance from her when she accidentally fell down a flight of stairs at the Church and was mortally injured.
In the case of his second daughter, she was in the full care of both parents at home when she ingested over 30 tablets of a potassium chloride supplement called ""Slow K"" that her parents kept in the home within reach of the child. Potassium chloride is not part of any Church program or service in Australia or internationally.

The subsequent coronial inquest found that the parents' misunderstanding of the risks accompanying an overdose of ""Slow K"" led to the girl's death and recommended greater precision in the product's warning label. In both instances, the Church assisted the family during this time of great loss.
Aaron Saxton and Peta O'Brien claim they were denied medical treatment. They both know it is a fact that all Scientologists are not only encouraged to seek medical attention to address physical ailments and injuries; they are required to do so by Church policy. And without going into the nature of their medical problems, records indicate that both of them received extensive and regular medical treatment while on Church staff.
Aaron Saxton went so far as to falsely allege he participated in a ""cover up"" of financial misdealing by an individual whom Church executives not only dismissed from staff when they discovered his activities but diligently reported to the police and successfully prosecuted.
All of these matters are the subject of documented evidence and sworn witness statements that the Church was prepared to provide to Senator Xenophon had he asked for them. Yet, Senator Xenophon never responded to the Church's request for a meeting with him prior to his parliamentary speech on 17 November 2009.
We regret that this matter has come before the Senate in this manner and seek only to correct the record.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-02-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Chief Executive Officer’s overview in the introduction on page 6 of the Australian Crime Commission’s annual report indicates—and this is a figure that would be astounding to most Australians listening—that the Australian Crime Commission conservatively estimates that organised crime in Australia costs in the order of $10 to $15 billion annually. It is a significant figure, and I think it demonstrates the need for the legislation that was passed through this chamber today—the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009
and the
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2009—and the prudent moves by the government, which are very strongly supported by the opposition, in adapting to organised crime in Australia. With figures like that, it is a warranted measure by the Australian government, with the great support of the opposition.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-02-04,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I would like to take note of a government response presented earlier this week entitled
Response to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee’s report: DEEWR tender process to award employment services contracts. The Senate committee inquiry into this matter verified the probity of the competitive tender process run by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. Based on the evidence before the inquiry, it is clear that the department was well equipped and experienced in carrying out this tender process.
That is not to say there were no valid issues raised, and the government in its response has accepted, at least in principle, many of the recommendations made by the committee majority. In fact, possibly the only reflection of the committee that the government has not accepted was in a recommendation that, aside from other further work, matters should be forwarded to the Productivity Commission for further review. I must say—possibly more as a quip than anything else at this stage—that, since the Productivity Commission’s review of maternity benefits, this seems to have become a very popular approach in dealing with various policy issues. In this particular matter, I think the government quite rightly reflects that that is not the best path. It has indicated in its response the other approaches that are being undertaken to address the issues raised by the committee, and I think the response on this point is quite adequate.
In relation to this report and also the government’s response, the opposition’s attempt to undermine the probity of the tender process has left the opposition somewhat red-faced. What we now know about the inquiry is that it was more of a political stunt by the opposition. The opposition was more interested in wasting time and resources than helping job seekers find work and redesigning a competent system, whereas the government was focused on delivering a simpler, more effective and more personalised service for people looking for a job. The government had to make changes, and an independent review, as championed by the opposition, has now been proven not to be needed.
Government senators on the inquiry, however, do acknowledge that the not-for-profit organisations raised valid concerns with the tender process. That is why the government asked the Productivity Commission last year to undertake a study into improving the measurement of the not-for-profit sector’s contributions. This study is now completed. The research report was provided to the government on 29 January 2010. The government recognises that not-for-profit organisations are critical to building a fairer and stronger Australia and to enhancing the economic, social, cultural and environmental wellbeing of society. It was also noted that work was already underway by an industry reference group on alternative purchasing and incentive models. These findings are likely to be taken into consideration for future arrangements and will address issues that were raised before the Senate inquiry.
Looking back at Job Services Australia, I think it is worth while to highlight these issues again here. The development and introduction of the Rudd government’s $4 billion new employment service, Job Services Australia, represented a major change to employment services in Australia. The focus turned from privatising public services and cost cutting—the focus of the opposition when they were in government—to service delivery and achieving outcomes for job seekers. Job Services Australia folds seven separate employment programs into a one-stop shop and provides job seekers with a flexible, more personalised service—one where providers work with job seekers to develop a tailored pathway to employment, a plan that identifies a mix of the vocational and non-vocational activities that job seekers need to undertake.
Providers, employers and job seekers told the government during the nine-month consultation process that the old system, Job Network, was confusing, fragmented and laden with red tape. Under the old Job Network system there was no provision to extend 95 per cent of existing contracts beyond 30 June last year. During difficult economic times, with the global financial crisis, it is critical that job seekers remain connected to the labour market and can access training so we can enhance the nation’s skills base for when the economy recovers. The government recognises that some organisations were unsuccessful in the tender process, which has resulted in disappointment for some tenderers. This is an obvious consequence of this type of tendering process.
However, this government made provisions to help these organisations readjust. Such organisations were able to apply to a $3.5 million business adjustment fund to help them realign their organisation and identify new activities and income streams. The government provided funding to enable service provider employees affected by the new tender outcomes to register with the National Employment Services Association if they would like work in the area. The new register was a useful tool for successful tenderers to find new staff. The government believes the new Job Services Australia will deliver a better, more personalised service that responds to all economic conditions.
Let me address some of the process issues that the opposition sought to highlight in this inquiry that the government has now responded to in a fulsome and timely fashion. The government’s consultation process included the conduct of the tender process and the purchasing arrangements, and changes were put in place as a result of the feedback that the government had received. The entire tender process was scrutinised by an independent, external probity adviser. The independent probity adviser was satisfied that at all stages the assessment process followed by the department met all the requirements. In fact, the probity adviser gave an unqualified sign-off on the tender process, describing the conduct of the process as, ‘A high benchmark for the conduct of the Commonwealth procurements in that DEEWR not only met but exceeded relevant probity principles and standards.’ The tender process was conducted at arm’s length from government at all times. It resulted in a diverse range of national and local providers, as well as a significant number of providers delivering specialist services. As noted in the government’s response to the inquiry’s report, ‘For the first time since 1988 community based organisations feature significantly in the profile of providers of employment services placing them in the 20 largest employment service providers.’
In conclusion, I would like to reflect that the new Job Services Australia design is to save job seekers running from door to door. It is a simpler, more effective and more personalised service for people looking for a job, which is more important than ever in these tough global economic conditions. The system also provides for an increased opportunity for training and skill development and greater assistance for disadvantaged job seekers and those who have recently lost their jobs, aligned with measures that the Rudd government introduced during the financial crisis.
Despite this balanced approach and the unqualified support and sign-off of the process by an independent probity adviser, there are those who sought to undermine the probity of the tender process for, what can be seen in retrospect, no good reason. The opposition made extravagant claims about the probity of the process. For instance, on 17 June 2009 the then opposition employment participation spokesperson, Andrew Southcott, claimed that the Job Services Australia tender had thrown the entire employment services system into chaos. This has obviously not been the case. But the opposition is stuck in the old paradigm of the Howard government that it is only ever about delivering the cheapest option rather than the most effective outcome.
The committee’s report and the government’s response debunk the opposition’s attempt to undermine the probity of the department’s tender process to award employment contracts. The outcomes of the tender process resulted in a diverse range of national and local providers, including a large number of providers delivering specialist services. The implementation of Job Services Australia has seen the rollout of new services, a redeveloped IT system and provider staff training to help job seekers get the help they need. These all contributed to meeting the transition principles of an on-time start with least disruption to job seekers, providers and employers. This smooth transition was a direct result of effective planning and preparation.

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,42,2
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-02-04,"—I rise tonight to speak on Australia Day and citizenship and how important that is for Australia, especially with regard to my home state of Tasmania. I will refer specifically to some of the southern municipalities and events that took place on Australia Day, as they were some of those that I could attend.
Australia celebrates its national day on 26 January. It is a very important day. It is the day when we welcome new citizens to this country. This year on Australia Day, almost 300 Tasmanians became Australian citizens. They were part of a record 16,698 people, from 130 countries, taking the pledge to become Australian citizens across the nation. These people join approximately four million migrants from 200 countries who have made the decision to uproot their lives and start again in Australia.
Our new citizens have come to Australia for many reasons, but, to put it simply, they have come here because they think Australia will provide them with a happy, safe and better life. They want a home where freedom of speech is not only allowed but encouraged. They want a home that provides them with the opportunity to get an education and achieve their dreams, whatever they may be. They want a home where they feel they belong.
We should feel honoured that there are so many people wanting to join us as Australians. Australia is the country it is today because of its diversity. There are people who were born here and there are those who came from abroad. There are people who came to escape war and poverty and those who had a safe home but were still intrigued by the Australian way of life. There are people who arrived in Australia as children and those who joined us later in life. We are all different but we share one thing: our love for Australia.
Becoming an Australian citizen is an important commitment. As part of the citizenship ceremony, a pledge to Australia is taken to affirm a person’s commitment and loyalty to the nation. As an Australian citizen, a person must obey the law, defend Australia if necessary, serve on a jury if requested and vote at federal, state and territory elections and referendums. They have the right to apply to work in the Australian Public Service, join the Australian Defence Force or, indeed, be elected as a member of parliament. In the parliament there are a number of members and senators who were not born in Australia. Australian citizens can also apply for an Australian passport, re-enter Australia freely and register children born overseas as Australian citizens by descent. Consular assistance is available for people experiencing difficulties while overseas if they are Australian citizens.
Australia Day is always an exciting day with a variety of events taking place as people reflect on our great nation, as it is today, following the changes that have occurred, and as it will change into the future. This year, I had the honour of representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Hon. Chris Evans, at the Kingborough Council Australia Day awards and citizenship ceremony. Thirty-four people became citizens. They hail from countries such as China, Malaysia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Canada, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom. The citizenship ceremony was followed by the council’s Australia Day awards and then a morning tea, where I had the opportunity to meet the new citizens and recipients of the Australia Day awards. I thank the Kingborough Council for all the work they put into this event. I also thank those who worked behind the scenes to ensure that all went smoothly.
Following these events, I attended the Kingston Beach regatta, known now as ‘A Day on the Beach’, which was very well attended with an estimated 10,000 people expected to attend throughout the day. This was the third year this event had been held. It included activities such as competitive sandcastle building, tug of war, kayaking, beach cricket, volleyball and soccer, as well as a concert. Access to all of these things was free, making it a very popular event and allowing everyone in the community to join in.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Stuart Harris and Brendan Charles, the chairman and the secretary of the volunteer group, who worked tirelessly for months before and on the day to make sure this event was even better than in 2009. They are already working towards running this event in 2011. I thank all the people who contributed in so many ways. I say a very sincere thankyou to those people for believing in and supporting their local community. It is undoubtedly a fantastic way to bring people together and, to me, it encapsulates the true meaning of community.
I had the privilege for the second year in a row to be asked to judge the Tasmanian Cricket Association’s classic catches competition. This was great fun. Along with Chris Rawson and some members of the Tasmanian Cricket Club, we managed to choose the winners. Basically, the entrants had three balls batted to them—one high, one low and the third one of their choice—and we judged the catch technique, including how entertaining the catch was and whether the ball was caught or dropped. We also took into account different age groups. This year there were a number of entrants in that competition. The eldest participant this year was only 14. We had many young children taking part, getting out on the beach and having a great day. It encapsulated what it means to be Australian. We had great fun. I thank the Tasmanian Cricket Association for their input on the day.
I was also invited to the Clarence City Council Australia Day awards and citizenship ceremony. I was unfortunately unable to attend, but I would like to acknowledge that the Clarence municipality welcomed 16 new citizens to its community and the nearby Huon Valley Council welcomed nine new citizens. These awards recognised the huge efforts put into the community by people who want to help others, to ensure that they live in a place where people care for others as well as encouraging the new immigrants to take that final step and become Australian citizens. The Huon Valley Mayor, Robert Armstrong, said it all when he stated: ‘I know that many of you do your work without seeking recognition. But what you do makes a real and important difference and for that we thank you.’
Awards included Citizen of the Year, Young Citizen of the Year and Junior Citizen of the Year, as well as acknowledging volunteer work. As an example, I mention Sophie Allwright. Sophie is only 15 years old and she was recognised as the Huon Valley Council’s Young Citizen of the Year. Sophie is involved in Scouts, and is always willing to help out her leader and to help the younger members. She is involved in National Tree Planting Day and Clean Up Australia Day, and she is also on the student representative council at her school. Sophie also has a younger brother with Down syndrome and has become actively involved with the Down Syndrome Association. It is wonderful to know that young people such as Sophie are so committed to achieving their best in all aspects of their lives. Our community is certainly in safe hands as we move to the future in the next generation.
I would like to quickly mention Hobart City Council too. Hobart City Council’s Citizen of the Year award went to Mr Nicola Ranalli. His award was for his hard work and dedication to the Italian community in Hobart, including fostering a sister city relationship between Hobart and L’Aquilla. Mr RanaIli was responsible for raising more than $50,000 for L’Aquilla last year following the devastating earthquake there. Mr Ranalli is a wonderful role model to others.
Another fantastic role model is Clarence City Council’s Citizen of the Year, Sydney McClymont. Mr McClymont is a former police officer, and was recognised for more than 35 years work with the community on Hobart’s eastern shore, including charity. I congratulate Sophie, Nicola, Sydney and all the others who were recognised by their local councils.
Of course, we had Tasmania’s Australia Day honours, so to everyone who received honours—Order of Australia Medals, Officer of the Order of Australia Medals and Member of the Order of Australia Medals—I offer my congratulations. Tasmania has some wonderful attributes, but I think the best attribute that Tasmania has is its people, and the people that make up the community of Tasmania.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australia Day</title>,Adjournment,44,1
