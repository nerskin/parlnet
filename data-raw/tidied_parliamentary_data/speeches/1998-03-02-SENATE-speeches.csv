"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I am pleased to be here today and to commence the speeches on the second reading of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 . This is another 
 example of the government intending to simplify but, in fact, they are adversely affecting the people targeted within the legislation, in this case, young people—those up to the age of 21. It is pretty sad that a government that came to the parliament saying they were going to do something about youth unemployment—in fact they said they were going to do something about unemployment generally—is actually making it harder for the unemployed and, in particular, harder for young people.
They have put a number of payments together and have said that it will make things simpler. In terms of the fact that there is now only one name—the youth allowance—it is simpler. That is where the simplification stops, because in many cases the implementation of the youth allowance in fact makes it far more complex than it ever was before.
There are some minor areas where there are improvements. I would like to go to them briefly to start with. But the trade-offs are huge. Those problems are the things that we are most concerned about. There is in some cases an increased rate of payment for some young people. There is greater flexibility which allows young people to combine part-time study with jobsearch and other activities. There is an extension of rent assistance to full-time students. And there is a payment of a higher independent rate for full-time stu 
 dents in de facto relationships. These things are good, and we do not have a problem with them; it is the cost to 16- and 17-year-olds who are unemployed.
In the community as a whole, young people who are not in education and are seeking work in the present economic climate brought about by this government are finding it extraordinarily difficult. Because of the environment and the training places available—and this again has been brought about by this government—they are finding it extraordinarily difficult to get training in an area that might suit them better than school. These young people, struggling to make a go of their lives and finding it very difficult, are being punished by this government.
I hark back to some of the statements made by members of the community in making submissions to the Senate community affairs committee about the effect of this bill. I cannot really state it any better than they did. I quote the National Youth Coalition for Housing, who made a submission but also sent me a letter dated 24 November last year:
The major problem with this Bill is that it has addressed inadequacies in the student payment system at the cost of reduced outcomes for unemployed adolescents (16-17 years) and unemployed young adults (18-20 years). Youth unemployment benefits have never been assessed as generous in any Parliamentary or other Inquiry or research, and if anything our young unemployed and their families deserve more, not less government assistance. It is in this context that we urge you to seek to amend the legislation.
When we do reach the committee stage of this bill, we will certainly be moving a number of amendments to try to rectify some of the uncertainties, some of the unfairnesses contained in this bill, but I am not confident that in moving amendments we can remedy all the problems that have been created, because they are many.
The first problem is that, despite the government's statement that their intention was to simplify the system, in fact they have made the system for young people incredibly complex. They have also continued the current trend of making sweeping statements but then not dealing with the matters directly 
 within the legislation. I am referring in particular to section 543A of the bill, which withdraws income support for 16- and 17-year-olds who leave education without completing year 12.
Of course, the community as a whole would enthusiastically say that it is better for a young person to continue their education than be unemployed. But the reality is that for many young people schooling is not the most satisfactory outcome for them or there is no schooling that is suitable for their needs and their talents.	I think it is very difficult when we do not provide appropriate schooling for young people, potentially by way of an apprenticeship or a TAFE place—and we all know that the heart has been cut out of TAFE places all over Australia. We are punishing those young people by not providing them with appropriate training. 	Even though this bill punishes those people who have not completed year 12 and are not in full-time education, there is no guarantee, there is no reciprocal promise, on behalf of this government to provide every young person with appropriate education or training opportunities. This government often talks about reciprocal obligations. I think it is a bit rich of the government to demand this sort of commitment from young people when the government is not prepared to make the same commitment to them.
The government has stated that there will be a number of exceptions to this particular provision. We have been provided with varying amended documents, for example, the document headed Policy guidelines—exemptions from the full-time education/training requirement for young people aged under 18. But the documents change. I am not certain that this is the final document. Maybe when the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is on her feet she can inform us whether this is the final document or not. We are told that, even though the bill contains no statement about the exemptions, we should accept this particular provision on faith that in subordinate legislation this government will put forward fair exemptions and will deal with all the difficult cases that arise in this piece of legislation.
I say on behalf of the opposition that we are not prepared to take it on faith. We do not accept that this government, some time down the track, will deal fairly with young unemployed people aged between 16 and 18 and properly deliver to them the entitlement that I think we owe them as a community, that is, to allow them to express their talents and to do as well as they possibly can in their particular circumstances. I do not think this bill addresses that problem at all. I am extraordinarily concerned that if we pass this bill without reference to or inclusion of exceptions, a lot of young people who are trying very hard to do the best that they can will be poorly dealt with.
I also have a lot of concern about the definition of when a young person is independent. There seems to me to be a little bit of uncertainty about that whole issue contained in the bill. The bill tries to define `independence', but in fact the definition that is used for independence is not the same definition that is presently contained within the social security legislation. I am not certain why this is the case. Again, maybe the minister can enlighten us some time down the track. I would have thought that if the objective of the government is simplicity and ease for those dealing with a particular system, it would have tried to make definitions the same rather than create yet another definition—which is what appears to be the case here.
There are some minor provisions that have probably been difficulties all along, for example, the provision that both parents of a child have to be in jail for at least 10 years before the child is considered to be independent. I would have thought that a child that had both parents in jail, for whatever term, would have a great deal of trouble being supported by either parent. I suppose that is a minor problem that we will attempt to remedy with an amendment, but I think it indicates that this government has not done a particularly good job in its stated objective of making the provisions simpler and fairer. I think most people in the community would agree that if both parents of a child are in jail from one year up to 10 years, that would normally make the child independent.
There are also some provisions contained in the bill in relation to rental assistance which we are concerned about, that is, the removal of rent assistance for young people between 18 and 20 if it is stated that they do not need to live away from their parents. If a 20-year-old is living away from home but, according to the department, they do not need to live away from home, they are counted as dependent. I thought this debate was over. In Australia, 18-year-olds have had the vote for a very long time. In all sorts of ways, the Australian community accepts that when a young person turns 18 they are an adult and entitled to the rights—and, of course, accept the obligations—of becoming an adult; that they should no longer be treated as a child, treated as dependent.
The  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  treats people between the ages of 18 and 20 as children. Is that fair when they have the obligations of an adult? They have to vote. If they sign legal contracts, they are bound by them; they cannot say, `I am a child. I am not bound by that contract.' When they go before the courts on a criminal matter, they cannot say, `I am a child: treat me under the juvenile legislation relating to crime. Do not treat me as an adult.'
These people are treated as adults for every purpose other than this particular legislation. Under this legislation, we are telling them that, between the ages of 18 and 20, for the purposes of the equivalent of what used to be unemployment benefits, they will be treated as a child. The opposition believes that this is fundamentally irrational and unfair. It is not reasonable.
There is also some uncertainty in relation to what full-time study actually means. There seems to be provision for what is defined as full-time study under HECS—and I suppose most people who are familiar with the HECS scheme would be aware of that. There is a definition of full-time study according to what the institution defines it as. However, there also seems to be a third definition, which is described as an alternative definition, and it is a catch-all provision which appears to be at the discretion of the secretary.
From the opposition's attempt to interpret the drafting of the legislation, it is not obvious whether it actually is a third criterion which young people have to comply with, or if they can come within that definition even if they do not comply with the first two. That is another matter which the Minister for Social Security could perhaps clarify. If it is an alternative that can stand alone as a definition and which is at the discretion of the secretary, are there guidelines? Will there be regulations? Or is it just a general provision which is determined at the whim of the particular secretary? It is certainly not clear to us.
The opposition does not believe that this bill that relates to providing a general youth allowance helps young people. We believe that, in the guise of making the system simpler, it is actually taking things away from and hurting young unemployed members of our community. When the bill goes to the committee stage, the opposition will be moving about eight or nine amendments.
We are concerned that a large proportion of what is contained in the bill is not clarified within the bill but is reliant on a consequential amendments bill. I understand that that bill was provided to the shadow minister last week. I have not seen that bill as yet. I am not arguing that you have somehow kept it secret, but is it really fair to be proceeding to debate a bill which relies on a lot of material contained in a consequential amendments bill which has been available for less than a week? Is it fair to debate the bill when it relies on a lot of subordinate legislation which is not yet available?
I find this trend extraordinarily disturbing. It was done with the child-care payments bill as well, where an attempt was made to debate the bill without the availability of the subordinate legislation on the basis of faith that, some time down the track, we would see it and, in some cases, they would be disallowable. Again, in the case of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 , the primary bill that we are debating at the moment has been available for some time. The Senate standing committee on community affairs has had the opportunity to 
 examine this bill and to hear a lot of concerns put by people in the community, particularly those who deal with young unemployed people.
However, in determining its priorities, the government did not see fit to finalise a consequential amendments bill. From a quick examination of the pile of paper that comprises that bill, it seems to be about three times larger than the primary bill. That seems rather peculiar. I understand that the Democrats and the Greens have also expressed some concern about this procedure. We may need to defer consideration of the committee stage, but I think that is a matter that is still to be determined. We do not believe that this bill is fair. We do not believe it is fair to young people, and we certainly do not believe it is proper.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-03-02,"—The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  before us calls on the Senate to support the government's intentions to change the payments to young Australians. On the one hand, the government seeks to provide a more simplified regime with some five allowances for young Australians being reduced to one; and, on the other hand, the government claims that it is seeking to encourage people to spend more time at school and TAFE colleges and that we should as a country be seeking to encourage a higher level of retention in our educational institutions.
I would suggest to you that, on the surface of it, they are very worthy objectives. The problem for me, however, is that, when you examine the detail of what the government is proposing, you soon establish that the government has not thought through the implications of its policies. That is a matter of great concern to me. What we are talking about here are measures that will directly affect some 27,000 young Australians—27,000 is the best guess that the department has come up—who are some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable members of our community.
What this government has done is introduce measures to force people back into schools and into TAFE colleges without the resources to sustain that policy initiative. I find it an 
 extraordinary proposition that this government should be seeking to institute policy of this significance without the funding to sustain that policy. It is a cost shifting exercise from the Commonwealth to the states which will effectively force back onto the states and onto Australian families an obligation which should rightfully be defended by the state itself by which, in this context, I mean the Commonwealth government. It is the Commonwealth government that ought to be sustaining its obligations to the young people of this country.
What we have is a noble policy in some respects which is being supported by ignoble means. It is a policy which is essentially trying to shift away responsibilities that should rightfully be those of the Commonwealth to become the responsibilities of the states which do not have the resources to sustain these policy initiatives and to poor families in particular who do not have the resources to sustain the policy initiatives proposed by this government.
 It seems to me that the implications of this policy have not been thought through carefully. They are very serious for this parliament. On the one hand, you have an option that all young Australians, 16- and 17-year-olds in particular, should be encouraged to take on further schooling, which is a measure I support. I do not support a proposition that sees the states, which have sustained cuts to their educational programs at a state level for many years now and in particular to the TAFE colleges reduction which have seen the reduction in the states' capacity to fund those programs, having higher levels of demand being imposed on them by the Commonwealth but which are not supported by Commonwealth funding.
Two years ago we saw the claims being made by this government that they were 60,000 places short in our TAFE colleges across the country, and that is based on figures that are now two years old. There was a waiting list of some 60,000 people who wanted to get into our TAFE colleges. Yet here we have a government that is not going to provide the states with additional money to support those arrangements but it is going to 
 implement a new policy of what they call growth through efficiencies. This means that the states are required to fund additional growth which would normally occur in the TAFE institutions as a result of economic activity as the various enterprises rightfully insist upon higher levels of training for their workers.
We have commitments such as this—there is a whole series of others that I could point to—which highlight the fact that the Commonwealth is not providing additional resources to meet that normal growth in demand from the economy as it stands. And on top of that the Commonwealth government is imposing additional burdens which cannot be met by the TAFE colleges.
Similar arguments also apply to schools education. What we are seeing there is the Commonwealth introducing policy initiatives, such as the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which is seeing resources taken out of public education and given to private education. It is not the private schools who are going to be picking up these additional students; it is the public education system that will be required to meet the demands.
 The second flawed policy assumption that is inherent in this proposition is that the government has an expectation that families should take greater responsibility for the support of young people. It is a recent historical development that says that individual families are required to fund and to maintain the income of children when they move into adulthood. This is a new policy initiative that says for the first time in this country's history that everybody ought to be able to support their kids into early adulthood.
It would be all very well if that were possible—and this is where the hypocrisy comes in—but it is a morality that is essentially dependent upon an extraordinary view that all Australians are well off. It is all right for the affluent to say, `Yes, I can sustain the lifestyle of young adult children because we have the money to do it.' But it is not so easy for the hundreds of thousands of ordinary working people in this country that just do not have the resources to do that. There is an expectation by this government that they will, 
 which is a further withdrawal of this government's proper and legitimate responsibilities to people on low incomes.
 You do not see an assumption being made—up until this government's election—that people up to the age of 25 ought to be supported by their parents. You do not have a recognition that many parents simply cannot do that because, despite their intentions and despite their desires, they simply do not have the resources to do it. Many parents in this country are flat out providing for their children at primary school to meet the fees and charges and expenses of participating in public education at primary school, let alone the suggestion that parents should be supporting their children up until the age of 25. That is an inherent proposition advanced by this bill.
What you see in this legislation is the inherent presumption that, despite the fact that there has been a collapse in the youth job market, everybody ought to be able to find a job—that is the unstated presumption. If they cannot find a job, then they should be able to get a spot at either a school or a TAFE college. I have already dealt with the fact that the facilities are not available in our schools and TAFE colleges as a result of this government's actions—and the actions of many governments over many years—in cutting back resources to our public education system. But to add insult to injury is to suggest that, if you cannot find a spot at a TAFE college or a school, then somehow or other it is your fault that you have not been able to get a job and that you should be punished accordingly for it.
It has been claimed that retention rates have been increasing in recent times. That is not the case. Retention rates in recent times have actually been falling in this country as a result of the policies of various governments, as I have indicated, in cutting back resources to the public educational institutions of this country. It ought not be assumed that the resources are, in fact, available.
A recent survey was undertaken through the COAG process which highlighted, for instance, my state. Victoria has seen an ideological obsession by the conservative govern 
 ment under Jeff Kennett to actually reduce the public resources available for public education. We have seen an assumption being made there that the schools can actually do without the resources. The figures are quite clear. According to the COAG figures, education spending per head in the time rose by 15 per cent in New South Wales, by 29 per cent in Queensland and by 29 per cent in Western Australia. On an adjusted needs basis, Victorian education spending fell from nine per cent above the national average in 1991-92 to four per cent below it in 1996-97. In that same period, spending on TAFE colleges, in particular in Victoria, has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Of course, Victoria is the state which this government holds up as the most efficient. It is the system which the whole country should emulate, according to this government, when it comes to spending on TAFE colleges. It is the cheapest state, you say. Therefore, it is the most efficient. In fact, it has one of the poorest qualities in the state on many measures, but it is a policy which you are expecting the whole country to emulate and it is a policy which is found completely wanting in terms of providing for the people of that state.
Recently in a MCEETYA meeting, the government of Victoria actually drew that to your attention—irony of ironies that it actually woke up. The Victorian government, in its own submission, highlighted the implications of the Commonwealth policy of cost shifting to the states and to the poor families of this country. The submission stated:
Education and training programs appropriate to the needs of the returnees and retainees are likely to require significant modification from standard arrangements and curricula.
It went on to say that there would have to be specific needs met for Australian students who were being forced back into the schools because the particular students at which this measure was aimed often had the lowest levels of literacy and numeracy. They had low self-esteem. They had behavioural problems and they had a difficult home environment. These are all reasons related to poverty, related to the social environment in which they live, and directly related to why they 
 were not in school to begin with. Yet this government has not provided the adequate resources to meet those needs. The submission went on to say:
The majority of these students will not have the skills without significant transitional assistance to complete a normal VCE or VET in Schools program, and many may regard their return to school merely as a necessity for receiving benefits. Many of these students will require higher levels of support from specialist school and external staff, and other government agencies. They will present a major challenge for Principals, teachers and School Councils.
What is the government's response? The government's response is to provide next to nothing to support the initiatives that they themselves are taking. The point the Victorians made is:
Although the Commonwealth has made massive reductions in Labour Market Programs, it has not to date shown any willingness to face the problem of direct transfer of costs caused by its policy change on State, Territory and non-government school providers. There have been discussions on extra funds for programs to deal with the transition costs of handling returnees . . .
And so it goes on.
They identify that additional places will cost about $7,000 each. The government acknowledges that 27,000 extra spots are required. The states, both Queensland and Victoria, are highlighting that it will cost about $7,000 a place. You add up those figures and you get about $189 million on the states claim of what is required to meet the legitimate expenses associated with this program.
You may quibble with whether or not it is $7,000 a spot or otherwise. What you cannot quibble with is the fact that providing no more than the normal supplementation payments that would follow any student rejoining a school is going to be nowhere near enough to meet the demands placed upon the schools and the TAFE colleges of this country as a direct result of this government's actions.
I say that because the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs made exactly that point in a cabinet submission last August. What did it say was required? It said $140 million was required. 
 What did this government do? It sat on that submission for about eight months, not knowing how to respond to the enormous problems that this government itself had created. According to the submission, Dr Kemp at the time sought an extra $60 million for the jobs pathway program to bypass the states to provide job brokers for individual schools. He sought $24 million to develop industry training based initiatives. He sought $10 million to revive labour market programs. He sought $40 million to provide preparatory training for apprentices and trainees—a package of $116 million to $140 million over four years.
What did the government announce? On 28 January this year it has put in a measly $42 million over three years. That leaves the schools and the TAFE colleges of this country at least $100 million short-changed by this government. If you combine it with all the other measures this government is taking in its education policy initiatives, you will see that these figures add upon add in terms of the amounts of money that are required to actually meet the initiatives the Commonwealth is now imposing upon the states.
I can understand governments complaining about cost shifting, and I can particularly understand the Commonwealth complaining about the states cost shifting from the states to the Commonwealth, but I think here is now undoubtedly a case where the Commonwealth is cost shifting to the states and to the poorer families of this society. That is a deplorable situation.
What you have, frankly, is a proposition that I think this parliament has to acknowledge is totally inadequate. What you have is a proposition that sees an initiative announced by this government without the proper funding basis to sustain it. What you see here is no understanding of the social implications of its policy. I pressed through the estimates on numerous occasions for a detailed breakdown of the department's estimates of the likely geographical spread of the persons forced to return to school and TAFE colleges. Have they come up with one yet? They have not got one, have they? I put it to you, Senator Newman, to ask your officials: where is the 
 regional breakdown of the impact of this policy? You will find they have not got one.
They are relying upon the states to tell you. We can tell you in generic terms, for instance, that there will be, from memory, an estimated 6,000 students in Victoria returning to the school system arising from the Commonwealth youth allowance—which the Victorians claim will leave them $40 million short. That is your best estimate. I defy you to tell me that I am wrong.
Essentially, the government has not thought through the implications of its policy. It does not have the administrative machinery in place to defend the positions that it is putting. It has not got the administrative machinery in place to highlight the enormous anomalies that have arisen in this legislation in terms of basic questions such as: what is the meaning of `independence'? It does not have that sorted out. Essentially we have a government that is trying to appeal to the worst elements of social stigmas about the way in which this country should be run, the sort of people who are entitled to social security payments, and the way in which society should treat the weaker members of this community.
What we have here is a government that thinks of easy fixes: `We just transfer responsibilities to the state and forget about them. We transfer legitimate responsibilities of the Commonwealth to ordinary working families and then say, ""That is your problem."" Forget the social consequences. We slash and burn labour market programs. We take some $4.2 billion out of the DEETYA budget. We reduce DEETYA in terms of its commitment to whole of government expenditure from about 11.1 per cent down to 8.7 per cent in the space of three years.' That is an unprecedented reduction in the level of Commonwealth commitment, and I say a reduction in the level of commitment.
You then see an expectation that other people will pick up the pieces. What you have got here is a government that essentially does not care. It does not think through the implications of its policy. It certainly does not provide the resources to sustain the social implications of its policies. This is not just me saying this; it is the government's own cabi 
 net submission. Its own cabinet submission acknowledges the weakness of its own position.
The government is saying that the weakest members of our community can fend for themselves. You are going to deprive those people of their legitimate benefits—and some 45,000 people will be worse off as a result of these initiatives. You are saying that they should do with less and that the Commonwealth will not provide the resources to support their legitimate claims for education and training and that they are going to have to fend for themselves.
This highlights the fact that the early school leavers who do not want to be at school—there are very good reasons why they do not want to be at school such as because the school system has failed them—are going to be forced back into that school system that has failed them without the resources to actually do anything about their predicament. That strikes me as a proposition that this parliament cannot take lightly. It strikes me that this government has let down 27,000 young Australians and let them down very badly.
I repeat that what you are trying to do may well have some noble intention in terms of trying to encourage people to stay on at school—a sentiment that I do support. But I do not support the miserable meanness and the extraordinary contempt that you are showing for poor people in this country, for people who are less well off, and the expectation that working people have got to live like the wealthy—if they have got the money, they can sustain their kids until they are 25. If they cannot, they are somehow or other lesser human beings.
That is an appalling attitude to take. It is an action this government ought to be condemned for. Frankly, the proposition that you will force 27,000 people back into our schools and TAFE colleges without the support necessary to sustain those schools and TAFE colleges equally ought to be condemned.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-03-02,"—This government stands condemned for seeking to introduce more measures which disadvantage our young people. This Social 
 Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  joins a long queue of other actions undertaken by the government which prevent our young people from reaching their full potential. Look at the removal of income support, stagnant youth unemployment, increasing long-term unemployment, the abolition of labour market programs and increased fees for higher education. This government has also failed to provide young Australians with jobs and the education and training alternatives they need which would make income support payments redundant.
The bill proposes to amend the Social Security Act 1991 to give effect to a new social security payment to be known as the youth allowance, which, if adopted, will come into effect from 1 July 1998. I know that to the uninitiated this bill may well have a simplistic appeal. Unfortunately, solutions to the problems facing our young people are not simple. If they were, they would have been resolved by now. Even with the best intentions in the world, parents of young adults and people who work with young people know that the proposals outlined in this bill cannot work and, worse, are not in the best interests of young adults.
The government's proposal to abolish unemployment benefits for young Australians coupled with the massive slash and burn of training and educational opportunities for them is a complete abrogation of its responsibilities to a vulnerable group of people in our society. Education has become the basis of opportunity in our society. Education is not only a catalyst for new forms of economic and technological progress but also the means by which each individual can develop skills to adapt and to reach their full potential. The government has failed to provide additional funding for sufficient relevant school or post-school education which would encourage these young people to participate in lifelong learning.
The mania with small government and the belief that the public provision of services is bad are quite inconceivable given the large number of young people who will be placed at risk. Winding back the role of government is the wrong approach. Instead, we should be 
 creating new opportunities through the possibilities of education and training geared towards the needs of a diverse group of people. Once again, the government is about short-term measures to save money, and it is some of the most vulnerable in our society and their families who will be expected to pay that price.
Young adults aged 18 to 20 years who are looking for work are independent and should not be forced by the imposition of a parental income assets and actual means test to rely on their families, especially their low income families, for support. What the government is actually proposing is that families with children between 16 and 18 who are not in full-time training or education—although it must be remembered that there is a shortfall of places here to the tune of about 30,000—look after these young adults themselves.
Such an approach ignores the reality for many families with young adults between 16 and 18 who have not achieved what they would have hoped for through our education system, who may have a learning disability, or who are unable to get a job because this government has failed to address our youth unemployment problem. Latest figures in this area show the Howard government is going backwards despite lower participation rates.
Youth allowance arrangements will hurt low income families. It takes income support away from 16- and 17-year-olds who are looking for work if they have not finished year 12 and reduces payments to unemployed 18- to 20-year-olds by introducing a parental means test. While we welcome increased basic rates of pay for some, extension of rate assistance to some and use of the youth allowance activity agreements to allow flexible combinations of education, jobsearch and other productive activity, there is an implicit assumption throughout this bill that such families should take care of their own and that they are in fact in a position to do so. It fails to understand the reality that many families are not in a financial position to do so and that young adults seeking to obtain their independence will be prevented from doing so.
If this bill passes through the Senate an estimated 27,000 unemployed 16- and 17- 
 year-olds will be forced back to school next year. Those 16- and 17-year-olds who are forced to stay at school because they have no other income support options may prove to be unruly and disruptive. In addition, the impact of these new enrolments will not be felt uniformly, but will be most concentrated in areas of high youth unemployment—for obvious reasons.
We know that residential location has become the most reliable indicator of a person's educational achievement and lifelong opportunities. Forcing young people who do not want to be there back into schools in areas of high youth unemployment can only exacerbate the growing problem of an educational underclass.
The Howard government will need to provide additional school resources to cope with this influx of people, many of whom may not really want to be there. Unless additional funding is forthcoming, an estimated $140 million in existing programs in the areas of vocational training, computer technology and literacy programs will need to be cut. The receipt of income support should be tied to participation in a range of alternative activities—not just school education—which would help young people to get work and reach their full potential.
I contrast the approach of this government with that of Tony Blair's government in Britain where his priorities are education, education and education. The massive cuts made in the education sector are only exacerbating the problems for young people. A cut of $270 million to government schools through the enrolment benchmark adjustment, coupled with a further cut indirectly through the Commonwealth's reduction of financial assistance grants to the states and territories, means that the funding necessary to support the influx of students who will not be eligible for social security payments will not be there. These cuts come at the worst possible time for our young people and our economy and go to the heart of the fundamental nature of our society itself. If society is to be judged by the way it treats its young people then we will be judged harshly indeed.
The Australian Labor Party is not opposed to the simplification of income support arrangements, but we do not support such arrangements when they are to be implemented at the expense of young people in our society, especially when this is being done dishonestly under the guise that it is good for you. Good for whom, we may well ask.
Dr Kemp's ill-considered comments about sending a message to 16- and 17-year-olds that they should stay at school ignores the reality for many young people who leave school for reasons other than short-term monetary gain. Young adults of that age leave school because of family, emotional difficulties and social disadvantage, or because they are not well suited to the school environment. These are the very reasons they need extra support, including income support. They certainly do not need extra pressure being put on them by this government if it gets its own way. Taking money away from people does nothing to address the causes of these problems.
Young people in schools need proper, work oriented careers education and work experience opportunities, as well as bridging school to work transition programs. The Australian Labor Party believes this strongly. We established in 1995 the jobs pathway guarantee program, which was piloted in schools in regions of highest youth unemployment to do something about unemployment. While the Howard government has revamped this program, there are other signs of neglect by the government, such as poor funding for vocational education and training in schools and a disregard for school based apprenticeships.
Our first priority should be to invest in the skills of our people. It is vital that, as we move forward into the 21st century, all young Australians have a range of education and training options available to them to cater for their specific needs. It is also important that we remember that young people are not a homogenous group, that they are a diverse population with diverse needs, and that that must be reflected in our education system.
I strongly urge the government to reinstate and expand the students at risk program, which was specifically designed to identify 
 and assist young people at risk of leaving school early; to restore the specific equity programs for disadvantaged schools, with a commitment to additional resources and Labor's initiative for a parents as educators program; to guarantee funding for the jobs pathway program beyond the current fiscal year—the facilitation of school and industry partnerships at a local level is an important way of assisting the schools most likely to be affected by the youth allowance; and to resume the pattern of growth funding for TAFE established under the previous government so that current unmet demand, as well as new student demand as a result of the youth allowance, can be met.
I urge the government to amend clause 543A, minimum age for youth allowance, to remove requirements for an under 18-year-old to be in full-time education or to have finished year 12—the exemptions touted by the government are to be determined by the secretary and are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny; to amend clause 1067A, which provides a definition of when a young person is to be regarded as independent, to restore current arrangements for young unemployed people who are a member of a couple; to amend module B, which sets out the various maximum rates of youth allowance, to ensure that all rates of payment are indexed six-monthly in line with increases in the CPI; and to amend modules E, F and G to ensure that parental assets, income and actual means, respectively, are not taken into account if a person is aged 18 or over and not a full-time student.
Denying young people access to income support at times in their lives when they are at their most vulnerable is not a blueprint for social cohesion. It is in fact a recipe for further frustration and will only add to the numerous difficulties confronting disadvantaged youth.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I rise to speak to this bill because of concerns I have. For the majority of our young, aged 16 and 17, who for a whole plethora of reasons are dissatisfied, depressed or anxious, to the stage that they do not want to continue their education, this bill will bring 
 about a period of utter despair. For a small number, who initially contemplated bringing a halt to their education but who will be compelled to continue in order to access the youth training allowance, the extra two years of schooling will bring rewards and benefits. But, as I have said, many will suffer under the changes proposed.
Don't get me wrong: I and the Labor Party acknowledge the intrinsic worth of staying on at least until year 12. There will be some winners from this measure. Young adults will reap the rewards from staying on. Some need extra assistance now, and some will have a second crack at education, not by being compelled but because they have a more mature outlook. It is the losers under this scheme that I am concerned about. Those children who drop out at years 8 and 9—I am really concerned about them and their parents under this scheme, and we get a high proportion of those on the north-west coast of Tasmania where I live. Many still will experience probably a further two years of humiliation, while others will drop out of the education system altogether, again putting extra burden on those low income families.
For many of our young who will be affected by the withdrawal of the youth training allowance, this will be one of the first incursions in their life where the big government cane will be wielded. The federal government is saying, under this bill, to our young people that there is only one course that it approves of and that should be taken in moving into adulthood. If you do not take that choice then you are on your own. What a wonderful message this government is sending our 16- and 17-year-olds. It is not a great start to life for many of those affected under this bill and they will have this government to thank for that.
On another note, I am sure there are some very edgy teachers in colleges within my home state of Tasmania who realise the difficulties that are going to flow from these changes. Many teachers understand that placing the shackles on a young person for two years to follow a pathway that they abhor, and in most cases are unsuited for, will do little good. It is going to be very difficult 
 for those teachers. I do not envy them the task ahead if this legislation is passed. I am very hopeful that some good work will be done. The high national profile of vocational education in schools enjoyed by Tasmanian colleges is a clear indicator of the state's capacity to make a difference to the motivation and aspiration of youth.
The problem is that our Tasmanian colleges will have an influx of youth who will, for many reasons, not want to be where they are. But this bill does not just involve 16- and 17-year-olds, but moves on to 18- to 20-year-olds. The 18- to 20-year-olds who are unemployed will be assessed for benefits on their parental income and assets. That will add to the feeling of guilt for a lot of those young people. I have a letter here that I would like to quote from. It is from a principal of a college in Tasmania and he says:
There is some considerable merit in these new financial arrangements for young people.
However the introduction of the new arrangements at the start of the next financial year will create considerable difficulties in Tasmania where the organisation of secondary education is different to most mainland states. Colleges can expect an influx of students over halfway through the teaching year requiring places in college courses. This simply is impractical as students, many alienated from schooling, will be endeavouring to enter courses six months after they have started. The likelihood of student success in such circumstances is minimal.
It goes on but I will not quote further. Students complete the application form to enrol to vote, and they are legally recognised as adults across the board, but this government says that if you are living in a family with an income of $23,400 per annum, then you will have your payments reduced. That will turn out to be a pressure cooker environment for families who are struggling to survive. Again, a lot of those families in Tasmania are on the north-west coast where I live.
That period from 16 to 21 years of age is not an easy period as one starts to establish independence, and family tensions can mount even with very little outside pressure. What this government is doing is just piling on more pressure. They are placing more hurdles for our young to jump over and in turn creating ructions that will end in more human 
 tragedy and breakdown. I think it will lead to a feeling of guilt for some of our young who are struggling to find independence and they will believe they are a continuing burden on their families. So for 16 or 17-year-olds it is out of the frying pan into the fire when you reach 18.
I would be a little upset if I were a young person of, say, 16 or 18 living in my region of the north-west coast of Tasmania. I can assure you that if this legislation gets up without major amendments being passed all and sundry within my region will be alerted to these harsh changes. The north-west coast of Tasmania has massive youth unemployment, and young people, scattered and living in small hamlets and country towns with diminishing prospects, deserve something pretty big in return if such changes are going to be made.
—And they are unskilled.
—Yes, I realise they are unskilled but they come from poorer socioeconomic families who do not want their children to go on to further education.
—These are the very kids who will get great help.
—They are getting nothing for the hurt they are enduring as a result of the $160 million that has been ripped out of the state economy thanks to the likes of the local federal member for Braddon, Mr Miles.
—On a point of order: Senator Denman has just reflected on one of our colleagues in the other House in a way which is both unfair and also undeserved. I ask that she retract it.
—I do not think there is a point of order.
—It is a reflection.
—It is not in my view a reflection that is unparliamentary and that seeks to make an accusation against the member of the other House in a way that ought to be withdrawn.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I quote from an 
 editorial from one of Australia's largest regional newspapers, the Advocate . It says:
Mr Miles, in particular, is representing an electorate which is screaming out for new investment, businesses and employment opportunities to stop the flow of its young across Bass Strait.
The editorial goes on:
While the North West—a regional area Mr Howard promised would be looked after—cannot expect governments to bail it out with a constant flow of direct funding, if there is Federal money available for job creation projects then there can be no electorate more in need of it than Braddon.
They are very badly needed. What reciprocal arrangement is being put in place by the federal Liberal government when you have comments like that from one of Australia's largest regional newspapers? This bill would not be such a blatant example of the abandoning of the poorer members and families of our society if they were reciprocating in some way, but they are not. It is all take and nothing in return. That is what I am witnessing back home.
With this bill the government is fiddling around with the indexation of the youth allowance. Once you are in receipt of it, then expect little change to the allowance while the price of goods and services go up. The indexation period is proposed to be extended under this bill from six to 12 months. I mention this because it is a little rich that this government is hounding our young so early in their lives when they have not got the decency to provide something in return. Our young are leaving Tasmania and on top of that the government is introducing a measure where Australia's young will get no protection and no support.
This legislation is hypocritical. Compare it with the comments that have flowed again from the member for Braddon over the years about how important the family is in building a strong society. I cannot fathom how this legislation does one iota of good for addressing homelessness or keeping families together. These views do not wash when the government is fiddling with social policy for savings of dollars alone.
Finally, much has been said about the initiatives that have been introduced by the 
 federal government that in supplementing this bill they will meet the needs of young people under 18 returning to full-time education. I am not yet convinced that those programs will make one scrap of difference over the next three years in my home state of Tasmania.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I would like to briefly outline why the government's amendments will only exacerbate the plight of young Australians. The government measures contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  will only complicate the system of payments to young people, despite the government's claim that it is an exercise in simplification. What we are seeing is another failure, another stalled reform process for young Australians. In almost every aspect of policy dealing with youth we find a policy limbo land, and this is yet another example of that. We find inactivity that spells out a lack of care and a lack of concern for the plight of young people seeking jobs or, indeed, seeking further education.
My office, like those of many of my colleagues, has received many calls and visits by parents and young people confused and bitter about how the Liberals are treating them. What they did to older Australians they are now doing to young Australians. What young people need is increased legislative flexibility, a system that recognises the difference between full and part-time students, young unemployed and those in training or, indeed, those undertaking the blend of each of those areas that suits their life and their lifestyle best.
It is impossible for this to happen under the current government regime because of the massive cuts to vocational training and education generally. What we have seen is the greatest inconsistency in a very long time of the application of government policy relating to youth. On the one hand this government has implemented massive funding cuts to universities, massive changes to the support and funding of secondary and primary schools, a changing of the relationship between the way the Commonwealth supports those public school places and a general 
 diminution of the standards of education in this country.
On the other hand what we have is a denial of the support for those who do not have the opportunity to enter that educational system. Here, certainly with the proposed cuts for 16- to 17-year-olds and the change in status for 16- to 20-year-olds, we have a double whammy for the youth of Australia. You would think on the one hand that in denying that support for those outside the educational system you would have a corresponding increase or boost in the educational opportunities presented to young people, but, no, not with this government. They decide to wipe out both of those areas of support.
The reality out there is that there are many families and young people who have different situations. The support schemes that evolved under Labor through social security, through Austudy and the various support provided by the department of education and training evolved in response to the community's needs. For all the criticism they have received, those services were a direct response to the needs of the community. Their value was in their diversity. That should be seen as a strength, as opposed to something that needs to be rectified.
Yes, it presents administrative challenges and, yes, we have seen how incompetent this government is in managing changes to the legislation and the way these services are delivered. Perhaps that is why one of the fundamental arguments underpinning the government's case is a simplification of payments. We know they have trouble getting those right, as we learnt with Austudy. In other words, with all of these reasons, what we are trying to extract through our amendments from this government is a compassionate base for their policies relating to young people. Too often the government's arguments—and you will hear them, I am sure, very shortly—are based on the fact that they need to force young people to take on greater responsibilities, for their families to take on greater responsibilities. That is not about compassion. It is about an imposition, an unrealistic imposition on youth and their 
 families in non-recognition of their circumstances.
I for one can speak for the fact that many young Australians find it either in themselves or in their circumstance to leave home when they are quite young. I left home when I was 16, for a whole range of reasons. Because it was quite a while ago now, I was lucky enough to get a job. Yes, it was seen as an unskilled area, but I was lucky enough to get a job. These days people are not so lucky. They are not so lucky because they have a government which does not care about youth employment, which does not care about providing decent educational opportunity and which is inconsistent across the policy platform when it comes to cutting education, cutting support and underpinning that with a very dry and a very uncompassionate approach to policy making.
I find it difficult to justify how the legal obligations for being an adult, including such things as when you vote and when you are eligible to pay for child support, begin at 18, along with many other responsibilities. So at 18 years old you are old enough to give a lot but when it comes to your status as an independent the age limit is raised to 21. So it is okay to reduce the age where young people are required to give but when it comes to a question of having to take a bit, perhaps because of the direct failings of government policy in other areas, that age limit rises to 21.
This bill will make it much more difficult for young people to meet the requirements for being independent. You cannot assume that families are in a financial position to support their adult children, particularly when the parental means test begins at just $23,400. This component of the bill assumes a moral and even an emotional relationship is in place even though no such legal status exists. If you are a young person and you wish to live away from home to study or to work or you have to because you cannot find work in the vicinity of your home or your study is in an area that takes you somewhere else, then barriers have been raised to stop that. Specific barriers are raised in this bill to stop those 
 options and to close those doors for young people.
I want to turn briefly to the areas that the government has identified as the main aims of their legislation. One of their main aims is, as I said previously, to `reduce the complexity and duplication, creating a more flexible income support system'—words from their explanatory memorandum. I think it is more likely to be the opposite. A reduction in complexity is a reduction in the range of services available to serve the needs of youth. In relation to a more flexible income support system, that is a worry. Senator Denman already raised the issue of lack of indexation. We know from this government that it is a pattern for them to consolidate a particular service or an allowance and use that as the basis from which to put forward quite simplistic cuts at the next budget round. So I think there are great dangers in what this government glibly calls simplification and reduction of complexity. I challenge the fact that it creates a more flexible support system.
Their next main point—reducing the number of different rates of payments and addressing concerns relating to the fragmentation of income support—again is harping on the issue of flexibility. As I said before, the reason it has been necessary to have such a wide range of services is as a direct response to the needs of the community. Whether this government like it or not, they cannot sit over there and determine on behalf of Australians what their situation is, box them neatly into categories and then address their legislation for it. It just does not work like that. Governments have to be responsive and they have to listen to what is going on out there and how people need the government's support.
The efforts by this government to embark on social engineering exercises are well traversed in other policy areas, such as child care and aged persons care. Here is another example of the government trying to determine what are the different categories of support required and asking young Australians and Australian families to conform and fit with their model. I believe Australian people will reject that. They will reject it because they will not be able to do it. You cannot 
 transform a society legislatively, as this legislation seeks to do.
The last point cited as one of the major aims of this particular bill is that the youth allowance reinforces the government's philosophy that families should support young people until they have achieved financial independence. If that is not clambering up the moral mountain, I do not know what is. It says so clearly that we are dealing with a government which seeks to impose its own moral agenda on Australians. I, like many others, am of the view that that style of government went out in the 1950s. There is no place for it here. Governments should serve the needs of the community, not impose their moral standards upon a community at their own will.
I would like to return to a previous point, and I think it is a significant point in this debate. This legislation, which limits the support of young people, is not accompanied by an increase in education funding. It is not accompanied by massive support to the states to boost the standard of quality of secondary education. It is not accompanied by a vision for our tertiary education sector. It is not even accompanied by a vision to create more Australian jobs to boost our industry base. In fact, it is accompanied by the opposite of all of those things: it is accompanied by policies that undermine each of those three areas systematically and without backdown.
Labor's amendments to this bill seek to redress the major inequities and the harsher requirements imposed. We cannot remove some of the moral impositions that this legislation seeks to impose. What we can do in opposition is try to amend it to make it a little bit more palatable, make it a little bit more workable and perhaps, through those amendments, make the burden upon Australia's youth and their families a little less onerous.
On this basis, Labor will seek to move a series of amendments. I know that those amendments will receive support from the crossbenches. It will be interesting to see the degree to which this government acknowledges what is commonsense, what is good policy, and accepts those amendments.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-02,"—At the outset, I want to flag the great concern that the Australian Greens have with the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  as it stands. I cannot do better than to read from a letter which was sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) now some nine months ago in the anticipation that the legislation would look like this when it got to the parliament. It outlines the concerns that young people in Australia had then, the concerns being expressed by some 20 or so community service organisations, and it does so succinctly. Nothing much has changed. It is still contemporary and relevant to this legislation. The letter to the Prime Minister says:
Dear Prime Minister,
The introduction of a Youth Allowance offers the opportunity to simplify aspects of the income support system, to remove anomalies in the treatment of unemployed young people and students, and to offer greater flexibility to pursue different pathways to employment and adulthood.
All good things, but the letter goes on:
However, community, youth and church-based organisations have grave concerns about the effects of the Government's proposed Youth Allowance package on many young people and their families.
Young people face increasing pressure as full time job opportunities evaporate, as they seek new pathways from education to work, and as they rely more heavily on parental support for longer periods of time. These pressures are pushing many of the most disadvantaged young people to the margins of society and further impoverishing many of their families.
Instead of offering more flexibility, the Government's proposed Youth Allowance withdraws support or makes it harder to obtain.
The Allowance proposal is based on unrealistic and false assumptions about today's young people, namely that:
Firstly:
.	 all young people aged 16 and 17 years from low income families will either benefit from formal schooling, or have viable alternative training options open to them;
That is the government's assumption. Secondly:
.	 all young adults aged 18 to 20 years who have completed their formal education and are seeking 
 full time employment should continue to live with, and remain dependent on, their parents.
That is the government's assumption. Thirdly:
.	 all young adults aged up to 25 years who continue their full time studies should relinquish financial independence and continue to live with their parents.
That again is the government's assumption. But the letter says:
The reality is that many young people from struggling families do not have these options open to them. They and their families are vulnerable to poverty if the Allowance goes ahead as planned.
There are three major aspects of the proposed Youth Allowance which are built on questionable analysis and unreasonable expectations. If imposed rigidly as the proposal implies, the Youth Allowance is likely to cause significant additional financial hardship and social stress for many young people and their families, and push more young people to the margins of society. The three aspects which need to be changed to prevent substantial damage to young people and struggling families are:
.	 the parental means test should not apply to 18 to 20 year old young adults who are considered to be independent by community standards;
.	 16 and 17 year olds should be encouraged and supported in continuing their formal education or training, but the Allowance must not be based on the assumption that that is the best course for all young people;
.	 Rent Assistance should be extended to all Youth Allowance recipients living away from home.
The letter then goes on to say to the Prime Minister:
We therefore strongly urge the Government to reconsider these features of the Youth Allowance in consultation with key national organisations, before the legislation is introduced. If these critical issues are addressed, we believe the Youth Allowance is capable of achieving its goal of simplification and efficiency, while maintaining a fair and equitable support system for Australia's young people and their families.
What a golden opportunity this legislation was and should be. It does present the potential for efficiency. It does present the potential for simplification. It does offer young people easier access to support at the most critical time in the development of their future careers and therefore their contribution to society. But what an opportunity lost in this legislation.
While the government will be able to argue that this legislation does actually improve benefits to some people—17 per cent of students, many of them from rural areas, and who would be opposed to that?—the fact is that there are some 24,000 unemployed people who are likely to be cut off from accessing rent assistance and some 346,000 students who will get nothing at all. The Greens in Tasmania estimate that there will be an extra thousand young people trying to enrol in TAFE and senior secondary college a year from now if this goes ahead simply because they are being denied the wherewithal they need to continue to make ends meet and to be responsible citizens in a society where their rights should be met, not cut as they are under this legislation.
With that in mind, the Australian Greens are going to seek to amend this bill—as are other parties on this side of the house—based on three major issues as identified by that coalition of welfare groups, which included by the way the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition and the National Union of Students. Firstly, when it comes to rent assistance, under the government's proposal only a minority of students—mainly those from rural families, as I have said—will actually benefit under this legislation. They will be getting a maximum rate of $98.80 a fortnight. Some unemployed people will lose their current rent assistance entitlement as assistance will only be paid to young people who must live away from the parental home for work or study related reasons. So we will be moving an amendment to ensure that housing assistance is based on actual housing costs and needs, rather than an expectancy that young adults will continue to live with their parents.
Secondly, we are concerned about the parental means testing for 18 to 20 year olds, as I have indicated in reading out that letter to the Prime Minister. The government intends to require that parents fully support their 18 to 20 year old unemployed sons and daughters. Our amendment will ensure that the age of independence for unemployed people remains at 18 years and be returned 
 from 25 to 21 years for students. We do not accept this theory that 18 year olds should be expected to fulfil their full responsibilities to society—to vote, to be part of the armed services and to carry out all the obligations, financial and otherwise, in society—but are denied the assistance that is required to allow them to live as fully functioning adults in our society for the purposes of employment or further education with employment in view.
Finally, the activity test requirements for 16 to 17 year  olds by the government means that they will have had to have finished year 12 in order to qualify for youth allowance. We do not accept that. The Greens amendment will ensure that all 16 and 17 year olds are able to access income support.
We feel very strongly about these amendments. We have had tremendous feedback from the community. This is a factor of demoralisation for young Australia. It is something that has come at a time when there is a great deal of debate that what we are doing with what appears to be institutionalised unemployment is going the wrong way. Instead of the government putting more money into ensuring that young people are able to search out their own path to fulfilment in society, to search out their own means of contributing to society—and very often in difficult circumstances, which for some young people means they do not have parental support—the government brings this in. We will be amending this legislation in the committee stages.

Have you or your office had any discussions with the Attorney-General or his office as to whether a solicitor-client relationship existed between you and Justice Callinan?

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-03-02,"—I am grateful for the question from Senate Bolkus, because he raises the issue of Hindmarsh Island Bridge once again. I was reading the lyrics of a song of Peter, Paul and Mary over the weekend in which they sang, `When will they ever learn? When will they ever learn?' Senator Bolkus also raises the spectre here of a minister of the crown advising a High Court judge what his actions should be. I know that is what Senator Bolkus would do. That is how the old bovver boys of the Labor Party would work.
To answer the question specifically, I was unaware of that letter, Senator Bolkus, because I did not read about it until you released it. Senator Bolkus was the one who brought everybody's attention to it in the media. I was unaware of its existence until he did so. Senator Bolkus has a responsibility here as a member of that committee. It is not my place as a minister of the crown to try in any way whatsoever to influence a member of the High Court. I would have thought Senator Bolkus would regard himself as being in the same position. He aspires to be Attorney-General. I would have thought that somebody of his capacity—as he apparently is in that he has been given that responsibility—should know that that is just not done.
Senator Bolkus was the one who brought this up, and I am grateful to him for doing so because he reminds the Australian electorate of the shambles that occurred over the Hindmarsh Island Bridge legislation on which $4 million of taxpayers' money was totally wasted. On my shelf I have the report of Justice Jane Matthews—that cost another $1 million of taxpayers' money—that was ruled inadmissible. I think I should draw that to the attention of the Australian public too. At least another $1 million, I understand, has gone over the last year on legal expenses.
As you know, Senator Bolkus, that is money gone down the drain. Nothing has been achieved. There were four inquiries, three of which said the bridge should go 
 ahead, and the other, on appeal, also said it should go ahead. Yet you are raising the spectre again. You do your party no service in raising the issue of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge yet again.

Senator Bourne asked a question on 4 December 1997 concerning the reasons for the rejection of visitor visa applications from seven delegates to the Second National Congress of the Timorese Democratic Union that was held in Perth from 3 to 6 December 1997.
The answer is as follows:
There are various legal requirements which need to be met by all applicants before a visitor visa for Australia may be granted. The legal criteria for the grant of a visitor visa require, among other things, that the applicant meets Australia's health and character standards, has adequate funds for support for the period of the visit and intends a genuine visit to Australia. When deciding whether or not an applicant intends a genuine visit, visa processing officers must take into account relevant considerations such as the applicant's personal circumstances, incentive to return home, financial situation and ability to support themselves while in Australia. The likelihood of an applicant overstaying or seeking to remain in Australia is also a matter which has to be assessed.
In addition to the requirement that each applicant satisfy the criterion relating to genuineness, certain applicants are also subject to criterion 4011 of the Migration Regulations, referred to as the risk factor criterion. This criterion requires that persons who have certain characteristics in common with people identified as presenting a relatively high risk of overstay must satisfy the decision maker that there is very little likelihood that they will overstay their visas.  

Applicants who are subject to criterion 4011 are identified by objective criteria. These are:
.	 persons who have applied for permanent residence in the five years prior to making an application; or
.	 persons who have characteristics relating to nationality, age and gender, in common with a profile of people shown by statistics to have overstayed the period of stay in Australia authorised under the visa with which they last entered Australia.
The risk factor is based on transparent and quantitative data which demonstrate that certain classes of entrants present a higher overstay risk than other entrants. Five of the seven applicants who were refused came within the risk factor profile. Applicants are not refused simply because they match the risk factor characteristics. The Migration Regulations provide that the decision-maker is obliged to carefully consider applications subject to the risk factor. A balanced judgement must be made, taking into account the applicant's personal circumstances in the country of usual residence, and weighed against the identified overstay risk factor. If the decision-maker is satisfied that the applicant's expressed intention only to visit Australia is genuine and they meet all other statutory requirements, the visa is granted.
In all, 17 people applied for visas in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' Paris office in connection with the Congress. Of these, ten were approved and granted visas and seven were refused. In the case of the seven applicants who were refused visitor visas, all were considered by the decision maker not to meet the bona fide visitor requirement. The rejected applicants supplied, in the main, only an application form and did not attach supporting documentation. Some of the forms were incomplete and did not provide details of contacts where applicants said they would be visiting relatives in Australia. The agency who sent in the application forms initially advised that these applicants would be attending the Congress and then advised by phone a week later that tourism only was intended.
Despite the inadequate information on the forms being explained by the Embassy to the travel agent that submitted the applications, and the limited time before the applicants had to travel, the applicants made no attempt to contact the Embassy to clarify their own situation or to supply the missing information.
The decision maker had no choice but to make a decision on the information available.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Timorese Democratic Union Congress: Visa Applicants</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech

The statement read as follows—
The inquiry into housing assistance was referred to the Committee in its present form on 13 February 1997. The Committee received 302 submissions indicating a high level of interest in some sections of the community in the impact of reforms to housing assistance which had been discussed at Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meetings since 1995. 

The Committee held three days of public hearings, receiving evidence from 43 organisations and 82 witnesses. Members of the Committee were also able, through the Community Housing Advisory Service of the ACT to inspect 3 community housing organisations in Canberra.
The major issue confronting the inquiry concerned the difficulties faced by disadvantaged members of the community in obtaining secure and affordable housing. Among those groups were people who suffer from special health problems or who have a disability, the frail aged, indigenous peoples, people of ethnic backgrounds and single mothers. The Committee found that the private rental market does not cater for the special housing needs of those groups. They need to rely on public housing to meet their needs and the Committee recognises that sufficient public housing must be allocated to that end.
The major organisations involved in housing research gave evidence that there is a lack of consistent data on housing generally and on the private rental housing market in particular, making it difficult to judge the ""effectiveness' of the current forms of housing assistance. The Committee sees the need for better data and has recommended that the Commonwealth government continue to support the expansion of research and data collection in all areas of housing with particular emphasis on the private rental market.
The Committee found strong support among those who made submissions to the inquiry for future Commonwealth State Housing Agreements to retain most of the elements contained in the 1996 Agreement. The Commonwealth was seen to have an essential role to play in the provision and funding of public and community housing and in ensuring that the advantages provided by public housing, such as security of tenure are maintained.
The Committee has focused on the issue of rental assistance to private renters and the affordability of rental housing. There are regional variations in the rents charged around the country and the Committee sees merit in investigating the possibility of a regional approach to Rent Assistance.
The Committee has also found widespread concern about consumer protection in the housing area, in particular issues relating to advocacy services, tenants' rights and minimum standards of housing. While this is a State matter, the Commonwealth can play a role in negotiating with the States for minimum standards to be agreed to as part of the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement.
Community housing provides an alternative to public housing and is of particular benefit for groups with special needs (including single mothers, people with disabilities or the aged). The Committee was impressed with the sense of self 
 reliance and the sense of community fostered by this type of housing. There are increasingly greater opportunities for community housing groups to raise private capital and enter into headleasing arrangements with the private sector. The Committee would like to see increased support for community housing and it has made recommendations for this to be achieved. Various methods of attracting private investment into cheaper rental housing were raised in evidence. The Committee believes that all governments need to investigate ways of facilitating private sector involvement in low cost housing and of increasing the capital available for those types of housing projects.
The major recommendations of the Committee are:
that on its expiration on 30 June 1999, the 1996 Commonwealth State Housing Agreement be replaced by a new Agreement which retains the specification of performance and the strategic planning processes which are in the existing Agreement measures and addresses the issue of State accountability.
that the Commonwealth government continue to support the expansion of research and data collection in all areas of housing, particularly those relating to the private rental market.
that the Commonwealth provide capital funding for public housing at levels sufficient to ensure that the public housing stock is at least 6 per cent of total housing stock.
that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States for security of tenure for public tenants to be included in the negotiations for the next CSHA.
that the Commonwealth consider the possibility of using a region based formula for Rent Assistance payments.
that as part of the COAG process, the Commonwealth negotiate agreed standards of consumer protection for tenants with the States with the objective of legislation being enacted in each State
that the Commonwealth ensure that the State and Territory governments provide sufficient public housing stock which is appropriately designed and well located near specialised health and other services to meet the needs of people with special needs who need to access to such services
that the Commonwealth and the States:
.	 explore different community housing models to suit the needs of different groups;
.	 explore ways of raising private finance for low cost and community housing;
.	 increase the size of the community housing sector; and
.	 develop model head leases for community housing organisations which are applicable to 
 their relationships with the various State and Territory housing authorities.
that in negotiating the next CSHA, the Commonwealth examine methods of providing funding guarantees of more than three years to the States and Territories in order to facilitate private sector involvement in the provision of low cost housing.

That the Senate take note of the document.
Mr Sharp claims that the Auditor-General's report found that he was careless rather than deceitful. Mr Sharp says:
These mistakes were honest mistakes . . . What this whole issue boils down to is the fact that I made 
 mistakes and that I was careless and that I have now paid a dear price for my carelessness.
By redefining his offence as merely one of carelessness, he hopes to lay the groundwork to justify his readmission to the ministry. John Sharp would want us to believe that he was a little careless and that alone was the cause of his resignation. The truth is no such benign conclusion can be drawn from reading the Auditor-General's report. It defies credulity to conclude that John Sharp's travel discrepancies were caused by carelessness or sloppy paperwork. Rather than answering questions, the ANAO report raises a raft of new issues that must be answered.
Mr Sharp claims that he relied on memory to complete his TA claims. Apart from the ludicrous spectacle of a minister attempting to claim almost $30,000 of public moneys on the basis of memory, this claim was openly questioned by the Auditor-General's report. The ANAO report noted that in his original claim certified on 26 June 1996, Mr Sharp claimed TA for the dates of 4, 7, 11, 20 and 23 June, which he then subsequently disclaimed. The Auditor-General was clearly not convinced of this explanation.
Does Mr Sharp expect us to believe that he was unable to remember on 26 June where he had been only three days before? Yet he was comfortable in compiling his claims from memory for periods of up to six months before. Even the timid language of the ANAO report could not conceal the ANAO's dissatisfaction with this explanation. This is not a question of carelessness. His explanation when squared with the facts simply cannot be believed. The ANAO report hints at it—and it must be stated right now: Mr Sharp's explanation is nothing more than a post facto justification for dishonestly obtaining travel allowance.
The first of Mr Sharp's 1996 TA claims was submitted on 26 June 1996 and the second was submitted on 19 January 1997. Why then did Mr Sharp's staff tell Laurie Oakes in September 1997 that Mr Sharp did not get around to completing any TA claim forms until he took leave in January? We all know why this line was put out. It was to put more time between the actual travel and the 
 submission of TA claims, hence justifying his apparent appalling memory. The truth is that staff deliberately misled Laurie Oakes. As John Sharp himself had actually filled in the reports in his own handwriting, the source of this misleading story is obvious to all.
The ANAO report noted that Mr Sharp's office had advised that the minister had indicated that he preferred to prepare his own travel allowance claims. One could understand a busy minister insisting on such a process so as to meticulously ensure the accuracy of every claim. In Mr Sharp's case, however, the true reason for the exclusion of the staff from this aspect of office administration appears more sinister. Why were the staff excluded?
Mr Sharp admitted to charging charter flights to the Commonwealth that involved strictly personal travel. The report notes that Mr Sharp advised ANAO that he used charter flights on occasions to visit his sick father. While all senators would extend their sympathy to Mr Sharp, this has never been accepted as a legitimate use of Commonwealth funded charter travel.
Further, the ANAO report questioned charter flights that were subsequently disclaimed in Mr Sharp's second revision. He was also unable to explain how invoices for flights that he claims he never took were certified by his office and forwarded by his office to MAPS. The details of these flights had earlier been provided to Mr Sharp prior to their release under FOI. He checked them at that time and advised DAS of several destination coding errors, but he did not identify any other flight details as having been incorrect.
How was he able to correct some destination codes but not realise that some of the details were for flights that he now says he never booked and never took? What were the circumstances surrounding the invoicing of charter flights to Mr Sharp's home department rather than to DAS? Why did Mr Sharp's electorate office forward charter flight invoices to the Department of Transport and Regional Development?
Will Mr Sharp now confirm that these arrangements were undertaken at his insistence because of a disagreement about the 
 extent of the entitlement by DAS? Is it the case that Mr Sharp approached Minister Jull for approval of his April 1996 flights and was knocked back? Is it the case that Mr Sharp took the charter flights anyway and billed them to the department of transport, which in turn billed DAS, and this fact was never brought to the attention of Mr Jull?
The bottom line for Mr Sharp is the report's conclusion that the 37 per cent variation rate in his first revised travel allowance claim is significant. The opposition has always sought to establish a realistic benchmark for understandable errors in TA claims. Half a dozen errors in a 12-month period was understandable before these matters became a matter of public controversy. But Mr Sharp's corrections involved the withdrawal of 37 per cent of his abnormally high TA claims. Further corrections that followed after his resignation have taken the variation rate even higher.
Yet despite all these discrepancies, the massive variation rate, the explanations that just do not stack up and the strange selective behaviour of Mr Sharp, we are expected to believe that he was just careless rather than dishonest. Why then when he made the repayments did he ask that the covering letter to DAS not go on the file? The chronology of events prepared by DAS for the Prime Minister on 23 September 1997 clearly states that Mr Sharp made such a request. The letter subsequently did not go on file. Yet now Mr Sharp claims that he gave no such instruction. Clearly this demonstrates a pre-emptive attempt at a cover-up.
John Sharp knew that the massive corrections to his TA claims would be a matter of controversy were they ever to become public. Not only are his TA claims reeking of dishonesty, his behaviour when he decided to amend his claims betrays his mental state. He knew he had done wrong and he sought to conceal it.
This report that we are dealing with was critical of MAPS for not checking Mr Sharp's claim outside the period under review. If John Sharp wants to claim that there are now no questions hanging over him relating to his TA claims, he should seek such a review. Was it his practice to prepare his TA from memory 
 prior to becoming a minister? If it was, even John Sharp would have to acknowledge the distinct possibility that a variation rate approaching 37 per cent could exist in these earlier claims.
Why was the Auditor-General restricted to looking at Mr Sharp's claims for just nine months? Clearly his claims for the 1993-96 period are critical. The same patterns of claims exist and he has admitted to the ANAO that, as a backbencher, he used the same arrangement to complete his TA claims that he would later use as a minister. Many of the records for this earlier period are with the Department of the House of Representatives, the authority responsible for paying the TA of non-ministers.
The simple truth is the ANAO report was by its very nature not able to challenge the veracity or honesty of Mr Sharp's explanations. The report could only note his explanations and present other contrary evidence in an essentially non-judgmental fashion. The Auditor-General did not complete a report on all aspects of the Prime Minister's written reference. It was not within his power to examine the claims of Mr Sutherland—they were not relevant to the audit process. Hence there has been no inquiry into Mr Sutherland's claims and the government has let them lapse. In turn this has meant no public exposure of the grubby role of the Prime Minister's office in attempting to conceal Mr Sharp's repayment.
This report does not clear him of impropriety. It does not justify his readmission to the ministry. As far as I can see, John Sharp can never return to the frontbench while all these questions remain unanswered. Mr Sharp's travel claims, both for the period when he was a minister and for the period before March 1996, should now be referred to the Federal Police. The extraordinary magnitude of the repayments coupled with the absurd explanations for the various discrepancies require nothing less.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 23 of 1997-98</title>,Documents,16,2,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-02,"—Shortly after the publication of the ANAO performance audit on ministerial travel claims the former Minister for Administrative Services, Mr David Jull, claimed there was no 
 impediment to his return to the ministry. It may just be that he is right. However, it has to be said that he took a few hits on the way through in this particular report.
What were Mr Jull's faults? Why was he dismissed from office? I think you can distil it down to four points. Firstly, his failure to keep the Prime Minister informed of certain events by some of his ministers. Secondly, misleading the parliament through the tabling of documents associated with ministerial travel allowance. Thirdly, biased and inequitable treatment vis-a-vis government and opposition members of parliament. Fourthly, a failure to reform a flawed system despite dire warnings from his own departments.
Before going on to each of these points, let me reinforce Senator Faulkner's point that the Auditor-General rightly rejected the Prime Minister's request to look at issues not associated with an efficiency audit. The Auditor-General's office is not a political office. Any inquiry into whether there was any complicity between the Prime Minister's office and Mr Jull's office and Mr Sharp's office is a matter for a legal inquiry. This is just the one that the government wants to resist at all costs.
The first of Mr Jull's faults—that is, not keeping the Prime Minister informed—is hardly a hanging offence. Prime ministers are busy people and cannot be expected to know everything. Indeed, if ministers constantly bombarded their Prime Minister with all the information at their disposal they would run the risk of alienating the Prime Minister very quickly. Yet it is now clear, of course, that the Prime Minister's office was informed—that is, by way of Mr Jull's senior adviser, Mr John Sutherland, advising the Prime Minister's chief political adviser, Mr Grahame Morris, and his office manager, Ms Fiona McKenna. It is therefore possible to find Mr Jull absolutely innocent in respect of the matter of not keeping the Prime Minister informed.
On the question of misleading parliament, the Auditor-General is specific. Page 51 of his report states:
Mr Jull, as the Minister responsible, tabled a report which was not accurate or internally consistent. 

Thus Mr Jull misled parliament. In interviews following the release of the Auditor-General's report, Mr Jull said that he had really done what everyone has done in the past. What he is failing to acknowledge is that this is the first time that these types of figures had been tabled in the House of Representatives rather than issued by way of a press release. However, I have to say in fairness to Mr Jull, that it remains unclear whether Mr Jull deliberately misled the parliament. There is a possibility, in tabling these figures, that it did not occur to him that he was in fact misleading parliament.
If, as Mr Jull claims, he was acting on advice from his department, why was the Auditor-General unable to find any documents to support this claim? Certainly, if such documents had existed both the Deputy Secretary and the Secretary to the former Department of Administrative Services would have intervened and advised Mr Jull that he was adopting an inappropriate course. Mr Jull may, in future, consider the wisdom of getting in writing any information he gleans from a friendly source in the department. But again, on balance, this is not a hanging offence and, by itself, should not debar Mr Jull from once again attaining ministerial office.
On the third point, Mr Jull is patently guilty. This was an exercise in smearing former Labor ministers for repaying legal claims to travel allowance whilst, at the same time, covering up illegal claims of certain coalition members. Claims made by former Labor government ministers and coalition shadow ministers for periods between the policy launches and election day, I stress, were entirely legal claims. The decision to highlight only the repayments by certain former Labor government ministers was political in motivation. Repayments made by former coalition shadow ministers in the House of Representatives were not highlighted and have yet to be published—they were protected. There was no such luck of course for coalition shadow ministers in this place—one sitting in this chamber probably repaid two days, to the best of my knowledge.
Mr Jull had made a great fuss of Labor's delay in publishing the 1994-95 ministerial 
 travel allowance claims. He published these with full office backgrounding and then published the 1995-96 figures early just in case anyone had missed the point. So he knew what a potent political weapon he had when he published the full set of figures in May 1997.
Being in charge of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Services Division of DAS does give a minister quite a considerable degree of power, but it should also give a minister a degree of responsibility. In the 15 months I held that particular power I cannot think of a biased decision I made to disadvantage coalition senators. They can correct me if I am wrong. I cannot make that claim for the totality of the Labor government. I am sure there was the odd occasion when favouritism was shown to Labor rather than the coalition opposition.
I think Mr Jull's sin in this case was simply to take it too far. However, I would argue that the lesson is probably learnt and we now have a more transparent and efficient administration and so we will see less of this bias in the future. As long as governments appoint people of the quality of Mr Oliver Winder you will not get a biased administration of these particular entitlements.
It is probably on the fourth question that I raised, on the failure to reform the system, where it has to be said that Mr Jull has been less than truthful. He claimed that he was left with a mess to clean up and that he had made efforts to fix the problem. These claims have a pretty hollow ring on examination. The reform process actually began in 1994, following DAS's approval of Mr John Howard's personal intervention in the postal workers' ballot by way of use of taxpayers' funds. There was a positive response to the proposal for reform from all the people canvassed, including Mr Fisher and a whole range of people, the notable exception of course being Mr John Howard.
Mr Jull certainly acted positively in response to the concern for reform expressed by his department in the period September 1996 to February 1997. Plans were drawn up for a full review of parliamentary entitlements. These plans were translated into budget 
 documents for the consideration of the Expenditure Review Committee. But what happens next? Suddenly, on 5 February, 1997, these documents disappeared. Political soundings had been taken and it was then decided to drop off reform of parliamentary entitlements. `Don't rock the boat,' was the message back from the various offices like Mr Reith's and Mr Howard's, that had been sounded out.
So if Mr Jull has a fault, it was weakness at that time. He should have stood up. He should have demanded that his cabinet submission go ahead. Of course, these all can be substantiated by reference to documents, including one leaked document that DoFA has put the Federal Police on to, to try to find the source of, which rather verifies it as an important document.
The government only moved to reform this particular area one month later, after it had junked the lot, on 5 March in a panic over allegations about Senator Colston. With half an hour's notice to his department, suddenly Mr Baxter is employed to investigate this area. The department got half an hour's notice before question time. Mr Baxter got half an hour's notice before question time.
Basically, if you take all these factors into account, it is possible to conclude that Mr Jull deserves some time out of office, but it is also possible argue that there is nothing to debar him from returning to ministerial office in the future. Political commonsense suggests that such a re-elevation should only occur if the coalition is successful after the next election.
I want to conclude on this point: there are two great points to Mr Jull's credit here. One is that he, in fact, informed everyone that there were communications between his office and the Prime Minister's office on these things, and if he had not done so, we never would have known. Secondly, I will say this about Mr Jull, even after all this, he still had the intestinal fortitude to actually be the only Liberal to stand up and defend Mr John Mellors, who was made a scapegoat by this government and by the Prime Minister. Those two things, and the fact that there was no hanging offence running through any of these particular things, suggest to me that, unlike 
 Mr Sharp, Mr Jull can return to higher duties at some time in the future.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-02,"—I think the Social 
 Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  that we have before us today is perhaps a timely reminder of the government's two years in office. I begin by acknowledging that there are a couple of positive measures in this bill. The Democrats are prepared to welcome and acknowledge those aspects of the bill, although in some cases even they have a bit of a nasty lining. The rent assistance conditions are one example. We think it is a winner for students to be eligible for rent assistance but in fact there are certain eligibility requirements there that seem unfair.
There are also aspects of this legislation that are reminders of some of the worst aspects of this government's policy measures, specifically in relation to young people, students and their families. This legislation is based on a premise that young people should be financially and I suppose otherwise dependent upon their families well into adulthood. I believe this is a misreading of the reality of family life today in this country, and it overlooks the social and many economic realities of young people and Australian families.
I think perhaps one of the worst measures and one of the most sad measures in this bill is the lack of eligibility for 16- and 17-year-olds for unemployment benefits or benefits of any kind unless they satisfy certain exemptions if they are not in employment, education or some form of training. I think that will be incredibly problematic for many thousands of young Australians. I ask the government at this point how they anticipate those young people will survive? Indeed, has the government calculated the kind of impact, financial and otherwise—certainly there is a social impact—on those families who will have to look after these young Australians?
Essentially, the common youth allowance replaces a number of payments made under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973—the youth training allowance, the newstart allowance and sickness allowance for 16- to 20-year-olds and for most 15-year-olds; Austudy for students aged 16 to 24 inclusive and older if the student commences a course prior to 
 turning 25 years of age; and 15-year-olds receiving Austudy benefits.
As has been mentioned many times in this debate today, the aim of the government to make payments more streamlined is of course administratively sensible and it is something that the Democrats support. We do support the aim to create a more flexible income support system, to reduce the number of the different rates of payments and to address the problems of those young people who are too often bounced between departments like DEETYA and the Department of Social Security. We support those measures.
However, the government's statement that `the youth allowance reinforces the government's philosophy that families should support young people until they have achieved financial independence' does raise some concerns for the Democrats. We believe that neither young people nor their parents should be subject to unreasonable hardship as a result of this so-called mutual obligation. They seem to be the buzz words not only in this debate but also in many debates of this nature that we have under this government and indeed the former government.
The common youth allowance relies on a moral obligation for parents to support their adult children. We are not talking about young, young people; we are talking about young adults—in fact adults. No such legal obligation exists for parents to do that. Nor is there any such legal obligation in any existing or other legislative framework.
The common youth allowance sets the age of independence for young people who are seeking work at 21 years and for those engaged in full-time study or training at 25. I believe that this is contrary to community norms and even the government's own practice. We have heard examples in the chamber today of where this does not conform with other measures and policies. The Child Support Act, for example, provides that parents are no longer responsible for providing maintenance once the child has become an adult. That is at the age of 18. Yet the government has failed to address that particular situation by increasing child support—the child support obligations of non-custodial 
 parents—until an adult child is 21 years of age.
The government's own recent tax initiative, the family tax initiative, cuts out at 16 for a young person not in  education or 18 for those young people who are students. I note too that in some cases young people will receive the common youth allowance directly at the age of 18. I presume this is because they are considered adult enough to receive a direct payment at 18. Yet when it comes to the rate of that particular payment they are viewed as dependent upon their parents. The government full well knows, and of course the Labor Party should too, that their concocted ages of independence are indeed a sham.
According to government figures, this bill and these measures will affect a significant number of young Australians. Around 560,000 young people will be eligible for the youth allowance. We acknowledge that students will make up around 70 per cent of this particular group. It is estimated—and these are government figures—that around 33,250 or six per cent of young people will receive less money as a result of this bill. I assume that is the minimum number who will miss out as a consequence of these changes—that is, the minimum number who will receive less money.
The bill will make 12,800 young people who would currently receive some form of income support ineligible to receive any payment at all. Again, I presume this is a minimum number. I am happy to be corrected. I am using government figures for the sake of this argument. The bill will force 13,400 young people who have left school earlier than the end of year 12 to return to school next year.
These cuts to income support—those people who are on less benefits or no benefits at all—will also impact adversely on those young people's families. In short, families are getting a shonky deal from this government. The youth allowance rhetoric in line with other government policies, such as work for the dole, talks a lot about the concept of mutual obligation. Far from being mutual, what the reality of the government's programs means is a greater obligation on young people 
 and their families to fend for themselves without any assistance from society or from government.
The critics, and there are many, of this approach by government towards young people observe this government policy or the government's obsession with a back to the 50s approach—a return to the halcyon days of the 50s. The figures and amounts upon which the government has based its parental means testing are certainly more appropriate for families living in the 50s than in the 90s.
According to this legislation, entitlement to the youth allowance will be subject to a parental means test. This particular test will kick in when the family income is only $23,400. An entitlement for families with one adult child will cut out completely when the parental income reaches $41,000. Again, I think this is one of the more sinister measures. We will be supporting any attempts to change these thresholds which are rather seemingly harsh and mean.
Indeed, the Democrats believe that the government's approach to those young people and others who need to access income support in our society, or in the case specifically of the Austudy scheme the income supplement, is very different from its proposed treatment of wealthier Australians when it comes to the potential for maximising avoidance. I think it is rather a hypocritical approach. Young people and others who are dependent upon income support have incredibly harsh measures, eligibility criteria and crackdowns applied to them. I wish the same measures were applied to those at the big end of town who seem to be the winners under this particular government.
The common youth allowance, it is said by government, is intended to remove the `disincentive' to study that currently exists. This disincentive is a financial barrier that has been created by the treatment of student assistance as income supplement rather than income support. So it is a disincentive of the government's own making, as was the case with the previous ALP government.
I acknowledge that DEETYA predicts that the majority of young people will seek to remain at school or return to school and that 
 around 27,000 people may seek to return to education and training as a result of the common youth allowance. The Democrats and many others would consider this a good thing if it were not simply a stick approach—that there is actually an incentive for young people and students to participate in the education system in a way that also enables them to have a viable and livable income and, of course, a lifestyle that is also healthy. But for those 27,000 young people I do not believe that the common youth allowance really provides a true incentive to study. The youth allowance may provide a financial imperative, but to force back to an educational training environment young people who may not necessarily want to be there or cannot be there is simply going to place undue pressures on not only those young people and their families but also the education system and teachers.
The Democrats' attempts, specifically the attempts by Senator Lyn Allison in the Senate employment, education and training committee to examine the impact of the common youth allowance on education and training institutions in Australia, were stopped by government. It was agreed to by the committee and then it was stopped. I think the government was incredibly remiss in being unwilling to even examine in some worthwhile and meaningful fashion the actual impact—negative or positive—that the common youth allowance would have on our educational institutions. That was a lost opportunity and I think it is one that teachers and education administrators all around the country are very concerned about. We have even heard from state and territory education ministers and representatives that they are very concerned about the lack of income support going to the states to deal with the potential impact of the CYA on education institutions.
Similarly, the Democrats are concerned about the pressures on sectors such as the vocational education and training sector. In 1996, 15- to 24-year-olds constituted over 40 per cent of participants in the vocational education and training system with the participation for 15- to 17 year-olds close to world's 
 best practice levels. However, even when the differences in data definitions and OECD cross country comparisons are taken into account, there is a gap between the current Australian participation rates and the country with the highest participation rate per age cohort. In particular, the participation of 18- to 24-year-olds would need to be expanded considerably in Australia in order to obtain the participation rates of best practice countries.
In the context of current negotiations over a new ANTA agreement, state, territory and Commonwealth ministers for vocational education and training have recognised that the common youth allowance and an increased emphasis on the provision of vocational education and training in schools will impose additional costs and pressures on the VET sector. In the 1996-97 budget, an efficiency dividend on Commonwealth owned purpose outlays resulted in a five per cent reduction of funding provided to ANTA. In 1997-98, the Commonwealth reduced annual funding to the states and territories appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This was to provide an incentive to the states and territories to achieve efficiency gains in vocational education and training operations. This reduction, which took effect on 1 January this year, is estimated to be around $20 million in the 1998 calendar year.
There is even greater unmet demand in the VET sector than the higher education sector. Something like 8.3 per cent of VET placement seekers are unable to gain a place compared with 3.1 per cent of higher education placement seekers. With a 1996 figure of 60,000 unmet demand places at TAFE alone, doesn't the government seem to be putting the cart before the horse by compelling young people to enter these education and training institutions whilst we have not proven—we have not established, certainly financially and economically—that these institutions can provide these young people with a place?
The Democrats are all for some kind of incentive to get young people, especially traditionally disadvantaged young people, into the education and training sector, but you 
 have to supply the places and you have to supply some form of student financial assistance and support to ensure that they get there. One thing you do not do is put other fees and charges and financial barriers in their path. Do not worry: I am not going to get stuck into HECS and other fees and charges today because I think it is on record enough—perhaps never enough but I will take that up in the committee stages.
In relation to Austudy, for those young people who do want to access education, the overwhelming disincentive to study is the embarrassingly below poverty line rates of student assistance in this country. Do not worry: we have not forgotten the failure of the Labor government to commit to a living income for students either. Despite assurances that Austudy would eventually be brought into line with unemployment benefits so that young Australians would not be living in poverty, the Labor government never matched its rhetoric on Austudy with any kind of meaningful action or financial commitment either. I note that it is still on record that the former minister Ross Free, in his correspondence to the National Union of Students, said:
Austudy is not designed to provide a student's full living costs.
In fact, in my time in NUS, the slogan was `You can't feed a dog on Austudy.' I wonder if it will be `You can't feed a cat on the youth allowance.'
Labor and coalition fees and charges for education and training have been the greatest disincentives—both financial and, I believe, psychological disincentives—to enter into and participate in education and training in this country. One of the government's claims is that, under the common youth allowance, students are the big winners. The claim is made because of the extension of rent assistance to compensate for the inadequacy of below poverty line Austudy. We, of course, welcome the extension of the rent assistance for students—we have long called for it—but note that not all young people or students on the youth allowance will qualify. I think that has been overlooked in some of the debates we have heard.
Access to rent assistance for students and the young unemployed is limited to those required to live away from home. This is regardless of whether they actually do live away from home or the amount or consistency of financial support they receive from their parents. Potentially, someone living in Wollongong could be required to work, study or job seek in Sydney, travel three hours a day and not be eligible to qualify for a higher rate of payment or rent assistance because they do not need to live away from home, according to this bill. I am happy to be corrected, if that is not correct. Indeed, I would be very keen to hear that that three-hour travel distance, allowing for both ways, does not apply.
Believe it or not, the actual means test, the unreliable and ambiguous Austudy actual means test, is going to be extended to apply to the common youth allowance. I think most of us know that the Austudy AMT has been nothing short of a disaster. One of the main problems with the means test and with Austudy in general has been, of course, the overuse of regulations to enact the legislation—again, a process that I acknowledge was started by the former government but I think has been entrenched or exacerbated by the coalition government. The 1997 report into Austudy conducted by the Australian National Audit Office found that the administrative complexity of the Austudy scheme was the result of many factors including:
.	 the number of regulations that underpin the Scheme;
.	 the number and frequency of changes made to these regulations each year;
. . .              . . .             . . .
.	 the complex administrative guidelines developed in relation to the Scheme; and
.	 the layers of interpretation that are required before the regulations and administrative guidelines can be translated into an eligibility decision.
The Australian Democrats urge the government to take heed of the warnings and the findings by the Ombudsman and to ensure that the workings of the actual means test are open to public scrutiny. The process must be transparent and accountable—certainly the Democrats will seek to ensure that this is so.
We will also be moving a series of amendments to ensure that the youth allowance is fair and reasonable and that no young person or their family is disadvantaged, to use the no disadvantage test used by the government, as a result of the passage of this bill. We will not be supporting a bill that does allow these families or young people or students to be disadvantaged.
My colleagues Senator Woodley, Senator Allison and Senator Bartlett will also contribute to this debate. They will refer to assets testing in relation to the impact on the VET and school sector and, of course, in relation to the two-year waiting period for migrants. I echo the previous comments by speakers in this debate regarding the consequential legislation, and I am sure we will deal with that at a later stage.
A further concern with this bill has been the process by which the common youth allowance has been introduced and debated. There was a restricted time frame for the Senate committee which looked at the implications of this bill. That is something a lot of community and advocacy groups have complained about. The lack of notice—less than two weeks notice to peak bodies in the student and youth sector to present submissions to the community affairs committee—demonstrates in some respects that there is no commitment to consultation. Many questions remain regarding how the common youth allowance will fit into the proposed Austudy payment scheme for students over 25, the future of the supplement loan scheme, and why students over the age of 25 will not be entitled to rent assistance. They are a few of our residual concerns.
We believe that this bill has the potential to split families, not to keep them together for longer. I think stripping the benefits from the 16- and 17-year-olds is going to be one of the harshest measures proposed, and perhaps introduced, by this government. We believe that this government has not only failed to look into the role of benefits and income support in this community but also has totally misread community feeling on this and also the social and economic pressures on young 
 people, on students and on their families today. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I rise to speak to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 . In the time available, I just want to pick up on a couple of points. One of the issues that my colleagues opposite, the coalition, used to abuse the Labor government for was the suggestion that we were encouraging people to stay at school past the compulsory time because we were just interested in getting unemployment numbers down. I am not sure whether this bill is actually a de facto understanding that they were wrong then and that they have changed their view and see the virtue of encouraging people to stay at school. Certainly, if that is the case, you will not find a fight with me.
I cannot speak too highly of the importance of an education for children at any time, but in particular at the end of the 20th century. With regard to the prospects for managing the rest of your life, however that is—whether it is in employment, in creative alternatives, in the field of arts, even in managing relationships, in getting on with each other, in being, if you like, participants in a civilised society—education is a very critical and necessary contribution. So I am pleased that the government actually now sees the need to encourage people to stay at school and get an education, but the way they are doing it in this legislation is ham-fisted and very unfair.
In particular, the problem for me is that the people who will be so-called encouraged—that is, the 16- and 17-year-olds, and I believe more accurately will be `compelled'—to return to education are precisely those people who are doing it tough, who are behind the eight ball, who have left school for a variety of reasons that are invariably not easily altered. If you are homeless, if you are a victim of family abuse, if you have suffered all sorts of trials in your own home, if you have left that family, if you do not count on their support, if you are trying to manage, finding yourself being compelled to go back to school or lose out on your payment is to completely miss the point of the needs of this cohort of students. The students who are staying on are 
 either those who want to complete year 12 with a view of tertiary education or those who are more than able to cope with the requirements of being in school.
The evidence is very strong that the very people who would be looking for the common youth allowance who are 16 or 17 are the very people who are going to be most disadvantaged. So I find with that emphasis, this government has got it very wrong on behalf of the people who most need that kind of assistance. If you are 16 or 17, you are not in education, you have left school without finishing year 12 and you do not have an exemption as required, then you will not qualify for an income support payment. As a result of that, you will not qualify for any education program, labour market assistance or any other program which might assist your transition from school to the work force.
As I said, a number of witnesses gave evidence to the Senate committee that these are the people who are victims of homelessness, family violence or abuse and that, in particular, there is a shortage of education places for these students. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, as Senator Stott Despoja said, has assessed that some 20,000-plus students will be encouraged back into school, if not compelled back into school, but there is no funding to assist the schools to cope with that.
The committee that I chair—the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee—is just concluding its examination on the status of teachers. We have already looked at private funding for public schools and we are very aware of the challenges for schools to try to cover the costs currently in front of them. But to pick up the cost of these extra students is going to be a tremendous demand and, if the finances are not there, it is going to be hard to expect the sympathy, understanding and recognition that is required in schools for so many students who, almost by definition, do not want to be there.
I do not think the point of the harshness of this change can be hammered home hard enough. While there is a sensitivity to amalgamate payments—and I am certainly one 
 who would appreciate simplification of social security payments—there is no sympathy for what this is going to do for those kids who are 16 and 17.
The other point is this: what happens if you are between 18 and 20 and you cannot establish that you are independent? The definitions of independence are particularly interesting. I find it curious in our country that, if you are 18, you can vote, you can carry a gun and you can authorise your own surgery, but you will not be eligible for any youth allowance payment unless you can prove some definition of independence. In particular, the most harsh definition is that you have to have been working full time for 18 months out of two years. That is a real challenge. So many of the people who have left school at 15 and have got into the work force—if they are lucky enough to have done that—are most likely to be in casual or part-time employment, not full-time employment, and are most likely to be sacked the minute they have their 18th birthday. They are highly likely to be a population with poor work experience and piecemeal work experience and of casual or part-time employment.
The definition of independence under this area of the legislation is particularly harsh—especially since, as I said, so many of those young people find that, once they turn 18, they are moved out of employment. They are an expense at that stage so off they go. If you do not believe this is true, just check out what is happening, for example, in the supermarkets of Australia. The youngsters get the jobs but, once they are 18, very few of them can stay on. That definition of independence is going to be particularly hard for this group of people.
I was a bit interested to find that Minister Newman, who is such a strong supporter of the family, was happy to include in the definition of independence people who have been in a de facto relationship for two years. I am not unhappy if that is the case and these people are allowed to have some kind of support, but it does seem contrary to many of the other things I have heard her say on a number of occasions.
For so many people in this country, once you are 18, once you have been in the work force for a while and certainly once you are out of school, you are no longer a youngster. You are no longer expecting to be at home and one of the kids for mum and dad. This definition of independence is a very harsh ruling. If your family income is somewhere over $23,000, the payment starts to fall, but we are not talking about people who are in clover in that case. Yes, if people have got a very high income, there might be a different case for the testing. But your income testing, parental testing and assets and means testing cuts in at a pretty low income. It certainly seems to me to be pushing very hard the increased responsibility for those families to look after children who really are no longer called children. Very few people in this country aged 18 to 20 are seen as being dependent on their families in the way that children under 18 might be.
Again, I would suggest that this bill's intention seems to be mainly to simplify the payments, but it has got it very wrong in terms of the hardship that will be provided to two most important groups of young people. I have not got time to talk further about the implications for Austudy. In those cases, as this government has said, you will have to be 25 before you can be eligible for independent assistance.
The evidence before the Senate committee made it very clear that this legislation is going to have a very injurious effect on those youngsters most likely to be at disadvantage and least likely to be able to cope without the sort of assistance that previously was available to them. I do believe that you have got it wrong, Minister. The policy and intentions for simplifying payments are right; the implications for caring for people who are behind the eight ball are very wrong.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-02,"—Late last year I was surprised and concerned when a bundle of glossy youth allowance brochures arrived at my office for distribution to young people inquiring about income support. Quite aside from the fact that 
 I knew the youth allowance had not yet been debated in the Senate, I was most alarmed by the misleading content contained within the brochure. Many young people pass through our offices on a daily basis and our staff attempt to assist them in whatever way possible—but to distribute these youth allowance brochures to young people and students presents a real problem for us.
You see, the Greens (WA) believe young people have the right to be fully informed about federal policies which affect their lives, not to be deliberately misinformed when the government is attempting to rationalise income support payments to the long-term detriment of both young people and the broader Australian society.
One of the first claims that the brochure makes is that the youth allowance will make income support arrangements `simpler and more flexible.' Let us just examine that statement to the youth of Australia by looking at the actual detail of this bill. For a person to receive youth allowance they must:
satisfy the activity test (s.541)
OR
be exempt from the activity test (s.542)
AND
be of Youth Allowance age (s.543)

This analysis of the youth allowance legislation did not seem `simpler and more flexible' at all. In fact, the only flexibility seems to be that which provides departmental officials with the ability to devise oppressive guidelines. There will be far less flexibility for those many young people who will be forced to live at home, or for those who will be drafted into work for the dole programs, or for those forced to submit to youth allowance activity agreements. It belies the government's attitude to young people which says, `Let's provide flexibility for methods of control and let's remove flexibility for the young people themselves.'
Another of the statements in the glossy brochure was that the youth allowance would result in a `better and fairer system by applying these same rules to all young people.' Anyone who examines this bill in detail will soon realise that this is an out-and-out fabrication. The plain and simple fact is that rules are not the same for everyone under the youth allowance. If you are under 18, you will have to be in full-time education and training. There is no provision for case management. If you are between 18 and 20, you may receive case management but be subject to a parental means test. If you are over 21, you will not be subject to a parental means test, unless of course you are a full-time student, in which case you will be dependent on your parents' income until you are 25. This is not the `same rules for all young people.' The government is misleading the youth of Australia. I would think that if this were a company they might be subject to the Trade 
 Practices Act under false and misleading conduct.
As a number of youth organisations have pointed out, such proposals are also totally inconsistent with other areas of government policy. For the purposes of taxation and other social security payments, the government deems that young people cease to be financially dependent at 16. Yet with this legislation it is imposing financial dependency on the unemployed until 21 and on students until they are 25. In other words, this government's definition of dependency differs by up to nine years, depending on whichever cost-cutting measure it is attempting to inflict on Australia's youth and their families. Of course, this inconsistency and inequity is not confined to the age of independence. Once again, we are dealing with the so-called reforms to student and youth assistance, which provide for different definitions of `marriage-like relationships', according to the government's budgetary agenda.
So we have the ludicrous situation under this legislation that a person who is 22 years old and has been classed as living in a marriage-like relationship while receiving newstart allowance will be told by this government that they are no longer living in a marriage-like relationship as soon as they begin full-time study and are consequently transferred to youth allowance. Such couples who have been sharing a house for a considerable period of time and who will have been recognised as de facto by the government from the very beginning of their relationship if they have received any other kind of social security payment, will be informed that, under youth allowance, their relationship no longer exists and that they are now children dependent on parental support.
How absolutely ridiculous. No wonder young people view law-makers in this country with such derision. After all, we are effectively removing the basic human right of consenting adults to live in a relationship independent of their families. While this may be John Howard's vision for Australian society—a return to 1950s values and conventions—it is at complete odds with the reality for young people in today's society.
Of course, there are many other inconsistencies which will come out in the course of this debate. Some of these will become apparent when we compare this bill with the consequential bill which we received only late last week. For example, a major part of the government's pea and thimble trick with this legislation is the provision of rent assistance for students. It is a blatant attempt to play off one group of young people against another. In order for the government to pursue its ideological agenda of forcing many 18- to 20-year-old adults back into the family home, it is waving the carrot of rent assistance for students.
Yet even this promise is a false one for many students. Under the consequential legislation, those students who begin their full-time studies after turning 25 will not receive rent assistance. The government bleats about having a genuine desire to provide students with rent assistance, saying, `This can only be financed by removing the independence of 18- to 20-year-olds,' yet it seems that this principle does not extend to students who happen to start studying after 25.
This is a real disincentive to study which will impact on low socioeconomic groups, and on women in particular. It is a piecemeal approach at its very worst; the kind of ill-considered policy which produces incredible anomalies, not the least being that if you enrol the day before your 25th birthday, you will be entitled to rent assistance, but if you enrol the day after your 25th birthday, you will not. But then this legislation is not about good social or educational policy. It is about saving money and attacking easy scapegoats—the young and the unemployed. I guess it is a break from attacking migrants, refugees and Aboriginal people.
Before I indicate some of the key problems with this bill, I would like to make it clear that the idea of a common youth allowance is fairly sensible. However, as usual, this government has taken a basically sound proposal, mangled it through its Treasury and policy wings, and finally produced something which is impossible to support. The government has ostensibly set out to remove disincentives to study by consolidating payments 
 for young people, but instead of seeking to provide better assistance it has effectively consolidated existing provisions at the lowest common denominator.
As the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition pointed out in its submission to the cursory Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearings on this bill, young people currently leave their studies because Austudy is inadequate to live on—not that newstart allowance is in any way generous. Yet this major impediment to study, the miserably low level of assistance for students, is entrenched in this bill and inflicted on young job seekers as well.
If the government was serious about removing disincentives to study, it would have raised the level of Austudy to that of the newstart allowance, not reduced the level of and accessibility to payments for young unemployed to that of Austudy. If the government really wanted simplicity, it might pursue legislation to provide one payment to all those over 16, with parental income testing for full-time students up to 21 and comprehensive partner income testing for all. This is the way to provide fairness and simplicity, but it has been ignored because the government's agenda with this legislation is more about cost cutting than about addressing the needs of Australian youth.
Don't you remember the bleating from the coalition when the Working Nation statement came out from the former government? Why were they bleating? They were bleating because the labour market programs that Labor said they were providing would actually interfere with the statistics on long-term unemployed and youth unemployed. Guess what? If you cannot apply for unemployment benefit if you are young and if you either have to be in work or at school, what will that artificially do to the rates of unemployment? It will simply make them disappear. So basically those people will have to disappear, I guess, or find some other means of survival. Isn't that going to be good for employment figures?
Income support rates for independent young people should be commensurate with adult levels to reflect the plain, indisputable reality 
 that the cost of living for a 19-year-old is the same as for anyone over 21. There are no youth concessions on rent, food or petrol. In fact, there is often a surcharge for youth—insurance premiums being a prime example. Yet young people, who are treated as adults under the law, are being discriminated against on the basis of age when it comes to income support. It is astonishingly unfair. It is reflected in the disdain that young people have towards the government of this country and the politicians who control it.
The Greens (WA) support commonality between income support allowances, but we utterly reject such a project when all it seeks to achieve is to bring everyone's assistance down to the lowest possible level. Key problems with this bill include the age of independence, the definition of youth allowance couples, the lack of case management options for those under 18, the appalling low parental income free area, the possibility that full-time students may be subject to activity agreements, the absence of a general concession for a full-time load for students, the disturbing amount of discretionary power granted to the department's secretary, and the absence from the legislation of much of the detail of the proposed changes.
This last point is a major concern. So much of the detail on how the youth allowance will work is contained in guidelines and regulations which senators have not had the opportunity to consider in their completed form. To proceed with debate on such an important issue without the administrative detail is an insult to both democracy and the young of this country. I will expand on just two of these problems in this address to the chamber. They are the removal of unemployment assistance for those under 18 and the parental means testing of 18- to 20-year-old unemployed people.
The Greens (WA) agree that it is entirely reasonable for young people under the age of 18 to choose from a wide range of education, training and/or employment programs in order to receive income support from the government. Indeed, we support this principle for those of any age receiving income support. We would also agree that those under 18 
 should be encouraged to take part in educational endeavours, including completing year 12, but such a requirement must be contingent on the government providing a viable set of alternatives for these young people, especially those who are unlikely to benefit from formal schooling.
In considering the options for young people, let us not forget the government's savage cuts to vocational education and training in the last two budgets. At the very least, this legislation should not pass the Senate without providing that case management is an alternative option for 16- and 17-year-olds who cannot participate in formal education or training. It must be accepted that students often fail at educational institutions because the institutions have grossly failed them.
Let us not abandon these young people. Let us not kick them out into the streets into a cycle of depression and hopelessness. Let us not penalise the families who need that income support to put food on the table. Let us not increase the risk of youth suicide or substance abuse. Let us keep these young people within the community, actively pursuing activities towards constructive employment which prevent them from becoming marginalised and disenfranchised. Let us not have a debate in the future where you point the finger at young people and say, `They do not have respect for authority. They just aren't grateful, so let's get back to the birch and hanging and so on.' That is what we will see in a couple of years if we are not careful.
It is an insult to their intelligence to tell 18- to 20-year-old unemployed people that parental means testing of their unemployment income support is an `equity measure'. As AYPAC pointed out, governments of all persuasions have justified applying the means test to students by claiming that students self-impose dependency when they undertake full-time study. We dispute that education is a privilege of this kind. Rather, we see it as a fundamental right of all people in Australian society. However, even using this government's flawed logic, one cannot possibly characterise youth unemployment as self-imposed when it is running at 25 to 50 per cent in most Australian communities—or 
 perhaps it is just a figment of the imagination, both ours and theirs.
Such a proposal assumes that low to middle income families which will fail the parental means test are not only able to support their 18- to 20-year-old adult children who may or may not be living at home, but that they are willing to support these young adults, who may well lead completely independent lives from their families. As reported in the National Youth Affairs Research Scheme paper `What price independence?', Robyn Hartley found that many young adults who live at home are expected to contribute to the household income and not be an additional burden upon the budgets of low income families.
I do not believe that the government is so foolish that it cannot recognise that setting the age of independence at 25 years for students is a structural hindrance for people wishing to commit to full-time study; nor that it is so ignorant that it cannot foresee that setting the age of independence for young unemployed at 21 will place tremendous financial and emotional hardship on many of Australia's battling families; nor that it is not aware of the long-term problems of removing employment assistance from those under 18. The fact that the government is not just foolishly ignorant—that it is rushing through grossly unfair changes with both eyes open—makes this legislation all the more despicable.
I will be listening with interest to the committee stage of the debate, but I think it is grossly unfair that we have not had more time to look at the other bill associated with this. It is realistic to consider that there will be careful consideration by the government and that it will listen to the community and to the young people of Australia—not about what they know now but about what they will know if this bill goes through. The government should listen to them and to the future of Australia, rather than just listening to a very narrow interest group in terms of a particular budgetary pursuit.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-02,"—I table the corrigendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 . I 
 thank senators for their contribution to the debate. While I value the interest that they have shown in the bill, I listened with some disappointment to their contributions. It reminds me of the comment that was made in the estimates committee when I suggested that we had something very important here which was going to be very beneficial to young people in Australia. I was told that other senators' contributions had to focus on anything that they saw as negative.
We have heard examples of that in today's debate, I am afraid. The items that have been picked out for criticism by senators have almost totally ignored the enormous value of this major social policy reform. I would have thought all senators who understand what a disadvantage it is in life to start out looking for work without a skill to offer would have acclaimed the opportunity that is intended to come from this measure to help young people have a better start in life. I did not hear much of that in the debate. I am rather sad about that.
This bill provides a new and a better way of helping the young people of Australia. It is not a savings measure. It has been done as important social policy reform. It was announced in the budget in 1996 after the previous government had been urged by welfare organisations and parents around this country to introduce something similar. That government had not got around to doing it. I have been heartened by the response of organisations which look after young people and their families which have realised that some of these measures are going to be extraordinarily important in the future. We have inherited a mess of confusing payments.
—Which ones?
—I am happy to give you one example straight away that I was about to move to. Confusion occurred when young people tried to access their entitlements, when five payments were paid by two different departments and were paid at 13 different rates. Even then, young people could slip through the cracks and be entitled to no support at all. That is the situation now.
If as a student you get sick with glandular fever, for example—which sadly is not at all 
 unusual with young people studying—and you must take a smaller academic load, then you are precluded from getting Austudy, you are not able to look for full-time work, and you are precluded from getting unemployment assistance. So students with such illnesses are not helped at all. Under the new arrangements, your circumstances can change from full-time study to part-time training and part-time jobsearch—a mixture of those things—and you will not have to reapply or find that you are not eligible for any support. I would have thought that Senator Margetts would have welcomed that; I certainly think it is one of the important outcomes of this proposal.
 Labor had a system where you could get $75 a fortnight more for being on the dole than for being at TAFE. Senator Margetts, don't you think that is iniquitous? I do. Fancy saying to the young people of Australia, `Go on the dole and we'll give you $75 more than if you were a student.' What does that say about the way we as a country value education?
—It is elitist.
—Senator Lundy, I am talking about education that has produced tradesmen, some of whom are on the other side of this chamber and some of whom are on this side of the chamber. Under your government, this country has been producing a secondary education system designed for the 30 per cent of students who go on to university. We are still focusing on those students but we are now also focusing on the other 70 per cent who have been neglected under your arrangements.
Vocational education—whether it occurs in the schools, in the workplace or in the TAFE colleges—is badly needed in Australia and young people are vitally affected when they cannot access that sort of education. I am not talking about eggheads; I am not talking about locking people up in school; I am talking about giving young people access to badly needed skills acquisition. That is what will come from this legislation.
—So what have you done to TAFE?
—I do not think we have heard any words from the opposition acknowledging the faults in their system. They did not listen when they were in government and they are not listening now. If they had listened and were willing to be honest, they would say that this government has fixed up Labor's mess.
Young people now will need to be on only one payment instead of trying to access that web of payments and still falling in between them. Students who have to leave home to study will get rent assistance for the very first time. I have been amazed how people have been very ready to wave that aside as if it counts for nothing. Do you realise you are talking about up to $75 a fortnight more, about pharmaceutical allowance as well and about a remote area allowance for those in the appropriate circumstances? How easily you dismiss all that. How wrong it has been that young unemployed people have had access to that allowance while students have not. We are bringing the students up to the same level. Is that unfair? Is it unfair to anybody? I think not. I cannot understand how you could possibly be criticising it.
I was especially disappointed—and I am sad she is not in the chamber now—to hear Senator Denman earlier because she was talking about young people in north-western Tasmania being losers from the youth allowance. Senator Denman, I guess, knows that I used to farm in the north-west of Tasmania so I know the area very well; I know the people very well. One of the things that senators should recognise is that participation in further education is lower in that area of Tasmania than anywhere else. That is partly because many parents there have not had further education themselves. Only now are some of them starting to access further education, which I welcome and am very glad about.
But, at the same time, that region of Tasmania has the highest level of youth unemployment. It is desperately important that we help those young people to get jobs. While the young people are jumping out of school early—perhaps because their families have not had the value of tertiary education of any 
 kind themselves—they do not understand what they are being condemned to by leaving school without any saleable skills. They do not understand how they are condemning themselves—or the parents are condemning their children—to long periods of unemployment. Young people are 2½ to three times as likely to be long-term unemployed if they do not have those saleable skills.
The reality is that right around the developed world—and I am sure Senator Cook would recognise this too—unskilled jobs are disappearing. They are ending up in the underdeveloped nations in the world while, throughout countries like Australia, they have been disappearing for some time. If we as a nation can sit by and not help our young people to recognise the need for skills acquisition and not help them to access those skills we are doing them a terrible disservice. The jobs that are coming in the future are in areas of new technology and in the service industries, and young people need training in both those areas.
Tasmania, for instance, has a growing tourism industry particularly because of the vehicle rebate scheme that this government introduced as part of its Tasmania package, which has already brought considerable benefits to the tourism industry. That industry is where there are massive numbers of jobs in Australia for young people. That is the area that we must ensure young people are aware of and get access to.
We are saying that our young people should finish secondary school or the equivalent. We are not saying they need to be locked up in school, as some would suggest, and I think parents around Australia would endorse that. But some members of the opposition in this place have said that young people should be able to drop out if they want to. All too sadly, some people have been dropping out before they have even reached the age of 16. There are lots of adults in Australia who worry at the truancy rates that we are seeing in our country. We should be able to help our young people into schools—if that is where their interest lies—or into traineeships, apprenticeships or TAFEs.
There are a number of exemptions in this legislation which will cover all those cases where it is appropriate that a young person not be in further education or training. If they are homeless, if they are sick, if they cannot access a training place or if they have some other good reason, then we will exempt them. But no longer will a young Australian be able to say, `I don't want to go to school,' and then walk into Centrelink for the dole. Labor's system sent out all the wrong signals to young people: drop out of school and go on the dole rather than go to TAFE. But we are saying that young people should stay in education—not necessarily to be an egghead—and get skills so that they will get a much better start in life and their job prospects will be significantly better.
The education system will be ready to receive them. We are spending $42.6 million over three years through programs, such as students at risk and jobs pathway, and new apprenticeships. Schools will be paid more for each child enrolled. Senator Denman obviously did not realise that we have deferred the requirement for the under 18s to be in education for six months until 1 January next to give institutions a more reasonable lead time to make the transition.
I wanted to draw the attention of senators to the moves by the new Labour government in Britain. Senator Crowley was making some gratuitous comments about ham-fisted approaches in this area of 16- and 17-year-olds. Mr Blair is, in fact, introducing just such an arrangement for 16- and 17-year-olds in the United Kingdom, recognising full well that it is no good saying to a young person that you can be unemployed as a choice. You need skills if you are going to get on in life. It is amazing that we could have criticism like that here when people hold up the new Blair government in Britain and say, `They are doing great things.' They are doing what we are doing, and you had better understand it, Senator.
There are a lot of other issues which we will address as we go along, but I do want to point out to senators that Senator Crowley, for instance, was giving a great deal of attention to young people whom she expects will leave 
 school and will drop out altogether—the under 18s. I want to make it clearly understood that we are talking about the young people who are currently on youth training allowance. Currently, that is something like 32,000 young people.
We believe we have thousands of young people who will be exempted from full-time educational training on the grounds that they are homeless, sick or have caring responsibilities; that there are no appropriate places available; that they have left employment; or for some other reason. Something like 11,900 would be returning to school. We believe there would be something like only 1,600 young people out of all that cohort, that age group, who would choose to not return to school or stay in education and training and either get a job or are supported totally by their family. I think that is a recognition of what this is actually going to mean in practice. Parents will say, `You need to go and get those skills for your own sake. If you do not, there will be no financial support for this family.' I think young people will be encouraged by their parents to act in their own interests.
—Poverty is an incentive, isn't it?
—No, it is not a question of poverty, Senator. I think you obviously do not have a very great understanding of the means tests as they currently operate under Austudy and as they will operate under the youth allowance. In fact, they will be more generous under the youth allowance than they have been under Austudy. So I think there has been some misrepresentation about that.
I will not address the question of age of independence of students tonight. I think that is a debate we are clearly going to have later. I think the point is that arguing that all young people at the age of 18 are independent is simplistic. If you look at real families, they slowly move out of dependence through their late teens and their early 20s. They may be legally adults at 18, but they are mostly financially dependent, either on their parents or on the taxpayer. So they are financially 
 dependent from the point of view of being raised.
So our independence ages are 21 for the unemployed and 25 for students. It is to those ages that young people should first look to their parents for support. As with anything else under the Social Security Act, people are not expected to go straight to the taxpayer for support to the extent that they or their families can support them. They should first go to their families for assistance. Of course, if parents are on low income or the youth is independent, the taxpayer will then step into the parents' shoes.
There were some comments made about consultation, and I would like to knock that on the head pretty early on. There were submissions asked for in the budget in August 1996. Senator Vanstone and I asked parents and organisations around Australia to make submissions, to consult with us, because we announced the general principles of a youth allowance we were trying to achieve. We had a lot of consultation. It was very productive, very valuable. I thank those who took part.
That was in August 1996. In June 1997, a package was developed and in September 1997, a bill was produced for senators and members to study. In November 1997, the committee met. It is now some months later. People do not have any reason for suggesting that there has not been extensive consultation, that there have not been extensive opportunities for senators to study the legislation. After all, it was debated in the House of Representatives last year. So I think some of the arguments that I have heard here today are specious. Perhaps people should look more carefully at what the true situation is.
This is a major reform, as I said at the beginning, and it does bring order to the mess we inherited from Labor in this area. The key issues are clear: the ages of independence; the need for young people to stay in skills acquisition if they are to find real jobs; and the thrust of the independence rules. I am optimistic that the Senate is going to support this because, despite the sound and fury, I believe in your heart of hearts, Senators, you understand how important this is to the young people of Australia, to the future of our 
 country, that we do not have a pool of young unemployed without skills, without hope, and very little chance of getting good long-term and interesting jobs. That is what we have inherited. We are trying to do something about it. I would have thought we would have had commendation for that and a willingness to work constructively to achieve good outcomes for young Australians.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-03-02,"—by leave—As a result of question time and an invitation thereafter by Senator Ray to confirm my level of knowledge of the Woodhouse Pastoral Company, I caused further inquiries to be made. The brief to me for approval contained only Woodhouse Pastoral Company as the proprietor and no mention of any Baillieu. The brief did not include the original application form or any third party supplementary material. Neither my office nor the department can find any other information that was provided to me regarding the proponent.
After question time I asked my department for the original application and any supporting material. I table the application in the name of the Woodhouse Pastoral Company. The seventh page, however, requires the printed name of representatives and stated there is the name Mr Antony Baillieu as owner. The Trust for Nature, Victoria, supported the application and I table the supporting documents. On the sixth page of this material there is reference to the owner being Woodhouse Pastoral Company, but the contact being Antony Baillieu (owner).
I sought clarification from my officers in the light of my question time brief prepared by my department which I read into the record. I read that `officers of my department did not know who owned this company at the 
 time of assessing the project'. Both the team leader for Victoria and the Assistant Secretary of Sustainable Landscapes, who dealt with the matter, state that they had not noticed the reference to Antony Baillieu. They had concentrated on the quality of the project and the name of the applicant, Woodhouse Pastoral Company. They had not addressed the issue of ownership of the company. Their interest was the assessment of the environmental merit of the project.
I think that advice is consistent with that they said at the estimates. As I have indicated, they strongly supported the project on its merits. I do not otherwise know of the Woodhouse Pastoral Company. I do not know Antony Baillieu and, obviously, I therefore do not know his relatives.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Natural Heritage Trust</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-02,"—by leave—I do appreciate the fact that Senator Hill has come down to the chamber to ensure the record is as accurate as possible. I have no doubt that the documents that Senator Hill has tabled will indicate that the name Mr Antony Baillieu is on the application forms. I have got no doubt that Senator Hill has provided previous advice to the Senate in good faith in relation to that specific matter.
The point that the opposition has been making, however, is this—and it needs to be said again—because of intervention from Senator Hill's own staff, three projects in the state of Victoria which had previously either been not considered or rejected by the regional assessment panel in Victoria were, apparently along with a whole range of other projects, reassessed. Senator Hill's own staff instructed officers of Environment Australia to have another look at these projects.
What followed was that three projects were then approved. At the estimates committee last week we were able to establish that one of those projects was this particular project from the Woodhouse Pastoral Company and we know that the Woodhouse Pastoral Company is controlled by the Baillieu family. I think Senator Hill has provided some further evidence tonight to suggest that that is the case. 
We know that the Baillieu family is probably the heaviest political family in the Victorian division of the Liberal Party. We ask these questions as to why that particular proposal has come forward and been approved. It is a grant for $52,900 to fence off 250 hectares of property owned by the Baillieu family. That is what it is going to do. It is going to fence off a very significant area of—
—It has conservation values.
—Senator Hill interjects that it has got conservation values.
—Very significant conservation values.
—They may be very significant conservation values, Senator Hill. You owe the Senate and the people of Australia an explanation as to why a member of your staff got on the telephone to Environment Australia officers and got these projects reassessed. You owe the people of Australia and senators an explanation as to why, after your staff had got on the telephone to Environment Australia and got these projects reassessed, this particular project—which has this involvement of the Baillieu family and all the Liberal Party paw prints and fingerprints all over it—comes through. You owe this Senate an explanation as to why that is the case.
—You will not listen.
—I thank Senator Hill for bringing forward this information. I appreciate your correcting the record, Senator Hill.
—Clarifying it.
—Or clarifying it. I accept that you have done that as soon as that information has become available to you. I am not being critical of you in the conduct of your ministerial duties in that regard. You have done the right thing. You have come and clarified it as soon as that has been drawn to your attention.
So be clear: the opposition is not criticising Senator Hill for that, but we want answers to these questions as to why Senator Hill's office got this reassessment process going for pro 
 jects that the regional assessment panel had excluded in the first round. These did not go anywhere near the state assessment panel. These projects were excluded in the first round. Senator Hill's office got them reassessed.
We want to know why we have this extraordinary coincidence of only three projects being approved as a result of the instructions of Senator Hill's office—we had better have a look at the other two, I think; it is probably just cover—and why this particular project was approved. They are some of the questions in relation to this issue that Senator Hill has not yet answered.
—That's not true.
—It is true, Senator Hill. The opposition will continue to demand answers from you. I am afraid, Senator Hill, what we now know—
—Whatever the facts are, you won't listen.
—It is not an issue. Senator Hill, we know what the facts are; that is, that your office interfered. What we want to know is why your office interfered. We want to know why we have the extraordinary circumstance that, as a result of the interference of your office—and we want to know what your involvement was—this Liberal Party fix occurred.
This will not go away. This is one of many hundreds of projects—and I hope for Senator Hill's sake that there are not a whole lot more. I said at the time the Natural Heritage Trust Fund Bill was being debated that this gave an opportunity for political rorting on a grand scale—political pork-barrelling on a grand scale. The more we know, the more we hear, the more we are able to extract out of you and the Department of the Environment, the more we know that this has been a rort.
We still want answers as to why 250 hectares of this property was fenced. I think the Senate and the people of Australia are entitled to some explanation and some justification for what I believe on the surface appears to be a most extraordinary abuse of government process and misuse of government and taxpayers' money.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Natural Heritage Trust</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-02,"—The bills before the chamber now seek authority for additional appropriations of $1.684 billion. They represent the new policy initiatives of the government since the 1997-98 budget and essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to that covered in the earlier appropriation acts.
The amount being sought is partially offset by savings of $373 million which are no longer required under the amounts originally appropriated in the earlier appropriation acts. These proposals, therefore, represent a net increase in the appropriations of $1.311 billion, around one per cent more than the estimated outlays at the time of the 1997-98 budget.
I should also note that these additional appropriation requests do not translate directly into a request for additional outlays of $1.311 billion in the 1997-98 budget, with a consequent blow-out in the deficit. Some of the myriad of appropriations are actually classified as revenue—for example, the reimbursement of taxes paid by some diplomatic, consular and charitable bodies—and some are classified as below the line as financing transactions—for example, repayment of debt associated with Australian National Railways.
Nevertheless, these bills do represent additional spending in a number of respects. Fortunately, some of the additional spending does not represent a backdown on previous decisions. The additional $34 million of legal aid is one such example. There is also a myriad of proposed additional appropriations which are being sought, some examples of which are: two separate appropriations totalling $27.4 million for the Tasmanian regional forest agreement—that is, $5.4 million and $22 million respectively; $11.2 million for the 
 Constitutional Convention election; $96 million to the states as compensation for stamp duty arising from the sale of airports; $111 million for various defence purposes; $40 million for major asset sales; $71 million for managing the surplus staff of the DAS business units—I guess that is redundancies; and $2 million in ex gratia payments to retiring commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, as the government rams through its policy to axe the IRC. Some of these are important bills, if merely routine, and they are supported by the opposition.
I make the point that senators should be aware that, whilst the ALP views the passage of these bills as automatic, those in the coalition do not. The infamy of 1975 and the threatened action in 1974, which contributed to the calling of the early 1974 election, arose because of a threat of the non-passage of appropriation and supply bills. The ALP believes that interference with these supply bills is dirty pool and opposes that action in principle. A government, even a government as bad as this government, is entitled to expect passage of its appropriation legislation. It is entitled to such treatment by this parliament because it is the government and hence commands the confidence in the other place. This is a fundamental principle for Labor, although it cannot be said to be a fundamental principle for the coalition.
The recent estimates hearings brought to light a number of important issues, such as the aborted Wik advertisements, the rorts involved in the Natural Heritage Trust Fund allocation scandal—a bit of which we have just heard a moment ago—and the dissembling by the government on tax reform and other matters. I would like to comment on some of the matters that have arisen in the Treasury portfolio from those estimates.
Firstly, there are the outrageous revelations concerning the selection of the former treasurer of South Australia, Mr Stephen Baker, by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for a plumb overseas job with an international financial institution. Twenty-nine people applied; none were interviewed. All the documents were forwarded to the Treasurer's office. He per 
 sonally made a selection without there being any objective criteria in front of him. None of the others were interviewed and Mr Baker got the job.
This is clearly a job for the boys `fix' and it is not consistent with what the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has said are this government's allegedly higher standards of public probity and openness when it comes to dealing with matters of major importance. This is not an isolated case. Last year we saw Senator Short go to the European Bank of Reconstruction after a dismal period as a failed Assistant Treasurer, and in similar circumstances—a jobs for the boys political appointment again. Mr Baker has gone to an office in Manila on a fixed three-year term at $120,000 a year—no tax is paid on that appointment—and at a time in which the greatest financial crisis in living memory is gripping Asia. It is not an experienced bureaucrat who has filled this post, as is normal, but a political hack and one who is a friend of the Treasurer.
That is outrageous. It should be denounced by the government. It is being covered up by them and it is only flicked away by the Treasurer in his standard answer to reporters' questions that the best person got the job. If that is true and there is nothing to hide, then I enjoin the government to hide nothing. To make the process transparent, let us know the qualifications of the other people who did not make it to the final list for interview and let us see what the selection criteria were so that there can be an assessment of the objectivity. The fact that the government declines to do that supports, of course, the view that is the growing public perception that this is a government of rorts, protection of mates, elevation by virtue of political influence—and never mind the important functions of serious overseas posts to which this government should be appointing the most experienced people.
However, that is one element of the issues that arose from the estimates just last week. The one that I want to pay most attention to is the extraordinary and convoluted manoeuvres by this government on the subject of taxation. We often hear in this chamber 
 echoes of what the government alleges is its tax reform commitment. The use of the word `reform' in this context is interesting. Reform, on my understanding of the word, connotes improvement over existing circumstances. Here, reform is being used to gloss over and lend a positive glow to secret proposals which are not available to the public and will not be until the eve of the next election campaign, in which the government intends to ram through a GST. Until the facts are on the table and people can judge, one can never be sure that the glossy word `reform' that is being used here is in fact true.
Let us dispense with the cant. Let us call it what it is. These are government tax changes, not reform, and they are tax changes in which the Prime Minister, according to evidence adduced before the Senate hearing, has directed the Treasury to come up with options which relate only to a broad based indirect tax or, if one wants to be direct about it, a GST. No other options are to be canvassed. Only GST options are to be considered. Versions of how that might be delivered is what the work of this secret committee is about.
I use the word `secret' committee because in evidence to estimates last year we heard that there are no records kept of this committee. There are no minutes kept for this committee. Those who make contributions to this committee cannot be sure that any document in which those contributions have been made still remains. The records and outcomes of this committee are kept within the head of one bureaucrat and the only people that information is shared with is a small group including the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, and no-one else.
I want to compare that to the last major time of tax reform in this nation. The most successful and far-reaching reform of the Australian taxation system in modern times was in 1985 under the Hawke-Keating government. In 1985 the Treasury, at the instigation of the then Treasurer, published several volumes of background and data for the Australian public in terms of the implications of taxation reform. All the numbers were there and various options were there. 
 One option, option C, was the option for a GST. The other options were options for other changes which would improve the tax system and give it the cachet that is essential for a tax system of simplicity, integrity and equity. Of course, that was in 1985. There was a widespread public debate, based on objective material, put into the public domain by the government to enable that debate to flow in a lucid and intelligent way.
What do we have here? We have a secret committee, secret submissions, no documentation, no basis of information for community discernment or investigation, and no options other than the single option of a GST. When are we going to hear about this so that we can make up our minds at our leisure, looking at this material? No, we are going to hear about it as an ambush on the eve of an election in which it will be rammed down the public's throat that this is the only way in which the taxation system can `be reformed (sic)'.
In terms of process, the first substantive point I want to make is that this is not a process of openness. This is not a process of allowing the people to decide. This is a process of positioning and managing an opinion to run an election campaign in which your considered and predetermined view will get up and nothing else will occur. That is what is happening.
The cost of this shoddy and seamy exercise thus far in evidence is $1.2 million. Obviously that is a cost that is expected to grow. I started these remarks by talking about so-called tax reform. It is interesting that in the Senate estimates committee we asked the Assistant Treasurer: is it true that a GST is a regressive tax? That is a technical definition of what a GST is. It is a regressive tax. It is regressive because it charges the same flat money amount to every individual that buys the commodity to which a GST is attached, irrespective of their level of income. That means that someone on a minimum wage pays the same cash amount as the wealthy Australians who are so often associated as friends of the Liberal Party. The same price irrespective of income equals regressive. We put to the Assistant Treasurer: is it true that a GST is a regressive tax? Sad to say, he 
 either did not know the answer to that question or he declined to answer.
The second substantive question I wish to ask in this debate is: how can tax reform be about imposing a regressive tax on the people of Australia and be regarded as equitable or fair? We are unable to tease that issue out in any great detail because the government declines, as I said earlier, to make available for public scrutiny the models that it is working on so they can be tested against public opinion and what is reasonable. What we do have, however, is a publication touted by the Treasurer as a publication which is supposed to shed some light on the nature of the Australian taxation system; that is, the Treasurer's booklet The Australian taxation system—in need of reform—his title, not ours.
It is a booklet that is supposed to catalogue the problems with the Australian taxation system. This is the sole, so far, public contribution to debate by this government. Is it anything about information, better understanding, insights into the numbers? No, it is not. Is it a catalogue of what is good about the Australian taxation system so one can have in context the bad with the good, a sort of balance sheet approach? No, it is not. It is simply a document meant to position public opinion for the inevitable GST outcome of what is bad about it. Even then, the 14,000 copies that are printed at the cost of $10,000 to the public purse cannot get it right either. Let me give you an example. On page 2, in the introduction of this booklet, Mr Costello says:
Our taxation system is second rate and getting worse; it does not raise money fairly or efficiently.
It is second rate and getting worse. I asked the Assistant Treasurer and the Treasury staff who were attending upon him in the estimates committee would they please name under their lights a first-rate tax system in the world if ours was  second-rate. What was the answer to that question? The answer was that there are no countries that fit the category of first-rate, but in some countries there are first-rate elements of their tax system and if you put all the first-rate elements together you come up with a first-rate system. First-rate therefore, to which Australia is allegedly second-rate, is a 
 conceptual ideal in the mind of Treasury boffins, not a realistic and practical tax system anywhere. That is the first point to be kept in mind.
The second point is: what is second-rate therefore about the Australian taxation system? Under fairly close questioning of the Treasury officials—and I now quote what they finally agreed to from page 92 of the Hansard of 25 February 1998—Treasury official Dr Ken Henry, the chairman of the secret task force, said:
I suspect that that sentence refers particularly to our indirect tax system.
. . .              . . .             . . .
In saying that our tax system is second rate, I suspect the dominant consideration behind that sentence is the state of our indirect tax system.
We know that by those words from Dr Ken Henry the reference to second-rate is not the whole system; it is part of a system. And what part of a system is it? It is the indirect part of the system. What does the indirect part of the system constitute as part of the overall? Indirect taxes bring in just over 10 per cent of our total tax revenue. So the revenue base that brings in 10 per cent of our total tax revenue is what someone from Treasury believes is second-rate. By deduction it is clear that 90 per cent of our tax revenue, even by the professional critics, cannot be regarded thus.
I think it is fair to say that we have in terms of the progressivity of PAYE tax a reasonable system. I have to say immediately that everyone regards that the tax system is not good enough and everyone regards that the tax system should be changed and improved. But when you come to looking at the models about how you do it there is no agreement because everyone wants a better deal for themselves. At the end of the day you have to come to a fair model. When the government puts out a booklet, 14,000 copies spread hither and yon, as to what is wrong with the Australian tax system, we should know it is only the indirect part of the tax system they are talking about; it is not the whole system at all.
The biggest sham in this booklet is the statement by Mr Costello `Ordinary Australians are now facing the prospect of paying the 
 highest possible income tax rate.' We asked him what is he talking about—the top marginal rate or the average rate of taxation? This is a very important concept. He is talking about the top marginal rate. If you earn $50,000 in Australia you pay the top marginal rate of taxation in Australia—47 per cent. What is the average rate of tax you pay when you pay 47 per cent at the top marginal rate? You then only pay 28 per cent of your total income in tax.
The sham here is to pretend that if you are on $50,000 you are going to pay 47 per cent in tax when you only pay 28 per cent in tax. We have a progressive system and it is the average tax rate that taxpayers pay that ought to be looked at, not the highest margin rate. This is explained in this document that for every extra dollar you earn you might pay 47c. What is not said is that even then you would only be paying 28 per cent of your income in tax. That is the sort of manipulative sham that this document represents.
Of course Treasury itself shoots the document down. It says in this document that sales tax is costly for business to comply with. The report from Treasury released on 24 February into taxpayer costs of compliance says that wholesale sales tax has `relatively low compliance costs as a proportion of revenue generated'. That is the tax office compared to the political propaganda document of the Treasurer.
Let us get the basic facts right here. This document is a sham. It is a distortion of the public debate paid for by taxpayers to suit the purpose of positioning the argument for a GST. It has no objectivity. It is a disgrace. It does not represent what is reasonable or fair in putting the case. It does not put any side of the case, only that side of the case that the government wants to have before the public.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-03-02,"—The appropriation bills presented to the chamber by the government this evening have a wide range of problems relating to them. Essentially, the appropriation bills and consequently the government lack direction in many key areas. The government has set no course for the nation. There appears to be no 
 real agenda from this government other than to cut away essential services like CES offices, Medicare offices and, through reduced state grants, schools and hospitals.
Primarily, there are two distinct direct issues of concern. Firstly, it is clear that the strategy of these appropriation bills is an attempt to reduce the budget deficit. While on the surface this appears to be defensible on the part of the government, the strategy is flawed because of its lack of commitment to providing real benefits to the economy and Australians as a result of this deficit reduction. To the community at large there appears to be no benefit from the stringent budget strategy adopted by the current government.
After two years, the Australian community is seeing no real benefits for themselves. This of course includes the business community. As the weekend Financial Review reported on Saturday, business confidence in the Prime Minister and his government has dropped seven per cent since January. In the poor job category, the Howard government has jumped six per cent. This is an indication that, after two years as Prime Minister, Australians are still unsure about Mr Howard's ability to govern. There is a large amount of concern with the overall direction of our economy. There appears to be no overall governmental strategy that is supportive of Australian families.
The second major concern is the budget's failure to deal with a number of critical and crucial policy areas. Those areas are employment growth, industry policy and trade policy. Importantly, the government has failed to provide an overall strategic approach towards management and integration of these three areas. This failure of the government to provide this required strategic approach is a reflection on the government's overriding ideology when it comes to budget and policy formulation. They believe there is no role for the government in the economy either as managers or as an organ that assists citizens towards participating in their economy.
This lack of government involvement is obvious in all areas of government policy. This is particularly true with regard to employment growth. The budget strategy has 
 been completely lacking in this area. This has resulted in little employment growth for older Australians caught in the long-term unemployment spiral and equally little hope in employment prospects for younger Australians. This lack of commitment to resolving the unemployment problem in Australia manifests itself in the low priority given by this government to education. Education for both our young people and older Australians seeking to be retrained is increasingly more difficult and more inaccessible. An increase in university and TAFE costs have made it difficult for those seeking to acquire new skills to gain access. These costs act as a significant disincentive to education and retraining for our unemployed.
Additionally, labour market programs have been significantly reduced almost to the point where they are non-existent, making it increasingly difficult for older Australians to retrain themselves. The government's lack of a strategic approach is, however, most obvious when it comes to industry policy. The appropriation bills do little to encourage and support Australian industry. Indeed, both the budget papers and the government's industry policy statement lack any cohesive, integrated and strategic plan by the government towards industry policy.
There is a complete ignorance on the government's behalf when it comes to understanding and implementing the role of government in the vital area of industry policy. The government's complete lack of vision and direction regarding industry policy was clearly highlighted last year in a number of ways. One only has to remember the government's responses to the Mortimer and Goldsworthy reports, the government's failure to understand the challenges facing the nation's manufacturing industries, the government's lack of direction in dealing with the closure of BHP in Newcastle, and the government's failure to devise a strategy that would assist Australian industry and business to access new growth markets.
David Forman from the West Australian best summed up the government's approach in October of last year when he said:
The Federal Government's industry reform agenda is in confusion, with Cabinet unlikely to reach any final decisions.
He went on to say:
Bureaucrats and ministerial staff were struggling yesterday to pull together a range of reports and policy papers into a single submission on industry policy.
This approach to industry policy by the government clearly indicates that they have no agenda of their own. Their approach to the debate has been to rely on a number of discussion papers and reports on various sectors and then attempt to deal with those reports in an ad hoc fashion. The government appears to have no understanding in its own right on how the varying reports ought to have been integrated into a strategic industry policy and no idea on how to even approach this particular task. As a result, we have a disjointed approach to industry policy and a government that cannot even compile a range of reports and attempt to form a coherent summary and plan from those reports.
On the few occasions when the government has attempted to devise some type of industry policy, it has had only two approaches. Neither have been comprehensive and both have had little effect. Firstly, the government has reacted to policy decisions of the previous government rather than implementing their own. This lack of government initiative and planning has led to a drift in the policy debate. As a consequence, the business community has been unsure of the overall government approach and what differing policies mean for different reasons. Late last year the Weekend Australian reported business concerns in the following way:
Business Council of Australia executive director David Buckingham said the Government needed an industry policy that is more than a series of discrete initiatives. What the business community is looking for is a strong signal that the Government wants to get on with growing investment and growing jobs led by an integrated industry policy.
The second aspect of the government's approach has been to confuse taxation reform with industry policy. For example, the commitment of the Treasurer to a GST and his consideration of removing the 10 per cent interest withholding tax on investments in 
 government bonds to increase the attractiveness of Australia to overseas investors was heralded by the government as a great advance in industry policy.
The business community, of course, did not agree. Trevor Matthews from the National Australia Bank was reported in the Australian last year as saying:
Professional investors were more interested in the fundamental health of the economy than tax when considering making an investment here.
The real message stemming from the business community is: get on with the real game of industry policy and incentive. What then should be the government's approach? The appropriation bills should be documents that define a broad strategy for government involvement and participation in the economy. This should be specifically directed towards an integrated approach.
There are a number of requirements for a successful strategy. There are a number of key factors. Firstly, macro-economic settings must be sound and directed towards efficiency and increased productivity in the long term. Secondly, micro-economic reform must continue in the appropriate sectors. Thirdly, an integrated, strategic and whole of government approach must be initiated.
A major mistake of this government has been its reliance on fiscal policy and its overreliance on macro-economic policy. Sound macro-economic policy is important. However, with much achieved in this area during the 1980s, this government has continued to focus heavily in this area. Instead, the government should be focusing on other areas of reform. No longer should government confuse economic policy with industry policy.
This government is relying on fiscal control, budget surpluses, low inflation and moderate wage growth to attract investment and to provide a level of growth that will increase both employment levels and living standards. An industry policy does not rely solely on macro- or micro-economic settings. It actively participates in creating an environment in which industry and investment will prosper. The government's budgetary strategy, as defined throughout the appropriation bills, should provide an environment in which the 
 desired industry policy can be pursued. The current appropriation bills do not perform this role.
Industry policy should be visionary and include a coherent development policy that focuses long term. The policy should seek to generate wealth by participating in value adding industries and other high growth sectors. The appropriate policy should aim to create sustainable economic growth to bring unemployment levels down below the five per cent mark. Those new jobs should be orientated heavily towards the service industry and moderately towards manufacturing and commodities. Additionally, there is great capacity for value adding in key resource areas.
Government should set out to achieve this by strategic intervention, cost competitiveness measures, market access and export promotion measures and support for innovation and skills formation. Underlying this approach is the acceptance by government that industry policy cannot and should not be left to market forces. Government has a responsibility and an obligation to intervene in the market to develop industry policy and to assist in the introduction of Australian industries into new markets.
Equally important is the established criteria for the selection of government supported industries. Supported industries must have a significant lifespan that will benefit Australia and Australians in the acquisition of technology, knowledge and research and development through both public and private sectors. Equally, these industries will exist where there is significant demand. They should be export orientated, possibly with the government prepared to assist financially with entry into the world market.
The industries should also be value adding. This will increase the value of exports and decrease the cost of corresponding imports where there is a direct correlation. The policy must also be integrated. No one aspect of policy is ever enough. This means that tax support for research and development must be part of an overall approach that may also include import replacement.
There are a number of practical measures that could be implemented to bring about the 
 desired environment and policy. Firstly, the government should continue to consider the recommendations of the Mortimer report to establish an Australian investment agency with funds of $1 billion. The creation of such an agency would allow the government to make decisions on how to best use its resources to attract industry and investment to Australia's shores.
In some cases industry does require incentives and rewards. The creation of an investment agency may allow the government to create the desired environment and pursue serious cost-benefit analysis to determine if financial incentives in whatever form are appropriate. The impact of this would be positive. Over a period of five, 10 and 20 years, there would be a further diversification of the industrial structure of this nation. There would be further development of natural resources and human resources through upgrading the skills base. There would be the development of deep and broad financial markets that encourage the required capital investment to achieve that necessary growth.
The gains to investors are obvious: higher return and capital appreciation. The benefit to employees will be real wage increases significantly over time. It is a willingness to study and research this type of approach that business and industry are crying out for. The willingness by government to play an encouraging role within the economy and to assist Australian industry entrants to new markets should be the overriding strategy of this government's appropriation bills.
The ideology on which the government has premised its budget strategy is wrong. Government involvement, when required, is justifiable. Relying on a free market to solve inequities between international economies is detrimental to our nation's interest. There are cases to be made for government intervention to create a level playing field with our international competitors and assist new industries to reach a level where they can compete on their own.
Assisting export orientated manufacturers or providing opportunities for our youth to educate themselves in the areas of future export orientated markets such as information 
 technology, without the cost of that education being a disincentive, are legitimate roles for government to play. A participatory government budgetary policy that sets a broad framework within which wealth creation and employment can prosper is the right approach to get our industries exporting and our people working.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I rise in this debate this evening to talk about two issues in particular. The first of those is the missed opportunity in the work for the dole scheme and the fact that the government, through this grandiose scheme, have frittered away needlessly very good dollars which could have been used constructively to assist those people who are unemployed.
This is the first time that has presented itself this year for me to address this chamber. Coincidently, it was 10 February last year that I spoke in this chamber on this very same issue. Not long after, the government clutched at a straw and announced the arrival of the work for the dole scheme. On that occasion, I expressed my concern that there needed to be additionality of employment, not substitution of employment. I stressed that there needed to be a creation of real jobs, and I said that there needed to be an ongoing commitment by employers to keep people employed in real jobs. Those were heartfelt concerns of mine, having had a long experience of what employers can get up to out there in the real world of the work force.
Some 12 months on, I do not see any improvement whatsoever as a result of the work for the dole scheme. Some employers out there are doing what was predicted. They see this as an opportunity for free or cheap labour. They see it as an opportunity to replace existing employees. In particular, they are targeting casual employees who have no regular employment guaranteed to them. To me, replacing these workers with a subsidised employee constitutes nothing but a total abuse of the employment of people in the work force.
At the heart of this is the fact that the work for the dole scheme, which is chewing up endless dollars of the budget, is providing 
 people with no career prospects. One could not countenance for one moment that planting trees or painting stormwater drains is in any way a long-term career prospect and giving someone access to a career job. We have heard the platitudes that this opens to people the opportunity for work and the opportunity to gain some self-confidence and self-esteem. Whilst that might sound good in theory, in practice, receiving two days work per week does nothing to improve the self-esteem of individuals who have been unemployed in the community for some substantial time.
In this grandiose scheme of things, the government have no proper monitoring to see that the outcomes are being delivered or to test that there is a real, positive result for those people who are unemployed. There is no test to see at the end of the day how many people are really scoring a real job. I would put it to you that very few, if any, are being successful in sustaining real jobs. What we have seen in essence is that the federal government have frittered away valuable tax dollars on an ill-conceived program that was doomed to failure from the outset.
One would have hoped that the government would have been more compassionate in dealing with those people who have unemployment problems in our community and they would have used the tax dollars far more wisely than they have chosen to. What the government really need to do is properly assess this scheme that, to date, has proved of little or no value out there in the community, and then dump it as soon as possible and put something that will do something absolutely positive for those unemployed people in its place—something that will give them some real hope and some real opportunities into the future. That is the first missed opportunity that I see arising in the current budget round.
The second issue that I want to focus on at more length is the closure of Medicare offices. Before the last election, the then opposition leader, the now Prime Minister, promised—and I do not know whether it was a core promise or a non-core promise—that Medicare would be retained in its entirety, and of course an essential element of the 
 Medicare system has been the public face of Medicare—the Medicare office.
The Medicare office has been important in terms of inquiries from the public, lodgment of Medicare claims and collection of any refunds that may be due as a result of the lodgment of a claim. Most people—particularly low income people and pensioners—find themselves in the position that, having lodged a claim, they wish to have a same day cash collection of that lodgment that they have placed at the Medicare office. However, it does not seem that this will be the case in the future because of actions by this government.
The Medicare office was identified as a service to the public, and that is very important. It was there to serve the needs of the public. You could not always have something that was going to be cost-efficient in the ideal economic rationalist mould, but it was there to serve the ongoing needs of the ordinary, everyday public. Many of those people—and I am going to come to some specific constituents in a moment—are people who do not have access to public transport or who do not have a great deal of access to their own private transport, and the withdrawal of this service is a great impediment to them in the processing of their Medicare claims.
In my view, the government has an obligation and a duty to provide a service through the Medicare offices. To date, all this government has shown is a propensity to withdraw the service rather than maintain or enhance the service. In the 1996 budget, 84 Medicare offices closed. In the 1997 budget, a further 44 Medicare offices closed. Whilst that is Australia wide, many of these have been in rural areas. But a substantial number have also been in major regional and urban areas where there are large populations of aged and elderly persons.
One gets a feeling that one has been there and done that—a feeling of deja vu—because of an encounter with this issue of the closure of Medicare offices within a month of my election to this chamber. Where I reside, in the seat of Griffith—adjacent to the seat of Bowman—in Queensland, there have been a number of closures of Medicare offices. For 
 example, the Cannon Hill office was in the first round of closures. It had serviced a largely pensioner community. In the latest uptake we have seen the closure of the Coorparoo and the Wynnum Medicare offices. The Coorparoo Medicare office, which was closed on 20 February this year, had serviced an older community, a fair number of pensioners, who had found it very convenient to go down to the local Medicare office in the Coorparoo shopping centre to do their lodgement and make their claims.
Now those people are being forced to Carindale which, even by public transport, is some 20 to 25 minutes away. Carindale shopping centre in itself is one of those monumental shopping centres where there are literally hundreds of tenants. Just the sheer task of getting around these centres can be quite daunting for some of the older people in our community.
The Medicare office at Coorparoo, which was closed off to them had had, by its track record as of 31 October 1996, a reasonably high throughput of claims on a daily basis—in the order of 264 claims each and every day. The Health Industry Commission used a notional figure of 400 as the baseline to judge whether a Medicare office should remain open or closed—not whether it was offering a service. It was purely a mathematical exercise as to whether or not an office should remain open or should close, and the Coorparoo office was very much a victim of that numbers game. The people of the Coorparoo area, which is firmly in the seat of Griffith, have suffered as a result.
The closure of the Wynnum office is an even more interesting story, because the Wynnum Herald of 14 August 1996 has a photograph of me with a local Labor candidate and a local resident in a story on what we believed was the pending closure of the Medicare office at Wynnum. Wynnum is a suburb where there are a large number of pensioners who rely heavily on this service being provided to them. Whilst the throughput of customers on a daily basis—according to the statistics back in 1996—was only 117 per day, it was a real case of a service to older citizens in our community. The heading in the 
Wynnum Herald of 14 August says, `Medicare closure denied', and I quote from the article:
Federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge has dismissed reports that the Wynnum Medicare office will close as scaremongering—but he will not guarantee the agency's future.
I am glad he did not guarantee the agency's future, but it certainly was not scaremongering. The truth is that that was one of the very offices that was always lined up to go and, in the end, it did go. It was a valuable service that served the needs of that bay-side community in the Brisbane area well. It is also interesting that at that time the then and current member for Bowman was totally silent about the prospect of that happening to the Medicare office down at Wynnum.
 Turning to more recent press statements from the Wynnum Herald, on 25 February a different story emerged. The headline that day was: `West slams Medicare'. West, of course, is Andrea West, who is the member for Bowman. The article reads:
Federal member for Bowman Andrea West has described her government's decision to close Wynnum's Medicare office on March 27 as ""outrageous"".
I think that sums it up pretty well. `Outrageous' is the right word. Here was something that was the public face of Medicare being closed and made unavailable to pensioners and older people in that community where the pensioner numbers are high. They are being told, `Go off to Carindale.' Previously, they might have gone to Cannon Hill. Now Cannon Hill has been closed, they have to go to Carindale anyway. This poses some real problems for them.
Then if one looks at the same day in the Wynnum Herald—they had a good day that day in the Wynnum Herald—the editorial was quite scathing of the closure of this office. Amongst other things, it says:
It makes you question the usefulness of our elected representatives when the needs, not the wants, of Wynnum residents are ignored in favour of cost cutting.
This is a very important issue for the people who are in the Wynnum area. It goes on to say:  
Sure, the Wynnum office was recording low transaction levels, but a government which claims to be concerned for the people should be able to sacrifice funding to meet a desperate need.
So what we have here is the local federal member coming out, belatedly, against the federal government, criticising her own government—and rightfully so—for the miserable attitude that they have got towards Medicare offices which are so vital and so important for our older community. But the hidden part of that particular scenario, of course, was reported today in the Courier-Mail . It is interesting that the Wynnum Herald  did not publish the full press release, apparently, that was put out by the member for Bowman, because the member for Bowman—this was picked up in the Courier-Mail  article today, and I quote from it—went on to say in that press release:
""I am amazed at the lack of action from the ALP state member, Paul Lucas, in lobbying on behalf of his electors in an effort to alleviate their isolation from some important community services,"" she said in a news release.
So here we have the local federal member, who could have taken the cudgel up as early as 1996, blaming the local state member of parliament for a federal matter. This, to me, is typical of the mess that this government is in. It is ignoring the needs, the desires and the wishes of the local people. You cannot apply economic rationalism to everything.
Here we have, in this effort by this government, something that is affecting older Australians. Older Australians are asking, `Why are we being ignored? Why are we being forgotten once again?' The bottom line of the whole of this is that the government has acted consistently miserably towards older Australians. There are other examples when one looks into issues like aged care, but this really highlights how the government has cast off its responsibility to meet the day-to-day needs of the people in terms of just a basic issue such as their Medicare refunds.
Whilst the government may well try to use the excuse that bulk billing is in place with many doctors, that is not always the case for every service that aged persons may need to avail themselves of. So what we have in the government's budget, in their appropriations, 
 is a degree of miserableness never seen before. The government should be ashamed of the way in which they are treating our elderly people in this community.

—You were not talking about Robertson, were you?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I wish to speak today in relation to the appropriation bills. I would like to talk—as prompted by my colleagues on the other side—about how this government's appropriation bills, which put into effect their budget, have affected the seat of Robertson. But before I do that, I would really like to talk a little bit about how child care has been affected by the changes that have occurred in that area and how the changes are affecting families all around Australia.
Child care is one of those areas where the Labor party, while in government, had a very proud record. In fact, we were well on the way to producing a child-care system that was accessible and affordable to most families. When we look at the numbers—if it can be done in an unbiased fashion—the number of places that were created is quite astonishing. When the Labor government was first elected in 1983, child care was one of those services that were really only available to the very rich. Child care was really only affordable for those people who were affluent and could employ a full-time nanny. In fact, in 1983 there were only 46,000 child care places available in Australia. It was a very different situation when we left government in 1995: there were 600,000 child-care places available and about half of those, 300,000, were supported by the Commonwealth through child-care assistance.
Since this government has been in power, despite their rhetoric, despite their weasel words, essentially they have taken out $820 million. The majority of that was taken out in the previous budget, but the follow-on effect of this budget, which removes a further $320 million, really puts the nail in the coffin. For many people, that additional cut of $320 million has meant a change from a situation where child care was affordable, accessible, 
 for families, and where women—and generally it is women—going out to work could afford to put their children in child care and still have a reasonable amount of money left over from working.
The situation now exists, with increases in out of pocket expenses of an average of $10 for those on partial child-care assistance and $18 for those on maximum child-care assistance, that for many women the changes brought about by the budget mean that they can no longer afford to remain in work. Many people on the coalition benches probably do not think that is a problem. As I have been travelling around the electorate, talking to women who use child-care centres and to people who run child-care centres, they have told me that they have become very aware of a secondary agenda of this government which no longer encourages or makes it beneficial for women who have children to be in work.
This government is attempting to turn back the clock in a way that many women in the community find quite startling. One of the areas which has been most adversely affected by this budget is the area of before- and after-school care. You might recall that the operational subsidy which allowed many of these centres to operate has been removed. Initially, this was to take place from 1 January. The government—as it appears prone to do in recent times—did a backflip. That measure has now been deferred until 27 April 1998. That is, I suppose, a good thing. It is better to have it coming into effect in April rather than in January, when a large majority of these centres were not open and it would have caused an incredible amount of confusion. However, though it is marginally better for the operational subsidy to be removed in April, it is still going to have dire consequences for many before- and after-school care centres.
Those who are not familiar with the operations of child-care centres and before- and after-school care centres may not be aware that before- and after-school care centres are generally run either in halls or in schools. They do not have a capital base. Generally, they are set up by a community based group which employs carers, usually on a part-time 
 basis, to care for children in the hours of between 7.30 in the morning until school starts, and from 3.30 till about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. Those organisations are run on the smell of an oily rag. That is no exaggeration.
They used to have an operational subsidy which gave them their base and then they collected a small amount of fees directly from parents—and I suppose having to top up their income by that method—and the calculation of fees was quite simple. Now usually one or two carers, who work about six hours a day, are expected to work out a very complicated formula of child-care assistance which they have to administer from information given by the parents. Somehow, they have to work out an estimate of how many hours each child is going to be in care, and from that advise the government. If they make any mistakes, they are liable to fairly severe consequences for giving misinformation. Many centres are finding this whole thing quite extraordinary.
The government was concerned about some of the reactions of paying child-care assistance in arrears. It sought to remedy that situation by saying that child-care assistance should continue to be paid in advance and would not be administered through Centrelink. However, what has happened—and I think it shows a great misunderstanding of the distinction between the different kinds of child-care centres on the part of the minister—it is unable to see that, by requiring before- and after-school care centres to administer child-care assistance, it is imposing an incredible burden on them.
Having changed his position once, and not seeming to have really understood how it all worked, Minister Warwick Smith tried to solve the situation by telling the before- and after-school care centres that he would pay them the equivalent of two months operational subsidy in order for them to put in place the administrative changes to administer the system—or I should say the chaos—which has been created by this government. On 20 February, the minister announced that he would provide an additional $8 million to bear this administrative cost.
I suppose that is better than nothing, but it is still clearly stated by most of the before- and after-school care centres that they will initially have to double their fees, and that they have already had major drops in the utilisation of their centres because of the fear and confusion that exists amongst parents.
	The seat of Robertson was mentioned before. Two weeks ago, I visited a before- and after-school care centre in Kariong. I spoke to the coordinator of the centre, and also to the parents, about their concerns. They told me that from the date when the operational subsidy was removed they would be doubling their fees. They were very concerned that this would mean a further drop in the number of children using the centre and that eventually—in fact, in a fairly short period of time—they would have to close their centre.
For many parents who rely on before- and after-school care to ensure that their children are properly looked after, this is  a major concern. It means that those parents either have to give up work and give up income that, in many cases, makes the difference between struggling and being reasonably comfortable, or they have to accept that their children under the age of 12 years have to go home to a house that is unoccupied by an adult—that they are on their own. This is no longer acceptable for many people. The risks that children face when unattended after school is not something that they would contemplate.
The budget cuts to child care that are contained in this year's budget are having a very major effect on before and after school care and this is before the real impact comes into place on 27 April. I hope that this government sees fit to examine the situation properly. Rather than making tentative and uncertain changes from time to time, they should realise that attempting to make the before and after school system administer child-care assistance is completely impossible and that it will mean the collapse of those sorts of centres. I would strongly urge the government to change their position and at least allow the present system to continue until the introduction, as they have proposed, of the smartcards next year.
 I would also like to emphasise that the overall effect of these budget cuts over two years means that every single parent who accesses long day care—and this is an average figure—is paying an additional $10 a week per child. For many of you that may not seem very much; those of you who are on parliamentary salaries may think that is not very much at all; but, for many people in the community who are having difficulty surviving, an extra $485 a year can be terminal—it can be terminal to their job and terminal to balancing the budget. I conclude by urging the government to rethink its position on before and after school care and the implementation date.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-02,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats I rise to support the appropriation bills. These bills attend to some housekeeping matters and other matters which accord with the need for the government to honour its commitments in the community. However, like other senators, I want to use the opportunity to draw attention to some of the consequences of existing fiscal, revenue and expenditure policy by the government.
Like Senator Cook, I want to make some remarks about tax reform, because tax reform is very much at the heart of the ability of government to raise funds in a manner which minimises harmful impacts on the community—
—And gives incentives to the people who are working in the Australian community.
—Quite right, and maximises the benefits. In doing so, it is appropriate that the government develop its views but what I and others fear is that the views which the government comes up with will be factional views. I am concerned that the Gibson committee might possibly prove to be a Clayton's committee, despite the quality of its chairman. And also, despite the fact that it has received over 300 submissions, the committee may well be ignored by the Treasurer's office and the Treasurer's line—maybe it will not but I draw your attention to the fear that we have. I also note that the Gibson committee excludes some of the finest 
 accounting minds that exist in the coalition ranks, which is a great mistake.
I note that at the ministerial level the ministers' departmental officers do not have their own dedicated small task forces to generate their own views, because it is quite plain that Industry or Environment or Social Security needs to compete with Treasury for ideas. I am at a loss to understand how ministers will be able to enter the cabinet room with their competing ideas if the Treasury task force has a monopoly on the reception of tax proposals, and the analysis and the conclusions that arise therefrom. I am afraid that the competing tensions which should exist within the coalition to arrive at a model that is acceptable to the members of the government as a whole may not materialise, so that the government's tax model might be flawed if it is a factional beast. I hope not, but that is a fear I have.
 The second area I want to draw attention to is the whole question of how we view our society and how we view the experiment that has been applied to the Australian economy by what are known as economic rationalists or fundamentalists. I draw your attention to a paper in Quadrant of September 1997 by Martin Feil entitled `The declining Industry Commission'. He makes this point:
If economic rationalism and minimal market intervention can be described as the business plan for the Australian economy from 1975 to 1995 then the government should report to its shareholders (the Australian people) that the plan hasn't worked and that senior management is being replaced.
He then goes on to quote the World Bank in this article:
In its World Development Report for 1997 (issued on 25th June) the World Bank makes the point that ""the lesson of recent years has been that the state could not deliver on its promises"".
In his introduction to the report the President of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, says:
Many have felt that the logical end point of all these reforms was a minimalist state. Such a state would do no harm, but neither could it do much good.
It is the opinion of the Australian Democrats that the previous government, and now this government, have continued with an experiment which puts far more pain than gain onto 
 the Australian people. It is time to recognise that an experiment begun with some hope for its outcomes has, in fact, reduced the social wealth and has created a social deficit in our country. I see signs of a shifting towards an understanding of that by Labor, and I hope it is a sign of a philosophical shift, not simply the consequence of being out of government.
The fact is that the coalition have succeeded in two ways in their two years of government. They have two achievements. First, they have balanced the books and have created a more credible and more responsible way of managing our financial affairs. Second, they have succeeded in workplace reform but, apart from that, the people as a whole are very disturbed. When members of the government proclaim the satisfaction that they feel with their policies, it is not a satisfaction reflected in the community at large. People do not feel better off. The constant harping on the wonderful benefits of lower interest rates is just grotesque, because the lower interest rates were part of the economic cycle and were arriving at the very time that Labor was leaving—we would have had lower interest rates anyway.
I agree with the coalition that their policies have, in fact, advanced those lower interest rates to a lower level, but they are not responsible for interest rates plunging from double figures to single figures, or even from high single figures to low single figures. They are certainly responsible for making the interest rate climate better. So that is the third leg on which they claim to have made the Australian people very satisfied. I do not think they have had that much to do with it personally, but I know they disagree.
When we turn to the people themselves, they are distressed about the state of their hospitals or their schools or their roads or their environment, and they are distressed about the amount of money in their pockets. Two things have been happening. 
Firstly, under the previous government and accelerated by this government, there has been a cost shifting to the states without a comparative benefit in terms of revenue.
I am a strong supporter of Premier Richard Court's campaign in Western Australia for a 
 review of the constitutional relationships which govern our taxation system and of the state and federal taxation relationships. It may be true that some things that are wrong in my state and other states are as a result of government policies, but other things that are wrong are because the governments in the states are starved of money in many respects. So they have long waiting queues in the hospitals, they have larger class sizes in the schools, and they have a deteriorating social environment. Some of that is to do with money.
One of the consequences too is that the states are forced to sell their family silver. The latest lot about to embark upon this road of selling off their people's assets is South Australia. I am quite sure that, whilst there might be an ideological commitment to privatisation by many coalition members, it is because they are short of money. One of the reasons they are short of money is not mismanagement but is the cost shifting that has gone on from the Commonwealth to the states and the shortage of revenue to compensate for that. I do not think the coalition government have the balance right in that respect. It is not good enough to balance the books; you have to deliver equity in the economic relationship with our peoples and our states. We are a federation: that is the nature of our constitution.
The second area of cost shifting is to the individual. I am told that this coalition government has, in fact, raised revenue by over $9 billion, not as a result of increasing taxes but as a result of decreasing benefits, decreasing subsidies and decreasing the transfer of funds to the community. The result is that parents pay more for their children's education. Over and above their taxes they are paying a lot more—every one of them. They are paying more for medicine; they are paying more for health. They were paying more for roads until the High Court changed the system and said that the government could not raise fees, as the states were doing.
So, whilst the Treasurer is quite right in emphasising the importance of sound fiscal parameters, individuals in Australia are not saying, `We are better off, these are the 
 golden years.' Certainly it is hard to make that happen in a short scale of time, but I think it must reflect upon the need to supply the community with the level of service that it needs and, in fact, is demanding.
The social deficit is reflected, for instance, in the agonies which accompany it which are caused by both ideology and cutting funds. The figures say that, in 1997, 15,044 permanent staff separated from the Australian Public Service. I do not know how many people in this room have separated from companies, jobs or whatever. It is not an attractive experience. It is not something which makes you feel good. It is not something which you look forward to even if you do get a redundancy or even if you follow on with another job.
That mentality that an automatic reduction in Public Service personnel is a good thing needs to be challenged—why is it a good thing?—because it does mean a reduction in service to our community. It does mean fewer people to do the job. We are not convinced that that small government idea can carry on for much longer. As James Wolfensohn from the World Bank said, the state that some members of the coalition may look forward to would end up not doing much harm, but it would not do much good either.
The other area I will highlight in terms of some effects is that of education. The enrolment benchmark adjustment exercise that Minister Ellison has gone about—and he is a sincere and committed minister—we think is having harmful effects. It is resulting in a net loss of expenditure per student, which ranges by our calculations from $6.18 in Victoria up to $21.87 in South Australia. Why is that good? Why does anyone think that is clever when our whole future rests on investment in our intellectual capital on the one side and, as Senator Bishop outlined in his address, in investment in our physical capital on the other?
Our levels of demand for university places have fallen. If you speak to university academics, the marketplace mentality is ruining a lot of the good quality education that we have provided in this country because it is changing the philosophy and ethos under which we pursue knowledge. Of course, you 
 are right to want to make universities more efficient. Of course, you are right to want value for money. But education is not a market. We have got a fall in university places of three per cent in Queensland; 12 per cent in South Australia; 13 per cent in Victoria; 15 per cent in Tasmania; 17 per cent in Western Australia—we are ecstatic about that I must tell you; and 19 per cent in New South Wales and the ACT.
When I discuss an appropriations bill or anything do with money, I understand the accounting and managerial needs, but the ordinary Australian—the ordinary battler as you like to call them—the battling small business person, does not see a lot of benefit to themselves. Of course they are grateful that their interest rate is lower, but they are not thanking you that much for it because in so many other areas their costs have gone up. In the budgetary process to come forward, I hope—even if the reason is an eye to the election—the coalition will have a look at what we refer to as the social deficit and put a little more heart into its accounting books.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I want to take this opportunity tonight to make some remarks about Defence and in particular the current position we find ourselves in in terms of the Defence budget here in Australia. Last week during the estimates committee hearings into Defence I asked the question about a newspaper report which indicated that before the government at this stage was the proposal to acquire a new fleet of VIP aircraft. Indeed, the article, which was in the Financial Review , indicated that the government was considering a $160 million procurement of equipment for the VIP fleet.
The general response from most of the senators was for me to shut up because some members of this august body here and the House of Representatives, particularly those from the more outlying areas, have used the VIP fleet. I have not had the pleasure of doing that yet. But, in essence, the questioning was not to do with the $160 million proposal—if that is correct—that is lying before the government; it was to do with where the money is going to come from. 
 From which budget line is the money going to come?
We got no answers to that. The government said that currently the situation requires a $22 million injection each year for lease fees, et cetera, for the Falcon and for the other aircraft that constitute the VIP fleet. They suspected that, if there were any change in the future, that pattern would continue and that we would have to wait—I think that was the comment of the minister—to find out what the government would do and when it was going to do it.
The nub of the questioning was to do with the fact that a $160 million aircraft fleet is going to be quite a burden on Defence if it is to fall completely within its budget. That brings me to the main part of my remarks here tonight, which I understand because of the time will have to be continued tomorrow. Defence in Australia has for many years now been a $10 billion enterprise. In fact, it is currently 1.7 per cent of gross domestic product. We are told by Minister McLachlan—he made a public statement to this effect last year—that Defence cannot really expect that budget to grow beyond that figure. I am not talking about 1.7 per cent of GDP; I am talking about the $10 billion figure.
The last great review of defence—there is currently a review into very many aspects of defence and defence planning—was the Dibb review of the mid-1980s. From memory, the Dibb review came down during the course of 1986, following a three- to four-year review of defence expenditure and the strategic position that Australia found itself in at that time. The Dibb review had two main backdrops.
The first, which influenced all defence thinking at that stage, was the bipolar world that we found ourselves in in the mid-1980s. That was until 1989, which saw the collapse of the Berlin Wall and then there was the collapse, effectively, of the USSR into a whole range of different republics, and a military system in Eastern Europe that can only be described as a rusting military economy that can no longer provide the necessary equipment or the necessary number of men 
 and women at arms that it once did before. When Dibb was looking at this particular question, the USSR was one of the world's great superpowers. It had the largest inventory of aircraft. It did not have the largest navy, but it had the second largest navy. Although a long way short of the United States, it was still a substantial naval presence. In terms of men and women at arms, it was much greater than the United States. In terms of tanks and a range of other things, the USSR forces were very much more considerable than they are today.
The other part of the backdrop was the Falkland Islands war of 1982. The experience of the Falkland Islands war in 1982 was very much in the minds of the persons who came together for this particular review. In many respects, what happened in the Falkland Islands in 1982 was really a precursor for the world we find ourselves in today, which is a much more dangerous world that is much more likely to have a series of small-scale wars.
Indeed, the world that we had until the collapse of the Soviet Union had seen since 1945 very few conflicts. We had seen the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, which affected a number of Australians, Americans, New Zealanders and other  allies, but in essence these were all within the Cold War parameters. What happened in the Falklands was a conflict that came from no-one and showed, at least to the British defence personnel at the time, that a conflict could blow up very quickly and that they needed to have a flexible defence approach to deal with that.
What has happened in the years since Dibb is that the world has become much less secure. One could argue that Saddam Hussein's move into Kuwait in August or September of 1990, and the consequent Operation Desert Shield to protect Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm to retake Kuwait, emerged from stage left, so to speak. They were not something that we were really prepared for. We did not have a great deal of warning of them.
We passed a motion this afternoon, which certainly went through with my support, supporting Australian soldiers who have been 
 deployed into the Gulf area. We hope that the need for them to be used for the bombing of weapons of mass destruction and the facilities in which they are constructed never happens. Again, we have to say that this is another conflict which has emerged.
Many people have said that the job on Saddam Hussein was not done properly in 1991. That is not the subject of what I am saying here tonight. What I am saying is that until two years ago we had no idea of the extent of these weapons of mass destruction and the amount that Iraq currently holds. As I understand it, there are sufficient stockpiles of weapons there that threaten certainly the intermediate area and threaten terrorist operations in other parts of the world.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1997-98</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-03-02,"—On Christmas Day 1974 Cyclone Tracey devastated Darwin. There was destruction on a scale never before seen in Australia. A whole city was destroyed. There were many heroic and astounding and astonishing stories about this disaster. But perhaps the most astounding aspect was the spirit that shone through.
We are seeing that strength in the face of adversity again in Katherine. On Australia Day 1998, Katherine was hit by the worst floods ever recorded in the region. Let me relate the size of this flood so that the Senate can appreciate the magnitude of the disaster that befell Katherine as a result of Cyclone Les.
The 1998 flood saw the river peak at 20.4 metres—1.1 metres above the record flood of 1957. The initial hydrologist's report puts the flow rate at double the previous record. The peak flow rate experienced was estimated at 12,000 cubic metres per second, over twice the maximum flow rate of 5,677 cubic metres 
 per second of the 1957 record flood. The river peaked at 7.15 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 January.
The flood would have filled 10 Olympic swimming pools per second. It could have filled Sydney Harbour in 12 hours. There was enough water to fill Sydney Harbour four times over. Some 1,000 square kilometres of country were covered by flood waters at the peak. The flood inundated 1,100 dwellings and every business and government office in the central business district. All houses and most of the farms along the Daly River were affected.
But the statistics cannot illustrate the devastation as clearly as the experience of seeing street after street of people's possessions—everything they owned—piled out in front afterwards, being picked up by front-end loaders and put into tip trucks to be dumped. I can assure you that it was a heartbreaking scene. The destruction and sheer magnitude of the disaster left you with a hollow feeling of loss and shock that cannot begin to equal that which must have been felt by the residents themselves. It makes you realise that this immense amount of water will not affect the families of Katherine for the days that their houses were under water, for the week of inconvenience, but for the rest of their lives. People lost everything. Whilst material possessions can be replaced, can they replace the memories, the laughter and the history in the photographs, the videos, the souvenirs and treasured family mementos?
Individuals and organisations alike cooperated and overcame extreme obstacles, especially the emergency services and Australian defence forces in the first few days after the disaster. The Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services, under the command of Commander Maurice Burke, in conjunction with the defence forces under the command of Group Captain Crowhurst and Group Captain Ward, did a superb job. In a perverse way, Katherine was lucky. They were lucky they had the RAAF base Tindal in such near proximity.
Defence personnel cannot be commended strongly enough for their supreme effort in the days immediately following the flood. Over 1,100 Defence Force personnel worked in 
 appalling conditions: temperatures over 35 degrees, humidity around the 70 per cent mark and the cloying stench of hundreds of tonnes of rotting food for many days. There were 34 C130 Hercules flights out of Katherine and Daly River over five days, carrying almost 1,000 people and over 400 tonnes of food and equipment. Of course, there were the simple stories like the heroic story of the soldier who drove through water to save the sewerage system of the town, averting the need to evacuate the entire town; or the power and water authority workers who saved the electricity supply by sandbagging.
I also would like to commend the efforts of Mike Reed, the member for Katherine who, whilst losing his own homes in the community, was instrumental in the defence efforts. There were so many people rescued and accommodated at emergency centres. In a recent statement to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, Mike Reed described declaring a state of emergency, acting under his powers as Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services, at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, 27 January, in the lounge room of his house with water lapping at his ankles. This state of emergency was subsequently upgraded to a state of disaster, which remained in place until 8 February.
Of course, the member for Victoria River, Tim Baldwin, must also be commended for the exceptional job he did in Katherine and particularly the community of Daly River, which was hit by floodwaters a week after Katherine. I flew over Daly River on Tuesday, 3 February, as the flood was at its peak. It is a sight I will never forget. That beautiful community that I had visited a couple of weeks previously was totally inundated and surrounded by a vast sea of water as far as the eye could see. Mention should also be made of the many residents of the area who, despite their personal losses, have overcome the disaster with extreme effort and spirit. The Mayor of Katherine, Jim Forscutt, and many others, fall into this category.
I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) were able to be so rapid in 
 their response to the disaster and to provide such unique assistance. The Prime Minister was in Katherine on Friday, 30 January surveying the damage personally, offering assistance and meeting affected residents. The assistance that the Commonwealth has provided includes a special Katherine redevelopment program which will certainly see all eligible businesses receive grants of $10,000. Under this scheme, 511 businesses had received assistance as at Friday, 27 February. There is also a Commonwealth emergency payment which allows ex gratia payments of $500 per adult and $200 per child to the affected residents of Katherine and some of the outlying areas.
Of the 30 staff who work in the office of Centrelink, eight lost their homes and yet continued to work tirelessly in those conditions. In the first two days of operation, the staff processed two and a half thousand claims and paid out nearly $2 million. At the close of business on Friday, 27 February 5,331 claims had been processed and $7.93 million paid out. It was an incredible effort for the Centrelink staff and I thank them, as their parliamentary secretary, for their dedication and effort. Mark Wellington, the manager of Area North Australia and Frank Jorgenson, the Katherine office regional manager, deserve special mention for the exceptional effort that they made during the disaster.
The Commonwealth contribution also included a $5 million grant to repair the Stuart Highway, the vital road link which was cut in both directions. The total Commonwealth contribution is likely to be about $34 million. This includes $21 million under the normal disaster relief arrangements, but does not include the very significant and special contribution of the defence forces. Australia Post flew in a special team of six immediately. They did a magnificent job and were operational again by Wednesday, 4 March. Telstra played a vital role in the maintenance of communications. Katherine's communications were lost for only a few hours as floodwaters inundated the town and their equipment. Staff such as Andrew Waddell and Ron Kelly kept working despite all of the personal inconvenience they must have experienced.
Red Cross has organised an appeal for the victims of the flood. The appeal committee is chaired by Mrs Josephine Stone and is raising money nationally. As at Friday, 27 February the appeal had raised $1.4 million, with $921,000 of that money already disbursed to flood victims. The Red Cross is also providing clothing and bedding for flood victims and their work for Katherine and the surrounding communities has been exceptional. I thank them, on behalf of the flood victims, for all of this.
The response by other territorians to the disaster has been phenomenal. Hundreds of volunteers have descended on Katherine to help with the massive clean-up effort and there have been incredibly generous donations of clothes, cash and other necessities. To the families and friends of the four victims of the disaster I offer my sincere condolences and also those of other territorians and Australians.
Through all the destruction and despair, one thing shone through; that is the strength of the people of Katherine, the surrounding areas and the community as a whole. The community pulled together, worked to restore their town and showed an incredible sense of commitment and solidarity. I am sure that all territorians and Australians commend them and thank them for their efforts.
I see this disaster as a turning point for Katherine. It will recover—I am convinced that it will—and it will come back a much stronger community. So many residents have experienced the loss of everything material, yet they have overcome this in an exceptional way, faced it and emerged on the other side with spirits strong and an even greater commitment to their own community.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Katherine Floods</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech
