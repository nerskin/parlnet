"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-11,"—The bill before us is the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, which will be supported by Labor. The product stewardship arrangements for waste oil are part of the Measures for a Better Environment package, which forms a key part of the Democrats' GST deal. This package includes the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, CNG and LPG vehicle conversion, the development and commercialisation of renewable energy, and diesel and oil recycling measures. Although Labor will support this bill, we do not support the fact that the MBE package has been consistently and massively underspent, a point I will get back to in a moment.
The Customs Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Waste Oil) Act 2000 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Waste Oil) Act 2000 impose a levy on certain petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic equivalents to fund the development of a recycling program for waste oil—the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil, known as the PSO. The intention of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil is to reduce the environmental impact of waste oil by imposing a levy on virgin oils and lubricants. The levy is used to fund a benefit scheme designed to encourage the recycling of waste oils. Benefits are paid on a six-tiered differentiated scale, with differing benefit rates for various waste oil recycling activities. Multi-use oils that are used in a specific way, either in the manufacture of another product or in a process that does not create a recyclable waste oil stream and is considered to present a low level of risk to the environment, are outside the original policy intent of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil. This bill provides the mechanism for exempting such oils from the levy.
To effect this exemption, a new category of benefit, to be known as the category 8 benefit, will be paid under the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 at the same rate as the levy for uses of oil approved by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage by Gazette notice. The purpose of this bill is: to amend the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 to provide an effective exemption for certain multi-use oils and uses of multi-use oils from the product stewardship oil levy; to introduce a mechanism that will allow the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to approve the uses of certain oils as eligible for the category 8 benefit; and to implement consequential amendments to the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000 to enable category 8 claimants to register for PSO benefits. 
Clearly, the destination of waste oil in Australia is a cause for concern—quite simply, it appears that we do not seem to know where it is going, so it is highly appropriate that measures are taken to address this issue. In her press release of 11 June, Dr Sharman Stone, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, outlined the scope of the problem. She said:
More than 500 million litres of lubricating oil is sold each year in Australia, over half of which is collected and recycled after use. Still, a large percentage of this used oil remains unaccounted for, and it could be hurting our environment.
Waste oil contains hazardous materials that are toxic and carcinogenic, and is harmful to the environment when irresponsibly discarded. These materials include benzene, toluene, dioxins, and other light hydrocarbons.
Dr Stone went on to say:
Recent figures suggest that more than 100 million litres of waste oil goes missing each year, which can be harmful to humans and the environment. It takes only one litre of oil to contaminate a million litres of drinking water ...
Naturally this is of concern to the Labor Party, and that is why we are supporting the bill. However, Dr Stone's next statement in the same press release highlights one of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party keep finding ourselves in conflict with the coalition over environmental issues—that is, the practice of the Howard government to consistently underspend on their environmental promises. They say one thing and do another. Dr Stone went on to say:
The Howard Government has allocated $60 million to the Product Stewardship arrangements for waste oil, which began in January 2001.
No doubt the coalition thought that this would have been well received by Australians genuinely concerned about the impact that waste oil is having on our environment. However, we will never get a chance to find out, because it did not take long before these commitments were exposed as mere rhetoric and hollow promises of funding which were broken.
In this year's budget the government cut $40 million from the original $60 million transitional assistance component of the federal government's used oil recycling scheme, as the funding was considered no longer necessary for program implementation. The Environmental Manager journal of 20 May 2003 reported:
A `reprioritisation' will see some funds originally intended for the $60m transitional assistance component of the Fed Govt's used oil recycling scheme now go to other environment protection initiatives, the Budget papers show.
An EM source said the oil stewardship advisory council had been assured funds would not be redirected. However, the minister's office said no such undertaking was given and the council has been informed the scheme may be amended.
This latest cut to environment spending by the Howard government is, sadly, but one of many examples of the government's record of cuts and underspending.
I opened my comments on this bill reflecting on the fact that the government's Measures for a Better Environment package has been consistently and massively underspent. The original MBE commitment was $896 million over four years from 2000-01 to 2003-04. However, we have now discovered that this commitment, like so many of the coalition's commitments, has been watered down by the Howard government. For a start, funding over the life of the program will also be cut from a promised $896 million down to $812 million, a cut of some $84 million. It may seem like a proportionally small cut, until one realizes that the total funding period has been pushed out until 2014. In other words, funding intended to last four years will now be stretched to 14 years. That is a significant change. So the funding over the original four-year period has been revealed in Senate estimates hearings to be, in reality, only $297.6 million, a cut of 67 per cent. 
It is a very cynical trick from this government to promise a huge amount of funding, undoubtedly to win the support of Greens colleagues on the crossbenches, and to then hold it back and say to the Australian people, who want to live in a clean environment and who want Australia to play its part in reducing greenhouse emissions, `You can't have this money for another 10 years beyond what we originally promised.' I certainly hope it will not turn out that this money, which was pencilled in to fund measures to protect the environment, has been siphoned off to fund the government's profligate spending in Iraq regarding nonexistent, it seems, weapons of mass destruction.
When the government is not cutting the environment budget, it seems as though all sorts of rorting activities are going on. Earlier this year, my colleague in the other place Kelvin Thomson revealed how the federal Liberal-National Party government has directed over 76 per cent of the $20 million Envirofund, a Natural Heritage Trust program, to Liberal and National Party electorates. In fact, Liberal and National Party electorates received 76.28 per cent of the Envirofund grants; Labor electorates, 17.88 per cent; and the Greens and Independent electorates, 5.84 per cent. This allocation cannot be defended on the grounds that the grants were allocated evenly around the country and that the Liberal Party and the National Party represent a larger land mass. The distribution of Envirofund grants was not area based. Queensland projects received less than half the funding of New South Wales, yet Queensland has a much larger area. Western Australia got even less, despite having a larger area than both of them. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr David Kemp, responded to these revelations. He said:
An Australian National Audit Office report of late 2001 found no bias. They are assessed in an apolitical process on their merits.
In fact, the Envirofund was announced on 4 April 2002, when applications were first invited—more than a year after that ANAO audit! I believe the environment minister, Dr David Kemp, has misled the public and the media about the auditing of the Natural Heritage Trust's Envirofund by the Australian National Audit Office. Under the Howard government, Natural Heritage Trust funding has never been about achieving the right outcomes—that is, halting salinity, stopping land clearing and protecting threatened species. Instead, the focus seems to have been as a tool of the coalition to buy votes. Dr Kemp should have had the ANAO conduct an audit into what has all the hallmarks of a very big $20 million pork-barrelling exercise.
However, I think these failures pale in comparison with the Howard government's irresponsible and illogical position on the Kyoto protocol, and I take this opportunity to make a comment on this matter. I mentioned before how the coalition has diluted funding to the Measures for a Better Environment scheme, part of which was the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. But the coalition's disregard for global warming does not end there. Over 100 countries have now ratified the Kyoto treaty, and the ratification by the Russian Federation, expected later this year, will ensure that the protocol will come into international force this year. Australia has been deliberating for far too long.
With the Kyoto protocol on the verge of coming into force, even Australia's peak business lobby, the Business Council of Australia, has reconsidered its opposition to the ratification of the protocol. It now declares itself neutral, and many of its members publicly support the ratification. Early action will allow Australian industry to take advantage of growing global markets for environmental goods and services and to prepare for the reality of a carbon-constrained future. 
In May this year Kelvin Thomson, the shadow minister for the environment, introduced into federal parliament a private member's bill to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. If passed, this bill will give legal effect to Australia's Kyoto target and will ensure that Australian industry can take advantage of emerging new markets when the treaty comes into international force. Labor is serious about tackling climate change. Labor would ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. Labor is also committed to domestic action on greenhouse.
On World Environment Day, Labor pledged to increase Australia's use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power by an additional five per cent by 2010. A news poll released soon after, on 11 June, showed that 83 per cent of Australians would be willing to pay extra if they got their power from renewable sources. This represented a clear endorsement of Labor's policy. Such a commitment would help Australia meet its Kyoto target, create thousands of jobs and attract investment and is estimated to reduce some 17 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The five per cent mandatory renewable energy target has been supported by the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and represents a significant increase to the Howard government's existing target. The Prime Minister originally committed to only a two per cent increase, but, since the Howard government announced that in 1997, the contribution of renewable energy has actually fallen by two per cent. 
The MRET is presently under review. This provides a perfect opportunity for the government to respond to the overwhelming community support to increase it. Labor's commitment to an additional five per cent of renewable energy in Australia's electricity supply mix will help Australia meet its Kyoto target, create thousands of jobs, attract investment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Labor believes the sustainable energy sector is a growth industry of the future, and by supporting Labor's five per cent target the government can ensure this is the case. 
In conclusion, having taken the opportunity to reflect on a number of current environmental issues, I call on the Howard government to get serious about environment protection and repair, and to spend less time on self-congratulatory backslapping and more time on seeing that money allocated for the environment is actually spent on the environment. On that note, I reaffirm that Labor will be supporting this bill. ",SENATE,<title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-11,"—The Democrats will also support the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003. The bill grants relief from the product stewardship oil levy for certain uses of multipurpose oils. That is, the bill will apply to multipurpose oils which, when used in a particular way, cannot be recycled and present only a very low risk to the environment—so-called category 8 oils. The government is seeking to exempt the use of these particular oils from the levy because it argues that their inclusion was outside the policy intent of the original product stewardship arrangements for waste oil. 
The treatment of waste oil can pose a very significant environmental risk, including to humans. This was identified during the inquiry into the government's legislation which reduced diesel excise. When used in vehicle engines, transmissions and electrical equipment, lubricating oil collects hazardous contaminants that are toxic and often carcinogenic. These hazardous contaminants include metals such as lead and zinc, dioxins, toluene, chlorine, benzene and sulfur. If inappropriately collected, treated and disposed of, waste oil can pollute land, inland waters, including ground water, and the marine environment. 
Taking dioxins as an example, once in the environment dioxins accumulate in the fatty tissues of many species and are known to cause health effects such as cancer, birth defects and reproductive and developmental problems. Their capacity to harm is assisted by the fact that, once in the environment, dioxins break down very slowly and they can travel large distances. For humans, short-term exposure to a high level of dioxins may result in skin lesions and altered liver function. Long-term exposure has been linked to impaired function of the immune, nervous, endocrine and reproductive systems.
In the main, this amendment bill is intended to apply to paraffinic and naphthenic process oils. These are oils that are included in formulations for personal care products, explosives, paints, agricultural sprays and printing inks. As mentioned, the advice is that the oils for which this amendment bill is likely to apply will present a low level of risk to the environment. That is because there is minimal chance of these oils entering the environment through direct spillage, for example. These oils involve oil formulation that is typically bound to the product and cannot be released for recycling. With respect to printing ink, the oil and other components in the ink are bound to the paper and cannot be recovered. In relation to rubber, once the oils are chemically bound into the rubber they cannot be readily extracted. 
The department informs me that agricultural sprays and explosives use small amounts of the oils of which we are talking. According to the department, the environmental impact of agricultural sprays which are assessed by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority will be low because of the low toxicity of the oils used and the low application rates. These oils, again, are not recoverable because they are widely dispersed into the environment. 
The oil levy was developed as part of the Measures for a Better Environment package and is used to fund benefit payments for waste oil recycling and reuse. In addition to the levy benefit scheme, the Democrats negotiated additional funding for transitional assistance to ensure greater collection and recycling of waste oil. The levy is paid by oil producers and importers at a rate of 5.449c per litre on domestic and imported petroleum based oils and 5.449c per kilogram for petroleum based greases. In 2001-02, the levy raised was $25 million, with $8.2 million paid in benefits to oil recyclers. The current benefit rate for rerefined oil products is between 3c and 50c per litre, the highest benefit being 50c per litre for rerefined base oil— that is, oil that is used as a lubricant, hydraulic or transformer oil. 
Each year in Australia, around 500 million litres of lubricating oil are sold, and of these 500 million litres at least 100 million litres are unaccounted for. We simply do not know where that oil is, but the most likely scenario is that it is being stockpiled in garages and sheds, retained in scrap equipment such as old vehicles, put out for rubbish collection, lost through leaks and spills, or illegally and deliberately dumped.
Since the introduction of the waste oils recycling program, an extra 30 million litres of waste oil has been recovered each year. That represents an 18 per cent increase in the amount of waste oil that was previously being recycled. Oil-recycling facilities have been established in most local government areas. So I think the program is a success. There is more room to move, but so far I congratulate the government on the implementation of the program. The Democrats are, as I said, relatively pleased with the progress and that is why we accepted the government's proposal that $20 million of the funding originally allocated to transitional assistance be redirected to support other so-called sustainable cities initiatives. However, we do have some concerns with the current benefits schedule from discussions that I have conducted with oil recyclers. The current benefits payments for rerefined oil at 5c per litre would still appear to be too low— that is, it does not fully reflect the cost of collecting and rerefining that oil. As such, the grant does not provide the incentive that it should in order to ensure the greater reuse of waste or, more appropriately, used oil in this country. I think there is also an issue with the distance that is now required to be travelled to extract some of that last remaining used oil from storage places.  
I seek assurances from the minister in this debate that the current review, which I understand is under way, looks at these questions. We do not want to obviously set up disincentives for full scale rerefining with possible reuse at the end of that process as lubricating oil, but we do want to make sure that the price incentives are in place which would ensure that we maximise the amount of used oil that is collected. I am also pleased that, as a result of our talks with the government, the department will be addressing the problem of oil bottoms, which is the material that is left over after rerefining and other processes. It represents a major cost to oil recyclers. The more we rerefine the more oil bottoms will be there and will need to be disposed of. This is another issue I would like to see resolved by the minister and by the department. On that note, I again indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-11,"—I thought that, as a young mother, Senator Jacinta Collins might get up and talk about oil and bottoms—I think of Johnson and Johnson's baby oil.
—You will have to ask my husband about that!
—That is right. I thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on the Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003. I was not going to spend more than a couple of minutes summing up, but there have been a couple of issues raised during the second reading debate which was, with Senator Lundy's assistance, a wide-ranging one. In response to Senator Lundy's comment about the Commonwealth government's handling of environmental issues since we were elected in 1996, it must be a struggle for the Labor Party. They have had a number of shadow ministers in the portfolio. I did not know—it is not his fault but mine— that Kelvin Thomson was the shadow minister before then. I think Carmen Lawrence may have been a shadow minister at some stage and also Senator Nick Bolkus. I do congratulate Senator Lundy on her promotion to the environment portfolio. I have no doubt that she will put a lot of energy into it.
—But only in the Senate.
—Who is the shadow minister?
—Kelvin. 
—Now I know. The problem for Labor of course is that the coalition in government have put a lot of energy and a lot of money—more money than any other government in the history of Australia—into this portfolio. This bill amends a product stewardship regime that I am informed by the advisers did not exist. This is a very practical measure. It is not a measure where you would have the minister, as with former environment minister Graham Richardson, going and getting the TV cameras in and saying he is going to plant a million trees, having his picture taken with Sting or undertaking some sort of publicity-grabbing exercise. These are real measures that assist the environment. It is pretty hard to get Channel 9 or Channel 7 interested in taking a picture of Dr Kemp looking at some recycled oil—it is not a pretty picture. But this very program, which did not exist under Labor, is a fantastic example of a government working, and I give credit to Senator Allison—with the support of the Democrats in some of these measures—to make a substantial difference and significantly increase the amount of oil that is recycled in Australia. In fact, the information that I have is that, since the program began, we have achieved an 18 per cent increase: 194 million litres of oil recycled last year compared to 165 million the year before. We have seen $6 million of Commonwealth money spent to assist 270 local councils to build 458 used oil collection facilities. It is probably not even something that you would get the local paper to come and take a picture of, but when you look at those massive quantities of oil that would otherwise potentially harm the environment it is a huge achievement and this bill builds on that success. 
The federal government has, across the environment portfolio, massively increased funding to a whole range of programs. I was in the portfolio when we first came into government in 1996. Senator Robert Hill and I sat down with former minister Warwick Smith, who was also in the portfolio, and we went through this plethora of Labor programs. They were probably created in that famous Ros Kelly era when to design programs you figured out where the marginal seats were, you got a whiteboard out and you decided where you were going to spend the money. There was no strategic direction. There was no scientific basis to it. It was all emotionally and politically driven. We saw through the forest debate poor old Senator Faulkner, when he was the minister trying to defend his forest policy, going through day after day of excruciating questioning about which particular forest coupe he was going to protect that day or whatever. It was an excruciating sight during the dying days of the Keating government.
We inherited this political and emotional imbroglio of policy confusion. We looked at all the programs, we got the best scientific advice from around the world and we put structure into the environment portfolio. As a result of the incredible work done by Robert Hill and his exceptional parliamentary secretaries over time, and the work that is being carried on so successfully by Dr David Kemp, we have achieved real success across a whole range of areas, including endangered species and some of the world's leading programs to address salinity. We are improving in the forest area, where we have had to do the very hard yards of getting sustainable forestry regimes across all of the states— often with no assistance from state Labor governments, which pretend to be green but are usually only green when it suits them for a couple of cheap headlines.
The coalition does have the runs on the board. In fact, in her speech Senator Lundy referred to the measurement by Newspoll of the propensity of Australians, as polled by that organisation, to pay extra for cleaner fuels. We are not surprised at that, because Australians have indicated year in, year out that they are prepared to support environmentally friendly measures. At about the same time, Newspoll also showed that the coalition was a clear leader over Labor in voter perception of which party is preferred to handle the environment issue. 
That is a historic political shift in this country. I think we all have to be cautious of what the Newspoll tells us about leadership, preferred parties and two-party preferred indications. I tend to agree with Labor leader Simon Crean that, ultimately, the only poll that counts is the one on election day. But, historically, for the Liberal Party and the coalition to be seen to be better managers at the Commonwealth level—better able to deliver environmental outcomes—is a great result. That change took place under Robert Hill's leadership as Minister for the Environment and Heritage and has continued under David Kemp. I think the reason for that is that Australian voters are not mugs. Through the Natural Heritage Trust funding, they have seen over $1 billion worth of extra funding put into the environment portfolio, which is being spent cautiously. It is being targeted, it is based on good science and it is based on sound principles and policy administration.
That funding involves a series of programs that capture the enthusiasm of local communities, effectively target environmental problems where they occur at the local level and engage communities in solving problems at a local level. These people in the community will not be sold a pup. They know very well, as many of us here know, that you do not solve the world's greenhouse gas problems by flippantly signing a protocol. They know that because they are not silly. They know that a bunch of old European nations and a few others joining together for short-term political reasons to sign a protocol and say it will all be right is not going to solve the problem—unless that agreement and the protocol incorporate and capture the emerging nations and rapidly developing industrial nations, particularly in the Asian region. 
Those communities also know that, unless America signs up to the agreement, it is not going to be effective. You would effectively be drawing up an agreement that excluded two of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions on the globe. If you have an agreement that turns a blind eye to the fact that Australia not only is a very large energy producer and a large per capita greenhouse gas emitter but also produces very high energy efficiency outcomes and exports enormous amounts of clean energy into those newly industrialising countries—therefore making a special contribution to reducing greenhouse gases in those emerging economies—and you have a protocol that pays little cognisance of Australia's special circumstances, then the Australian people know that it is not a good idea to just sign the protocol to make us look greener than we are.
It is a very cheap thing politically to sign onto an agreement that you know in your own heart is not good for Australia. It is not good for all of those reasons. It is not good because it does not look at the special circumstances of the emerging economies that are not included in it. It is also bad for Australia because it unfairly hurts working men and women who rely on those energy-exporting industries—be they the people who rely on the great gas projects in the north-west of my state of Western Australia or the many families who rely on the coal exporting communities around the eastern seaboard who produce energy which is very efficient greenhouse gas wise compared to the countries we export it to.
That is one of the reasons the coalition and the Liberal Party in particular—but the coalition government, to be fair to my coalition colleagues—is held in such high regard by the Australian people when it comes to environmental management. We do the hard yards. We do not just sign up to the latest trendy idea, which is not always popular. It would be very popular for Prime Minister Howard to say, `Right, we are going to sign up to the Kyoto protocol now that we are green,' but he does not do that because he knows it is bad for Australia, it is not the solution for the world environment and we have to work a little bit harder to get a good agreement that the United States and China will be part of and which all the emerging nations will be part of. That is the cold hard fact. Either you have to do the hard work and get the results—and that is what this government has been doing—or you just do the easy thing and sign up without much thought and, in the process, jettison the economic hopes and opportunities of thousands of working Australians who rely on the coal industry and who rely on Australia's massive natural gas and gas export industry.  
Senator Allison raised a couple of questions in relation to the review of the PSO funding arrangements. In response to Senator Allison seeking an assurance that the review will consider price, I am informed that the review of the PSO funding arrangements will fully evaluate the existing funding rates, with particular emphasis placed on burner fuel funding rates, as asked by Senator Allison. The government is also committed to working to find a solution to oil bottoms—the residues resulting from processing waste oil. On that note, I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to. 
Bill read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-08-11,"—With the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has failed to demonstrate that the bill will provide for a unified national workplace relations system. The area of termination of employment at the federal level—and before this parliament— has a very lengthy history which I will not revisit today, as I think I have on seven or eight previous occasions, other than to say that on this occasion there is no reason to regard this bill any less suspiciously than some of the earlier attempts by this government. I will, however, discuss that the minister has simply added another layer of complexity to an already complex system of regulation. It is clear that this bill is an ill thought out, cheap political stunt cobbled together without the approval of the states in a shifty attempt to steal their industrial powers and entrench them in a substandard—and I stress substandard—federal system.
The principal purpose of the bill is to expand the reach of the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission over unfair dismissals to all employees in constitutional corporations. In addition to groups such as Commonwealth employees, waterside workers, Victorian and territory workers presently, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has coverage of unfair dismissals for employees who work in a corporation and under—and I stress under—a federal award. The key to the expansion of the federal unfair dismissal jurisdiction in the bill is the removal of the requirement that a person working for a corporation must also be a federal award employee. The deletion of the federal award criterion would mean that all state award employees who work in corporations would find their primary remedy for an unfair dismissal would lie with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. According to the explanatory memorandum, this would result in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's annual case load in unfair dismissal applications increasing from about 8,000 to 14,000. As well as centralising jurisdiction over unfair dismissals, a secondary purpose of the bill is to effect various changes over the processing of unfair dismissal claims, altering the eligibility for applicants and reducing the remedies available, especially for small business employees.
With respect to a unitary system, the complexities of federalism have provided for constant debate on both sides of politics— this has not only been an issue for the current government. In the year 2000 Peter Reith favourably explored the concept of the federal government using the corporations power as the principal constitutional plank for workplace relations legislation in his series entitled `Breaking the gridlock—discussion paper 2: a new structure'.
A fuller use of the corporations power, together with other selected heads of constitutional power, would give the federal government direct legislative control over the wages and working conditions of 85 per cent of Australia's work force. Further, it would allow the federal government to make extensive inroads into the states' industrial relations systems, creating an opportunity to achieve a relatively high degree of centralisation and uniformity. Again I would regard this somewhat suspiciously in relation to the terms and conditions of employment that apply to Victorian workers now caught up within the federal jurisdiction.
If the Commonwealth wishes to establish a unitary system, the corporations power goes a long way toward that goal. The only other serious rival is the external affairs power; however, the coalition has traditionally shied away from the use of the external affairs power—ironically, because of its potential to undermine the federal balance. Notably, during the debate regarding the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, the member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, the now Prime Minister, said: 
The other objectionable feature of this bill is the unnecessary use of the external affairs power of the constitution. This government has perverted and undermined the constitutional balance of this country by its remorseless use of the external affairs power.
Contemplate that with respect to the corporations power. Clearly, when the coalition is in federal opposition but holds many state governments, federal and unified industrial laws are objectionable; however, when the coalition is in federal government but state opposition, it is in favour of federal and unified laws.
This government is not motivated by a desire to positively reform the Australian system of industrial relations for the betterment of all parties. This government is simply motivated by the fact that it cannot control state industrial relations systems. Serious reform of state and federal industrial laws designed to harmonise workplaces must be through cooperation between state and federal governments. Such cooperation involves consultation, negotiation and compromise.
With respect to consultation with the states, the explanatory memorandum of this bill cites a speech by the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Justice Giudice, in support of a move towards a unified system for unfair dismissal claims. It is true that the president of the commission did call for serious debate regarding this significant issue. Indeed, he emphasised the importance of consultation and cooperation in achieving greater uniformity in industrial laws. Among other things, he makes reference to how the Hancock report suggested greater comity in industrial laws be achieved. For instance, he said:
The Australian Government should seek the co-operation of the States in establishing, in both the short term and the long term, a viable, co-ordinated, acceptable and effective industrial relations system.
As to the long term, the Australian Government should initiate discussions with the States with a view to putting an integrated system of industrial relations into place. The matter is of such importance that it should be raised initially at a Premier's Conference.
The matter should be treated as a priority item in the Premier's Conference and pursued through the Conference of Labour Ministers. A Steering Committee of the Conference of Labour Ministers should be established to give directions to a Working Party consisting of Commonwealth and State officials and representatives of the industrial parties.
The president also recounts how a uniform companies law came about: by consultation and cooperation, not by legislative fiat. Notably, the minister's consultation process on this occasion has not in any way reflected the sentiments of the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The minister has seemingly deliberately avoided any real or serious consultation with the state governments. Indeed, this too is evidenced in the explanatory memorandum under the subheading `Policy development and consultation'. It is clear that the government has simply relied upon unidentified submissions to a Senate committee regarding another bill, the `Breaking the gridlock' papers—a product of the government's former Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith—a summit held by the Business Council of Australia over two years ago and a speech by the minister to the Australian Food and Grocery Council in May last year. 
Significantly, there was a meeting of the Workplace Relations Ministers Council two days prior to Minister Abbott outlining the essence of this bill to the press. However, despite the fact that this bill had the potential to effect one of the most drastic shifts in state and federal industrial law since 1904, the state workplace relations ministers were given no indication of the federal minister's intentions in relation to this bill. 
It should also be noted that on this occasion the government even seeks to contradict the views of the former New South Wales opposition spokesperson on industrial relations Mike Gallacher, who in 2002 twice publicly expressed support for New South Wales retaining its own industrial relations system. One wonders what Liberal Party New South Wales policy is today.
This bill is also yet another attack by the government on the rights of Australian working people. The bill reduces the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business—that is, a business with fewer than 20 employees—from 26 weeks pay to 13 weeks pay. The bill extends the qualifying period of employment before an unfair dismissal action can be brought by an employee of small business, from three months to six months. The bill narrows the scope of an employee made redundant by her or his employer to mount an unfair dismissal action. The bill reduces the amount of back pay available where reinstatement is ordered for employees who have mitigated their loss by requiring the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take into account income earned from other employment.
Notably, however, the bill also contains some measures that appear to borrow from Labor's policy of reducing costs and simplifying procedures for all parties in the unfair dismissal system, such as making reinstatement the primary remedy and discouraging lawyers and agents from taking on speculative claims. While Labor would support these measures, it would be more appropriate for the government to deal with them by supporting the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissal—Lower Costs, Simpler Procedures) Bill 2002, a private member's bill introduced by the member for Hotham.
Regarding uniform unfair dismissal laws, when a comparison is made of the key features of the unfair dismissal regimes that apply across the states as well as the Commonwealth, one finds—surprisingly, to some—that a relatively high degree of regularity already exists. A comprehensive comparison is in fact contained in an attachment to the Senate committee's report on this bill. Under the different systems, salary caps on claimants are relatively uniform, exclusions for casuals do vary but compromise would not be impossible to bring them into line, and probationary periods and processes generally are similar. Overall, with some goodwill, there would undoubtedly be scope for a lining up of legal remedies for unfairly dismissed workers.
However, the issues become more complex. Often an unfair dismissal claim may be wrapped up with other matters such as recovery of wages or insufficient notice. In this regard, to effect optimal uniformity there needs to be a voluntary transfer or referral of power from the states to the Commonwealth. Until that happens, an aggrieved employee would be forced to take separate actions under different jurisdictions. This could hardly be considered a simplification of the process. 
The Senate report also contains an extract from the Queensland government's submission that highlights the flaws in this bill insofar as it attempts to create a uniform system. They are: 
• two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent;
• different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entities;
• different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities, depending on whether they meet the definition of a `constitutional corporation';
• concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of workplace relations in the one business, for example a federal regime governing a business' unfair dismissals and a state regime governing workplace harassment and industrial disputes; and
• concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of the one employee's claim (for example, the federal regime for unfair dismissal and the state regime for insufficient notice or unpaid entitlements).
A leading labour law scholar, Professor Andrew Stewart, makes a compelling argument. Many employers have historically operated solely or predominantly under state awards and are familiar and comfortable with state laws and procedures. However, under the government's approach, they would have their industrial relations regulations bifurcated: award and agreement matters would continue under state law, and unfair dismissals would become the subject of federal law.
Another consideration is the cost of pasting a new system on top of an existing structure. The government has allocated close to $17 million to fund an expansion to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to cope with the expected increased workload. But it makes little sense to expand the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Industrial Registry when this would leave many state commissioners idle. Of course, state commission members have life tenure, and the state governments would be required to continue to pay their commission members even if the federal government took away many of their powers and responsibilities. A far more sensible arrangement would be to reach agreement with the state commissions to participate in administering the system. There are already arrangements in place that allow state and federal commission members to work cooperatively, but that should be cooperatively with the state governments. This commonsense approach evades the government's thought processes in this matter.
In conclusion, this bill is an inept and clumsy attempt to reach a noble objective. A uniform industrial relations system has the potential to save time and resources for industrial associations, employers, employees and taxpayers. A unitary system could simplify the nation's overly complex maze of industrial regulation and bring fairness and uniformity to workers and employers. However, it is not just a matter of a uniform system for the sake of a uniform system. The content of a system—both procedural and substantive—is just as important, if not more important, than the structure. In both these regards, this bill fails the test. Not only does this bill reduce workers' rights and protections but it does not even achieve its stated object of uniformity. This bill fails to meet the requirements of sound public policy and should be rejected—and Labor will reject it.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-08-11,"—It is with pleasure that I follow my colleague Senator Collins today in this debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002. You would think that we are discussing something of national importance here that may see the wheels of administration or government grind to a halt. You might think that we are going to discuss a problem with the standard railway gauge or salinity on the Murray, but no—we are talking about some shabby, contemptible attempt by the coalition government to deny workers and their families in the states that have a state jurisdiction for unfair dismissal their ability to go to that commission or court and argue their case. This is the first shot across the bows of the state industrial relations regimes—ones that have ably and fairly looked after the interests of employers and employees for well over a century. It will effectively take away from those jurisdictions the ability to hear unfair dismissal claims. 
In my own state of New South Wales, we will be worse off as a result of this, because our unfair dismissal regime—and, as a Labor senator from New South Wales, I am proud of this—is fairer, simpler and easier to use than the federal jurisdiction, and there is much more history and institutional experience with unfair dismissal regimes in New South Wales. Unfair dismissals make up the bulk of the work for the state industrial relations tribunals. If this is taken away from them, undoubtedly the size of resources directed to state industrial relations tribunals will be lessened and their future viability will be in jeopardy. This will be bad for the workers of New South Wales, because the impact will be that the much fairer system will be taken away from them. There are fair provisions in the New South Wales jurisdiction for state enterprise bargaining agreements. Traditional areas of state regulation and enforcement—for example, occupational health and safety and leave entitlements— will be taken away from them. Other unique features of the New South Wales system, such as unfair contract provisions and contracts of carriage provisions, will be denied to them.
The effects of this bill will be that the federal jurisdiction for unfair dismissals will be extended from four million to seven million Australian workers, and a single dismissal jurisdiction for all companies under the corporations power of the Constitution with the exclusion of state tribunals from hearing most unfair dismissal cases. State termination of employment regimes cover about 40 per cent of employees, with the federal regime covering just over 50 per cent. It is important to note that the federal coverage is so broad mainly because Victoria does not have a state industrial relations system. The bill will remove all employees of constitutional corporations—that is, limited and proprietary limited companies. The only groups still under the state system will be state public servants and employees of non-incorporated businesses, of which there are only something like 1.5 million out of about eight million Australian workers. The immediate effect of these changes will be to make state unfair dismissal regimes unviable. The net effect of this bill will be to create a single system of unfair dismissal laws under the currently less fair and complex federal regime.
Workers in my home state of New South Wales will be much worse off under this bill. The majority of workers in New South Wales have recourse to a much fairer and simpler New South Wales system. If this bill is passed, most of them will immediately have recourse only to the federal system and, over the longer term, arguably all workers in New South Wales will have no choice but to make a claim under the federal system. The unfair dismissal system in New South Wales is fairer, simpler and easier to use than the complex federal system. Senator Collins quoted Professor Andrew Stewart, and I will quote him again. He remarked:
The provisions of ... the Workplace Relations Act ... are ... unnecessarily complex and unduly prescriptive. They are very hard for ordinary workers or managers to understand, necessitating legal advice for even the simplest procedures. Instead of simply empowering the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deal with certain claims and providing broad guidance as to how to do so, as most State laws do, the legislation seeks to regulate each step of the process in ever-increasing detail. As is generally the way when parliament tries to anticipate and counter every eventuality, this level of detail simply creates potential gaps and uncertainties for litigants and their lawyers to exploit. 
In addition, the federal provisions exclude a broader group of employees—casual employees. The New South Wales exclusion period is six months; the federal exclusion period is 12 months. There is also the continuing drive of the federal government to exclude all small business employees from accessing the federal unfair dismissal laws. Professor Ron McCallum of the University of Sydney has estimated that, if this bill is passed, only 70 to 75 per cent of Australian employees will have access to unfair dismissals of any kind. As I have already outlined, it is complex. 
Under New South Wales law, there is no sharp distinction between unfair dismissal and discriminatory determination. In New South Wales, all matters may be determined simply and centrally by the commission. Under the federal system, only unfair dismissals may be finally determined by the commission—unlawful dismissals or discriminatory determinations may finally be determined by the Federal Court only. This bill seeks to impose on the majority of Australian workers a system that is plainly unfair and unnecessarily complex. 
If you look at the history of the state jurisdictions, you will see that the six different states created their industrial relations systems in different ways, which I think is silly. In New South Wales—and this was explained to me by former Justice Macken— the industrial relations system came about because there were a number of disputes at the turn of the 20th century. Those disputes occurred because of people being unfairly dismissed, mainly on the waterfront. So the New South Wales parliament dealt with it. The first dispute was dealt with in 1896 through `the Wise's Act', which contained unfair determination provisions. In the year 1902, the first unfair dismissal decision, between the Newcastle Labourers Union and Newcastle and Hunter River Steamship Company Ltd, came before what was known as the Industrial Arbitration Court of New South Wales. In 1912, the Industrial Arbitration Act created a power to make an award determining any industrial matter—where `industrial matter' was defined to include dismissal. This jurisdiction was widened and recognised in the Re Bank Office (State) Board decision of 1921.
So in the early days of the Commonwealth, unfair dismissals in a state jurisdiction like mine came about because of industrial action and they were dealt with by the industrial commission because it was action taken in that state. But in the history of states like South Australia or Tasmania—or maybe even your state, Mr Acting Deputy President Cook—the industrial tribunals there were simply wages boards, whereas in the other states they came about because of unfair dismissals, in effect, and having to deal with them. I may be taken to task on that, but essentially there have been different pathways in the states leading to an industrial arbitration tribunal of sorts—one dealing with wages and one dealing with how to govern the relationship between the employer and the employee. The paths have been entirely different. So if you try to prescribe or come up with some sort of unique scheme federally, you dismiss the history of over a century of federation in dealing with this matter.
Let us go to 1971. I know that Senator Forshaw is going to speak later in this debate, and he—like I—would remember a number of the participants in a case where the principle of `a fair go all round' was established. The case was presided over by Mr Justice Sheldon; it was Loty and Holloway v. Australian Workers Union. Then, in 1978, section 20A was inserted into the Industrial Arbitration Act 1940 of New South Wales, establishing the jurisdiction's right to hear unfair dismissal claims. Up until this time reinstatement or compensation was granted only through the dispute settling powers of a New South Wales court or tribunal. In 1991, a simple and easy system to operate unfair dismissal regimes was brought in by a coalition government: the Industrial Arbitration (Unfair Dismissal) Amendment Act 1991. 
It has been a desire of the coalition's to go after some sort of unitary system while they are in power. In fact, former Minister Peter Reith repeatedly argued for a national system of industrial relations. In October 2000 he released a serious of discussion papers entitled `Breaking the gridlock', which argued for a single system. I find it interesting, given the Liberal Party's strong attachment to federalism and championing of states' rights, that they are pushing this. Their only drive must be the fact that, in the Commonwealth of Australia, all the states and territories have Labor governments, and their systems are much fairer, easier and less complex for people who find themselves in the position of having been unfairly dismissed. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 is an attempt to undermine those systems. As I said, it will make sure that people in those systems are much less well off.
What I want to talk about in particular in the time I have left is that, in my own state of New South Wales, there are two groups of workers—I suppose that is the right way to refer to them—who do not seem to be covered by the jurisdiction in this proposed legislation. The first are outworkers and the second are what we would call contract carriers or lorry owner-drivers. Under New South Wales legislation, clothing outworkers are included in the definition of an employee under section 5 of the act. The federal Workplace Relations Act does not include clothing outworkers in its definition of an employee. I do not think that anybody would disagree that clothing outworkers are amongst the most exploited and mistreated employees in Australia. Yet there is no reference in this legislation to that particular classification or class of employee—not one reference.
There is another particular difference in the jurisdiction in New South Wales—which, as you would expect from my background, I am quite familiar with. That is the position of lorry owner-drivers before a state tribunal. New South Wales, as far as I am aware, is still the only state in the Commonwealth in which lorry owner-drivers can have their rates of pay and conditions regulated by a state tribunal. I am not aware that any other state allows that to occur. People are required to present to a company a certain class of vehicle design or type of truck; they are required to paint it; and they are required to present themselves at a certain time every day—maybe every day of the week. From 1978, under New South Wales legislation, a tribunal has been able to regulate their rates of pay and conditions. These people are painted in whatever colours—as we may recall, it goes from TNT to Boral to Readymix.
Secondly, under chapter 6 of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act, unfairly dismissed owner-drivers can go before the commission and be compensated for their goodwill. That has not been mentioned in this area at all. You may be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I have before the parliament—it is in the process of wending its way through the system—a private member's bill to deal with compensation of lorry owner-drivers for goodwill, particularly in the Canberra region. Under the New South Wales legislation, if a lorry owner-driver is unfairly dismissed, he or she may go and argue the case for his or her reinstatement or compensation. I recall that bill being passed, because it was drafted by the Labor member for Auburn, Mr Peter Nagle, and it was passed while the coalition was in power in New South Wales. But, because we do not have that legislation in Canberra, drivers for Boral are involved in a protracted dispute here. Because of the absence of that provision in the Workplace Relations Act they have no recourse to compensation for goodwill or opportunity to be reinstated where they have been unfairly dismissed. 
So I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are just two areas that are open to exploitation by employers: outworkers, and lorry owner-drivers or contract carriers. They clearly have been and are— and will be—exploited unless the legislation is changed, and there is no reference to that in this bill at all. So, as Professor Stewart said, when you come up with a bill to try to come to some sort of all-embracing, all-knowledgeable bit of legislation that will cover everything, it is not there. Maybe that will be answered when the government has its opportunity to speak. But, in New South Wales—one state—if you are an outworker or a contract carrier, you can be reinstated. I do not know how it is in the other states; maybe my colleagues in the other states will make reference to it. But you can be reinstated in New South Wales.
If we pass this legislation, we will cut away the ability of people who work for corporations—that is, who will be covered by it—to access justice. We will cut away the ability of those men and women and their families to access justice. We will cut that away from them; it will be gone. For what? For some ideological pursuit—for the belief that it is in the interests of our nation to have a unitary system. I do not believe that is the case. It would be just madness for anybody to even consider supporting this bill and consider a situation where, as I said, these men, women and their families would be denied justice. They have it under one jurisdiction, and maybe they will get it under another jurisdiction as those good state Labor governments move to operate in that area. You would have to be mad and bad to support this legislation, as it excludes this class of people. There are already men and women and their families in this capital territory suffering because they do not have access to the justice they would have if they moved and operated a few kilometres across the border.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2003-08-11,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 is part of a package of bills put forward by this government that again seeks to tip the scales in industrial relations even further in favour of the employer. It is apparent whom this government represents and it is not the working people of Australia. At least the former workplace relations minister, Peter Reith, had the honesty to state that he was there simply to serve the interests of employers and no-one else. This bill, in its attempt to force unfair dismissal coverage from the states to the federal system, is fundamentally misconceived. There are four key problems with the bill. One, there has been a complete lack of consultation with the states. Two, there has been insufficient attention given to costing and administrative arrangements. Three, the bill will result in a reduction in rates for workers with unfair dismissal claims. Four, the absence of a cooperative approach means a substantial sector of the work force will remain beyond the reach of federal law. These flaws make this bill untenable, and the reality is that this bill will not result in one new job.
Fundamentally, the federal government has failed to justify any problems with the operation or application of the current state unfair dismissal system. It must be said from the outset that I am sickened by the coalition's hypocritical stance on this issue. For years, a unitary system that upholds employee rights has been the policy province of Labor. The benefits of a unitary system have been ignored by conservatives, who have been obsessed with defending state rights. Now that all state governments are Labor, we find the coalition more interested in industrial relations reform than in state rights. If the government were making a constructive move towards a unified and simplified industrial relations system, Labor might well be interested. But this bill is nothing more than an attempt to reduce the rights and protections currently enjoyed by many workers under the state industrial relations system. 
A speech by the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Justice Giudice, was cited in the explanatory memorandum in support of a unified system for unfair dismissal claims. However, this speech emphasised the need for consultation and cooperation to be embedded in any attempt to pursue a national system of unfair dismissals. Justice Giudice went on to recount how a uniform companies law came about—by consultation and cooperation, not by legislative fiat. There has been minimal consultation on this bill. In fact, the Workplace Relations Ministers Council met two days before Minister Abbott outlined the essence of this bill to the media and the minister gave no indication to his state counterparts of this bill's existence. I find this particularly outrageous. It simply confirms our claim that this is a political bill rather than a serious attempt to improve the industrial relations system. Interestingly, Minister Abbott's proposal runs contrary to the views of the New South Wales opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Mike Gallacher. He has twice this year publicly expressed support for New South Wales retaining its own industrial relations system.
Very little work has gone into analysing the financial impact of this bill. There will be a considerable increase in work for the commission, leading to greater demands being placed on registry staff and resources and the need for additional courtrooms, facilities, court reporting services and so on. The government has largely ignored the impact of the proposed changes. Furthermore, the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee produced a report on the bill. The Labor senators' report concluded:
... the bill will actually increase the industrial relations costs borne by business because many who choose to use the state system will now be forced to operate in two systems, a unitary system will not result, and workers will be discouraged from working for small businesses because it offers them less security and fewer rights.
This bill: one, reduces the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business; two, extends from three months to six months the qualifying period for employment before an employee of small business can bring an unfair dismissal; three, narrows the scope for an employee made redundant by her or his employer to mount an unfair dismissal action; and, four, reduces the amount of back pay available where reinstatement is ordered.
Just briefly, on the changes to small business employees, this bill suffers from the same problem plaguing the countless workplace relations bills put forward by this government, and that is that there has never been a strong case made for the proposition that employees in the small business sector should possess fewer rights and legal safeguards than people who work in other employment sectors. The references committee conducted a serious inquiry into small business employment and found that the preoccupations of small business differed very little from those of large and medium business—having to do with business cycles, taxation, regulations and general economic conditions. Small business employs to the extent that business levels and business growth strategies determine, not the unfair dismissal laws. Any connection between the fear of unfair dismissal claims and the rate of overall small business employment is extremely tenuous. The Labor Party believe in equal rights; therefore, we believe that, for an employee who is dismissed, the size of the business should not be the determining factor. 
A number of submissions made scathing comment on the methodology of the Harding survey, which was the basis for the government's claims about unfair dismissal laws constraining employment. These submissions found that the conclusions of the survey were badly flawed. Professor Andrew Stuart found that the figure of 77,482 job losses due to these laws was an estimate based on a series of estimates, and a curious exercise providing a weak foundation for government pronouncements on the benefit of the legislation. The onus of proof must always remain with those who desire to strip employees of legal rights to fairness, and this government has failed to satisfy this onus. 
The Democrat senators' report agrees with the view that no hard evidence has been put forward. In fact, Senator Murray stated:
The experiment under Queensland State laws, when their then Coalition government introduced an exemption for small business, had no evident effect on job creation. 
Even if these laws represented an increase in labour costs, the same could be said about superannuation and occupational health and safety laws. Are we to conclude that these are next on the government's hit list? The references committee's inquiry into small business employment found that:
Consistent with survey rankings of small business concerns, unfair dismissal did not arise as a major issue during the inquiry ...
The changes to redundancy obligations are very worrying. Many employers use redundancies to get rid of workers they consider troublesome. Employers must use an agreed and transparent process, otherwise unfair dismissal claims are almost inevitable. There is no guarantee that this bill will finish debate on termination of employment. The federal scheme does not purport to provide a national scheme in which all employees have access. If this bill passes, state termination jurisdictions will need to remain to provide for employees of non-incorporated businesses, and the state appears to have a role, potentially, for 1.5 million or so employees, including state public servants. This bill will simply create another tier of employees with yet another level of rights and protection. The government has asserted, without explanation or justification, that the proposed Commonwealth legislation will be better balanced than current state laws that, according to the explanatory memorandum, contain inequalities which, however, are not identified.
Furthermore, this bill—overriding state legislation—has been produced without consultation with the states. Hence this bill shows all the signs of failure to deal cooperatively with the states. The bill seeks to override state unfair dismissal laws in favour of a federal regime that is inferior in both design and operation. The proposed amendments would not in fact contribute to the goal of simplifying the coverage of federal and state labour laws. As the Democrat senators' report stated:
... relying on the Corporation's power alone will still leave large chunks of employees working for non incorporated business, many of these small business, with no protection from State or Federal laws. 
In conclusion, this bill is both a limited and blunt instrument of legislation. It leaves a small but significant group of workers beyond its ambit and it creates legal complications in cases where current state legislation covers regulatory matters affecting unfair dismissal. Labor are not opposed to a more coherent system per se. What we are opposed to, however, is this government's arrogant and unilateral approach and its determination to attack working people's rights and their protection.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-08-11,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 7 August 2003, of the Honourable Charles Keith Jones, AO, former federal minister and member for Newcastle, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Charles Keith Jones was born on 12 September 1917 at Newcastle, New South Wales. He was educated at Cooks Hill High School and Newcastle Technical College. He married Doreen Wright in 1939. A boilermaker by trade, Charles was an apprentice at the BHP Steelworks before taking up employment at Stewarts and Lloyds. He became a member of the Boilermakers Union and was involved with the Metal Trades Federation and Trades Hall Council. Charles joined the ALP in 1941 and was a committed Labor man throughout his life, always remaining active in party affairs.
He joined the State Dockyards as a boilermaker in 1943, where he remained for 13 years. Mr Jones was elected to the Newcastle City Council in 1946 and rose to be Lord Mayor of Newcastle from 1956 to 1957. He was 39 years old—at that time, the youngest person to hold the office. He was an inaugural councillor of the Shortland County Council from 1957 until being elected to federal parliament. In 1958 Mr Jones was elected to the House of Representatives seat of Newcastle, holding the seat until his retirement prior to the general elections in 1983. He was Minister for Transport from 1972 to 1975 and Minister for Civil Aviation from 1972 to 1973, and he held several party positions whilst in opposition.
Mr Jones represented the old-style trade union trained politician and did his job well. His colourful use of language is well known—in 1966, he called Harold Holt a `dirty old mug' and in 1976 he earned a suspension from the House for 24 hours after he called the then Treasurer, Mr Lynch, a `dingo'. He served on several parliamentary committees, including those on printing, road safety, aircraft noise and tourism. He was the Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1964 to 1967 and 1980 to 1983. He also attended several overseas parliamentary delegations and conferences and travelled overseas on official visits.
Mr Jones was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 1984 Australia Day honours list, for service to politics and government. He was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977 and, more recently, with the Centenary Medal for service to the community. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Doreen, to his children and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jones, Hon.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-08-11,"—On behalf of the opposition, I support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the death of Charlie Jones. Born in Newcastle in 1917, Charles Keith Jones was educated in public schools and apprenticed as a boilermaker. He was an executive member of the Boilermakers Union for 14 years. He was also an official of the Metal Trades Federation and the Newcastle Trades Hall Council. He was an alderman on Newcastle City Council from 1947 to 1959, including two years as Lord Mayor in 1956 and 1957, and an inaugural councillor of Shortland County Council between 1957 and 1959. 
Charlie Jones was elected to parliament as the member for Newcastle in 1958. Newcastle is, of course, a seat of great significance and importance to the ALP, having been held continuously by Labor since Federation. Newcastle is the only seat in the House of Representatives to have been continuously represented by the same political party since Federation. Charlie Jones, elected in 1958, was the third member for Newcastle, and a very important part of that great tradition. It is worth noting that Sharon Grierson, the current member for Newcastle, elected in 2001—just over 100 years since Federation—is only the fifth member for Newcastle in that period of over a century.
Charlie had to wait until 1959 to make his first speech, and in it he was largely concerned with the impact of changes in the coal industry on his electorate and the devastating effect of pit closures and job losses on working men and women in Newcastle. He argued the long-held and still-held Labor Party belief that the benefits of increased productivity ought to go to workers, to employees, as well as to owners and shareholders. Improved technology and greater mechanisation, Charlie said, should lead to shorter working hours, not longer dole queues.
Among the committees Charlie served on were the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety in 1972, prior to the election of the Whitlam government, and the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, from 1968 to 1970. He was the opposition spokesman on transport from 1967 to 1972. All of this meant that he was very well prepared when he became the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation in the second Whitlam ministry in December 1972. He was so well prepared that Gough Whitlam later described him as `the most effective and creative transport minister in Australian history'.
One of his achievements was the passing of the National Roads Act in 1974, the legislation that authorised a Commonwealth-funded national highway system linking all capital cities—a total of 15,800 kilometres of highway. Of course, Charlie's achievements with road and rail were somewhat overshadowed by controversy over Sydney's airport—I suppose there are a few of us who probably could sympathise. In August 1973, Charlie announced that Galston had been chosen by the Australian government as the site for a new Sydney airport. The Parramatta by-election later that year, lost by Labor in no small part because of the backlash against the airport, saw the end of the Galston airport proposal. A feasibility study in 1975 into the possibility of a Goulburn airport—and Gough did say Charlie was creative—discovered that that was not feasible either. Charlie's plan to reduce aircraft noise in Sydney by asking new applicants for flights into Australia to use Tullamarine rather than Kingsford Smith was greeted with horror by the New South Wales government, as they watched tourism dollars roar overhead, bound for Melbourne.
Charlie was notoriously plain spoken. Charlie was able to get the last word in, even at times against Gough Whitlam. Former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam tried to subtly—if that was possible—rebuke Charlie for turning up late to a cabinet meeting, remarking, `We were hoping to complete this item before you arrived.' Charlie retorted to Gough, `I was hoping you would too.' Charlie was twice suspended from the House of Representatives: once for calling Phillip Lynch a dingo, and the Australian published a cartoon of two affronted dingoes vowing revenge; and once for calling Harold Holt a `dirty low mug'. His most memorable parliamentary remarks were not unparliamentary. Explaining PNG aviation policy, Charlie declared, `I told Michael Somare, “Look, Michael, you can argue till you're black in the face, but it's that Ansett who's the nigger in the woodpile.”' Many politicians, of course, have dreamed of bringing the House to absolute silence—Charlie Jones achieved it. 
After Kerr, Barwick and Fraser conspired to bring down the Whitlam government in 1975, Charlie remained in parliament, representing the seat of Newcastle until 1983. When he retired from parliament, he became an official of the retired members association. I know Charlie loved fishing, so I suppose he took time off from that important activity. But he also kept up his interest in transport and civil aviation and, on a number of occasions, carpeted retired members he felt were misusing their gold passes.
Today in this condolence debate I want to thank Charlie and acknowledge his personal support, particularly during the late 1970s and 1980s. Charlie could be a very difficult character to deal with: stubborn, curmudgeonly and inflexible, he held some quite old-fashioned views. Many could not understand him. Always loyal to the Left of the Labor Party, he was more than capable of expressing quite right-wing views. Charlie explained this approach once to a colleague: `Think Right, vote Left.' When I was the Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the ALP, Charlie would often be in contact over the labyrinthine intricacies of Labor politics in Newcastle, which are far too complex to explain here in the Senate chamber—actually, Mr Deputy President, I would have to admit that I have never quite understood them myself.
The best thing I can say about Charlie, and the thing I am sure that he would want someone to say in this condolence debate, is that no-one could question his loyalty to the Labor Party. He remained a party activist until his death last week. Charlie Jones served the labour movement and the people of Newcastle in many different capacities from 1943, when he first became a member of the executive of the Boilermakers Union. After 40 years of public service, in his retirement he continued to be active and engaged. He was always motivated by his desire to serve and to help the working men and women of Newcastle and their families, whether as a unionist, an alderman or a member of parliament. I will certainly miss him. Many other members and supporters of the Labor Party will miss him. On behalf of the opposition in the Senate, I express our deep regret at Charlie's death and offer sincere condolences to his wife, Doreen, his children, Fay and Ken, and his many grandchildren and great grandchildren.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-11,"—I would like to associate the Australian Democrats with this condolence motion. Charlie Jones obviously made a mark on his country, and his friends and family have great reason to be proud of all that he achieved and all the effort he put in. He was elected to the seat of Newcastle in 1958 and served in that seat until 1983. That 25-year service in the House of Representatives is of itself worth noting. Very few senators have served this chamber for 25 years, and I think only a handful of the current members of the House of Representatives have served for that length of time. Twenty-five years is certainly up there in the higher ranks of length of service. 
Prior to entering the federal parliament, Charlie Jones was active in the Newcastle City Council as an alderman and then as lord mayor, his service there stretching back a further 12 years. Clearly, he served his community with great diligence and effectiveness and, from the tone and detail of the contribution of Senator Faulkner—who is in a position to know—obviously he was viewed with a great deal of affection by many in his party. To serve a party and a community for that length of time and still be recognised at the end as someone who has done a good job is the sign of a task well done. 
The time of Charlie Jones as transport minister perhaps has had the most focus in terms of the role he played in parliament. As Senator Faulkner mentioned, some of the issues of that period—30 years ago now, when Charlie first became a minister in the Whitlam government, at the end of 1972— are still around today in varying forms. The second airport in Sydney is one such issue that Senator Faulkner mentioned. Some of the trials and tribulations involved in trying to get decisions on that issue continue to this present day. Many an aviation minister—not to mention an opposition leader and various representatives of Sydney based seats—has been caused a lot of angst by the varying proposals for further airports and air traffic in Sydney and the Sydney basin. 
Mr Jones also served as transport minister during the difficult period when the world was confronted by the oil crisis of the early 1970s. Airlines around the world were suffering, as many of them are now. There was talk at the time of merging Qantas with what was then TAA, a move which eventually became reality some 20 years later, although of course under very different circumstances, in a deregulated market. The Hon. Mr Jones was also the minister responsible for making the decision to allow the supersonic Concorde to fly to Australia. It subsequently did make a number of visits to Australia—although, as senators would be aware, there shall be no more Concordes flying into Australia. But Charlie Jones was the person who gave permission for them to come here for the first time. 
Also in the area of aviation, long before smoking was banned on all domestic and international flights, Charlie Jones recognised the health implications of smoking on passenger aircraft and suggested that smoking seats should be segregated from non-smoking seats. This was a forerunner to the subsequent government's later legislative segregation, which effectively banned smoking on domestic flights. So clearly, even in that small number of years as minister, he had a significant role in some issues of the aviation and transport industries that we are still wrestling with today. I am sure that his local community, the proud community of Newcastle—although I must say that after 100-plus years of electing a Labor Party member they might want to consider some alternatives—
—I doubt it; certainly not the Australian Democrats. 
—You never know; just you wait and see. I am sure many people in that community are very proud to be a part of it. For Charlie Jones to have been able to serve that community for a quarter of a century in the federal parliament is a great achievement and, I am sure, a source of pride to his family and friends. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I pass on my condolences to them, recognising the importance of acknowledging in a condolence motion not just our sorrow at the passing of a person but our recognition of the achievements of their life.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-08-11,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 has no redeeming features. Indeed, it is just another in a long line of legislation brought forward by this government to reduce the rights and entitlements of workers and to limit the capacity of the trade union movement to represent workers. Since 1996, when the coalition government came to power, there have been over 50 separate pieces of industrial relations legislation introduced by the coalition government. In nearly all cases they have been directed at reducing entitlements for workers, removing their rights, targeting particular groups of workers—such as those in small business— and creating inequitable situations for them. They have been about promoting non-unionism. They have been about limiting the ability of democratic trade unions to function within the industrial relations system. Many, of course, have been given titles which suggest the opposite of what the legislation has set out to do.
We all recall, of course, the legislation introduced in 1999 called the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999. Somebody in the government had an idea for dramatic irony or a sense of the absurd, because that legislation did exactly the opposite. It did not do anything to create more jobs, and it in fact proposed reduced entitlements and reduced remuneration for workers. We have bills such as the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. That last bill started out as the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill—legislation which, on a number of occasions, has been rejected by this Senate.
One of the ironies of the bill that we are debating at the moment is that the title actually, for once, gets it right. The bill is entitled the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002. It does deal with termination of employment but, if passed, it will terminate the rights of employees under state jurisdictions to seek a remedy for unfair dismissal within those jurisdictions. That is the real impact of this legislation. This, of course, demonstrates the hypocrisy of the coalition government. The Liberal Party particularly, and the National Party, have campaigned for years for the promotion and the protection of states rights. They are the self-appointed protectors of states rights under the Constitution, opposing any concept of centralism, of taking away powers from the states. However, they throw all of that out the window in their ideological pursuit of greater federal control over industrial relations and, in particular in this bill, over unfair dismissal laws.
The main purpose of the bill is to extend the federal unfair dismissal laws by excluding state jurisdictions from hearing such cases in nearly all situations. The bill relies upon the corporations power of the Constitution. Placitum (xx) of section 51 of the Constitution states:
The Parliament shall ... have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:
(xx) foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth ...
The bill does not use as its head of power the section of the Constitution—placitum (xxv) of section 51—which deals with the settlement of industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. Placitum (xxv) is the power that has been used historically, since the first Conciliation and Arbitration Act came into being in 1904, to regulate wages, working conditions and employment law at the federal level. Consistent with that, it has always been the case that the states have had the right to regulate industrial relations within their state jurisdictions. 
The argument that has been put forward by the minister is that this bill endeavours to bring about a unitary system, a national system, for the country to remove the complexities that are said to exist with six state jurisdictions and a federal system. That is an argument that has gone on for many years. I am sure those who take any interest in, or have looked at the history of, industrial relations issues in this country are well aware of the many arguments that have been advanced over the years and the many reports that have been written on the subject of how we get greater uniformity and a unitary system. There are some who believe that that is a good thing and there are some who argue that it is not, but this bill does nothing at all to advance the cause of a unitary system.
Let us look at some of the reasons why it does not. First, the legislation deals with unfair dismissals. It deals with the situation that arises when an employee is terminated and believes that he or she has the right to pursue a remedy, either for reinstatement or for damages, because it was an unfair dismissal—a breach of the contract of employment by the employer. That is what the legislation deals with. The legislation does not deal with the whole of the contract of employment. The legislation does not seek to bring those employees who are covered under state awards in respect of their wages and working conditions completely under the federal jurisdiction. It deals only with the discrete area of unfair dismissal. The bill in effect says that if you are an employee under a state award—for example, in New South Wales or Queensland—all of your wages and working conditions will continue to be regulated by that state award except if you get the sack. If this bill becomes law and you get the sack, you will no longer be able to seek a remedy through your state commission or your state industrial court. You will have to apply to the federal commission. No ifs, no buts.
So this bill in no way advances the cause of a unitary system of industrial relations; rather, it singles out one discrete area and denies the state jurisdictions the power to continue to deal with that. Furthermore, this legislation does not even really deal with the area which regulates wages and working conditions; rather, it deals with what happens after the employee has been terminated. Rather than simplify matters, rather than remove complexities that may or may not exist in the current situation where you have federal and state jurisdictions, this will create more complexity. It will set up a situation in which many employees will be covered by two jurisdictions. Their wages and working conditions—the things they negotiate about or their employee organisation negotiates about on their behalf with the employer— will continue to be covered by a state award but, if they get dismissed and want to take action, they will have to go to the federal commission. As I said, that is creating more complexity. It is placing many millions of workers currently covered by state awards, and currently completely covered by a state jurisdiction, under both jurisdictions.
The second point is that this legislation does not actually do what its purpose seeks to do—that is, move all employees from a state jurisdiction to the federal jurisdiction for the purposes of unfair dismissal. The government acknowledges that. As the minister himself said in his second reading speech, this will produce a situation where about 85 per cent of workers will be covered by federal unfair dismissal laws. He said: 
This `cover the field' provision means that the percentage of employees covered by federal unfair dismissal provisions should rise from about 50 per cent to about 85 per cent and that the number of workers covered by federal unfair dismissal provisions should increase from about four million to about seven million.
So the government, by its own admission, knows that the argument that this will bring about or promote a unitary system is false because this will leave, on its calculations, 15 per cent of the work force either still covered by a state jurisdiction for the purposes of unfair dismissal law or possibly in a state of limbo. I say `a state of limbo' because this will inevitably create legal argument about whether or not the federal jurisdiction applies in particular cases. When you set out to pass legislation that purports to cover the field, you immediately raise issues about whether or not that objective is achieved in all cases. If the government's own admission is that 15 per cent of employees will not be covered by the federal legislation if it is passed then there is potential for some, if not most, of those employees not to be covered by the federal jurisdiction and at the same time to have their state jurisdiction coverage removed. I can see a lawyers' feast coming up in respect of some of those disputes.
A further point—and again, I am sure the government acknowledges this—is that, as the bill only applies to employees of corporations, it still leaves out people in unincorporated businesses such as many small businesses, institutions such as charities and unincorporated associations, and state instrumentalities. These employees are not covered by the bill. So to suggest that this bill is about bringing in a unitary system is a furphy; it is a nonsense. It does not do that. This bill is about Minister Abbott endeavouring to destroy the structure of the New South Wales Industrial Commission and the Queensland Industrial Commission in particular. Those are the two states where the state jurisdictions cover a large number of employees. This is nothing more than a deliberate ideological attack upon the existence and the work of those state commissions.
It has been recognised by many spokespersons on all sides of the debate—coalition supporters and Labor supporters—over the years that, if you want a unitary system of industrial relations, you have to bring it about by consensus. You have to create it through a cooperative effort. That is the way it has been done in other areas of the law where the corporations power has been used, such as in company law itself. If you are serious about improving the industrial relations framework in this country, you do not do so by trying to ram through the federal parliament legislation which attacks state institutions such as the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission, which has existed for over 100 years. It is the oldest industrial jurisdiction in this country, predating the federal commission, and it has a proud record of fairness, equity and providing industrial stability in the state of New South Wales. You could not find a better example of that than the construction of the Olympic facilities only a few years ago on budget, in time and by agreement. The New South Wales Industrial Commission and the employers and unions in that state contributed a great deal in bringing about that result.
But of course Minister Abbott is not interested in any of that. Minister Abbott is only interested in trying to use a form of industrial blackmail upon companies by saying to them, `You won't get a government contract unless you sign up to our federal construction industry laws.' That is what he is saying to the major construction companies in this country. In other words, you play by his rules or you do not play the game at all. I say to Mr Abbott that we will fight this legislation all the way. There are serious constitutional issues arising out of this bill with potential challenges to the High Court because of its potential invalidity.  
In conclusion, if this government are really serious about using the corporations power to bring about some reforms in this country, why don't they use that power to do something about the rights and entitlements of employees who are dismissed and lose their entitlements when businesses and companies such as HIH collapse and millions of dollars of employees' entitlements are lost? Why don't they use the corporations power to do something about protecting those innocent workers in those situations? Why don't they use the corporations power to stop some of the fraud and the criminal conduct that have gone on in companies in this country, such as the one I have just mentioned? Why don't they use the corporations power to do something about stopping some of those obscene payouts to failed chief executives? That is what the corporations power should be used for.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-08-11,"—I rise today to speak in opposition to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002. Labor opposes this bill because it is yet another example of this government being driven by anti-worker ideology and political expediency. The bill will not even achieve what it ostensibly aims to do—that is, in the words of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott:
... a more unified national workplace relations system ...
This would mean, in his words again:
... less complexity, lower costs and more jobs.
Those are noble sentiments from the minister, sentiments that no-one on this side of the chamber would oppose, obviously. However, we oppose this bill not only because it will not deliver those aims which the minister has set out but also because it deliberately and unfairly sets out to further erode protection for Australian workers. 
Let me examine in detail each of the minister's claims about this bill. He claims there will be less complexity. Instead of removing complexity, this bill adds to the complexity of the current situation. As the Queensland government's submission on this bill to the Senate committee pointed out, the bill establishes:
two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent;
different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entities;
different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities depending on whether they meet the definition of a `constitutional corporation';
concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of workplace relations in the one business, for example a federal regime governing a business' unfair dismissals and a state regime governing workplace harassment and industrial dispute; and
concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects on the one employee's claim (for example, the federal regime for unfair dismissal and the state regime for insufficient notice or unpaid entitlements).
The Queensland government's submission was far from being the only one to point out the defective design of this bill and the additional complexity that it would bring about for workers and employers alike. Professor Andrew Stewart, in his submission, discussed the complexity of the Workplace Relations Act that many more workers and managers would have to come to terms with should this legislation be passed. In particular, Professor Stewart, writing about the provisions of the act, said: 
They are very hard for ordinary workers or managers to understand, necessitating legal advice for even the simplest procedures. Instead of simply empowering the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) to deal with certain claims and providing broad guidance as to how to do so, as most State laws do, the legislation seeks to regulate each step of the process in ever-increasing detail. As is generally the way when Parliament tries to anticipate and counter every eventuality, this level of detail simply creates potential gaps and uncertainties for litigants and the lawyers to exploit.
So much for the minister's stated aim of less complexity!
Let me now turn to the alleged aim of lower costs. I do not need to go into the claim of the minister in detail other than to point out that, given the nightmare of complexity that he is apparently hell-bent on creating, there is no hope of lower costs. In fact, the opposite will result: costs will have to increase for workers and employers alike as they will need to seek legal advice for, in Professor Stewart's words, `even the simplest procedures'.
Lastly, I turn to Minister Abbott's claim that the passage of this bill will mean more jobs. For some time the government has been holding onto the claim that making it easier for the employer to unfairly sack a worker will make the employer more likely to take the step of employing the worker in the first place. We on this side of the chamber have more faith in the employers of this nation than it appears the government does. Nobody believes for a minute that when considering whether or not to take on a new worker an employer thinks, `No, I won't take someone on because when I treat them unfairly and sack them they might be able to come back at me.' That is not how employers think. That is not how small business employers, whom the government thinks are most likely to want to treat people unfairly, think at all. I think that when deciding whether or not to take someone on a potential employer looks at the turnover of their business and what skills are needed and whether there is sufficient work and resources to allow for an additional worker. But the government does not think that. The government thinks that the only thing holding back small business from taking on more staff is the risk of not being able to unfairly dismiss those workers down the track. I believe that is just not a factor in the minds of small business employers.
The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee conducted an inquiry into small business in 2002. The committee's findings released in February this year found:
Consistent with survey rankings of small business concerns, unfair dismissal did not arise as a major issue during the inquiry.
The committee found that more pressing concerns for small business were the difficulties they faced complying with the government's new tax system, the need for better business management and problems with recruiting suitable employees. Where unfair dismissal laws were raised as a concern, the committee reported that the main issues were a `lack of understanding in how to dismiss staff consistent with the law, the costs and complexities of the current processes for determining claims and the uncertainty for outcomes'.
The committee noted that what was most lacking were personal management skills in the small business sector, and reported a need for more training and support. But the government does not offer this training and support; what it offers through this bill, as my colleague has already said, is a sledgehammer approach: fix the problem by having yet another go at Australia's workers and remove their protection from being treated unfairly, rather than providing the education and training to employers about their obligations. 
I do not think anybody has forgotten that it was this government in its previous term who turned dogs onto Australian workers under the previous minister, Minister Reith. That image will be seared forever into the consciousness of many Australians, I believe. But just because this attempt by the government to snatch conditions and protection from workers has a less dramatic modus operandi, that makes it no less abhorrent. Minister Abbott, in introducing this bill, was trying to achieve three things: less complexity, lower costs and more jobs. The minister needs to go back to the drawing board, Labor believes, because this bill demonstrably will not achieve any of those things.
At the risk of teaching the minister how to do his job, Labor suggests that a good place to start would be to consult with the states. This bill will have a considerable effect on states' industrial relations jurisdictions. The rationale for this dramatic change is replete with rhetoric and generalisation but has very little by way of evidence or detailed analysis. As Ron McCallum, Blake Dawson Waldron Professor in Industrial Law and Dean of Law at the University of Sydney, said in his recent speech to the 11th Annual Labour Law Conference:
If the provisions of this bill concerning the coverage of federal law over employment terminations are enacted into law in their present form, they will strike a blow at the five remaining state systems of employment regulation that may mean the beginning of the end of state employment regulation in Australia.
That is something I would not have thought the federal government would want. Professor McCallum went on to say that, due to the expanded coverage of this legislation with about 85 per cent of workers having recourse to only federal mechanisms, state regulators would be left with very little to do. He believes that this—and I quote:
...would have a telling impact upon the viability of these state-based systems of labour relations regulation, especially in the smaller states of South Australia and Tasmania.
As these state systems do much more than simply regulate laws governing wages and employment conditions, to leave them gutted and unviable would impact on other areas of state law—areas that the Australian parliament has no interest in. So why would the federal government wish to go down this particular path? Their past record would suggest that having a go at workers may be their main motivation; however, some of the more charitable amongst those on this side of the chamber may suggest that the government is attempting to simplify industrial relations law and create a single, national system. So let us assume that that is the motivation.
—Like the tax system!
—That's right. Thank you, Senator Murphy. However, this bill, whilst achieving the first, certainly fails to do the latter. In my home state of Tasmania, despite the lack of consultation from the federal government, a considerable amount of work has been done to examine the implications of this bill, and I commend the state government for the quality of their submission to the Senate committee and wholeheartedly support their recommendation to reject these proposals.
As part of the work done on examining the effect of this bill, the Tasmanian Industrial Commission assessed the last 300 filed applications. These 300 applications related to 326 individuals. The results of examining these applications were as follows. Firstly, the Tasmanian Industrial Commission determined that 202 of the 300 applications—67.3 per cent—were possibly applicants employed by constitutional corporations and would therefore be subject to the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Secondly, of the 202 applications, 67—that is, 33.2 per cent—could be excluded from pursuing an application in either the Tasmanian Industrial Commission or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by regulation 30BA and section 170CC of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Thirdly, of the 300 applications, 128—that is, 42.7 per cent—also included claims in respect of underpayment of wages, long service leave and/or redundancy entitlements. A number included multiple claims. Fourthly, 93 of the 202 applications—46 per cent—would require applications to be lodged with both the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Tasmanian Industrial Commission as they sought entitlements as well as a claim for alleged unfair dismissal. 
The Tasmanian Industrial Commission's inquiries indicated that there would be a significant impact on the work of the commission and that the bill would result in a number of potential applicants—33-odd per cent of their sample—not being able to pursue a claim in either jurisdiction. Also, a number of clients—46 per cent of the sample— would need to pursue their claims in both the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. For anybody who is still with me, I think what we have here, from a Tasmanian perspective, is an increase in the complexity of the industrial relations system at both the Tasmanian and Australian level. So much for a more simple method of operating and an aspiration to a unified system. The clear evidence is that this legislation is fundamentally flawed. If Minister Abbott had consulted with the states, including the Tasmanian state government, he would have found this out for himself. I will say again that this bill does not achieve what Minister Abbott sets out to achieve at a practical level. All that we are left with, therefore, is the assumption that this is an ideological obsession with diminishing protection.
So let me now turn to what effect this bill would have on protection for workers in the event of unfair dismissal. The first and most glaringly unjust provision of this bill is its attempt to treat workers employed by small businesses in a different way from workers employed by medium and large enterprises. None of us on this side of the chamber can see any reason why the size of the business that the employee works for should determine their ability to seek redress in the event of unfair treatment. To argue otherwise is to argue for an inequality of rights and sets Australia on a very dangerous path indeed. As the Senate committee found, one of the major issues identified by small businesses was `problems with recruiting suitable employees'. Creating an environment where there is less security and fewer rights for employees of these businesses will only make it harder, in fact, for them to attract suitable, skilled staff, which is completely contrary to the objective of this bill.
This bill seeks to differentiate between employees of small businesses and those employed by larger businesses in a number of ways. For an employee of a small business the qualifying period of employment before an application for a remedy can be made will be extended from three months to six months. The maximum compensation payable to a small business employee who has been unfairly dismissed will be reduced from six months remuneration to three months remuneration. I ask why. Is the unfairly dismissed employee of a small business more readily able to find alternative work? Do small business employees have less financial commitments than other employees? Do the children of small business employees have less need for education or health care— things that under this government are costing families more and more each day? Of course they do not. So how can it possibly be fair to discriminate against employees of small businesses in this way? It cannot be. That is why Labor will not be supporting this bill: a bill that attempts to set up two classes of workers in this country and effectively, in the case of small business, an underclass. 
Minister Abbott has made some cursory attempt to justify what would seem, prima facie, to be discriminatory treatment of workers by some relatively poorly explained and ill-defined notions of imbalance. Like my Labor colleagues on the committee, I do not accept this attempted justification. As they noted in their report, there were strong arguments put before the committee:
... that small business may have compensating advantages that undermine any argument for concessional treatment in regard to employment laws.
In particular, they noted Professor Keith Hancock's submission in which he stated:
There is a wide variety of forces at work that determine the `make-up' of the economy between small and large business. Some of these favour large businesses and others small businesses. The oft-cited importance of small business in the overall economy is of itself evidence that by no means all advantages lie with bigness.
So there goes the final of the minister's arguments. Add to that the lack of protection for that substantial proportion of the work force who will still remain beyond the reach of federal law and those for whom the system will become immensely more complicated and you are not left, on the face of it, with much to support. As I said, this is a bad bill that does not achieve even the less distasteful elements of the minister's agenda. The minister, if he is serious about making some changes to bring about a more coherent regulatory system, has to go back to the states.
To finish, I would like to return to the words of Professor Ron McCallum, who said:
We are a federation and will remain so. It is possible to work towards a national system of industrial relations law: However, such a program requires cooperation, discussion and patience on all sides. If this Bill is enacted into law in its present form, then in my view it will ... set back federal and state cooperation on industrial law reform by several decades.
We cannot afford to do that, so in the interest of future, better-intentioned reform and in the interests of Australian small business workers and Australian small businesses themselves, Labor will continue to oppose this legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-08-11,"—I rise tonight to make a few brief comments with respect to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002. I want to take up the point that it is intended to make a simplified process of and to bring uniformity to industrial relations as it goes to the question of unfair dismissal. This is all very good and interesting; I am sure a lot of people would support uniformity and simplicity if it were actually equitable. I am sure there would be many workers in Tasmania who would be more than happy to see uniformity in respect of wage structures and, in fact, uniformity dealing with the payment systems that some of their mainland colleagues have.
Senator Mackay raised a point with respect to Federation. We are a Federation and it is interesting to note that, in one comment, the Prime Minister strongly supported the issue of Australia being a Federation. He urged Australians to vote against Australia becoming a republic to protect that particular system and yet we have a government minister seeking to undermine it completely in respect of some of the laws that operate within the Federation. It is interesting to note that the government is taking this approach to unfair dismissal laws because it suggests that somehow all of the states' laws in respect of unfair dismissal are fundamentally flawed. Many of them were formulated under conservative governments, so it suggests that the government's own colleagues at a state level have failed miserably to introduce laws that give adequate protection to employees on the one hand and facilitate the process for determining unfair dismissals at the workplace level on the other. 
You really do not have to pull away the cloak here to see exactly what the federal government and particularly the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations are up to. This is a process to try to get at trade unionism in this country. Nothing could be clearer. The facts are that, on the one hand, the minister has introduced bills into the parliament that are inconsistent with bills that he has previously introduced which sought to exempt small business employers from the Commonwealth unfair dismissal laws and yet, on the other hand, here he is seeking to have a cover-all process for unfair dismissal only, which makes it very interesting. He is saying to workers in Tasmania, `You have to be covered by Commonwealth unfair dismissal laws, but you cannot be covered by payment systems in respect of your wages that might apply at Commonwealth level.' Just that example in itself clearly demonstrates what the government is really on about here.
I think we have had eight attempts to introduce bills in one form or another. Again, I think that is an example of how this government, and in particular Mr Abbott, has been pursuing the issue of trying to reduce the capacity of worker representation in this country. It is clear, both historically and even today, that worker representation is needed. Senator Forshaw may have raised the issue of the use of the corporations power. We did not see the government rushing to use the corporations power in respect of some of the payments that have been made to CEOs, many of whom have proven to be totally inadequate in their job. We do not see an unfair dismissals process applying there to protect the interests of the company or, indeed, the shareholders of the company. No, what we see totally and indifferently is a system whereby these people receive huge payouts for miserable failure. It is hard to see how a government can argue that there is some justice in its approach.
As I said, I just wanted to be brief and say that I do not and will not support this type of legislation in this place. I do not think it is worthy of support. I do not even think it is worthy of an attempt to amend it. I hope that other senators will take that view. There is no purpose in trying to amend legislation that delivers an unfair outcome to the Australian people, particularly Australian workers. If it is fundamentally unfair, which this is, then it is not worthy of any support and it should be sent back to the government. If the government ever decides that it wants to bring in some genuine reform then that is worthy of debate, but there are many more important issues in respect of matters that relate to the operation of business in this country.
I note with interest that the government senators said in their majority report that they saw an `urgent need to reduce the burden of regulation on small business'. If there is one thing that this government has successfully done it has been to introduce a tax system that has placed a greater burden on small business in this country than any other government, from a historic point of view, has ever been able to achieve. And we all know what that is: the GST and the BAS. If the government was really genuine about looking after the interests of small business—or indeed any business, but particularly small business—in this country it would embark upon a process of introducing legislation and change into this parliament that would ensure that the 20 days, on average, that it takes for a small business to fill in its BAS forms were either reduced significantly or that the burden was removed altogether. If there were a contribution that this parliament could make to the operation of small business in the country, that would be a very significant contribution. 
If you read various reports that go to the question of the concerns of small business, unfair dismissal laws per se do not rate highly. It is true to say that there is a general lack of understanding with many employers and with some employees, so a much more useful contribution to make to the Australian business community would be for small businesses, in particular, to be informed— and informed in a way that they could understand—about the requirements in respect of unfair dismissal laws. But, as I said, one of the most significant contributions that this parliament could make in respect of doing something for small business in this country would be to amend the tax system to enable small business to get on with the job of operating a small business and not be bound up by a tax system that requires a significant amount of their time to be spent on filling out forms—time that is totally lost to them— at a significant cost.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-11,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 represents something of a crossroads in the development of industrial relations law in this country, because it seeks to cover the field in a manner which has not before been attempted in industrial relations law at the Commonwealth level. The provisions covering termination of employment in the Workplace Relations Act do include provisions concerning unfair dismissals, as do the state regimes, and these have been the subject of intense political and policy debate for the past decade. This bill attracts the Australian Democrats qualified support—I say `qualified' because we are circulating amendments to the bill shortly—because it advances the Australian Democrats philosophy and policy with respect to a unitary industrial relations system. It also revisits a few areas we have previously rejected—and will continue to reject in principle and practice—and it does advance a few process improvements on unfair dismissal.
Schedule 1 of the bill before us is the second major move towards a unitary, or uniform, system. The first was the referral of Victoria's state industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth by former Premier Jeff Kennett and his government. That act of referral will be one of his greatest policy legacies. It is a policy decision that no government in Victoria, whatever the colour, would be keen to reverse. I am sure that every night members of the Labor government in Victoria and countless others in the Victorian community kneel and thank the various gods that industrial relations in Victoria is under one system and not two systems, as it also is in the ACT and the Northern Territory.
For New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia it is still the Dark Ages of industrial relations, each with a state system overlapping and conflicting with our Commonwealth system. As I have argued before, we need one industrial relations system, not the six we presently have. We have a small population of just 20 million people; we have nine governments, 15 houses of parliament and a ridiculous overlap of laws and regulations. There are areas of economy that genuinely require a single national approach, like finance, the Corporations Law, trade practices law or tax law. Labour law is one of those areas too.
Globalisation and the information revolution have created competitive pressures that require us as a nation to be as nimble as possible in adapting to changing circumstances. Whatever the colour of the Commonwealth government, we still require just one set of laws for the country. There are areas of policy and jurisdiction the states no longer have sensible involvement in. It took 30-odd years for tax law to become far more national than had been conceived at the commencement of Federation. After 70-plus years we finally got a unitary system of trade practices law. After 100 years states' rights and vested interests finally gave way to one unitary financial system for Australia and although the process was messy in the execution we do finally, after 100 years, have a unitary system in Corporations Law. 
The Australian Democrats have never supported states' rights and, by extension, states' laws therefore, or even the Federation as originally conceived. That long Australian Democrats tradition is repeated in the Democrats' constitutional reform policy balloted in July 2001, which says:
We strongly hold that the current three tiers of Government in Australia should be replaced by a more representative framework, where the States are replaced by Regional Governments ... 
As an automatic consequence of such a policy position long held by the Democrats, there is therefore explicit backing for national laws on, for example, trade practices, finance, corporations, tax and industrial relations. Regional governments would have no part in such law. Obviously there is absolutely no chance whatsoever, given both the views of the Australian community as a whole and the views of the major parties, that our federal system is likely to be revisited. Nevertheless, the central concept that there are laws which are appropriate to be national and laws which are appropriate to be regional or state is entirely accurate. 
It is time we moved towards a national system of industrial regulation that will do away with unnecessary replications, conflicts and complexity. Referenda aimed at extending the Commonwealth's industrial relations powers failed in 1911, 1913, 1926, 1944 and 1946. It seems unlikely that anyone will attempt a unitary system by referendum again, or at least in the near future. Does that mean it is a policy we should not pursue? No, it does not.
The referral of the Victorian system to the Commonwealth from 1997 has been a remarkable success with remarkably little aggravation within the community. That is despite the fact that, under section 1A, thousands of Victorian employees still, regrettably, remain under inferior employment conditions. I was very pleased to see that the federal minister had finally agreed with the Victorian minister to end that circumstance. Victoria is much better off, despite the criticisms one might have with parts of the federal legislation, with one system and not two.
This bill does advance unfair dismissal 85 per cent of the way to a unitary system for unfair dismissal. A nearly unitary system for unfair dismissal would have three prime benefits. Firstly, it would achieve for the majority of Australian workers common human rights across Australia, which differ at present. The second motivation is economic. Common, easily administered rules and laws make for more efficient, competitive and productive enterprises, and this bill moves towards that objective. Thirdly, the bill facilitates more comprehensive coverage for workers. There have been estimates of up to 800,000 employees not covered by federal or state awards or agreements, for example the former employees of OneTel, that would now be covered.
Unfortunately, the bill cannot go as far as it needs to. Constitutional limitations prevent complete coverage. As we have stated earlier, the Democrats are concerned that relying on the corporations power alone will still leave large chunks of employees working for non-incorporated businesses, many of these in small business with still no protection from state or federal laws. The Democrats also recognise that the federal unfair dismissals law is more complex than in a number of the states and that is because of the competing considerations that exist. A simple system allows far too generous an access; a complex system produces its own costs and difficulties. 
A number of state governments have raised these issues as a concern but have noted that the federal government has yet to make any genuine efforts to attempt to get a uniform system going. Various state governments have expressed a willingness to be involved in discussions about a harmonised national approach so long as it is done in a consultative and cooperative manner, but attempts to do so have met with little satisfaction. My own experience from my reading of the history of attempting harmonisation is that it is inevitably full of rhetoric and very difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the Democrats certainly would prefer a cooperative, harmonised national approach to a single IR system.
I must say I find a contradiction in seeking to extend the coverage of federal law on unfair dismissals while simultaneously proposing to exempt small business from unfair dismissal law through the—again Senate rejected—Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. Such an inconsistent approach is easily understood when we remember that the sole purpose of the fair dismissal bill, as it is ironically called, is political: to provide an easy double dissolution trigger. We will not support schedule 1 of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 because, if there were to be a double dissolution election and the fair dismissal bill were to pass a joint sitting, effectively we would have facilitated the exclusion of a much greater number of small business employees from unfair dismissal remedies as a large number of small businesses would be brought in under the expansion of the federal regime. So, consequently, we have produced an amendment to prevent this bill coming into operation until 11 August 2004, which is after the final double dissolution date.
Concerns have been raised by states, unions, some advocacy groups and some academics that some employees such as short-term casuals, those on fixed-term or task contracts and `high earning' non-award workers, trainees and managers who in some states are able to challenge their dismissal would not be covered by the federal system. Since the early 1990s employers have increased their use of casuals, contractors and labour hire forms of employment, often on a long-term basis. Between 1998-99 and 2001-02 we have seen a 29 per cent rise in the number of job placement agencies, many of which specialise in temporary placements. The total number of placements from these agencies comprised 424,400 permanent jobs and a massive 3,314,500 temporary or contract placements.
The growth in precarious and atypical employment has meant that, increasingly, legitimate workers are being excluded from recourse in the unfair dismissal system. While many state unfair dismissal legislation regimes make an effort to cover legitimate employees in precarious employment, the federal unfair dismissal regime does not. One noted academic, Professor Andrew Stewart, who has been quoted here today, has proposed that many of the problems created by the growth in precarious and atypical employment can be dealt with by a redefinition of the term `employment'. Professor Stewart's definition has been picked up as a key recommendation by the recent Stevens report, which recently reviewed the industrial relations system in South Australia. 
In an attempt to address the changing employee landscape as affected by unfair dismissal, the Democrats propose to expand the definition of employee—and we have put that in our amendments—based on Professor Stewart's recommended definition, to cover contractors and other workers who, under the Workplace Relations Act, might not presently be considered employees. One would assume that the federal government would support such an amendment as the federal system has always supported access to genuine employees, so the government should have no objection to provisions that ensure genuine employees—and I stress `genuine' employees—are captured by the unfair dismissal system. To further make the point: you cannot at one level deem an employee for tax purposes and then for workplace relations purposes exclude them. We have made it quite explicit in our suggested amendments that any person who is categorised as an employee for tax purposes will also fall under this act for unfair dismissal purposes.
While our proposed amendments will address some of the concerns raised in the states, given that the states' regimes are so varied it would be difficult to satisfy everyone. There are good arguments to rationalise state laws. When we first revised the unfair dismissal regime in 1996, casuals were an entirely different proposition from what they are today. Today the estimates are that there are about 2½ million Australians under casual employment, and most of those fall under the state jurisdictions. In Western Australia and in Tasmania there is a very strange provision in that there is no probationary period for casuals, which seems remarkable to me. In the other four jurisdictions, casuals on probation are excluded from accessing unfair dismissal—rightly, I think. In the Commonwealth, Queensland, Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory the exclusion period is 12 months. In New South Wales and South Australia it is six months. So the question, in my mind, is not whether there should be a probationary period for casuals but what the length of that period should be. In that respect, if we are going to minimise the angst of the states about those who can presently access their regimes and who should be entitled to have access to the federal regime, we think it is appropriate to produce a compromise. Consequently, we are recommending that the standardised casual probationary period be six months.
Concerns have also been raised that the federal unfair dismissal system would lead to reductions in the resourcing of state industrial tribunals and hence their ability to perform their other roles and that workers in regional and rural areas who currently can attend local courts visited by state commissioners would incur increased costs to attend the federal commission, which some expect will be based solely in capital cities. While parts of the industrial relations system will remain with the states, the Democrats are sympathetic to the states' concerns and propose that federal unfair dismissal cases should also be able to be heard through state commissioners by having dual state and federal appointments.
In schedule 2 this bill again attempts to differentiate unfair dismissal laws for small business as opposed to large business, provisions that in this case in effect reduce the rights of employees in small business. The coalition has repeatedly sought to justify its attempts to exempt small business from unfair dismissal laws by arguing that they deter small business from recruiting employees and place a greater burden and cost on small business. There continues to be little hard evidence to support the view that fair unfair dismissal laws have an adverse effect on overall employment levels, although there is evidence to show that unfair dismissal laws that are unfair or that allow process abuse do affect business attitudes to employment. Economics aside, fundamentally the Democrats have consistently said that, on both human rights and equity grounds, we will not accept reducing the rights of employees just because they are employed by small business. 
One of the amendments in schedule 2 relates to giving the commissioner the ability to dismiss vexatious and frivolous applications on the papers. There are genuine concerns at the cost to employers and the commission of dealing with claims that are frivolous and vexatious. We feel that these concerns are valid for all sizes of business, not just small business, and therefore if enacted should apply to all business, and that is our amendment. Labor have previously expressed willingness to support such an amendment—I refer to the former shadow minister Robert McClelland in Hansard on 5 May 2003—and they have said that they are willing to look at amendments that curb frivolous and vexatious behaviour. The provision provides for employees and employers to give any additional information before a decision is made. Some groups have raised concerns that the provision takes away employees' rights to be heard. We have drafted in consultation an amendment that will enable the employee to be heard by either the commission or registrar without the employer being present. The Democrats have consistently supported process improvements to unfair dismissal laws that will increase efficiencies and reduce costs, and have consistently opposed changes that materially impact on the basic rights of employees, especially if one group of employees have rights and another, such as small business employees, do not.
Schedule 3 tightens unfair dismissal processes, sharpens relevant considerations and confirms that reinstatement should be the primary remedy. We agree with reinstatement being the primary remedy.
In summary, where do I get to on this bill? The Democrats are prepared to support the central proposition that the field should be covered. In return, we believe that there has to be an adjustment to ensure that genuine employees are covered and to ensure that standard provisions for casuals reflect the reality of the market as a whole. That is the broad thrust of our approach.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-08-11,"—The principal object of workplace relations legislation is to make it easier for businesses to employ people. It sometimes seems in the national debate over workplace relations and the government's policy that the loud constituency that claims it is actually a measure that assists bad employers become worse employers has indeed taken charge of the debate. It bears repeating, apparently, that it is in no way in the interests of any employer to recruit and then to have to sack unsuitable workers. Neither is unfair dismissal law any longer naturally an area of big union dominance. Most Australian private sector employees do not belong to unions, and this is something the Labor Party, in particular, really needs to get to grips with.
In speaking to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 today, I want to concentrate on the really vital ground in this debate, and that really vital ground is small business. As a general rule, big business is capable of looking after its own interests in relations with its employees. We need laws to govern dismissal primarily to foreclose on what generally are very rare instances of unfairness in dismissals from large companies. The Labor Party might like to think differently—actually, we know that they think differently from everything that they say—but we would all benefit, and the country with us, if, in thinking differently, they also thought logically. I appreciate that this may come as something as a culture shock to those opposite, who seem to think that the Tolpuddle Martyrs were monstered only last week. But the logic of employment today in industries where work is either cyclical or seasonal is that short-term contract employment is a sensible option. Often this is provided by labour hire companies. In single workplaces with long-term employment conditions—and this is the basis of most employment in this country—it makes no sense either for employers to be unfair or for employees to take unfair advantage of their positions. As in most things, in a democratic and socially responsive culture such as ours, we are all in the same boat. Our collective interest lies in ensuring that those who row the boat do so in a coordinated manner, that those who steer the boat take the safest and speediest course to our shared destination, and that those who own the boat ensure that it goes to the destination they desire to sail to. 
In Australia the bulk of the employment picture is made up of small businesses. The statistics are so often quoted that it hardly seems necessary to go through them here again tonight, and I will not. It is enough in this debate to say that small business is the real driver of local employment and that it is there that government policy on the workplace should concentrate.
Unemployment in Australia has been a persistent problem for a number of years. It is clear that there are a number of reasons for this, ranging from an awkward fit with emerging commercial and industrial opportunities and markets to that phenomenon of the soft Western world, the workless by choice. It is often useful to pause and think about how lucky we are as people. We live in an advanced economy under a system of government that the people actually control and which provides a welfare safety net that most of the world can only dream about between nightmares. In the workplace relations debate, in particular, I believe we need to recognise the beneficence that we award ourselves. That is not to say that this beneficence should not be removed or even reduced. It is just that on any objective analysis of Australia's workplace relations laws we do have good reasons to be proud.
The business community, and in particular in this instance the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have voiced some criticisms over what they see as insufficient attention being given to the two core impediments to business growth. Small business employment has been a focus of attention lately. There has been the Senate committee report and the federal Office of Small Business is currently undertaking an evaluation of two of its small business programs that aim to promote business growth and employment. The Senate committee report shows very clearly that the primary employment driver in the small business sector is business growth spurred by economic growth. Obviously priority should be given to policy that maintains a high level of production.
As well as making it possible for business to maintain high levels of production—and, of course, these are not in any case matters that rest only in workplace relations laws, as Senator Murray suggested—we have to liberate the workplace further to take account of how Australians nowadays want to work. There is a high level of casual employment in the restaurant and cafe sector, which operates on razor thin margins and experiences a high rate of both business openings and business closings. But casual work suits a great many of today's Australians and it is not necessarily something that is of disadvantage to the country, the economy or the people engaged in casual work. Similarly, part-time work is also gaining in popularity and it is not doing so because—although this is what the Labor Party sometimes seem to want to say—that is all people can get. 
The Labor Party has for a long time been struggling to get out of its collectivist cave and to come to grips with the reality that a great many Australian people do not want to be busy little worker bees in some vast socialised employment market where the unions tell them what to do and when to do it or what not to do and where not to do it. The primary aim of all business is to grow, and this applies to small business just as much as to big business and global business. It even applies to the growing number of sole business operators. Everyone wants to get ahead; indeed, this is what drives human society.
The role of government in this environment is to facilitate growth—to make it as easy as possible for a business, any business, to grow and to contribute to national growth. We all know, even those opposite, that businesses and the community generally have long held concerns that termination of employment provisions are an employment disincentive for small business. Aside from the general philosophical point that the law should avoid being an impediment to enterprise—and we on this side of the chamber hold that to be an immutable principle essential to the operation of a free society—it is also plain commonsense to liberate the workplace. 
These concerns were noted in the More Time for Business response from the government in 1997, near the beginning of the liberalising and liberating process that Australia has chosen to go through in the employment area. That report found that termination of employment provisions have a disproportionate impact on small business, which can neither afford the high costs associated with a highly regulated and formally structured system nor find the time to engage in the lengthy processes which ensue. A range of surveys since then has reinforced that point. Small businesses are more likely to employ new staff and employ staff on a permanent basis if freed from what is, in effect, a restrictive trade practice in terms of the prospects of unfair dismissal claims. This survey information was covered by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in its submissions to Senate inquiries into bills seeking to exempt small business in 1998 and 2002.
More recently, as I have stated previously, a new Yellow Pages survey report commissioned by DEWR from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research, with results released in October last year, has found that state and federal unfair dismissal laws impose extra costs of $1.3 billion a year on small and medium businesses and reduce employment for low-paid workers by one per cent. Small business organisations representing a wide range of small businesses, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Small Business Coalition, have argued that the laws should be changed to make them less onerous, particularly for small businesses. A major cause for concern, as I briefly alluded to before, is that small businesses are generally unlikely to have dedicated human resource professionals within their management structures, let alone personnel departments to handle recruitment and performance management processes necessary to defend unfair dismissal claims. They are also unlikely to engage outside specialists to assist in this area. 
The focus of interest for many in the bill we are now debating is that it proposes to establish a single system throughout Australia at the expense of state jurisdictions. In a federation—and I would venture to suggest particularly in our federation—one should tread very lightly in all areas where the existing rights and obligations of subnational and local levels of government are concerned. I do not believe in the principle of centralism as a force that over time is permitted to take over everything. In Australia, where we have a relatively small population in a relatively large landmass, we must always take proper account of regional differentiation and the commonsense that tells you that things in Townsville, for example, are likely to be very different from things in, say, Traralgon.  
But there is a strong argument, and I believe a convincing one, for creating employment conditions on a national basis where the application of the law is concerned. There is no reason why an Australian living in Townsville should be governed in his or her terms of employment in any way differently from an Australian in Traralgon—or, indeed, anywhere else. There is one rider I would put on this condition, however. Universality in employment terms, so far as the law governing dismissal is concerned, works only when the principle that is engaged is the principle of maximum freedom of movement. 
It is vital to balance the interests of employers and employees. For the most part, sensible people will come to some mutual arrangement that, provided it is within the employment law, should be nothing to do with anyone else. In the argument that is often advanced from the other side of the workplace relations debate, it too often seems that it should be compulsory for an employer to take on—and keep on, even if unsustainable—a particular person. That is not how the world works, of course. It certainly is not any sort of policy that will assist in maximising profit and thereby contribute to business growth, local community growth and national growth. It is at bottom an anticonsumer market argument and, as such, it should be rejected. The concept of a single market for unfair dismissal relations—the concept that is the fundamental purpose of this bill—does nothing to offend against the single most important element of governance that a free federation such as ours should never surrender: protection of the individual's right to be an individual. 
We can expect the Labor Party and the union movement to attempt to demonise any moves towards greater freedom in the workplace. They are so caught up in their time warp that unravelling the web of employment constraints that exists in this country always carries the risk of strangling them. They will escape that fate only by making up their minds to free themselves from commitments to the past that hold no relevance in the 21st century in Australia. 
The future legislative amendments proposed to improve the Commonwealth unfair dismissal scheme are an expression of the `fair go all round' principle on which the existing unfair dismissal provisions are based. It would be very hard to characterise them as radical, and you would have to be potty indeed to consider them dangerous. They are designed to give the commission stronger direction in cases to allow it to more effectively balance the interests of all parties concerned.
In his second reading speech, opposing the bill, of course—a regrettable but thoroughly unsurprising position—the member for Barton, the opposition spokesman on this area in the House of Representatives, complained that it would lead to duplication of resources, Commonwealth and state. His remarks are worth repeating here. It is refreshing indeed to hear a Labor politician so staunchly defending states' rights, even if in this instance he is completely mistaken in the approach that he has chosen to take. The member for Barton said: 
It is a significant bill. It proposes to override state unfair dismissal laws insofar as those laws apply to corporations. Any instance where this parliament seeks to override state laws is of significance because we are here as part of a federal system of government and we should not ignore the significance of this parliament attempting to override state laws.
The member for Barton is from New South Wales and, as a member of the Labor Party, is presumably happy with the continued restriction of business and employment opportunity represented by his party's long established policy of `cosyfication'—and I admit that I have made that word up—with the unions. I am from Queensland, where the present government, as its opening act of vandalism on assuming office in 1998, destroyed the sensible industrial relations reforms that I put in place as the relevant Queensland minister in 1996-97. So I declare a particular interest in seeing a continuation of Commonwealth improvements to the workplace environment and to business prospects.
It is, I suppose, possible that this legislation might lead to duplication of resources— I stress, in a very limited area—but there are two things to say about that. The first is that in a federation there will inevitably be some duplication across jurisdictions. The second thing to say about it is that it is a sterile argument and one that is, frankly, not altogether germane to this debate. Passing this bill—which I support as sensible policy and which, ever hopeful, I commend to the Labor Party—would provide better support for small business as a major employer of Australians. State jurisdictions would still have powers in areas where the Commonwealth's writ did not run. That is how we have always run our federation anyway. And I think if they are honest with themselves, honourable members opposite would admit that. 
The member for Barton, in the other place, has not persuaded me that he is speaking with anything other than continued repression of small business and enterprise in his mind. I am far more persuaded by the argument of our side: by the argument of this government and of my friend and colleague the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I suggest to honourable members opposite that the sun will still rise—and in the east—and set in the west, and the stars will continue to shine, if we pass this bill, which I support.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-08-11,"—I am sure that the former shadow minister in the other place, the member for Barton, would like to know that his words were taken note of in the Senate and I wait with great joy now for the words of the new shadow minister, the member for Rankin, Craig Emerson. We will just have to wait and see, but I am sure that Dr Emerson will say marvellous things about Labor Party policy in this area.
Having said that, I briefly want to address the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 this evening. It is a regurgitation of the same old line that this government have put up over a period of time. As some of my colleagues have said, it is a very cynical approach to industrial relations and shows the vacuum there is in government policy when they have to keep turning up bills such as this. If you read the second reading speech you can see the jargon that is in it. One catches on very quickly that this is but another desperate attempt by the government, because in the second reading speech they say:
A more unified national workplace relations system means less complexity, lower costs and more jobs.
That is as far as it goes. There is no detail, no explanation and no justification—just the rhetoric. Further on in the second reading speech we find a little bit of the reason for this attempt to get uniformity. They quote the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research study which was referred to by the previous speaker. They note: 
Based on a Yellow Pages survey of nearly 2,000 small to medium businesses, the study found that almost a third of businesses did not know whether they were covered by federal or state unfair dismissal laws.
I find that quite surprising. I think 30 per cent is really quite low. I would have thought the figure would be far higher, because my experience in industrial relations has shown that employers, and particularly small employers, invariably are unaware of whether they are covered by a state or federal award. They do not know anything about the industrial relations system whatsoever. So I find it quite surprising that only 30 per cent responded that they were uncertain as to whether they were covered by federal or state unfair dismissal laws.
I would have expected, in responses to questions in that survey, that the survey would have at least found out if the people knew whether they were under a federal or state system. As I said, I think they would have found that a large number of those respondents would not have known what system covered them. That is very important because my ongoing experience in industrial relations—as a former branch secretary of the SDA in Queensland over a 15-year period, and now as the branch president for at least the last seven years—tells me that there are still many employers who do not know the difference between state and federal jurisdiction and do not know the difference between state awards and federal awards.
If one knows the federal system, one knows that there are not a great number of small employers who are covered by federal awards. Invariably they fall through the system and get caught under the state award systems. In Queensland, common rule awards apply so that those employers who fall through the federal award system get caught invariably by state awards. The industry that I have been involved in over a long period of time, the retail industry, covers a large number of small to medium retailers who operate over the state and over a wide span of trading and working hours. They are invariably caught up by the shop assistants award in Queensland. Of course, that is important to the employees who work in many of those places. If one knows anything about the trade union movement, one knows that it is difficult to organise, particularly in those small business areas. Regardless of our ability and capacity as a union to be able to organise in those small business areas—because many of the businesses are owner operated business or they have a limited number of employees who may work casually to assist the owner operator out of a bit of a hole once or twice a week so that the person gets some spare time—invariably where there are employees, they are caught by the state award. We keep the state award up to date. My union in Queensland prides itself in taking a great deal of care and attention to ensure that the conditions in that award mirror what can be negotiated in many of our enterprise bargaining arrangements through our federal award system. Whilst they are not always to the same level as in the federal awards, they nonetheless maintain very good standards and very good conditions indeed.
We then know that the people that we represent—whilst some of them may not be members of the union, there are those that are—do have access to a range of benefits that are not covered in a federal award or a federal agreement. To people in many of these small enterprises these benefits include having reasonable working hours; having a proper starting and ceasing time; having a roster; having proper leave conditions, such as sick leave and annual leave; and, most importantly, having access to unfair dismissal laws. There is no doubt, based on my experience with many small retailers, that the problem of unfair dismissal does exist and that people are quite unfairly dismissed because it suits the purpose of the employer rather than for any good, cogent reason. The industry churns people over, unfortunately, to the disadvantage of the employees. 
The fact that people in these small enterprises can, and have the right to, access unfair dismissal laws is important indeed. But my experience has been that over a long period of time, whilst the access has been there, it has not been overly used by employees in the small business area. It has been quite the opposite: most of the cases that the union— that is the SDA—has been associated with have involved employers that would be quite rightly titled as very large, major employers in the retail industry. I think that in any 12-month period one could reasonably count on both hands cases involving smaller employers that actually get to some formal proceedings in the commission. Those cases that are taken up are invariably resolved in conciliation conferences before the industrial commission.
The government is making much ado about nothing with this piece of legislation. The submission that the SDA, as a national organisation, put into the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, which considered this legislation, really gets to the nub of many of the concerns of the SDA. Of course, the SDA is a union that has a highly casual membership content. Part-time work has become popular in recent years. It has become popular with some of the retail firms primarily because of the insistence of the union in negotiations on employee enterprise bargaining agreements. This has been to ensure that the unsatisfactory casual employment which the employers were making available to the employees was changed from that unstable form of employment into a more stable form: part-time employment. No-one should be under any illusion that either part-time or casual employment satisfies the needs of people who want full-time employment.
We have an industry where there are many people who are working in precarious employment, who are working with small employers, who have more than one job and who change jobs on a regular basis because of the mobility within the industry. If this particular bill were to apply to those people then they would see some of their rights immediately ripped right away from them because of the desire in the bill to stretch the probation period to six months—where it is three months for everyone else—and the proposal in the bill that if a person is unfairly dismissed and they seek remedy then the maximum compensation is three months for people in small businesses. So immediately we have, in an industry which is highly casualised, people in highly precarious employment finding themselves the subject of a bill which could severely disadvantage them. Anyone with a good conscience would have to reject that and say that it is completely unfair to create a distinct second-class group of people in the work force whose rights are fettered by the type of bill that is before the chamber this evening.
What makes it even more concerning is that we are not just dealing with people who are casual employees but we are dealing with many people who are young and who do not have great deal of knowledge about their rights. We are also dealing with a large number of women who are coming back into the work force after having absented themselves in many instances for family duties. They go back into casual employment and so find themselves in precarious employment and we have the government trying to push through a bill that would see these people denied their basic rights. These people are the most vulnerable in the employment market and who could, and would, be quite easily exploited if this legislation were to succeed. 
As I said, the SDA made in its submission to the inquiry what I thought was a quite fair and balanced statement. It says:
The SDA starts from the principle that all people are entitled to fair and equal treatment. This Bill would deny some workers but especially those in small businesses that fundamental right.
We are not dealing with anything trivial; we are dealing with a fundamental right that gives people the dignity that they are entitled to in our society. The submission goes on to draw attention to this fact:
These amendments would particularly disadvantage young workers and women returning to the workforce after an absence therefrom.
It goes on:
Every time a worker started a new job, if it was in a small business, the probationary period would apply anew.
So we see that a group is going to be unfairly exposed because of the ideological dictates that rule the people on the other side of this chamber.
—Oh, Hoggie!
—Well, Carlton aren't doing any good, and you know that. I want to refer briefly now, in view of my time, to the Queensland government, because it was raised by the previous speaker. It is worth while looking briefly at the submission of the Queensland government to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill. I will quote a couple of appropriate comments from that submission which show the attitude of the government. The Queensland government—a fine government under the stewardship of Peter Beattie—claims that it was not consulted properly in relation to this particular bill. The submission from the Queensland government states:
Despite the repeated claims of the federal Minister, the Bill does not simplify industrial laws for employers or employees but makes a very complex federal system even worse. ... The Bill does not achieve an equitable balance between the rights of employers and employees but strongly favours employers to the detriment of employees. It takes away workers' rights under state laws without consulting the states, seriously compromising the Queensland government's economic, social and labour policies and its mandate to deliver a balanced and fair industrial relations system to the people of Queensland.
That is the Queensland government's view of this piece of legislation. The Queensland government in its submission goes on to outline a number of problems that it sees with the legislation. I will turn to the report of the committee to go through those, because the committee's summing up at the end of those points is particularly pertinent indeed. Page 20 of the report says:
The submission from the Queensland Government points out that far from resulting in improved legislation, as the Government claims, the bill establishes:
·	two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent—
that is obvious—
·	different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entities;
·	different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities, depending on whether they meet the definition of a `constitutional corporation';
·	concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of workplace relations in the one business, for example a federal regime governing a business' unfair dismissals and a state regime governing workplace harassment and industrial disputes; and 
·	concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of the one employee's claim (for example, the federal regime for unfair dismissal and the state regime for insufficient notice or unpaid entitlements).
This is the environment that is being created. The report goes on, as I said, to really sum it up:
Therefore, a state award employee of a constitutional corporation with a claim for unfair dismissal and withholding of wages would need to lodge claims in both federal and state jurisdictions, one for the unfair dismissal component, and the other for the wages component. Employers, who complain now about time wasted in court under the current law will find the regime proposed under this bill to be even more onerous.
I refer back to my opening remark: the claim in the second reading speech was that the reason for the unified national workplace relations system was to take away complexity, lower costs and create more jobs. I do not believe that can be seen to have happened. I believe that if we are to have a system that protects people's basic rights, that is fair, that is equitable, that applies commonsense, that people understand very easily and that lacks complexity then the bill that the government have presented here is not the path to go down. That does not mean to say that there cannot be, and should not be, some form of uniformity. The main thing that the government have got wrong here is the vehicle that they are using to try to achieve it. What they are trying to do is discriminatory to a particular class of workers, which I have a great affection for and have represented over a long period of time. I believe they should not be disadvantaged by the passage of this piece of legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-08-11,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 is the latest attempt by the Howard government to undermine the rights of working people. The government seems unable to accept the unequivocal view of the Senate majority. The Senate has rejected its many attempts to erode the rights of people who are unfairly dismissed by small business employers, so the government has dreamt up a new plan of attack.
The bill proposes to extend the Commonwealth's jurisdiction in unfair dismissal laws from 50 per cent of employees to around 85 per cent, or seven million people. At the same time, the Commonwealth government is seeking to diminish the rights of workers who are unfairly dismissed and take away the rights of redress that these workers currently have under state laws. Because the extension of federal jurisdiction relies on the Commonwealth's corporations power in the Constitution, employees of unincorporated businesses will not be covered. This means that around 15 per cent of employees will remain outside the so-called national unified scheme.
The Commonwealth, after having foisted this law on the states without consultation, wants the states to replicate the federal law or refer state powers to the Commonwealth so that these excluded employees can be picked up by the federal scheme. At the same time as the bill seeks to raise additional barriers for employees who make a claim for unfair dismissal, it weakens the remedies for workers employed by small business who are unfairly dismissed and it disadvantages casual employees, who will be subjected to a 12-month waiting period before they can make a claim for unfair dismissal.
The Greens will not support measures to undermine the protection of working people. We have been presented with no evidence that justifies discriminating against small business employees when it comes to protecting them against unfair dismissal, or their seeking reinstatement or compensation for wrongful loss of employment. The Australian Greens support the concept of a national industrial relations system that delivers good outcomes. That clearly is not the case here. We might have been inclined to consider more favourably supporting the part of the bill that extends the Commonwealth's powers had the bill improved protection for all employees and not been linked to another bid to undermine the rights of employees who are unfairly dismissed. 
In effect, the government is using the expansion of its powers as a cover for extending its objectionable policies. Given the government's record, it is difficult to imagine that it could propose any industrial relations measures that would deliver good outcomes. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, has said:
Greater uniformity in unfair dismissal legislation will provide substantial benefits for employees and employers through reduced complexity and greater certainty about the application of legislation.
It is worth noting that the Howard government's desire for a unified industrial relations system sits oddly with the government's general approach of divesting itself of responsibility for, and leadership on, a range of policy matters that rightly demand Commonwealth involvement—for example, the protection of the environment. The idea of increasing the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, something the Australian Greens support, is also at odds with the government's history of trying to scale back the commission's relevance by stripping it of powers such as the power to settle disputes.
More significantly, this bill would not deliver what the government and the minister claim to be its main goal: a national system. On the one hand, the government wants to capture most Australian workers within the ambit of the federal scheme while, on the other, it wants to treat some employees—that is, those employed by small business—less fairly than others. This contradiction is another reason the Australian Greens think the minister is simply using the extension of Commonwealth powers as a cover for what he has been unable to achieve through stand-alone legislation: exempting small business from federal unfair dismissal laws.
The bill certainly does not remove the confusion and complexities of the dual industrial relations system that the minister claims is its driving motivation for the legislation. On the contrary, even if the bill were to pass it would exclude a significant number of employees of, for instance, sole traders, charities, unincorporated companies and state government bodies. In addition, some businesses would be subject to a federal unfair dismissal regime while other aspects of their business would be subject to state law. Then there would be two types of federal unfair dismissal law: a lesser standard of protection for people employed by small business and another standard for everyone covered by the Commonwealth legislation. Far from being national and unified, the scheme would be fragmented and confusing.
The Greens are also concerned about the lack of consultation with the states on this and Minister Abbott's high-handed approach of imposing this system on the states. Were the federal government genuine about wanting a national scheme, it would have sought to work cooperatively with the states. So what is the government really up to? The Greens believe that it is more of what we have come to expect from the coalition: shifting the balance of power away from employees and in favour of business. Not content with proposing to expand the Commonwealth's jurisdiction in unfair dismissal to seven million employees, the government wants to prohibit those people who are brought within the scope of this bill from seeking remedies for unfair dismissal in state schemes. 
This bill would further undermine the rights of all employees covered by the federal regime by restricting the circumstances in which an employee of any business can take action against unfair dismissal, including where an employee is dismissed purportedly on operational grounds. We can find no check proposed to prevent this provision from being abused. This would appear to be a minimum requirement, particularly in light of the ACTU's submission to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, which identified employers' use of operational requirements to target particular employees on grounds including age and union activity. The bill also reduces any back pay component of compensation where a dismissed employee has had the opportunity to earn income from another source since being sacked.
Even further restrictions are imposed by this bill on employees of small business. It should be noted, as others have, that the number of unfair dismissal cases against small business has fallen in recent years from 3,218 cases in 1998 to 2,168 cases in the year to last November. Claims against small business as a percentage of all claims also fell, from 40 per cent to 30 per cent, in the same period.
Nevertheless, the government wants to go further, imposing additional restrictions on employees of small business including doubling from three to six months the waiting period before an employee of small business can take action if they are unfairly dismissed; denying an employee their day in court by allowing the Industrial Relations Commission to dismiss an application on the papers while requiring the commission to consider the cost of the employer attending the hearing; halving the applicable maximum amount of compensation that a dismissed employee can be granted to either three months salary or, for non-award employees, $20,400. Also, the commission can be directed to consider an employer's capacity to pay when determining a remedy or an amount of compensation, a provision that those working outside small business do not have to encounter. In addition, there would be the removal of the Industrial Relations Commission's ability to consider whether an employee was warned about unsatisfactory behaviour prior to being dismissed. This is particularly alarming when combined with the absence of a requirement for an employer to warn an employee about unsatisfactory behaviour before sacking a worker. It is only fair and reasonable that an employee has a right to be told that their behaviour is unsatisfactory and be given the opportunity to address an employer's concerns before being dismissed. The absence of such a direction and the removal of the commission's ability to take such a matter into account further demonstrate how this bill undermines the protection and rights of working people. So the government is trying to raise the hurdle for employees who are unfairly dismissed and reduce the compensation that they may be awarded.
On top of being unfair, the focus of these provisions is misdirected. They are aimed at reducing costs to small business and they do nothing to discourage employers from sacking people unfairly. In fact, these claims that make it harder for an employee to take a claim against their employer where they believe they have been unfairly dismissed could encourage some employers to abuse their power. The New South Wales Labor Council has provided a number of examples about how workers protected by the state unfair dismissal law in New South Wales would be disadvantaged under this bill, and, as a New South Wales senator, I would like to share those with the Senate. One is about an employee who injured their shoulder at home and was given medical clearance to return to work. They were dismissed after the company's nominated doctor said that returning was a safety risk. The employee's union made a successful application for the person to be reinstated under a state provision that protects injured workers. No such provision exists in this bill. 
Another employee was moved to a permanent position after working as a casual but was then sacked five weeks later for refusing to move to night shift work. Her letter of employment did not contain a probationary period so she was able to take a claim for unfair dismissal, which she won. Under the federal bill this would have been impossible because of the compulsory three-month probation period when she went to a permanent position.
Under this legislation employees of small business who are unfairly dismissed would be excluded from lodging a claim until they have been employed for at least six months, whilst casual employees would be excluded for 12 months and only eligible if they have been employed on a regular and systematic basis. In New South Wales there was a casual sales assistant in a small bookshop who was dismissed on the basis of a lack of hours available at the same time that the employer was advertising for new casual positions. The employee was able to settle the claim for unfair dismissal under the state scheme but would not have been able to do so under the federal scheme because they had not been employed for 12 months. 
In the New South Wales law there is no qualifying period for casual workers who are employed on a regular and systematic basis. For those casual workers who are not employed on a regular and systematic basis the exclusion period is six months. I know that in other states, in Western Australia and Tasmania, there is no exclusion period for casual employees. Given the growth of casual work, and particularly the casual work carried out by female workers, the 12-month exclusion period for casual employees would open the way for unscrupulous employers to exploit casual workers further and encourage greater use of casuals rather than permanent employees so as to avoid the application of this law. In addition, in New South Wales workers in regional and rural areas—and this may apply to other states as well—under this law would have to travel to the capital city to attend hearings before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, whereas currently in New South Wales the Industrial Relations Commission provides for hearings in towns outside Sydney.
On top of the long list of objections to this bill there is a cost to implement it. The government has set aside $16.8 million over four years for the expansion of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that would be required to implement this proposal. The Greens believe this is a terrible waste of public funds not least of all because it duplicates existing state resources that will still be required even if the proposed federal expansion in the area of unfair dismissal laws were to proceed. The Greens say that the $16.8 million could be far better spent investing in job creation and training and it would yield a far better return than investing in a scheme that the government argues with a straight face will encourage jobs growth by making it easier to sack people.
The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has made it clear that this bill is the start of the coalition's project to centralise industrial relations under the Commonwealth. Of course his predecessor, Peter Reith, embarked on a similar undertaking, without much success aside from the support that he obtained from the former Victorian Liberal Premier, Jeff Kennett, and many Victorian workers continue to suffer as a result. In the absence of cooperation from the states, Minister Abbott has decided to force this dramatic shift onto the nation. This approach is not conducive to good outcomes. Regulation should protect the rights of the parties to a workplace relationship, guard against exploitation, and deliver fair wages and working conditions. A regulatory regime should act as a counterweight to the power an employer has over an employee, a power imbalance inherent in most working relationships. 
The Greens are attracted to the idea of all employees having the same high standards of protection and rights under a national regulatory regime, but we cannot support this move by the coalition government because it does not deliver a unified national scheme; rather, it is a `not quite' national regime with lots of exemptions. What it does provide comes at too high a price, reducing the protection and rights of working people. That is because the government has confused long-term goals with short-term self-interest and political expediency. The government's determination to force its views on the states rather than to approach such a significant undertaking as a national IR system in the spirit of cooperation strengthens our conviction that the coalition's strategy is counterproductive. As such, the Australian Greens will be opposing this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-11,"—Thank you to all honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. I would like to sum up the debate by responding to a couple of points from other senators that should not go without response. Senator Nettle needs to fundamentally re-evaluate where the Greens are coming from on these issues. They are regarded generally by the government as being irrelevant in this place because 99.98 per cent of the time, or thereabouts, they vote with Labor and they are basically a rebadged radical Left of the Labor Party.
To say with a straight face that `the federal government should not impose something on the states against their will' is in contrast to virtually everything else they propose in virtually every other policy area. They would love to impose their views about the environment, about taxation, about social policy, about welfare policy, about education policy and about every other policy without any consultation with the states. The truth about this is that it is a measure proposed by a government that seeks not to protect the vested interests of unionised workers and their representatives but in fact to protect the rights of the whole nation and all of her citizens. If the Greens or the Labor Party senators who oppose this legislation would, instead of listening to the same old vested interests, open their other ear and their hearts to the concept of giving someone who is unemployed a chance in life, of giving someone who cannot get a job and who is not a member of a union a chance of a job, then you could take them seriously. Both the Labor Party—most of their members or many of their members—and the Greens pretend to stand in this parliament for the rights of the downtrodden, yet what they do is make sure that those downtrodden stay down.
All you have to do is read independent research. All you have to do, instead of hanging out in the trendy cappuccino strips up and down the inner suburbs of Sydney or sipping Chardonnay, is to get out and talk to a few small businesspeople who are trying to develop their businesses, which I am sure the Greens and many friends of the Greens in the Labor Party would generally regard as something that they despise. They do not like business, they do not like free enterprise, they do not like Australian companies developing and building international markets. They do not like trade and commerce. They would rather we all lived in recycled tents and did not eat anything that was packaged. That is really what they are on about, but they quite often do not have the honesty to present that to us in the way that I have starkly done so. 
If they got out, as I know you do, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, and talked to small businesspeople about the effect of Australia's unfair dismissal laws and about the effects of the industrial relations regimes that many of the state Labor administrations impose on the societies that they govern, they would know that the laws themselves are stopping thousands of people from having a chance in life, of having what many of us regard as something that you just assume and take for granted. We, as Liberals and National Party members in this coalition, would like to see that all people have that right. And what is that? To get out of bed in the morning, put on a set of clothes and go to a job and, at the end of the week, collect some pay and have the choice of buying a cappuccino if that is what they want. But a lot of these people do not have that. We have got six per cent unemployment in this country and these Lefties on the other side of the chamber will condemn that six per cent to stay there. They say, `We care about the workers.' Well, you do not. We want to create more workers. The facts are blatantly obvious but the Greens senator over there cannot see them, but not because the facts are not there to see—because you can go and talk to people across the country.
You do not even have to accept the Harding report, The effect of unfair dismissal laws on small and medium businesses, from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne, dated last year. You do not have to accept that report and the work that has gone into it; you can actually leave the cappuccino shop, leave the wine bar—the Chardonnay place—get up from your comfortable stool and walk around and talk to people. This is what Professor Harding did. Don Harding went out there and he spoke to people. Of the people he spoke to, 47.9 per cent reported that their businesses' recruitment and selection decisions are influenced by the unfair dismissal laws. Professor Harding reported changes to recruitment and selection practices, include the following: greater use of fixed term contracts in over 10 per cent of the businesses—11.6 to be exact.
Senator Nettle was talking about the casualisation of the work force and the impact of that. When an employer is so worried about the potential impact and cost of the unfair dismissal laws that they are cautious about putting on a new full-time employee, what is one of the natural reactions? Put them on as a casual. So what happens? Increased employment of casuals, rather than permanent staff, by 21.3 per cent of the businesses—a phenomenal figure.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-11,"—Before the suspension of sitting for the dinner break we were concluding the second reading debate of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002. I was drawing the attention of the Senate to the sadness of the position taken by Labor, the Greens and, from time to time but with not as great a degree of severity, the Democrats in relation to reform of unfair dismissal laws and industrial relations laws in Australia and also to the importance of industrial relations laws and the role a good workplace relations environment—not only in the workplace but also in the law, regulations and systems of justice—plays in developing a sound economy and therefore providing employment opportunities for all Australians. It is most important for those Australians—measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from time to time, averaging about six per cent—who are classified, for statistical purposes, as unemployed.
There are, of course, people behind those statistics. There are mothers and fathers who hold hopes for their teenage children, having put them through school and sometimes TAFE, and who are sad because their offspring do not have the opportunity to get a job—an opportunity, as I said before the suspension, that most of us in this building take for granted and many of us have taken for granted all our lives because we are the lucky ones. But there are lots who do not have that and they are the people I referred to before—those who get out of bed in the morning and do not have that special feeling of belonging to our society, which is felt by those people who can go to work and share the experiences of the workplace with fellow workers and have the freedom of being remunerated at the end of the week.
It is a tragedy that the majority in the Senate so often say no to opportunity and so often vote against measures in this place which offer to empower those who aspire to work, when the evidence is so stark. Unfortunately it does not matter how much evidence, either anecdotal or through the distinguished work of people such as Don Harding in the University of Melbourne report of last year, shows that this particular provision could make such a significant difference to the employment opportunities and the employment intentions of the employers. The report that I quoted prior to the suspension stated that just over one-third, in fact 33.4 per cent, of businesses reported that the existence of the unfair dismissal laws increased their business costs. The Harding report conservatively estimates that compliance with the unfair dismissal laws costs small and medium businesses $1.329 billion—that is, $1,329 million—and that figure is in table 19 on page 19 of the report. This cost impacts most heavily on businesses with 20 or fewer employees—the total estimated cost of this group being $839.912 million. That figure is on the following page of that report. That is a phenomenal cost for businesses to bear. When you think of the alternative investments to which that sort of cost can be put, you wonder at the massive unmet potential that this nation has.
In fact, our new Governor-General, in his brief words to the Senate this morning, talked about how great this nation was in terms of its people, but I picked up that he also mentioned the word `potential'. This government is dedicated to unleashing the potential of this country. The core potential of this country is actually in its citizens. It is a national disgrace that we allow six per cent of the work force to remain unemployed when we have at our fingertips the potential to give those people more opportunities whilst balancing the very important measures contained in the law to protect workers, whether unionised or non-unionised, from a boss who may seek to unfairly dismiss someone. You would think from listening to the senators opposite that we are throwing away all their rights; we are not. We are actually protecting their rights but what we are saying in this bill in particular is: let us move to a simpler and fairer system to extend our protections across the nation by moving towards a single system. Potentially, at the moment, an employer across Australia could be subject to six or seven different jurisdictions and sets of rules; under a single system, they would be subject to only two sets of rules at the very most and possibly only to one. It is a significant move. 
The bigger issue is: how long can the Labor Party, with the strong support of the radical left wing faction of the Labor Party who go out and promote themselves—and I steal one of Senator Andrew Murray's lines when he talks about truth in political advertising— have as false and misleading a title as the Greens? These are people who really are opposed to anything. They are opposed to free enterprise; they are opposed to business in virtually all its forms; they are opposed to trade and commerce across borders, which is called globalisation. They are scared of it or they do not like it because it could actually make the economy grow—and they do not like a growing economy. If the Greens had their way, along with their comrades in the Left of the Labor Party, they would actually shrink the economy and shrink living standards. That is one of their unwritten goals: they do not like an expanding economy where people have greater opportunities and where free enterprise and a liberal economy give people opportunities. They would rather shrink the economy. They call themselves the Greens because I guess they have to give themselves a title that appeals to the current political orthodoxy or to a niche that will get them just enough votes to squeeze them into a seat in the Senate. They can only call themselves the Greens because they do not actually follow pro-environmental policies.
I think the Australian Democrats, who are trying to create their own post Natasha Stott Despoja destiny, need to think very carefully about their position on some of these issues. You can in fact care about workers, care about unionised workers and support the reform of unfair dismissal laws. You can care about the environment without taking the same negative, carping antidevelopment attitudes of the Greens. The Greens entered into the realm of hypocrisy in relation to environmental policy when they supported a measure that was defeated in the Senate during our last sitting. On the last day of sitting, we put through a bill and the Greens supported a Labor amendment to effectively drive cargo off coastal shipping and onto Australian roads—in other words, increase the consumption of diesel, if you can believe this, take heavy goods off coastal shipping by taking the rebate off the diesel that gets used in coastal shipping and make coastal shipping more expensive vis-a-vis trucks on our roads. They actually voted for that.
It was one opportunity where the Greens could have thought about it for a nanosecond and said, `Hang on. Here's one thing we can vote with the government on.' It was one time when they could have wrenched themselves away from their comrades in the Labor Party and voted with the government. It was an opportunity to say, `No, Labor Party, you've got it wrong this time. We don't believe you are doing the right thing by the environment. You're actually forcing cargo off coastal shipping and onto Australian roads—chewing up roads, chewing up tyres, chewing up distillate and creating more greenhouse gas emissions.
—It's bizarre.
—I could understand Labor doing what they did, Senator McGauran, because they had to vote to support their fraternal brothers in the Maritime Union. They want to destroy coastal shipping and make sure that only ships that are flagged in Australia can run the coastal routes. You can actually understand why Labor did it. They are a wholly owned subsidiary of the union movement and, under their governance structure, effectively have to vote for the self-interest of their fraternal brothers in the Maritime Union. But the Greens say that they are here to help the environment. So we put it to them on our last sitting day here: vote for the environment, vote to ensure as much cargo as possible gets carried across the seas in ships and let us get some of the cargo off the roads and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. No, they voted the wrong way; they voted against the environment. 
The same thing occurs with the Greens' approach to forestry. When we are talking about the use of native forests for timber products, the Greens say, `No, you can't take down a single native tree—not one. What you have to do if you want to use wood is to grow it in plantations.' So they get their way in relation to banning the use of native timber in most states of Australia, and then when someone comes along and says, `I want to buy a bit of dairy farm in Tasmania to put in some plantation timber,' the Greens say no to that as well. So you start to see this pattern developing.
In Western Australia you see the Greens stopping the Ningaloo Reef proposal, with the support of the Gallop government. A few days after they stopped the proposal to develop the Ningaloo Reef and, in fact, find a way of saving the Ningaloo Reef by developing it sensitively for the environment, they moved up the coast a few hundred miles to Barrow Island and said, `You can't have any development there either.' The challenge to the Greens and to the Democrats is to find something that they actually agree with. In fact, I challenge the Greens to put a dot anywhere on the Western Australian coast showing where they would actually agree to any development at all. There's a challenge! I think my money would be pretty safe when I say that they would not put a dot anywhere.
I think that challenge links imperatively to this debate about the reform of unfair dismissal laws. If you want a good environment, if you want a healthy environment, if you want a healthy social environment and if you want a stable social environment where people have opportunities, then you need to find ways to develop Australia in an environmentally and socially sustainable way. Having unfair dismissal laws that protect the rights not only of the workers but of those who aspire to work is a vital piece of that. So I make an impassioned plea. As the Deputy President has now returned to the chamber—
—I said I'd be back.
—right on time as usual, I commend this bill to the Senate and look forward to the support of a majority of senators for what should be a historic reform that delivers opportunity to many Australians who do not have jobs.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-08-11,"—As you would expect from its title, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002 deals with the issue of the transmission of business—in other words, what happens to workers' rights and entitlements when their employer sells or otherwise passes on the business to another employer. At one level there is an elegant simplicity in the way the law deals with this issue. However, award regulation of employment together with formalised bargaining and resultant certified agreements and an increasing trend to outsourcing, contracting out and labour hire have led to recent judicial attention on the issue of transmission of business from the High Court and the Federal Court of Australia. 
From a practical and a legal perspective, there are two interrelated issues that arise for employees and employers in a transmission of business situation. First, what right does an employee have to accept or reject the transmission? Second, if the transmission is effected and the employee starts with a new employer, under what terms and conditions of employment will the employee be engaged? 
In relation to the first question, an employee's right to reject a transfer to a new employer, the classic statement in law comes from Lord Aitkin in the 1940 English case of Nokes v. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries. Lord Aitkin said:
I confess that it appears to me astonishing that apart from overriding questions of public welfare power should be given to a Court or anyone else to transfer a man without his knowledge and possibly against his will from the service of one person to the service of another. I had fancied that ingrained in the personal status of a citizen under our laws was the right to choose for himself whom he will serve: and that this right of choice constituted the main difference between a servant and a serf.
The essential distinction made in the above passage is that goods, chattels and livestock can readily be sold from one owner to another but a contract of service—a contract of employment—simply cannot be passed from one employer to another. This is because when a worker contracts to a particular employer the personal nature of that relationship requires that the worker should not be compelled, especially against his or her will, to work for another person. It is simply unfair and it affronts the dignity of workers to allow them to be shuffled between one employer and another, and more so if the conditions under which they are expected to work are in any way reduced or compromised.
But with realities of commercial life requiring that businesses pass from one owner to another it is recognised that there needs to be a fair and sensible regime that governs the right of employees in a transmission situation. Indeed, in many instances employees will work from one firm one day and another the next day without noticing much difference at all apart perhaps from the name of the enterprise or a different CEO. Under such occasions the transmission of business is just part of a vibrant and dynamic economy in action, and for the employees the transmission may be to their advantage, opening up new prospects for promotion or enhanced conditions of employment.
Returning to the first question that arises in the transmission of business situation, namely the right of an employee to accept or reject transfer from one employer to another, at common law the ruling in Nokes stands as part of Australian law. This was confirmed as recently as September 2002 by the Federal Court in the case of McCluskey v. Karagiozis. In this matter, the presiding judge, Justice Merkel, not only cited with approval passages from the Nokes case; he stated in relation to the employing bodies that they:
... appeared to have pursued their own interest in disregard of the entitlements and interest of their long serving and loyal employees by transferring the employment of the employees, and the responsibility of their entitlements to shell companies thereby treating those employees as if they were serfs, rather than free citizens entitled to choose their own employer.
This is in 2002. As can be inferred from this passage in the McCluskey case, the purported transmission of the employees' employment was ineffective for want of the employees' assent to the transfer. And, indeed, I am sure that if asked the employees in question would have given only one answer on whether they consented to being transferred from the principal asset holding entity in the business to worthless shell companies.
Herein lies the role of the common law as a real and effective protector for employees in a transmission situation. Before a business can effect a transfer of its employees to another business as part of a sale it must secure the consent of the employees affected. If the employer offers the employees appropriate guarantees as to future conditions and the security of the employees' accrued entitlements, the natural response from employees would be to accept the transfer—and then the issue is disposed of in a fair manner all around. 
On the other hand, what happens if the employees take the view that the transfer is not in their interests and they refuse to agree to it? The real prospect is that they will lose their jobs but this may also stand in the way of the employer selling or passing on the business. This then compels the parties to negotiate and reach agreement.
It should be noted that in many federal certified agreements the prospect of a transmission of business is a matter contemplated in advance by the parties, and the obligations on the employer in a transmission situation are well known ahead of the event. For example, clause 9 of the Walkers Pty Ltd certified agreement 2002 reads:
In the event of Walkers Pty Limited (the Company) business or businesses activities thereof is sold or closed leading to a transmission of business and transfer or termination of employment, the company commits to:—
(i) Identify all accrued entitlements of affected employees.
(ii) Consult with the Combined Unions regarding the impact of such a transmission of business on the accrued annual and long service leave entitlements of employees up to the date of transmission.
(iii) Consult with the parties in relation to the extent of any national employee entitlements scheme in place at the time, with a view to agreement between the parties to avail themselves of it, and/or establishing a trust fund into which such entitlements could be transferred. Such trust funds, if used, would be subject to any reasonable legal, accounting, taxation or fiduciary requirements in place at the time.
These provisions show how the parties—in this case Walkers, an engineering firm, and the relevant unions: the AMWU, the AWU, the CFMEU, the CEPU and the TWU—are capable of sorting out their own arrangements. However, under this bill the provision in the agreement I have just cited could be replaced with an order of the commission. Isn't this tantamount to the commission taking on the role of a player and not that of an umpire? Haven't we heard this phrase before, and where did it emanate from? So here is an example of the government throwing out its stated principles where it is convenient or expedient to do so.
For the sake of completeness, there are other issues that arise in the severing of an employment contract in a transmission, such as the possibility of an entitlement to redundancy pay; and, as the Federal Court recently held in the Amcor case, an entitlement to severance pay on redundancy will arise even where employees accept a transmission with continuity of service. This case turned on the natural and literal meaning assigned to the terms in the prevailing certified agreement. Again it demonstrates that, under our current system, parties to an agreement can expect to get what they agree on—but not if this bill goes through. Furthermore, what is worrying for employees is that this bill proposes that the commission have reposed in it the power and discretion to alter agreed terms on a transmission, but that power and discretion would not be guided to preserving the benefits that accrue to the employees under their agreement.
A second consideration is what conditions of employment apply to employees transferred over to a new business. Here, the existing law is designed to have a certified agreement follow the employee to the new business as long as the test set down in section 170MB is met. This test is not materially different to that found in section 149(1)(d), which deals with when award conditions of employment flow on in a transmission of business. The test that triggers a certified agreement or an award flowing over is whether the new employer is a successor, transmittee or assignee, whether immediate or not, of the whole or a part of the business concerned—that is section 170MB(1)(c). A recent High Court judgment, in the PP Consultants case, emphasised the importance of the word `business' in that phrase. It is only where the successor takes on the business or a part of the business of the transmittor that the award or agreement flows. This meant in the PP Consultants case that bank employees who transferred from a branch of the bank into the employ of a pharmacy which also carried on banking functions as an agency of the bank were not entitled to the benefit of the relevant banking award. The High Court held that the pharmacy did not carry on the business of banking, notwithstanding its bank agency function, so the award did not transmit. 
While this decision is not particularly helpful for outsourced employees, it shows that the existing laws already cater for businesses that divest functions to agencies, contractors or other service providers. Nevertheless, the current law ensures that the primary policy objective of the transmission of business provisions continues—namely, employers cannot avoid their award and agreement obligations simply by transferring their employees to a different employing entity. This means that in conventional situations such as takeovers, buy-outs and other forms of acquisition, one could with some confidence expect the transmission of business provisions to do the work they are expected to do and ensure that the award or agreement conditions of the old employer come across to the new employer.
If a successor finds the conditions of employment that come across with an acquired business objectionable or otherwise incompatible with the successor's other businesses, the successor may enter into negotiations with the employees of the newly acquired business and, if agreement is reached, the new agreement or a variation of an existing agreement can be ratified. Again, the solution to a business's problems in such circumstances lies in the principle so keenly espoused by this government—namely, agreement making between employees and employers. Recourse to the commission in such circumstances, which is what this bill provides for, is the antithesis of the government's stated approach to workplace relations. As was said before, principle is so readily discarded by this government when it impedes business getting its own way over employees and reducing their conditions.
Moreover, if one digs a little deeper into the bill, one can find another example of inconsistency in the government's proposed treatment of employee rights in a transmission of business. The bill only modifies the scheme of succession for the terms of certified agreements and, whilst consistency is one of the stated objectives, does not spread to Australian workplace agreements. Why the government has left Australian workplace agreements out of the equation is unclear, but one can draw the inference that AWAs are being given special treatment. This issue has, as I recall, been before the government for several years and no clear answer has been supplied to the Senate or to the committees that have investigated these proposals.
On the subject of AWAs generally, I can remark that, for all the government's attempts to promote AWAs, they remain unpopular, with less than two per cent of wage and salary earners on AWAs. Perhaps the government has left AWAs out of this bill because they are so rare that business has not lobbied the government to act on AWA employees. At any rate, without speculating further on the government's motives for leaving AWAs out of this bill, consideration should be given to how the exclusion of AWAs could affect labour law generally. If AWAs are to be afforded greater scope to protect an employee's agreed conditions of employment vis-a-vis collective agreements in a transmission of business, this would amount to discrimination against those who choose to bargain collectively. This principle is repugnant to Labor, and Labor will stick to its principles and give this as sufficient reason by itself to reject this bill. 
In conclusion, this bill has the potential to undermine the sanctity and certainty of certified agreements. If it is passed, workers who have bargained and reached a deal with their boss could have the boss trigger a revision of their agreement simply by assigning the business to a new employer. This is unacceptable to Labor. Workers deserve better when they reach agreements. If the prospective purchaser of a business is not attracted to the workers' existing agreement, the purchaser should reconsider the buy or negotiate a new, mutually acceptable agreement with those existing workers.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-11,"—I rise to give the Democrats' opinion on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002. Like all workplace relations matters, it is far from easy to draw a conclusion on. Transmission of business provisions have been part of workplace relations laws since 1914. At heart, the intention behind these provisions was to provide a protective mechanism for employees, but there has always been a corresponding understanding that business sales should be facilitated. Transmission of business has been the subject of lengthy litigation, and litigation clearly shows the issues are complex and they become more complex as the nature of agreements diversifies, as the nature of work circumstances diversifies and as the nature of sales agreements change. To date, by and large the courts have determined cases in a manner that has been beneficial to the employees. In that regard, a full court of the Federal Court in the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v. the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, quoting from an earlier decision, affirmed:
The first point to be made about the operation of S.149 is that it should be beneficially construed so that employers do not `avoid the settled rights of employees', see George Hudson v Australian Timber Workers Union (1923) 32 CLR 413 at 435-436, per Isaacs J. Thus, in my opinion, whether there has been succession, transmission or assignment of a business should not be approached on some narrow basis.
A recent article in Employment Law entitled `Transfer of undertaking: international comparisons'notes:
Over the last couple of years, the Federal Court has significantly expanded the operation of the transmission of business provisions. Under the new approach, a transmission of business may occur wherever there is a “transfer of work” from one employer to another. As a result, the transmission provisions could apply where there is a substantial identity of work between that performed by employees of the transmittee and that previously performed on behalf of the transmittor. Consequently, a wide range of outsourcing or contracting out situations now fall within the scope of the provisions.
The article further notes:
PP Consultants Pty Ltd v Finance Sector Union [2000] HCA 59 (16 November 2000) increased the uncertainty that has attached to these provisions. In the main judgment of a unanimous decision of the High Court of Australia, it was held that “it was not possible to formulate any general test to ascertain whether ... one employer has succeeded to the business or part of the business of another”. However, at least in relation to nongovernmental transmissions, the court stated that a comparison of the identification or characterisation of the business (or the relevant part of the business) of the former employer and business activities of the new employer is required. If these bear the same character, there would usually have been a transmission. 
It is acknowledged that this has raised further uncertainty and practical difficulties within the context of a complex industrial framework. It was the first wave of industrial relations reform by Keating and Brereton in 1993 and the second wave of the coalition-Democrats law which helped increase this complexity. It did so because it increased the number of industrial agreements and instruments which could operate outside the award system. The consequence is that transmission of business issues have become more particular and more specific to individual circumstances than was the case under the award system.
Businesses naturally want to avoid their original employees being on different wages and conditions to their newer employees in the acquired business. Awards have general application—award conditions easily transfer across businesses—so conditions for old and new workers in those circumstances are more than likely to remain the same. Certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements have specific application. Unlike awards, they are instruments determined by the parties in the business—between the employees and the employer—and are not determined through the Industrial Relations Commission. Consequently, conditions for old and new workers are as likely to be different as to be similar.
Certified agreements continue until their nominal expiry date, which is no less than three years, which means a certified agreement cannot be replaced by another certified agreement until the expiry date has passed. Therefore, on the transmission of business, the new business retains the certified agreements it takes on until their expiry date. On the other hand, one business acquiring another only has to wait out the unexpired portion of the certified agreement before negotiating a new one. Certified agreements can be terminated before their expiry date but only under specific circumstances, including where employees and/or the relevant union have agreed to the instrument being terminated and the termination is then approved by the Industrial Relations Commission.
The key change in this bill is to give the Industrial Relations Commission discretion to review the applicability of existing certified agreements in a new business without employee approval. This is the case at present with awards—as I said earlier, they are not agreements between employees and employers, but general instruments—but it is not so with certified agreements or Australian workplace agreements. It should be noted that certified agreements were regarded as awards under the Industrial Relations Act 1988; thus the transmission provisions applying to awards also applied to certified agreements. This is no longer the case under the Workplace Relations Act 1996— and I suspect it was not the case under the 1993 act, but I am not sure.
This bill has been introduced because employers have expressed concern at the possibility of meeting the obligations of a variety of employment instruments following a business acquisition. The Democrats appreciate the complexities that might arise from multiple agreements for the one work force, especially if those agreements cover performance of the same work. Here you have an odd contest. The chamber as a whole has cooperated in recent years to make the market work very effectively. Corporations Law has been changed to ensure that mergers and acquisitions proceed as easily as possible, with tax law there have been consolidation provisions and there has been general agreement overall that fluidity in business transactions should be encouraged and made easier through law. Here on the employee side there is the impediment of a time frame which, as far as I can see, is of three years or less. It is notable that within the government's bill no real attention is given to the time frames occurring within certified agreements. 
Because the concerns that have been raised have some validity, the Democrats consider this issue to be worthy of further consideration. One concern is that there is potential for a seller to offer a prospective employer a `package' of lower cost operations through the elimination of current terms of employment. Related to this point, the Australian Council of Trade Unions is concerned that `weakening an already inadequate transmission of business provision will further encourage the types of contracting out and corporate restructuring which we have seen can have such an unfair effect on employees'. The flip side of the coin is that an acquiring business has the right to reshape the new business in the manner which will produce the best outcome for it.
Affording rights to the outgoing employer to make an application to the Industrial Relations Commission about the extent to which a current certified agreement will bind a future purchaser of the business, as this bill does, will only serve to facilitate behaviours which might be regarded as contrary to employees' interests. It should be noted that providing particular rights of the outgoing employer to have a certified agreement not bind a future employer is not available under the award transmission provisions. That surprises me, might I say, where you might have a state award and a federal award circumstance.
The amendments provide no assistance to the commission in determining the relevant circumstances or grounds for making or refusing an order. Also there is no requirement that an order to set aside be subject to a no disadvantage test or some similar mechanism to ensure that, for the short period remaining within a certified agreement, employees are not disadvantaged. Where two awards have `collided' following a transmission of business, it has been the case that the superior terms have been applied. In the current bill there are no guidelines of this sort for certified agreements. I might add that, in approving a certified agreement, the Industrial Relations Commission does and can apply a no disadvantage test.
Repercussions of the proposed new provisions have been quoted elsewhere. The Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union, in its submission to the Senate committee inquiry into this bill's predecessor, stated:
Whilst some may argue that it is up to the Industrial Relations Commission to make any order and that this caveat will protect employees, it will be cold comfort to them. The fact is that the capacity will exist to remove the agreement in whole or in part. Where employees feel threatened or have little confidence in the system, the potential for industrial disputation increases exponentially.
You can understand why it would take that view. In a privatised circumstance, and it does not seem to matter what colour government is doing the privatising, typically the number of employees falls and their wages and conditions change.
Only employers are allowed to make applications; employees and/or their unions are not, which seems odd. The Australian Democrats, however, have a long tradition of supporting the Industrial Relations Commission having an independent discretion to determine industrial relations matters on their merits. What the 1996 act did—and this bill seems to go against that intention—was to try to keep the Industrial Relations Commission out of as much action between employers and employees as possible. The whole basis of the enterprise bargaining system originally introduced in Labor's 1993 bill is to ensure that employers and employees, independent of a third party, work out their own circumstances. This bill takes it back to the Industrial Relations Commission. That is not something we have a problem with, but it does seem a bit of a backtrack in government philosophy. 
I have said previously in our minority contribution to the report that discretion is never open-ended. It has long been the Democrats' view that, wherever possible, such discretion is a better guarantor of fairness and flexibility—and, of course, I am referring to the discretion of the Industrial Relations Commission. However, we do recognise that discretion can lead to uncertainty and cost until such time as orders have been made, and that is another characteristic of the transmission of business. Somebody buying a business simply does not want to wait around longer than is necessary for due diligence to ensure the transference of assets and understanding of where they are going, and the employees of course also want certainty.
It seems self-evident that the IRC should have discretion in respect of transmission of employee conditions in business acquisitions, particularly when more than one certified agreement affects `old', `transferred' and `new' employees in a business. This is an alternative to the courts, which are notoriously slow and are a notoriously blunt instrument in these circumstances. The Industrial Relations Commission needs to determine which agreement should prevail—provided, that is, that the Industrial Relations Commission continues to recognise that the intention behind the transmission of business provisions is, in the interests of fairness, to provide a protective mechanism for employees. The IRC must do this while taking into account the need to provide new or reformed businesses with necessary operational flexibility. Whether we keep the current system, which allows employees and employers to terminate the agreement in special circumstances, or whether we introduce a new provision for the Industrial Relations Commission to weigh up the repercussions for both parties does need to be determined. But where does this lead us?
It seems to lead us to this: the government are only going part way along the road. They say that applications should be made to the Industrial Relations Commission. I cannot disagree with that, as a general intent. They say that the Industrial Relations Commission should have arbitration powers—in other words, the Industrial Relations Commission should have a final decision making ability, subject to the normal appeals based on matters of fact which are available. I cannot disagree with that. The whole purpose and basis of the Industrial Relations Commission was that it should have an arbitration ability. They say that employers should have the ability to make submissions or applications. I cannot disagree with that but I would surely envisage circumstances in which unions or employees would have similar rights, because that allows maximum flexibility. 
There is the question of time. I would think that you would need to enforce a rapid process. In the case of the Corporations Law, when you are looking at the merger provisions and the takeover panels there is a speedy fast-track process which you can access. That is desirable in a transmission of business circumstance. When you are dealing with a certified agreement I am not sure you would want these provisions in the bill to operate if the certified agreement had a relatively short period still to run. Why would you want to get into this activity if—within the last year, anyway—the employees were starting to gear themselves up for renegotiating their agreements?
I have an inclination that the government are on the right track in a number of areas but I do not think, to borrow some words we were using in the earlier debate, they have `covered the field' of their intent sufficiently. I will be very interested to see how the debate stacks up and how we will be able to manage the various amendments, and the bill itself, to reach an appropriate outcome.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-08-11,"—I rise here tonight to reflect on one of Australia's newest but most popular national institutions, the National Museum of Australia. As senators will be aware, a review of the museum's performance, the National Museum of Australia Review of Exhibitions and Public Programs, was handed down recently. Therefore it is timely that I reflect on the review's findings and acknowledge what the National Museum of Australia has achieved in a relatively short period of time.
It will be forever to the credit of the government of John Howard that, after years of grandstanding by the Labor Party, it was this government that finally funded and built this important national icon, the National Museum of Australia. Indeed it was a coalition government that passed the National Museum of Australia Bill in 1980. The genesis of the vision for a national museum is widely, and rightly, regarded as the 1975 Pigott report. In articulating what a national museum should be about, the Pigott report made a comment that is worth repeating today:
The museum, where appropriate, should display controversial issues. In our view, too many museums concentrate on certainty and dogma, thereby forsaking the function of stimulating legitimate doubt and thoughtful discussion.
`Legitimate doubt and thoughtful discussion' are interesting words in the present context. Whether intentionally or otherwise, the National Museum of Australia has fulfilled this foreshadowed aspect of its mission. It has certainly stimulated passionate debate in some circles. Consider the recent diatribe of a Sydney newspaper columnist. She wrote:
You just have to look at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, built with $155 million of taxpayers' money on Howard's watch, with its sneering black armband treatment of our history, its irony overload of upside-down Hills hoists and digger statues, and its Holocaust architecture.
I do not begrudge such sentiments. Supporters of the National Museum—and I count myself in that number—welcome strong reactions to this institution. Without those sorts of reactions we might be accused of erecting nothing more than a warehouse for baubles. However, it would be a shame if this sort of rhetoric, used in the so-called culture war, distorted the image Australians have of their National Museum.
The reactions of visitors to the National Museum have been overwhelmingly positive. They have found it entertaining and engaging. The exhibitions and programs review concurred, concluding that the National Museum has established itself as a popular and significant attraction in the national capital. I note that the opposition spokesperson on the arts, Senator Lundy, has labelled the review as disappointing. She says that it advocates a `whitewashing of Australian history'. I do not think that assessment is fair; the review is a much more subtle and balanced document than that description would suggest and ought to be taken seriously, even if we might disagree with some of its findings. 
On the issue of bias, the review concluded that political or cultural bias was not a systemic problem at the National Museum but that it existed in pockets. There were elements in some exhibitions that, when taken as a whole, could be construed as characterising Europeans as the `bad guys'. I have said previously in this place that I have no truck with those who elevate Australia's shortcomings above our successes. Australia has a cohesive society that is the envy of other nations. Our values of tolerance and the fair go have given thousands of new Australians the opportunity to adjust to and to fully participate in Australian life.
We should take pride in the fact that this has occurred without the marked social upheaval and conflict evident in other nations. Yet we should acknowledge that there have been chapters in Australia's history that are, frankly, regrettable. Indeed, one of the criteria which the review panel used was the ability of the National Museum to cover so-called darker historical episodes with truthfulness, sobriety and balance. A significant proportion of Australia's darker episodes relate to the Aboriginal experience since European settlement. One aspect of this is the frontier conflict between Europeans and Aboriginals that occurred until the early 20th century. There is no doubt that this conflict occurred and that there were killings of Aboriginals. But, appropriately, there is ongoing debate on the scale of the violence and the intentions of both parties. Invariably, historical events involve differing interpretations. However, Aboriginal history is often passionately contested because it has contemporary political and cultural implications.
That was evident when the National Museum recently presented its Contested Frontiers exhibition in the First Australians gallery. It was accused at that time of being biased, demonising Europeans and being over-reliant on oral history. I might note that the review, on that issue, agreed to some extent, stating:
... where an issue is likely to attract such public debate and scrutiny, the NMA should be careful to ensure that it is backed by a wider range of sources
Nevertheless, the reaction of the National Museum to the initial criticism should be commended. In December 2001, the National Museum hosted a two-day forum that examined the frontier conflict from widely different perspectives. Speakers included the Left and Right's respective darlings on Aboriginal history, Henry Reynolds and Keith Windschuttle. It was at times a lively, emotional and uncomfortable event. It was also informative, controversial and engaging. Clearly this was an example of the National Museum delivering on Pigott's vision of an institution being able to stimulate thoughtful discussion on controversial historical issues.
The biggest criticism emanating from the review was that the National Museum lacked compelling narratives—in other words, it has not presented the Australian story in an understandable, chronological and meaningful way. It was also slated for glossing over key themes in the Australian experience. These are substantive criticisms and do deserve honest assessment and some soul-searching—responses which I have no doubt the National Museum will deliver. It will need to consider its use of technology, its collection policy and its commitment to evidence. I do not doubt that there is scope for improvement, but we should put the review into perspective. The National Museum, after all, is only 2½ years old. It is a work in progress. Despite reservations it can claim significant achievements in that 2½ years.
I also point out that the National Museum is the only museum whose role is exploring and exhibiting the history and culture of the entire Australian nation. It is supposed to appeal to diverse audiences by using contemporary and even entertaining techniques. Those are real challenges in any modern institution. We should be careful to ensure that any reforms do not compromise the National Museum's strengths. Some of its defenders have argued that the review signals a desire for the National Museum to take a more traditional and anthropological approach. They fear it would undermine the National Museum's accessibility—what we would call, perhaps, its capacity to educate by entertaining. I think that fear is ill-founded. At the National Museum's opening in March 2001, the Prime Minister said: 
What it does unusually, and I think very attractively is seek to interpret the history of our nation. Not only in terms of events and objects but also in terms of the life experience of people from different backgrounds ...
	...	...	...
But importantly, it represents a quite different way of presenting the history and culture of a nation. 
It is the contemporary and, you might even say, lowbrow and sometimes irreverent style of the museum that has made it such a hit with its more than one million visitors, particularly schoolchildren.
I see a great irony in the position taken by certain critics of the National Museum. I am referring to the commentators who promote themselves as defenders of mainstream or middle Australian values. These people have been scathing of some cultural institutions, accusing them of being pockets of political correctness and having a sneering contempt for the lifestyles and preferences of the majority. Yet in the National Museum of Australia we have an institution that is overwhelmingly popular with the general public—there is no doubt about that whatsoever. Above all, the National Museum retains a capacity to be insightful of the Australian character and experience.
My assessment of the National Museum is that it is an inspired and vital element in the notion of a national capital. Its capacity to be fairly criticised in no way detracts from the good job it is doing, and yet it complements and confirms that role. Even at the tender age of 2½, its value to Australian society is difficult to overstate. I extend my congratulations to the staff of the National Museum of Australia and its Director, Dawn Casey, for achieving so much in the first 2½ years of its existence. The National Museum adds to the national capital's reputation as a repository of the finest examples of this nation's achievement and innovation.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Museum of Australia</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-08-11," asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 1 November 2002:
(1)	What action has the Royal Australian Navy taken to address the significant shortfall of pilots, seaman officers, weapons electrical aircraft engineers, electronic technicians and marine technicians that existed as at 1 July 2001.
(2)	How many pilots, seaman officers, weapons electrical aircraft engineers, electronic technicians and marine technicians have been newly recruited to the Royal Australian Navy since 1 July 2001.
(3)	How many pilots, seaman officers, weapons electrical aircraft engineers, electronic technicians and marine technicians have separated from the Royal Australian Navy since 1 July 2001 (can the information on separations be broken down to show the length of service of those personnel that separated from the Royal Australian Navy).
(4)	Does the Royal Australian Navy conduct exit surveys as a means of determining why personnel with specialist skills are separating from the Royal Australian Navy; if so, what do the findings of these surveys show; if not, why not.
(5)	What is the current strength of pilots, seaman officers, weapons electrical aircraft engineers, electronic technicians and marine technicians at navy bases.
(6)	What is the required strength of pilots, seaman officers, weapons electrical aircraft engineers, electronic technicians and marine technicians at navy bases.
(7)	What action is the Royal Australian Navy taking to overcome the ongoing shortage of pilots, seaman officers, weapons electrical aircraft engineers, electronic technicians and marine technicians.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Royal Australian Navy</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,26,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-11,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	The Royal Australian Navy has undertaken considerable effort to identify and rectify problems in these areas.
Pilots. A project has been established to provide the required number of qualified pilots and observers by mid 2013 through a ten-year ramp-up program. The Navy Capability Management Committee recently considered a paper that details a three pronged approach (short-term retention, mid term loans and transfers, and long term rectification of systemic issues).
Seaman Officers. Significant activity is underway to address the shortfall of Seaman officers including addressing workforce requirements, training throughput and retention issues. A recruiting campaign targeted specifically at Seaman Officers resulted in a significant increase of recruiting, achieving 86% of the original target.
Weapons Electrical Aircraft Engineers. Weapons Electrical Aircraft Engineers are the subject of a number of activities, including the introduction of an “Interim Retention Allowance”, continuing professional development programs and the introduction a recognition program as a “Chartered Professional Engineer” with the Australian Institute of Engineers.
Electronic Technicians. The Electronic Technician workforce structure was critically examined with the result of a modest reduction of the workforce requirement, thus effectively reducing the shortfall. Recruiting targets have been set at maximum training capacity levels and a focussed recruiting campaign has produced significant improvements in the achievement rate.
Marine Technicians. In mid 2001, Marine Technicians (MT) were surveyed to identify their reasons for separation or an intention to separate. A working group was established to implement recommendations and to further identify policy and management action that will improve the retention of MTs. The MT recruiting campaign has achieved excellent results with a near 100% achievement of targets now occurring.

(4)	The Royal Australian Navy conducts voluntary exit surveys. The most recent data available, which was collected during the period January-December 2001, contains 5 respondents from the Seaman Officer qualification, 34 respondents from the Electronic Technician category and 40 respondents from the Marine Technician category. There were no respondents from the Pilot or Weapons Electrical Aircraft Engineer Officer qualifications, so it is not possible to provide reasons for leaving information for the January-December 2001 period for these two trades.
The top five reasons for separation were:
Seaman Officers: (Based on 5 respondents which equates to 5% of those who separated in 2001. All 5 respondents were females which may account for the significant difference between the reasons listed and those of the wider Navy community which are reflected in the Electronic and Marine Technician reasons).
·	personal experience of other types of unacceptable behaviour;
·	lack of control over life;
·	poor leadership by my immediate supervisor; 
·	conflict with superiors; and
·	sea service obligation.
Electronic Technicians: (Based on 34 respondents or 20% of those who separated in 2001).
·	desire for less separation from family;
·	little reward for what could be considered overtime in the civilian community;
·	desire to stay in one place;
·	better career prospects outside; and
·	lack of recognition for work done.
Marine Technicians: (Based on 40 respondents or 19% of those who separated in 2001).
·	desire for less separation from family;
·	insufficient equipment or resources to do my job;
·	to make a career change while still young enough;
·	little reward for what could be considered overtime in the civilian community; and
·	lack of recognition for work done.

Pilots. The short-term plan (1-3 years) is focussed on retention management including re entry and the use of Reserves. All pilots or observers considering discharge are counselled by a senior Aviation manager. A comprehensive on line survey was recently conducted to determine the retention profile of all pilots and observers. An environmental scan of the helicopter pilot and observer job opportunities market, local, regional and globally, for the short, medium and long-term, will soon be undertaken in conjunction with the Army by a commercial company to more fully understand the threat to Pilot and Observer retention. Information obtained will be used to determine what further (if any) short-term retention measures may be required, noting the present maturing of the pilot and observer financial retention incentives.
Seaman Officers. The RAN is undertaking a number of actions to address the significant shortfall of Seaman Officers. These actions include:
·	a senior officer has been appointed as Head of Surface Warfare Community to improve Warfare officer and sailor management. A Seaman Officer Management Plan is being implemented;
·	improved Seaman Officer recruiting material and maximum Seaman Officer recruiting targets; 
·	changes to the structure of Seaman Officer training to motivate officers and increase pass rates; and
·	the development of a Principal Warfare Officer Retention Allowance to improve Navy's retention of that section of the Seaman Officer community.
Weapons Electrical Aircraft Engineers. Although there are shortages remaining predominantly at the rank of Lieutenant, there are now sufficient trainees coming through the ranks to resolve the shortfalls within the next four years. Improvements to career structures and remuneration will reduce the likelihood of future shortfalls.
Electronic Technicians. ET workforce structural review is ongoing with the aim of optimising the workforce resource. This applies to both sea going and shore positions. 
·	recruiting targets are being closely managed and the recruiting organisation remains focussed on maximising target achievement;
·	the length of initial training for ET sailors is considered too long and results in sailors not commencing a full time sea going billet until over two years has elapsed since joining. This is a de-motivator and is being addressed through a revision of the initial training packages; and
·	ET work practices are being altered to make the trade more attractive and rewarding and thus improving retention.
Marine Technicians. MT sailors have a similar initial training time problem as that experienced by ET sailors. The MT initial training packages is being restructured accordingly. In addition:
·	Navy is implementing changes to engineering watch keeping practices to significantly reduce the machinery watch keeping requirement, thereby releasing MTs at sea to concentrate on tasks that require maintenance and trade/technical skills. This is being positively received in the workplace and should improve job satisfaction and retention;
·	the ANZAC Ship MT workforce arrangements are being modified to create a sustainable workforce structure that meets the maintenance requirement. This initiative is aimed at improving work practice, job satisfaction and retention. It also reduces the MT manning liability to sustain ANZACs by 445 positions; and
·	selected ships will trial a significantly reduced engineering duty watch requirement alongside in their homeport over the Christmas leave period. If successful the new routine will be permanently implemented to allow personnel to spend more time with their families whilst in their homeport.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Royal Australian Navy</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,26,1,answer
