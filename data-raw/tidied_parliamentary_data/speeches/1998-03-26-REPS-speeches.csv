Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,N/A,1998-03-26,"—My attention has been drawn to the alterations proposed by Senate amendments 10 and 11. I understand that the alteration in amendment 10 will extend the scope of a definition in the bill. One result would apparently be that some taxpayers will have tax deductions and other benefits disallowed, so that they would be liable to pay more tax. Amendment 11 is consequential. It appears that both of these alterations were prepared and circulated in the Senate as requests rather than amendments. This reflected advice received by the government in terms of compliance with the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution.
Following a statement by the chairman of committees in the Senate, these alterations were, however, treated as amendments. On their face, the alterations fail the test proposed by our legal and constitutional affairs committee as to the type of amendments open to the Senate—the committee referred, inter alia, to a request being required where an alteration moved in the Senate will make an increase in the total tax payable legally possible. I note, however, that the supplementary explanatory memorandum presented stated:
The amendments to the bill will not affect the financial impact outlined in paragraph 1.45 of the explanatory memorandum to the bill.
Matters such as these often raise difficult questions of interpretation. Having drawn attention to this matter, I acknowledge the House may choose not to take any objection and proceed to consider the Senate amendments. On this occasion the House may wish to follow that course.
Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith.

That the amendments be agreed to.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Evans, Gareth, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—There are a variety of amendments here which have been made, essentially, to cover drafting errors and technical matters. None of them are opposed by the opposition.
I take this opportunity, however, to draw attention to one amendment to the legislation that has not been accomplished in our process in either house and which certainly ought to have been—that is, to deal with the absolutely unacceptable expanded exemption to the trafficking in trust loss legislation which is contained in this bill and which has been the subject of previous controversy.
The Labor Party's bill, as originally introduced in 1995 to cover the problem of trafficking in trust losses, did, as a significant concession to family business situations, enable the beneficiary of a family trust carrying a loss to inject into that trust income obtained from other sources and to apply it against the trust loss which that beneficiary would otherwise have to bear, for tax saving purposes.
Treasury and the tax office at the time did explicitly advise Treasurer Willis that this concession was already very generous and should certainly not extend to any further exemption. The version of the legislation, however, brought forward belatedly by the present Treasurer (Mr Costello) does include a further exemption which makes it possible for a very wide range of extended family members who are not already beneficiaries of the trust to themselves inject income to apply against a trust loss to avoid tax.
For example, a non-beneficiary as remote as a wife's grandmother or a niece's husband who wants to avoid paying tax on, say, $200,000 of property income can inject that amount into the relevant family trust, write off the income against any loss up to that value being carried by that trust and then have the $200,000 distributed back tax free. This particular exemption is a classic rorters' 
 paradise. Our estimate, on the information available to us, is that the cost to revenue of allowing this enhanced exemption is measurable at least in tens of millions of dollars.
We asked a number of questions about this publicly and in the parliament during the passage of the legislation. We did not get answers to any of them. But, in a spirit of optimism, encouraged by the actual presence in the chamber on this occasion, unusually, of the Treasurer himself, I ask the questions again. What public policy justification, if any, was there for this expanded exemption, given the obvious scope for its use in tax avoidance by high-wealth families? Did up to 19 members of his front bench who have family trusts stand to benefit from this expanded exemption? Did the present Treasurer have the same negative advice from Treasury and the tax office as Labor did about any expanded exemptions for loss trafficking in family trusts? With whom did the Treasurer or his staff discuss the expanded exemption? In particular, were representatives of high-wealth individuals now being investigated by the tax office involved in those discussions? Why did the Treasurer mislead the House on several occasions by misstating, as he did, the effect of Labor's 1995 legislation, in particular refusing to acknowledge that our legislation did not allow non-beneficiaries to inject income for tax avoidance purposes? What was the precise estimated cost to revenue of this expanded exemption as compared with what would otherwise have been brought in by a properly crafted legislative package?
The truth of the matter is that here, as on so many other matters, the Treasurer talks big, claims that there are major problems in the tax system which need redress and talks endlessly about fairness, but when he has an opportunity right in front of him to correct an anomaly or not to create new ones, to actually genuinely ensure that a piece of anti-tax avoidance legislation has a genuinely anti-avoidance character and does not become a birthday party for a whole new category of avoiders, he throws it away. I think he continues to have a great deal to answer for in relation to this legislation. I invite him to give those answers right now.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I happen to be here this morning, as you know, to introduce the biggest shake-up of the Australian financial sector probably in two decades. I was not aware that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) was going to try this stunt. Seeing as I am here, I will respond to his stunt. It will not take very long.
This is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who is engaged on this little stunt because yesterday he said that he discovered yesterday Australia had a tax problem. The basis on which he says he discovered yesterday that Australia had a tax problem was the release by the Australian Taxation Office of statistics about the growth in the number of trusts between 1991 and 1995.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is it in order for the Treasurer to mislead this House by misquoting and incompletely quoting my statement yesterday, which was that we had a tax problem in relation to the scale of creation of new trusts, not more generally?
—There is no point of order.
—There is no point of order, and you know it. Yesterday you said you had discovered that there was a problem on the basis of statistics that were released about the growth in the number of trusts between 1991-92 and 1995-96—a period during the whole of which, with the exception of March 1996 to June 1996, you were in government; a period during the whole of which, apart from those three months, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was the finance minister; a period during the whole of which you had the capacity, if you were genuinely worried about that, to do something about it; but a period during the whole of which you did nothing.
Gratuitously, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition discovered yesterday, on the basis of his own failure, a problem. What you discovered yesterday, the honourable member for Holt, is evidence, according to you, of your own default and failure. You come in here in relation to these amendments, which 
 bear no wit of relation to what you have just addressed, and try to sneak around this issue and put false and misleading slurs upon the government.
The truth of the matter is this: this was the government that legislated to prevent trafficking in trust losses. The measures that were always intended were to prevent trafficking in trust losses. They were not to prevent those people who had legitimately incurred losses being able to offset those losses against income, as would be the case for an individual.
Let me go through it. If you as an individual incur a loss on some part of your income and you make a profit on another, you set off the profit against the loss and you pay on the balance. It is an obvious principle of tax collection. You do not have to pay tax on the profit and disregard the loss. If you made a loss on your rental property and you made a gain on your share trading, as an individual you can set the profits and the loss off and you pay tax on the balance. The same should apply in relation to a trust. The amendments that you speak of were applied in relation to a trust. So if a family group had losses and income, it could offset them. It is an obvious point and a point which, if you had turned your mind to it, would have been agreed from the outset.
The second point which you conveniently and repeatedly overlooked was that the changes we made actually tighten the definition of family. In your speech you referred to a wife's grandfather. What you omit to say is that we narrowed the definition of family because under Labor Party proposals you would have included great-grandparents and great-grandchildren and a far wider class of person than is allowed by this current legislation.
The proof is in the estimates. When the changes were made, the actual revenue estimates provided by the Treasury were for increased collection. To stand up here and say that this could in some way harm the revenue, when it produced an increased collection, is entirely false.
The amendments that have come back here this morning from the Senate are accepted by 
 the government. The legislation should be allowed to be put into place. It is good legislation, and the government fully supports it.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Evans, Gareth, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—Without unduly prolonging this debate, I wish to make three brief points in reply. First, it is true that the government's present legislation does slightly narrow the definition of family of an individual as compared with the original Labor bill, although that definition is still extraordinarily wide, extending, as it does, to wife's grandmothers and nieces, husbands and so on.
—Why didn't you narrow it?
—The point, Treasurer, is this: under the Labor legislation, no member of the family group, however defined, could inject income into a trust for tax saving purposes unless he or she was already a beneficiary. That is the big difference. You had to be already a beneficiary under our definition. If you were a beneficiary, the second point I make, as the Treasurer said—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I refer to standing order 81. There were some comments made from both sides of the House initially in relation to this matter. The present comments bear no relevance at all to the matter currently before the House. I invite you to rule the present comments out of order so that we can return to the terms of the matter before the House.
—Order! The question before the House deals with 24 amendments made by the Senate. Perusal of those makes it very difficult for me to adjudge how relevant the debate has been so far. I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer, if he so feels inclined, will try to contain themselves within the narrow parameters for this most unexpected debate.
—I propose to keep quite squarely within the parameters you have just identified, Mr Deputy Speaker. If I had not been interrupted, I would have already sat down by now. I do not propose to make any further interventions, but I just want to correct the record on this.
It is the case that it is perfectly appropriate as an ordinary principle of tax law that you should be able to set off your, in effect, profit against your losses. We did make provision in our legislation to enable someone who already was a beneficiary of a family trust carrying a loss to inject into that trust income obtained from other sources to apply it against the trust loss for tax saving purposes. We accepted the principle, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said. It was pretty generous—deliberately generous—but we certainly did not accept the further generosity involved in allowing non-beneficiaries to leap into the act for purposes that could not be described other than for tax avoidance.
The final point I quickly make is about the revenue implications of this. The Treasurer says again today, as he has previously, that these trust loss bills as a whole—and I am talking now about the bills before us and the actual language before us—will bring in more revenue than Labor's legislation, suggesting that there is no loss to legislation possibly arising from this exemption of his. There is no rort.
What the Treasurer ignores now, as he has in the past, is that the problem of trafficking has grown very dramatically in the past two or three years and that his revenue gain would be larger still if he cracked down on this particular exemption. What is involved here is extra revenue that would clearly have been obtainable being forgone with this particular enhanced and absolutely indefensible exemption. My case rests.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are allowing the debate to go wide, I will reply to each of the points. The first point is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) says that the definition is narrower than the Labor Party wanted but is too wide. What a proposition! It is narrower than the Labor Party wanted but still too wide. You merely have to state the proposition to realise how bizarre the claim is. It is too wide, even though we narrowed it on what the Labor Party wanted. It is really a false proposition and hardly worth replying to in the House of Representatives.
The second point he makes—I do not know whether he understands it or whether it is an attempt to make a trick point—is that non-beneficiaries can now inject income into trusts. He means to say that a family can inject income into the trust if that income is another trust income, but it still has to be the family. You still have to have the same family. If the same family has income in another family trust, that trust can inject into the loss trust, or if it has it in some other mechanism.
It is true that the original proposal only allowed it for individuals. That is why it was wrong. Let us take the family that has one trust conducting one business and another conducting the other. It should be able to set off the income against the loss, just as an individual should be able to set the income off against the loss. It is a point that you have never been able to grasp, regardless of the structure.
If the family is conducting two businesses, or even one business, through two entities, you should be able to group the losses and the income. That is entirely what the legislation does. If you had thought about it for a moment instead of trying to make these cheap, ignorant points, you would have conceded it.
The third point is in relation to the income and the revenue. When the revenues were announced as a measure—that is, a change on a previous policy—the effect of the change was to increase the revenue take. That is what we always do in budgets in relation to measures. It is the conclusive answer to this totally fabricated and weak point.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Evans, Gareth, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—The Treasurer (Mr Costello) is being irredeemably obtuse. I do not think it is capable for me to educate him further in the time available. I make the point again that he has not answered any of the questions I have put to him, including in particular the question as to whether the tax office gave him the advice on which he is now relying in bringing this legislation forward. I have abandoned the unequal task of trying to educate and civilise him, so I suggest we move on.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Evans, Gareth, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—This International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998  comes before us as a very direct result of the Asian economic crisis. Were it not for that crisis we would not be debating it today. That crisis is already having a profound impact on the Australian economy and will certainly dominate economic developments both domestically and internationally over at least the next year—probably rather longer than that. The wider political and social as well as economic repercussions of this are going to be felt for many years not only in the Asian region in general but also certainly in this country. This bill provides us with an overdue opportunity to debate all these things, and I will come back to them.
The particular purpose of the bill is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to enable a framework to be put in place for Australia to provide financial assistance to a country that is undertaking an economic adjustment program with the support of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF. In the first place, it makes specific, in effect retrospective, provision for appropriations to fulfil Australia's pledges of financial assistance that have already been given to South Korea and Indonesia last year. These pledges involve loans or currency swaps of up to $US1 billion for both countries.
The bill does not specifically mention the third contribution that Australia has announced, that is, the currency swap, also of 
 $US1 billion, that has been negotiated for Thailand through the Reserve Bank of Australia. That is not in the bill because it will not involve an appropriation from consolidated revenue. It is, rather, an inter-bank arrangement.
The bill is also significant because it provides a framework for future Australian financial assistance in support of IMF programs in as yet unknown and unanticipated situations. It provides what is in effect a standing appropriation to enable the government to supply this assistance from the consolidated revenue fund. While it is expected that such assistance will only be required in very rare and exceptional circumstances, this legislation could eventually involve quite significant future appropriations. I make it clear at the outset that the Labor opposition supports this bill, just as we supported the announcement by the government of Australia's participation in the programs for Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
IMF-sponsored adjustment programs of this kind are vital to restore confidence and stability in countries experiencing financial crisis. It is particularly important that Australia participates in these packages when they relate to countries in our region or countries with whom we have strong economic links. We certainly support the government's action in ensuring that Australia is in fact the only country beside Japan to have participated in each one of the three IMF-sponsored packages for our Asian neighbours.
When so much else has gone wrong in Australia's relations with our region over the last two years under this government, it was very important for us to re-establish our credentials in the region; and this coming to the assistance of our neighbours has certainly helped to do that. As Paul Keating, a former Prime Minister, said in his very interesting speech—which I will refer to again—to the University of New South Wales:
Some of the old brigade obviously think Asia's recent economic problems mean that Australia can heave a sigh of relief and head for the safety of old friends and familiar geography.
He goes on to say:
This is dangerous nonsense . . . Australian engagement with Asia is not a temporary enthusiasm.
. . .              . . .             . . .
If we know anything about dealing with Asia it is the importance of building relationships for the long term. That is the business Australia needs to be in now.
The extent to which this particular willingness to come forward with these loans and currency swaps is an example of exactly the kind of commitment we ought to be continuing to make to the region. There is no question but that we in the opposition give this wholehearted bipartisan support.
I should also say that we agree with those parts of the bill which refer not just backwards to what has happened so far in Asia but which do provide an explicit framework for Australian participation in future IMF-sponsored adjustment programs, not necessarily confined to our own region—in this context, building in a capacity for a standing appropriation allowing the Treasurer to make the relevant loans or currency swaps. It certainly does not seem appropriate to us that pressure be put on the Reserve Bank to assume the responsibility for managing Australia's contribution in these circumstances when the decisions involved are essentially those of the executive government.
In explaining and justifying these contributions to the Australian public it is important for us all to make clear that the bill does not provide in any way for grants or donations in support of these programs but rather for loans which must be repaid in the future. Either it is a matter of the currency swap running its course and us getting back into our own reserves the US dollars or other international currencies that have been swapped for Thai baht, or it is a matter of the loans being repaid in such a way as to immunise them from any currency changes that may have occurred in the meanwhile, with an appropriate interest component for the opportunity cost of the particular loan.
Short, then, of complete financial catastrophe in the countries in question making it impossible for them to repay the loan or to give back the relevant currency entitlement, there is every reason to anticipate that there 
 will be no financial risk and no financial loss at all. You cannot remove every possible element of risk from these situations because, by definition, we are talking about situations of economic and financial crisis, but I certainly am confident, and I think all of those who have participated in this enterprise from the government are confident, that Australia will not suffer in any way financially from coming forward in the way that we have on these occasions and that we can be similarly reasonably confident about the future.
The bill does contain some conditions that have to be satisfied before these arrangements or agreements are entered into. The Treasurer can only agree to provide Australian assistance if at least one other country or international organisation is participating or has agreed to participate in the program. In addition, the Treasurer can only agree to provide assistance to a recipient country at the IMF's request. The bill also requires that any agreement by the Treasurer on behalf of Australia must allow Australia to demand early repayment in the event of the suspension or premature termination of the fund program. All of those, in our judgment, are appropriate conditions.
There is one obvious deficiency, however, in the bill in its present form, that is, it does not impose any explicit disclosure or accountability requirements on the Treasurer of the government of the day. While this may be unlikely in practice, the bill would, in its present terms, allow the Treasurer to commit very substantial amounts of public money to an IMF program without making any public statement at all about that assistance. More seriously, the bill would allow the Treasurer to commit substantial sums of taxpayers' money to such a program without having to justify or explain his decision to the parliament.
The lack of explicit provisions requiring the Treasurer to publicly announce the size of any loan or currency swap under the bill and the reasons why it is in Australia's national interest is a clear shortcoming in the bill as it is presently drafted. So the opposition will be moving amendments to this bill, which I think have already been circulated. They will 
 require the Treasurer to issue a public statement detailing the terms of any currency swap or loan to be provided in support of an IMF sponsored program in as much detail as is practicable, given the realities of international confidential negotiations. That statement should provide reasons why this assistance is in Australia's national interest, in particular taking into account our foreign policy, trade and economic interests.
The particular national interest statement to be tabled in the parliament in this respect is also required by our amendments to be referred to the Statutory Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and report. That is just a further means to ensure that there will be proper scrutiny and proper accountability but, hopefully, always delivered in a responsible way.
The opposition believes these are important amendments. The government has given some indication that it may be prepared to accept them and we hope very much that that will be the case.
There are three important general issues thrown up by this legislation which do need to be debated: the nature, causes and course of the Asian economic crisis itself; the question about the role of the IMF and the international monetary system in reacting to the crisis; and the question of the domestic impact of the crisis in Australia. I want to say a few things about each of those issues.
As far as the crisis itself is concerned, there is no doubt that it is of spectacular magnitude. It is certainly Asia's worst crisis in three decades. On an international scale, the speed and magnitude of the contagion effect of the crisis from country to country has really been unprecedented. Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, the very influential Vice Minister for International Relations of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, has described it as really the first crisis of global capitalism. That is, I think, an apt description of the scale of the problem that we are now witnessing.
In terms of analysing the causes of it, a great deal has been written, some of the best analysis of the situation coming from our own Reserve Bank in the papers that have been delivered by Governor Ian Macfarlane and 
 Deputy Governor Stephen Grenville. There are, of course, a legion of other commentaries and analyses around the place, including a particularly useful presentation I heard from Saul Eslake, the Chief Economist of the ANZ Bank. In what I say now I will draw quickly on a variety of those sources, in particular Mr Eslake because he does seem to me to summarise very succinctly my own understanding derived from wide reading, travel in the region and talking to many people about what has been going on.
The point to understand at the outset in terms of appreciating the causes of this crisis is that they were really very different from those of earlier developing country crises, which have not been unusual. We did not have here, driving the crisis and being the fundamental cause of it, public sector profligacy. Certainly that was a partial element in the equation but, overwhelmingly, the crisis was driven by developments in the private sector and in the institutional and regulatory structure of government bearing upon private sector activity.
There were what can now be seen in retrospect as excessive levels of investment in the sense that very little attention was being paid to potential profitability, creating a massive oversupply of investment product, particularly building. There were excessive levels of private sector debt being accumulated, resulting either from so-called directed lending or from inadequate supervision and regulation of the financial systems of the countries in question. There were certainly inappropriate exchange rate regimes in place—fixed relationships between the local currency and the US dollar, which tended to foster a boom-bust economic cycle through a tie in first instance of the fall and then the rise in the US dollar against the yen. But, more particularly, what was encouraged by those fixed rates and people's belief that they would be maintained come what may was a massive accumulation of unhedged foreign exchange borrowings.
There was a search around the region for higher yielding alternatives to low United States and Japanese interest rates which sucked in a lot of lenders who should perhaps have been a bit more cautious. There was 
 certainly an insufficiently critical scrutiny both inside and outside the region of the character of the Asian economic performance in the 1990s and, in particular, the extent to which it was being fuelled by unsustainable levels of unhedged borrowing for poorly risk evaluated projects.
In understanding what is actually going on in general terms, I think it can be said that the Asian crisis will pass through four phases. The first one, which we have seen unfolding before us, is that of financial market meltdown with some dramatic overshooting on the downside being very much part of that—a very unhappy part of it. Secondly, we have seen the beginnings of the policy response and the external account correction that is a crucial component of that response—higher interest rates, tighter budgetary policy, the establishment of machinery and procedures for financial system rehabilitation, and the slowing down of the economy very sharply in response to these contractionary and tightening measures, leading to a lapse into actual recession, with the current account moving into surplus, remarkably rapidly in a couple of cases, as imports in fact collapse in response to those developments internally which I have just described.
The third stage, which we have not yet seen but we all hope we will see pretty soon, is that of sustainable external account improvement through a recovery in exports, through a resumption of voluntary private capital inflows, through domestic activity still remaining weak enough not to be sucking in a great heap of imports and with inflation and interest rates beginning to decline.
The final stage, which we all look for with enormous hope and hope will be achieved sooner rather than later, is a recovery in domestic economic activity in the countries in question with the recapitalisation of the financial system and a recovery in consumption and investment.
Even if it is the case—and it is arguable that this is now so in the region, particularly so far as Korea and Thailand are concerned—that the worst of the financial crisis has passed, the economic effects—the real economy effects as distinct from the financial 
 economy effects—are still to be fully felt. There are a great deal of corporate bankruptcies still occurring, restructuring going on with consequent employment losses and declines in capital expenditure. There is a significant destruction of wealth occurring through asset price deflation and losses of personal savings. There are interruptions to economic activity through lack of access to credit or trade finance. There is an obvious erosion of purchasing power going on through increased inflation and unemployment, and a number of government policy changes are also having their negative effects on the real economy, including higher interest rates, tax increases, reductions in subsidies and the deferral or cancellation of infrastructure projects.
There is still a lot of downside risk, it also has to be acknowledged, for the Asian financial markets and economies. Whatever is going on by way of recovery could be turned around again by breakdowns in relationships with the IMF—and it is a particularly acute concern for Indonesia. A further devaluation by China is something that would be alarming if it were to occur. Frankly, I think the jury is still out on whether some of that will occur—if not sooner, perhaps in the last quarter, or the first quarter of next year—in response to an erosion of China's competitive position with some South-East Asian economies, which is being vigorously denied by Chinese leaders and officials. But, as I say, there is a degree of scepticism about whether that position can be maintained.
Violent political and social unrest is a potential problem in a number of countries, particularly Indonesia. A continued policy failure in Japan to be unwilling to give the kind of fiscal stimulus the whole region needs, as well as the domestic Japanese economy, can contribute to some further downsides ahead. Also—and this is one of the many points that is articulated by Mr Eslake—a protectionist backlash in Western economies cannot be ruled out which, if it occurred, would seriously exacerbate the global impact of all of this.
The overall picture is a disconcerting one when you pull it apart and look at the causes 
 and the likely course of future events. The current situation, I repeat, has pretty much stabilised in Thailand and Korea, very much as a result, I think, of democratic institutions proving robust and resilient, much more so than might have been expected. We just have to cross our fingers and hope that that will continue.
The other Asian economies have so far been dealing with the situation reasonably well. Although there is lower economic growth in the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, there is quite a bit of domestic cleaning up still to occur in Malaysia in its economic response to what is going on, and there is the situation in China I have described where we are all holding our breath as to whether or not devaluation can be avoided.
Most of the uncertainties are concentrated and focused on Indonesia at the moment, with a very real doubt in just about everyone's minds as to how events are going to unfold. One scenario is that the IMF reforms are in fact implemented in a way that satisfies everybody and we get a reasonably rapid stabilisation of the situation, as has occurred in Thailand and Korea in that context, with the IMF activity being matched by an equally concentrated effort by private sector banking institutions and other creditors to work together to get rollovers of the private debt, which is one of the biggest problems in Indonesia at the moment.
The other scenario is that doubts persist about Indonesia's capacity or willingness to follow the IMF prescriptions, and there is continued total erosion of international confidence and a continued destabilisation of the internal economy as a result of the failure of the external situation to stabilise, leading to inflation, food shortages and all the rest of the negative effects of unemployment and so on in the real economy worsening with the consequences, all too unhappily real, of rioting and major civil breakdown.
The situation is nothing like as intrinsically serious as it was in 1965 when there was massive poverty, massive inflation and a massive political confrontation between right and left also going on as a backdrop to the 
 chaos that did then eventuate. To that extent, those who say, like Paul Keating, that this is not a case again of a revisiting of the so-called year of living dangerously may well be right—and I certainly hope they are—but it is a volatile and very dangerous situation, and anyone who tries to trivialise or downplay the potential consequences of it is I think misreading the situation.
One of the biggest issues thrown up by the situation in Indonesia and also thrown up generally by a recent course of events has been the response of the IMF and, indeed, the whole international monetary system to the crisis. We have had a pretty lively debate going on about the way in which the IMF has in fact handled itself and the situation. There have been two kinds of criticism essentially of the IMF's role. One that was more current in the earlier stages of the crisis was that we saw from the IMF nothing much more than the old one size fits all approach, in which the IMF reacted to the Asian crisis in exactly the same way in which it had reacted to many other developing monetary crises in the past and saw it as essentially a situation of public sector profligacy and a situation to be addressed as a result by imposing the usual set of IMF strictures with redressing big, exploding, ballooning current account deficits and high inflation environments by contractionary measures. There was a lot of that in the initial IMF reaction requirement of budget surpluses being achieved and so on in situations where to do so rapidly was going to have an accelerating, negative impact on the capacity of the domestic economy to cope.
I think the current criticism is less in those terms than of a different kind—that is, the IMF, in its current round of packages that it is requiring people to sign up to, is overdoing the emphasis on structural and institutional reform, overdoing the micromanagement of the patient economies in a way that would be absolutely unacceptable in dealing with a crisis anywhere else and which really is requiring not only an economic revolution but also in some cases a political revolution to occur.
The arguments here are really quite finely balanced. Those of us—and I am among 
 them—who have had a lot of reservations about the overreach of IMF programs and demands, particularly in Indonesia, do of course also frankly acknowledge that there are many structural and institutional problems that remain to be addressed, having at their heart the problem of crony capitalism, excessive influence from high places and so on and having a lot to do with an absence of transparency, accountability and basic democratic process in the political system.
The trouble is that you also have to temper your recognition that there are these problems—and they are problems that need to be addressed, certainly for the long haul—with a recognition that the reaction to too robust an attempt to impose solutions is likely to be counterproductive. Certainly, when it is accompanied by the kind of arms folding performance we had from Michel Camdessus at the time of the signing of the IMF treaty, you create a situation where the strictures, sensible as they may be in terms of getting the economy right for the long haul, are not likely to be capable of actual implementation and do in fact undermine the capacity of the international community to see the stabilisation of the currency and access to foreign capital restored. So it is a matter of achieving the balance between, on the one hand, taking the steps which are in fact necessary to maintain a flow of foreign funds by recapturing the confidence of the international financial markets and investors and at the same time not acting in a way that is counterproductive.
The IMF has certainly had a pretty rough and tough record over the years. I remember vividly talking to the then Hungarian foreign minister Gyula Horn in 1989 when he was on the receiving end of a very tough IMF restructuring package. He said to me, `I have a very wistful dream that one of these days Michel Camdessus will be coming towards me on a red carpet on his knees begging me to bail out the IMF from its particular current economic crisis.' That is a reaction, of course, that one hears from many people around the world who have been on the receiving end of these strictures. The task is to somehow steer a course through all this that will in fact 
 recognise the necessity for these bailout operations to occur and recognise the necessity for the IMF to preserve its credibility but not to operate in a way that is ultimately counterproductive.
I did want to mention in passing one other major policy issue in international finance that is being generated by this crisis and the international financial system's contributions to its causes as well as to its solution, and that is the renewed debate about the scope of the Tobin tax. I would like to incorporate in Hansard if that were permissible—I have discussed it with Hansard and they say it is technically possible—a two-page document which is quite difficult and complex in its layout and certainly much too long and complex to read into the record. I would hope that I might have permission to incorporate that.
Leave granted.
—I think that will be a useful contribution to the debate. Finally, I wanted to say a few words about the impact of all this on our own country and our own economy. This is really an issue for a longer debate on another occasion, but just let me make some very quick points by way of conclusion. The first thing to say is that the economic impact on us in general terms is going to be big. The estimates from most commentators is an order of magnitude of around one per cent off our GDP directly attributable to the crisis.
There is some very interesting analysis around the place, including a piece by Stephen Kirchner in the Australian Financial Review last week, suggesting that, given that the United States analysts are saying the impact on the US economy will be of the same order of magnitude and given that the US economy is much less trade exposed to Asia than we are, with only around three per cent of that economy being directly exposed as compared with some 12 per cent of the Australian economy, maybe there is a significant underestimate of the impact upon us.
Certainly we are already seeing the impacts beginning to accumulate in a collapse in tourist numbers, a dramatic decline in live cattle exports, falling world commodity prices 
 in response to the Asian crisis and reduced demand for Australian university education by Asian students. We have seen the car industry already being affected with Mitsubishi requiring 3,000 of its factory workers in Adelaide to take annual leave for a couple of weeks in order to reduce production of cars or car parts destined for the Asian market. No government could ever possibly have anticipated this crisis, its nature and magnitude. Of course, it is a problem for any government in dealing with it.
I simply make the point in conclusion, however, that for the present Australian government to claim as it is that it has acted brilliantly over the last two years to insulate the Australian economy from the impact of this crisis is simply hogwash. The truth of the matter is that unemployment remains a massive problem for us, with a growth in both youth and long-term unemployment. We have had a rise in the current account deficit even before the Asian crisis hit. We have had a rise in foreign debt similarly. We have had an average rate of economic growth of just three per cent compared with the average 4½ before we left office.
We have got a manifest decline now in both business and consumer confidence, developing at a very rapid rate. That is a product of a recognition by the business and consuming community that we simply have not got the kind of insulation of the Australian economy that would protect us from these further downside effects.

—Before I call the next speaker, I will say to the honourable deputy leader that the document cannot be incorporated as it does not fall within the Speaker's requirements and guidelines.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—The shock waves from the Asian financial crisis have served to reinforce what has become obvious in recent decades; that is, that the increasing interdependence of economies in the region, in addition to bringing obvious benefits to the country, also increases our vulnerability and brings with it increasing levels of responsibility.
The  International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998  establishes the framework for the provision of financial assistance by Australia in conjunction with the IMF and other countries to provide assistance for adjustment programs in the threatened economies. The bill is significant in relation to Australia's participation in the IMF packages for Korea and Indonesia, and follow on a package already put in place for Thailand. It provides balance of payments support to the recipient countries to restore market confidence and to try to prevent exchange rate volatility in those countries.
The legislation involves amendments to the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to enable the government to act swiftly in providing support for countries in receipt of financial assistance from the IMF. Under the bill the Treasurer can, in response to requests from the IMF for assistance, make an appropriate response to countries in need. This provides for an appropriation from the budget, compared with the package put together for Thailand recently that came from the Reserve Bank.
There has been considerable misunderstanding and distortion in some sections of the community about the nature of Australia's assistance to Asia in this current crisis. These misunderstandings need to be addressed. Two things need to be said. Firstly, this assistance is not a give-away. Australia is not simply throwing billions of dollars of taxpayers' money into Asia, as some would have us believe. Nor, on the other hand, does it come out of the current aid budget. This package does not detract from our other aid programs.
These packages—both the one already put in place and the potential under this bill for others—will consist of loans or currency swaps; not grants, not donations, not gifts. For example, the rescue package for Thailand to which Australia contributed in August 1997 pledged Australia to a currency swap between the Reserve Bank and the Bank of Thailand. The Reserve Bank provided US dollars to the Bank of Thailand in exchange for the Thai baht, with a predetermined exchange rate to unwind the swap at renewable six-monthly periods until completion date.
Furthermore, the return to the Reserve Bank is equal in that case to the prevailing US Treasury bond rate. The bill will enable Treasury to make loans or similar currency swap arrangements. It does not allow for simple grants. Thus, the bill does not allow action which will impose any direct cost on Australian taxpayers. To the contrary, it provides the opportunity to earn some income as part of the process of providing much needed assistance to the region.
Secondly, the bill does not expose Australian taxpayers to undue risk. As the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) pointed out, obviously there is risk in assisting countries in need, but there is no undue risk or excessive risk entailed in this legislation. Any currency swaps or loans come with government guarantees and without significant exchange rate risk.
Australia, furthermore, is not out on a limb on its own. It is part of an international effort. Any assistance under this legislation must be part of an IMF package involving other countries, and Australia will participate only where such an IMF package is in place. This ensures not only a productive outcome for the recipient country but the means by which Australia can be repaid at some future time. Furthermore, any agreement must allow Australia to withdraw and require repayment if the IMF program is suspended or terminated prematurely.
This bill and the associated rescue packages provide two important roles for Australia. Firstly, it is an avenue for responsible involvement in the region. This is what we would expect from a leader in the region, as Australia is. It would be grossly irresponsible, on the other hand, for any international citizen to ignore a crisis on its doorstep, particularly considering the potentially grave social and political fallout which may result from financial and economic collapse.
Secondly, this bill is a matter of significant self-interest to Australia since the Asia-Pacific region contains our largest export markets. It is clearly in our interests to protect these markets by doing whatever we can to restore financial and economic stability to the region and maintain social and political stability.
Some figures might illustrate the point. Thailand now takes $1.7 billion of Australian exports, which is up from $1.2 billion just four years ago. Indonesia now takes $3.3 billion of Australian exports dollars a year, which is up from $1.7 billion four years earlier. South Korea, our second biggest export market, takes $7.1 billion worth of Australian exports a year, which is up from just $3.9 billion four years earlier. Japan, of course, our largest export market, accounts for over $16 billion of exports a year.
Clearly, it would be suicidal for Australia to allow total financial collapse in the region; the effect on our exports would be devastating. Virtually every region around the country would feel the impact, if such a collapse occurred. As it is, we are certainly feeling some impact.
My electorate of Macquarie is no exception to this. My electorate is very dependent on tourism, and the crisis in Asia has led to a significant downturn in inbound tourism figures. We have seen already a reduction of 40 per cent from Indonesia, a reduction of 30 per cent from Thailand, and a reduction of a remarkable 75 per cent of South Korean tourists. This must affect Australia's tourist industry. In fact, the hospitality industry in my electorate is so heavily based on tourism that it is one of my electorate's largest employers.
Almost 2,000 jobs in the Blue Mountains are in the core hospitality industry, with more in the Hawkesbury. In the mountains alone, there are nearly 5,000 jobs in over 680 businesses which provide services directly to visitors at some time. The Blue Mountains Tourist Authority figures indicate a decline of 20,000 visitations in February of this year compared with last years figures—although there are other factors that have contributed to that downturn. A number of local operators report declines of 30 to 40 per cent in their inbound market from Asia. For those who are very dependent on this part of the market, the impact has been significant. One or two operators who have specialised in catering for the South Korean visitors have seen their visitor numbers absolutely decimated.
Fortunately, anecdotal evidence is that inbound tourist numbers from Europe and North America are beginning to show signs of picking up. Timely and appropriate assistance to our prime export markets is a matter of self-preservation. Tourism provides 11.7 per cent of our GDP, 13.3 per cent of our exports, and employs 694,000 people. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that Australia does whatever it can to protect these South-East Asian markets, and to protect the viability of the Asian economies. Certainly, it is appropriate that the Australian government does whatever it can to assist the Australian tourist industry.
While we are talking about the impact, or the potential impact, of the Asian crisis on Australia, however, it is worthwhile noting that it could have been far worse. It is worth repeating again what has been patently obvious: had the coalition government not taken action to strengthen the fundamentals of the Australian economy, the fallout on Australia would have been far worse than it has. It is not good enough for the member for Holt to stand there and try to deny the obvious facts; the fallout would have been far worse.
The currency collapse of the threatened Asian economy should be a clear warning to everyone. From the 1996 average to January 1998, the Malaysian ringgit has depreciated by 47 per cent against the Australian dollar, the Thai bhat has lost 73 per cent, the South Korean wan has fallen by 75 per cent, and the Indonesian rupiah has fallen through the floor losing a massive 203 per cent against the Australian dollar. South Korea and Indonesia have experienced stock market collapse, widespread financial losses and bankruptcies, and massive falls in living standards—especially in Indonesia. Further, the tightening of monetary and fiscal policies, as part of their restructuring packages, will also create significant short-term hardship.
Had our economic fundamentals not been so strong, the financial markets would have brutally sold down the Australian dollar. The results would have been accelerating inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and economic slowdown. It is not good enough for the members of the opposition to deny this 
 fact. I will just refer to a comment in the Sydney Morning Herald by that paper's financial commentator, Max Walsh, on 3 February this year. He states:
. . . there is no doubt that Treasurer Costello's policy of winding back the fiscal deficit has been a major contributing factor to Australia's immunity from the direct financial contagion which has swept through the region to our north. The economy is certainly much more fireproof than would have been the case had a Labor government been returned at the last election.
There it is, in black and white, in simple terms that even the opposition can understand. Yet it is evident that Labor has not learnt its lesson from this. I follow up with a comment—
—Very briefly.
—very briefly, from Mr Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin . He states:
Whatever else can be said about the draft platform Kim Beazley and his shadow treasurer, Gareth Evans, took to Hobart, fiscal rectitude was not one of its more glaringly obvious characteristics.
Again, if the Australian economy had not been growing so strongly, if we had not had such high levels of private sector investment, if consumer confidence and spending had not been so high, if interest rates had not been so low, our ability to cope with this impact would have been far, far worse.
In conclusion, firstly, it is essential that Australia is able to respond quickly as part of an international package to help countries in crisis, as we have done with Thailand and as we have committed ourselves to doing in Indonesia and South Korea. The bill before the House provides the framework for this to happen. Secondly, it is in Australia's best interests to do whatever we can to ensure social, political and economic stability in the region. Thirdly, the message is clear: responsible economic management, as we have seen from this government, is a necessity—not a luxury, as the opposition would have us believe.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Willis, Ralph, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I rise to support the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill, with the amendments as indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). 
 I recall that in our last two or three years in office we were, on a number of occasions, required or requested to provide some balance of payment support to Papua New Guinea. This occurred through the Reserve Bank on one or two occasions. Then finally in 1995, when the amount was in the order of some $70 million, coming on top of previous support, it was decided that this should be done through the budget, and it was done through the Advance to the Minister for Finance.
What we are now dealing with in the context of the Asian economic crisis is much bigger balance of payments support. Clearly, there is a need for a structure for handling that, which this bill does by providing standing approval for such support so long as it is part of an IMF package. Such can be either a loan or a currency swap, both of which have been utilised in the three packages to which we are committed to this stage. 
The amounts of assistance which have been contained in these packages to which Australia has contributed—and our contribution to them—has certainly been large: $US1 billion to Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia. That is very big money, altogether about $A4½ billion—almost one per cent of our GDP. This is substantial assistance, but so too is the problem to which these packages are addressed. What this support relates to is, quite simply, one of the greatest financial crises in world history. Extraordinary devaluations have occurred in these countries: in South Korea and Thailand it is about 50 per cent and in Indonesia it is about 75 per cent. They are earth shatteringly large.
Devaluations of these dimensions have extremely damaging effects on these countries. Obviously it makes their imports far more expensive. So it gives a major impetus to inflation. In Indonesia, which had virtually no inflation before the devaluation, just last month there was a 12 per cent increase in prices, an annual rate of inflation already of 31 per cent, and obviously it is going to go far, far higher.
Monetary policy is tightened to control inflation or, more correctly, to prevent development of hyperinflation. Although interest 
 rates in these countries were already high, they have been tightened much further. The credit squeeze inevitably means downward pressure on economic activity which brings increased business failures, reduced economic growth, rapidly rising unemployment and falling real incomes. In addition, the massive devaluation makes foreign debt servicing and repayment vastly more expensive if debt is denominated in foreign currency, as was the case generally in these countries.
The borrowers of these funds—mostly local companies and banks—are faced with the impossibility of servicing such loans after the devaluation, let alone repaying them. As a consequence, many companies and financial institutions are technically bankrupt because they cannot meet their repayments or servicing obligations. The total outcome, therefore, is one of rapid reversal from strong economic growth, which in all these cases has continued for 30 years or so. These have been key elements of the East Asian economic miracle. What we have seen instead of that is a quick reversion to falling GDP, rapidly rising unemployment, soaring bankruptcies, exploding prices and general economic mayhem.
How did all this happen? Not because these countries had poor economic fundamentals. Economic growth had been strong, yet inflation was low in these countries generally, budget deficits were low, current account deficits were relatively low. In South Korea they have been averaging around two per cent of GDP in the last decade and in Indonesia around 3 per cent. Certainly Thailand had moved up to eight per cent of GDP, which is getting rather high, but not exceptionally high for the region. In fact, for a couple of decades or so Singapore ran a current account deficit of some 10 per cent of GDP. Everyone thought that was okay. It was part of the East Asian economic miracle.
There are a number of contributing factors which seem to me to account for these extraordinary developments. Firstly, there is the system of fixed exchange rates in all three of these countries—that is, fixed to the US dollar—which automatically caused these countries currencies to appreciate heavily as the US dollar appreciated, particularly against 
 the yen. Exports slowed and current accounts started to increase. Secondly, there was a massive amount of short-term capital inflow into these countries attracted by growth but also by high interest rates. In 1995 they had $40 billion, in 1996 they had $100 billion and in 1997, instead of an inflow of those sorts of dimensions, they had an outflow of $12 billion.
What these amounts mean for the five South-East Asian countries in trouble—Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines—is that they had capital inflows of eight per cent of GDP in 1996 and a capital outflow of two per cent of GDP in 1997; a total hitting of the brick wall in this context of 10 per cent of GDP turnaround. Why such a turnaround? I would suggest because of the increasing realisation by lenders that short-term capital inflow exceeded the reserves of these countries. Once doubts were raised by some deterioration in reserves as currency appreciated, it became a race to get out before there were no reserves left. This was not a rational approach. It is what the head of the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States, Dr Greenspan, has described as nothing more than `visceral engulfing fear'. It certainly has nothing to do with the economic fundamentals.
Thirdly, there was the unstable banking and financial systems. This was brought about by lax bank lending practices and poor prudential regulation. Once the edifice began to crumble with the devaluations and tighter monetary policy, bank bad loans began to soar. Non-performing loans in Thailand are about 30 per cent of all bank loans compared to about one per cent in this country and about 20 per cent in Korea and Indonesia. These numbers could become much higher as the economic crunch intensifies. Another contributing factor is seen to be overinvestment—certainly in dubious projects such as real estate developments but also in key export industries. For instance, in South Korea where the chaebols, the conglomerate bodies which predominate in that country, have heavily overinvested in steel and cars which had been made less competitive by the appreciating won and also by 
 world overcapacity. Now the chaebols generally are in a disastrous state.
In all of this one must also take into account the role of the IMF. All of the previous factors that I have mentioned—the fixed exchange rates, the large short-term capital inflows and outflows, the unstable financial systems and the overinvestment—explain why these countries quickly fell into major problems once the ball started to roll. Why did it start rolling, particularly outside Thailand, which was the only country with a balance of payments problem?
What is now patently obvious is that it was the IMF's policy of moving Thailand on to a fluctuating exchange rate which sparked an uncontrollable market panic. The Thai baht promptly plummeted once it was untied, and then a contagion effect occurred for South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, and the Philippines to a lesser extent, which were in a similar situation. What is now clear is that no-one—including the countries themselves, the IMF, the G7—was prepared for what happened when the Thai baht was untied.
More worrying still, this episode shows that no-one around the world really understands how to effectively handle an international financial system in which about $1 trillion a day in capital flows moves around. That is about twice Australia's GDP moving around the world each day, or the whole of the United States GDP moving around in one week. These are fantastically enormous capital flows which happen instantaneously through modern technology. The size of those amounts and the speed with which they can move has meant that a whole new development has occurred which, frankly, the economists of this world and the economic controlling bodies, like the International Monetary Fund, simply have not caught up with.
The IMF absolutely shares this ignorance of how to deal with this. There is a definite feel that the IMF, having unleashed the contagion in the first place, is now reacting blindly by prescribing cure-alls that are the standard prescription for different circumstances. That is, it is giving prescriptions for the old type of balance of payments problem, where countries had run lax budgetary and monetary 
 policies, run up big current account deficits and had a balance of payments crisis. They certainly could come in and prescribe tighter budgetary and monetary policies in that situation because it all made sense. But that is not what happened here.
Basic economic policies have been good. Yet, in the face of severe devaluations which will clearly cause enormous economic pain, the IMF is prescribing more economic pain through tighter monetary policy which is designed to control inflation—it is understandable to do that—and is insisting that tight budgetary policies are maintained. For instance, in the face of its mammoth devaluation, Indonesia was required by the IMF to keep its budget deficit to no more than one per cent of GDP—this in the face of an economy going through the floor and the forecast escalating for what percentage of GDP will be lost in 1998. Yet the budget deficit is to be no more than one per cent of GDP.
Given Indonesia's economy is likely to shrink by several per cent this year, tough measures will have to be taken to achieve such a budget outcome, including at IMF insistence eliminating food subsidies by April. This is at a time when Indonesia is short of food because of the El Nino drought effects and has to import a lot of rice, which at the devalued rate of the rupiah has become vastly more expensive. On top of that, the IMF says that they should scrap food subsidies, making food even dearer at a time when people are losing their jobs by the millions and real incomes are being slashed. This is not only socially uncaring and perverse but also politically insensitive since no government is likely to be able to carry out such a policy.
Certainly the IMF has recently shown some willingness to modify its package in this area, which is welcome. Also, the actions of the Australian government in requesting the IMF to take a softer line are certainly commendable. But how much change the IMF will agree to is not at all clear. It is strongly being criticised for the extraordinary detail of the conditionality that it has attached to its agreements to provide balance of payments support. 
It is not just a rescue package; in the case of Indonesia in particular it is an exercise in economic and political engineering. Much of the measures which they are insisting on desirably address issues that need to be taken up eventually—for instance, the end of crony capitalism and the breaking up of marketing monopolies—but these are not first-order issues to be resolved in a crisis, especially as they are politically difficult to do. If they are not done, the government is seen to be failing to implement the IMF package, which further damages foreign investor confidence and so keeps the value of the currency down. Of course, the most important thing of all is to get the currency up. Measures like this, which almost guarantee that the currency will be kept down, are terribly self-defeating.
As I have said, the really important issue at this time is to stabilise the currency: to stop capital outflow and get capital inflow if possible. This requires restoration of confidence. It cannot be achieved by setting the bar impossibly high.
The IMF is also open to criticism for not addressing the key issue of the moment—indeed, making it worse—and that is the banking and debt crisis in these countries. There is nothing in the IMF packages to address debt rescheduling, without which there will be massive bankruptcies in these countries. In 1997 Korea had 17,000 bankruptcies; this year, an estimated 50,000 bankruptcies. The companies with foreign loans are already in major trouble, since they cannot repay them after devaluation, as are banks and financial institutions.
The tough budgetary and monetary policy being pursued by the IMF is exacerbating this problem. For instance, bank loans to real estate projects are becoming bad loans as those projects collapse; shaky loans to domestic businesses are becoming bad loans as these businesses face higher interest rates and declining demand for their products. Thus the banking systems are becoming more and more unviable. The failure of banks and companies means that bad loans for foreign lenders increase. This is especially important for Japan, which is a major lender to the region. 
 It lends something like $300 billion to the region.
The Japanese banking system itself already has massive bad loans of around $1 trillion—about twice our GDP. Now it is estimated that another $150 billion of bad loans is going to Japan out of East Asia. At long last, the Japanese government has accepted that it needs to bail out its banking system. It has pledged several hundred billion dollars to do that, including by buying real estate, which is the cause of a lot of bad bank loans. Until Japan gets its banking problem fixed, it is unlikely that it will get its economy going again.
In the meantime, Japan seems to be sliding back into recession after sputtering signs of recovery from its long period of recession and minimal growth since the early 1990s. So Japan will not be playing a role in the immediate future, or the foreseeable future, in helping to drag East Asia out of its problems by sucking in lots of imports from the region. On the contrary, the only strong part of the Japanese economy appears to be its exports sector, which is just what the rest of the world does not need.
The US is calling on Japan to boost its domestic demand by a stimulatory budget package of $65 billion to $80 billion, but Japan has already had stimulatory packages since the early 1990s worth a staggering ¥77 trillion or about $A880 billion—about 1¾ times our GDP—which were to no avail because, as they blow out the budget deficit, the Japanese people seem to save more. Maybe Japan should concentrate on bailing out its banking industry, and then at least with that fixed it will have a sound basis for economic recourse.
The failure of the IMF to address the banking bad loans problem in the countries to whose rescue it has supposedly come and its previous actions in making the banking crisis worse have been the subject of intense criticism by a number of highly respected international economists, both academic and market based, such as Jeffrey Sacks of Harvard University, Ken Courtice of the Deutsche Bank based in Tokyo, David Hale of the Zurich Group based in Chicago and Paul 
 Krugman, an American academic economist who uniquely predicted the end of the Asian economic miracle. All these respected international economists, and many more, are of the view that the IMF has blundered badly in its approach.
It is small wonder that the Indonesian government, faced with such a dramatic turnaround in its fortunes and loss overnight of so much of the economic progress it meticulously achieved over three decades, is acting somewhat erratically, looking around for cure-alls like the currency board, flirting with that and then dropping it, announcing a tax a few days ago on foreign exchange and then dropping it two days later and sacking the minister for finance and the governor of the Central Bank. Obviously, they are having immense difficulty in trying to cope, but who can blame President Suharto when so much has happened that is undeserved? Those who are insisting on so many changes as the price of balance of payments support are politically and socially insensitive and, arguably, not applying a prescription that is suitable to the problem.
So what should be done from here? I would say that the IMF should back off on Indonesia regarding the extent and timing of a package and, in particular, soften its impact on the ordinary people of Indonesia. Secondly, there should be a major emphasis on getting a debt rescheduling exercise going in these countries, especially Indonesia. This could include an agreement to swap debt into equity, so relieving enterprises from debt servicing and repayment obligations. I understand that there are some movements that way in Korea. Japan should be encouraged to solve its banking crisis as soon as possible and deregulate its economy more and be more receptive to imports. Unless something along these lines happens, there will be the prospect of a real meltdown in East Asia.
There will be a chance for a major reassessment of policy and for developed countries to discuss these issues at a meeting in April called by President Clinton and at the IMF half-yearly meeting which usually takes place in April in Washington. What is also needed, however, is a discussion of the capacity of the 
 international monetary system to be prevented from producing extreme outcomes which have little to do with the economic fundamentals. This has now become a major issue of our time. There is no control over the outcomes produced by the international monetary system; it is panic reaction even by bodies like the IMF who are supposed to have the answers, and probably, as I have argued, the wrong approach has been taken.
We need to consider what can be done to prevent the recurrence of the sorts of outcomes that we have just witnessed in East Asia and to ensure that we have a more stable international monetary system. Doing that, in the context of the enormous movements of capital inflows, is a massive challenge to the world, but it is one which we must overcome if we want to have a stable economic environment in the future.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Southcott, Andrew, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—In speaking to the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 , there are several points that I think need to be made in this parliament and need to be disseminated throughout Australia. The first point is that, with respect to the packages, the currency swap with Thailand and the possible loans to Indonesia and South Korea are loans or currency swaps and not development assistance. They are not aid; they are loans on which we will receive interest and they are loans which are required to be paid back at some time in the future. The second point to make—and this rebuts some of the information that has been disseminated by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the member for Moore (Mr Filing)—is that these loans are in Australia's national interest and have helped Australia's standing in the region by being the only country, along with Japan, to have actually contributed to all three packages in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand.
The third point to make is that during the Asian firestorm the pressure on the Australian dollar would have been much greater had this government not done its job of repairing and reducing the budget. When we came in in March 1996, the budget deficit was $8 billion. That was later revised up to $10.5 billion. The budget which will be delivered in May 
 this year should show a surplus. The member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) mentioned the comments of Max Walsh in the Sydney Morning Herald. Max Walsh, speaking at a seminar of the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, reiterated the same point and that was: if we had still had a budget deficit of the order of $8 billion to $10 billion, then the pressure on the Australian dollar would have been much greater. You would have seen the Australian dollar dropping to the 1985-86 banana republic sorts of levels.
The second point to make is that almost every measure that this Commonwealth government has taken to reduce and repair the budget was opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party, in the area of health, for example, has opposed over $6 billion of budget spending. Had Labor been in government, we would be seeing an Australian dollar much lower than it is now, and that means that inflation would be much higher and interest rates would be much higher, with a high budget deficit.
In moving to the packages, the first package that was announced of $1.2 billion with Thailand is a currency swap agreement. This means that the Reserve Bank will give US dollars to the Bank of Thailand in exchange for baht. It will be at a set exchange rate and it has to be paid back at a set exchange rate. The exchange rate risk is borne by Thailand, and the interest paid is equal to the US Treasury bond rate.
The point to make is that this is not $1.2 billion that we are giving to Thailand; this is a loan. The risk is the sovereign risk; that is, of a country defaulting—which is quite unusual. In Indonesia, the package is that Australia has offered up to $1 billion. That support is conditional on the implementation of the IMF program and it needs to be repaid at the conclusion of the program. It also comes into effect only if the IMF funds are not enough. It is the same in South Korea; we have offered up to $US1 billion but the supplementation of the IMF resources will be required only if external circumstances change and the IMF package is not enough. That is the point to make: these three packages are 
 loans, they are not aid. They are not development assistance and they are in Australia's interest.
Australia does have an important role to play in the IMF rescue packages because Australia has more people studying Indonesian than any other Western country. It has more Indonesian scholars, not only on a per capita basis but also on a total basis. In Europe and North America, Indonesia often does not even rate a blip on the radar screen. As a consequence, we do have a greater understanding of Indonesia and we can act as an intermediary in terms of helping the interests of Indonesia.
Looking around East Asia, there are remarkable differences between the countries. Japan, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) mentioned, has been flat for five or six years—there is still an ongoing banking crisis in Japan. More importantly, the interventionist industry model has prevented the Japanese economy from taking off. The Japanese economy now has a prime interest rate of 0.5 per cent but the interventionist industry model, the MITI, which is so beloved by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has contributed to the Japanese economy staying flat.
In Singapore there is a sound economic policy. The open economy is being seen, rather like Australia's, as a relatively safe haven. Similarly with Taiwan, which has had ongoing economic reform since the late 1950s and a period of political liberalisation as well. In Malaysia it is a different picture. Banking, agriculture and manufacturing are all strong but there has been a misallocation there in real estate and infrastructure.
Indonesia does have problems with the interventionist industry model and we have to reflect on the fact that the Labor Party's industry model is an interventionist one. The Labor Party, two years ago, was saying that their great inspiration was the MITI of Japan. That was the sort of industry policy that they wanted to apply to Australia. It is the sort of industry policy which has got many of these East Asian countries into a lot of trouble. Paul Krugman in Foreign Affairs first highlighted this back in 1994 in an article on the myth of 
 the Asian miracle. In Australia, 22.9 per cent of our GDP is in trade and 34.5 per cent of this trade is with Asian newly industrialised and developing economies. So Australia is more exposed due to the importance of trade with Asia. That is why it is in our interests to see these economies recover some confidence in their currency.
In the bill it is acknowledged that it is important that Australia does not act alone and that it acts in response to the IMF packages. The bill also avoids any problem of moral hazard by saying that we will be doing it only if it is part of an IMF program and we reserve the right not to contribute if the IMF program is not implemented. There is no cost to the taxpayers here, but there is interest income based on the US Treasury bond rate, which is to offset the risk. The point to make again is that this is not aid; this is a loan. Regarding Australia's budget position, it has been the government's fiscal consolidation over the last two years which has fireproofed the Australian economy from the Asian firestorm.
Turning very briefly to Indonesia: in Indonesia, the key issue is the stabilising of the exchange rate. As the previous speaker mentioned, if you were to have the same fall in the exchange rate in Australia, we would have an Australian dollar at about US13c. What we need to see in Indonesia is a return of market confidence, a return of confidence in the exchange rate. That will not occur without banking reforms and without financial sector reform. These transactions under the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998  will provide balance of payments support to the recipient country. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—We have been told that we have only a limited amount of time to speak on the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998  so I will not be able to canvass all of the issues that I want to canvass in relation to this bill. Let me commend to everyone in this place the speech by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) because I think that speech was extraordinary in that it covered a broad brush 
 of the economic background and the causes and effects which have bought us to this point in relation to the problems of the Asian countries, especially Indonesia, Thailand and Korea.
I think it is important that all members understand some of the background in relation to this and that we have a debate in this place about issues concerning globalisation. Essentially, what has happened is that there has been an impact on these economies of the globalisation of economy generally. This phenomenon of globalisation, the way in which controls by the nation state are very difficult to put into place and economic forces have become dramatic in their power vis-a-vis the political power of the state to do anything about it, is an issue which is going to be perhaps the paramount issue for consideration by parliamentarians and governments in the 21st century. Unless we come to grips with this phenomenon in some way, we are going to find many international crises impacting on us.
In the case of the Indonesian economy, one might have thought a government as powerful and as ruthless as the government of Indonesia would have been in a position to actually protect itself from the difficulties which have been created. But the fact of the matter is that the values of the currencies of different nations are now outside the control of governments. Even the plan by President Suharto to bring in some kind of currency board to control the currency and deal with the current crisis has been pooh-poohed around the world as ludicrous. The reason for that is not that it would have been thought ludicrous 20 years ago but that now, with the force of the market—especially the money markets around the world, what they can do with currencies, the values of currencies and, as the member for Gellibrand pointed out, the amazing amounts of money being shifted around the world every day—it obviously has a huge impact on all economies, especially on economies, such as the Indonesian economy, which are vulnerable.
In that situation, Australia was faced with a choice. The choice was: do we assist Indonesia, do we assist Thailand, do we assist 
 South Korea—our key Asian neighbours—by giving them repayable loans that could be used to help in this crisis situation? I believe that the decision to give these countries loans was a correct one. I think we have an obligation to do something about the problems of these regions for ourselves. But we also have an obligation, as I said at the beginning, to examine what is actually happening in relation to the International Monetary Fund and its role from two aspects: first, its role in the stabilisation of Indonesia and the other countries; and, second, its role and the role of the G7 countries in the stabilisation of the world's monetary systems.
One of the problems we have at the moment is that, ever since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement in relation to international finance and exchange rates, we do not really have a solid basis for the values of currencies. A lot of it depends on the behaviour of the marketplace. But, as many commentators have shown, the money markets can move around in ways which are independent of production, the value of labour and the value of resources. In other words, it can be a totally subjective matter.
There is a lot of talk these days about the overvaluation of shares throughout the world vis-a-vis the real value or some concept of the real value of goods and services. We may have to face a crisis internationally before these matters are resolved. Hopefully not, but I might say that there is quite a lot of theory and empirical evidence which suggests that we might.
Recently, I spoke with a gentleman who came to Australia, Hans-Peter Martin. He wrote a book called The global trap where he argues that we are moving towards a global crisis, especially in relation to the behaviour of the multinational corporations and other powerful economic instruments which are far beyond what many small nation states can control.
The situation is not dissimilar to what existed last century before the real development of the power of the nation state. What we had then was a situation in which economic movement, industrialisation and all sorts of powerful forces were unleashed and the state 
 did not know what to do or how to handle these. The market went ahead and crises of a massive social nature occurred until the nation state was strengthened, the welfare state came in, Keynesian economics was introduced as a way of handling these issues and redistribution was brought in as a way of helping the poorer sector.
Many people are now saying that we are facing a similar situation internationally with the creation of huge groups of poor people who are left out of the globalisation and economic process—people who cannot participate in the whole information technology revolution, people who do not have the skills or the access. These people will become poorer and will have to be looked after. If they are not looked after, crises on an international scale will occur.
People are talking about the consequences for Indonesia. People are saying that Indonesia is facing the creation of massive poverty as a result of this huge devaluation. Because food prices have increased dramatically, many people will be lucky, if they have a job, to earn enough to feed themselves let alone be able to purchase goods and services. In this situation where the possibility of starvation is being faced, it is very important that the International Monetary Fund's programs be directed towards resolving that sort of problem.
We in the opposition have said that we support the view that the IMF should tailor its package in Indonesia to take account of these social questions, especially the questions of poverty, food shortages, starvation and the like. Unless the IMF actually ensures that its package and the measures it wants to put in place take account of this, we could be facing a situation of serious rebellion in Indonesia. I do not think that rebellion would necessarily be a bad thing in this sense.
I believe that the fundamental element that is preventing the Indonesian package being put into place is the refusal of the government of Indonesia to move towards greater meaningful democracy and a legal basis for its system, especially its economic system. We should contrast what has happened there with what has happened with South Korea, where 
 the new President, Kim Dae-jung, has been able to move the IMF reforms along. That is because we have seen the actual democratic change in South Korea with the election of Kim Dae-jung. We have seen democracy at work, we have seen more accountability and we have seen more of a legal basis for the economic processes. Unless you have that as a minimum condition, it is going to be very difficult to stabilise the Indonesian economy.
I believe that we should support this package but we should also support democratic movements in Indonesia. We should ensure that, as a result of what we are doing to assist the Indonesian people, we make it clear to the government of Indonesia that we are doing this for the Indonesian people and we want to assist the Indonesian people and, indeed, the government of Indonesia but we also want to see more democratic reforms and more action in relation to human rights. I wanted to say more about a number of other aspects of this matter. I will take that opportunity at another time because I have run out of time.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,1998-03-26,"—During the second half of 1997 three Asian countries in our region suffered severe economic crises: Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The International Monetary Fund has offered direct assistance in conjunction with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The International Monetary Fund has also requested that Australia and other Asian countries offer support. In return, the IMF has requested extensive adjustment programs in each country.
The support that Australia has given has varied for each of these countries: in Thailand, a currency swap; and in Indonesia and South Korea, repayable loans. I will go into a little more detail about the manner in which assistance from Australia has been given, the response that has been received to Australia's very swift reaction and also the effect it has had, specifically on exporting industries in my region. I would like to deal very briefly with the amendment moved by the member for Holt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans).
—Order! I simply point out to the 
 honourable member that, whilst an amendment has been foreshadowed, it has not actually been moved.
—Thank you for your sound advice, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Holt has referred to the changes he wishes to see. He wishes to have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) publicly release and table in each House of parliament a national interest statement relating to the agreement.
The coalition government has been very transparent and forthright in all of the assistance that it has offered, whether it be a currency swap or a repayable loan. This has been very well received throughout South-East Asia. If the coalition government is so open with the Australian people and with the parliament about any assistance it offers, who on earth could the member for Holt be speaking about? Which government would be indulging in subterfuge? Who would be secretive about such a move? I can only assume that the member for Holt is referring to a future Labor government. If he has so little faith in his own future government, I am afraid that says very little for his own party. But they are the only people he could be referring to. If the Labor Party is going to be so secretive about any future moves that they make to assist in the region, perhaps he has a reason for putting forward his amendment. I would stress that the coalition government has been absolutely transparent with the Australian people and the international community about their modes of assistance and their motives for doing so.
I will move on very quickly to the different countries and the situation they have faced. Thailand was the first to see a devaluation in its currency. The International Monetary Fund has offered a credit arrangement of $US3.9 billion. The total support of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank is $US13.2 billion. Australia was one of the first countries to come forward and offer assistance. The other countries are Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. It was very well received throughout the Asian area that Australia had come forward so quickly as a responsible neighbour to assist in Thailand's time of crisis.
We have undertaken a currency swap with Thailand. That means that we are giving them US dollars and receiving Thai baht in return. There is a minimal exchange rate exposure because the exchange rate is fixed for the first swap and, of course, for the final swap when we receive US dollars in exchange for our Thai baht. There have already been two swaps: one in September of $US400 million and another in December of $US200 million.
At the time of this initial assistance there was concern expressed in my area. The argument was very much along the lines of, `Why are we giving money to another country when we have difficulties of our own?' The point that we have made, quite rightly, and that the Treasurer has made, is that we are not giving. It is of course a currency swap, and we will receive our money back in full. There is another reason we are lending money. Not only are we being neighbourly and putting action to our words about being part of Asia but also there is a saying that it is as blessed to give as to receive. In our case, particularly from my area, we are one of the biggest exporting regions from Australia. That is only too true.
What happens when a currency devalues, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that imports become more costly and exports become less costly. It is often said in the bush in Australia that there are two sweet sounds we like to hear: one is rain on a tin roof and the other is the news telling us that the Australian dollar has gone down in value, because it means that our exports are more competitive. Likewise, the same is true for Thailand and the other Asian countries. When their currency drops in value, their exports become extremely competitive and their imports become quite costly.
In the case of North Queensland, sugar, coal, beef and tourism are our major exports. Asia is a large customer of ours for sugar—41 per cent of world consumption is taken up by Asia. We have a 50 per cent share of Korea's raw sugar market, a 60 per cent to 70 per cent share of Malaysia's and a similar growing market in Indonesia. But, interestingly, Thailand is our competitor. They are one of the world's substantial producers of sugar. There 
 was grave concern that, with their currency falling, they would be in a position to compete against our raw sugar exports. The very swift action by the Treasurer, resulting in our contribution to the IMF package, has assisted in keeping the Thai baht as high as it could be. It is not something one can quantify, but it has certainly assisted in ensuring that Thailand could not undercut us any more than they already do in some of our raw sugar markets.
Indonesia was the second Asian country to experience an economic crisis, as it still does. The IMF has given $US9.9 billion as a stand-by credit arrangement. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have given $US4.5 billion and $US3.5 billion respectively and there is bilateral support as a second line of assistance. The countries involved in this are Australia—again at the forefront—China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States. In this case, Australia's assistance is a fully repayable loan. I also note that through our organisation EFIC we have agreed to underwrite agricultural exports to head off a food shortage.
Indonesia is one of our biggest competitors for thermal coal. This morning I spoke to one of the executives from one of our major coal exporters in North Queensland to see to what extent Australia's loan to Indonesia has assisted us in maintaining some of the markets that we hold overseas against the Indonesians. As I have said, one of the results of a currency fall is that your exports become more competitive. That has certainly been the case with Indonesia. They are the most aggressive country in the marketplace for thermal coal. As their currency has declined, their exports have increased. There is no doubt that the currency fall is linked to the drop in price for thermal coal. Most of their contract mining operations in Indonesia sell in US dollars, so it has not been quite as severe as it could have been. Many of the smaller mines are rupiah based. The difficulties for our coal industry are still down the track. For thermal coal, which is used in power stations, we will probably not see the impact for another two years. According to 
 this executive, there is no doubt that, although it cannot be quantified, Australia's loan to Indonesia has assisted Indonesia to prevent its thermal coal prices from falling to the extent that they could have, further undermining some of our markets overseas.
The very swift moves taken by the Treasurer to assist and to be a neighbour in South-East Asia have enabled us to help ourselves as well. They have ensured that those countries in South-East Asia that purchase our products—and, as I said, they are very big customers of ours—are able to continue to do so because our exports have not become too expensive to them. Those moves have also ensured that the currency drops in their countries have not enabled their exports to severely undermine our exports in our traditional markets.
I applaud the moves of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to see that Indonesia is not dealt with too severely by the International Monetary Fund. I would like to quote from Professor Hal Hill, the head of the Indonesia project at the Australian National University:
""Australia is now beginning to take a more subtle and sophisticated approach"" out of a realisation that ""pushing Indonesia into a corner is counterproductive"" . . . A tough approach could create a backlash, and Indonesia ""might just tell the West to go to hell with (its) aid.""
Excuse my language, Mr Deputy Speaker. That would be a very unfortunate situation for all of us. I applaud the government's moves to see that the IMF takes a reasoned approach to the crises in our neighbouring Asian countries.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I am very conscious of the time constraint that applies to the debate on this International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 . I am disappointed with this time constraint and the urgency of the parliament's consideration of the bill. I have been stunned on some occasions to hear members, particularly from the government side, adopting such a blase attitude towards the question which lies behind this amendment—and that, of course, is what has been referred to as the `Asian meltdown'. One would be tempted to believe that what has 
 happened in Asia, what is continuing to happen and what is likely to become even more severe in Asia is just some small peripheral economic skirmish. This series of incidents has been referred to as probably the first major economic crisis of the global economy and global capitalism. If it is, and if the nature of the responses to it indicate what we can look forward to in the future, it does not augur too well.
The purpose of this legislation essentially is to put into place a legislative arrangement to make it possible for the Treasurer to unilaterally make appropriations in response to International Monetary Fund requests for support for the types of packages it may put into place to `assist' countries that find themselves in economic difficulties.
We have indicated that there are some aspects of this legislation about which we are very deeply concerned. The first one is that the Treasurer is not required by this legislation to apply any transparency to any unilateral decision that he makes, presumably in conjunction with the government—hopefully that would be so; at least it would broaden the area of responsibility. But there is no indication of that in the legislation and there is no requirement on the part of the Treasurer to offer any transparency about the reasons why he would make such a decision. There is no requirement in this legislation for the Treasurer to be in any way accountable. There is no provision in this legislation for limits to be placed on the amount of funding that the Treasurer could apply for the type of currency swaps or loans which may be requested by the IMF. They are very serious deficiencies and we indicate our concern about them.
The previous speaker, the National Party member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly), referred to the need for transparency. I would suggest that she vote for the opposition's amendment because that is one of the things we will be seeking in order to amend this legislation to make it more acceptable not only to this parliament but also to 18 million Australians. I have no reason to have any faith in the individual, unilateral judgment of this Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the political interests in Australia which he represents. If 
 there is no transparency, no accountability and no ceiling the opposition wants to know why and the Australian people are entitled to ask why. The Australian people are also entitled to ask why provisions of that kind are not put into place to protect them.
It is quite illuminating that this economic meltdown has occurred among countries which were being identified as the Asian tigers—those which showed enormous growth and potential. One of the main reasons why that meltdown has occurred is that a lot of the investment, particularly the speculative investment but also a lot of property investment and a lot of short-term investment, was suddenly withdrawn. One reason for that was that there was probably too much investment that was finding its way into those economies, and the people and the institutions that were making those investments became a little apprehensive about the future security of their investments and they started to withdraw them.
There is another reason too. Let me make it clear that I am not a conspiracy theorist—but I am a realist. There is no question that one of the things that encouraged the economic meltdown and the domino effect, first of all with Thailand in the middle of last year and then increasingly through other countries of Asia, was the deliberate ploy on the part of international financial institutions to withdraw their investment to create insecurity and to create those exchange rate variations because there were major interests around the world that were capable of benefiting from them. There is no question at all about that.
Those people who adopt a blase attitude towards these developments and think it is some little economic skirmish on the periphery of the world economy should have a closer look at it. I am sure that they would then raise the same concerns that I have. There was a withdrawal of investment and the domino effect then occurred as investors started to panic. I am not saying that they were all part of a conspiracy but there is no question that a conspiratorial basis existed in relation to a lot of those developments.
The response on Australia's part to the demands of the IMF in relation to Thailand, Indonesia and Korea with those loans and 
 currency swaps was a choice to become part of what the IMF and others have referred to as—but what I do not refer to as—a rescue package. What the IMF insisted upon in making available its share of that funding was that there would be no loan defaults by those countries. To whom do those countries owe money? They owe it to the large international financial institutions. The IMF said, `Do not repudiate those debts. You meet your commitments to the big international lenders, the big investors and the big financial institutions. You make sure you meet your commitments to them.' They also said, `You have to withdraw any of your domestic support for your domestic firms and for your own finance houses.'
The IMF said they had to cut programs. A good example of that was the Korean package. They had to ease restrictions on foreign investment and on foreign ownership, and they had to make it easier to dismiss workers in order to look after the big financial institutions and investors. So the burden came back on ordinary Koreans, on ordinary Indonesians and on ordinary Thais to meet those commitments. Their governments were told to cut expenditure. But there was no requirement imposed by the IMF to ensure, for example, that there was any security given to the ordinary people within those countries—the ordinary people who become impoverished and who lose their jobs. Small farmers with loans lose their farms, their houses, their jobs and their incomes when there is foreclosure.
Let me make this point as well. We know that, as far as international exchange rates are concerned, whenever there is a change someone loses and someone else equally gains. There are massive funds of international currency washing around the financial conduits of the world—speculative funds—causing many people to become impoverished and causing many people to lose. Equally, many people and many large institutions make massive profits. If they can make those profits, to whom will they be responding when they are developing their own plans, their own behaviour and their own responses?
They are giant international corporations. They are not just financial corporations; they 
 are industrial organisations as well—commercial organisations with assets and income which exceed that of at least one-third of the world's nations. Of the 100 biggest economies in the world, 51 are private corporations. Let me give you examples: Mitsubishi is already larger than Indonesia, General Motors is bigger than Thailand or Denmark, and Unilever surpasses the entire economy of Vietnam.
What we need to do when we see these economic difficulties develop is to look behind them to see what type of motivation may exist there. We also want to look at the impact it is going to have on ordinary people because the ordinary people in those countries are the people who are making the sacrifice. We have indicated as well that there are benefits to Australia in participating in what might be identified by some as `international rescue packages'. We have spoken about the importance to Australia of trade with Asia; it is our biggest trading area. We have also spoken about the importance of Asian tourism—$5,000 million worth of Asian tourism might be lost.
We have also spoken about Australia's strategic position as far as waves of refugees are concerned. They are already starting to move out of Indonesia. Those countries adjoining Indonesia are very conscious of that; it may just be a matter of a short period of time before Australia experiences the same. So Australia does have to act as a good global citizen, to participate in these things and to assist, but we also need to look behind it and we need to expect—from the government's point of view as well—that there will be appropriate precautions built into legislation of this kind to satisfy not only this parliament but also 18 million Australians.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998  is important for Australia's future economic prosperity and market access in Asia. The bill enables the Treasurer to rapidly respond to the IMF economic restructuring programs in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. We need to do this because we have economic and strategic interests in these regions that cannot be ignored. Australia's 
 interest in assisting the recovery of the Asian currency crisis is immense. South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia have a combined population of over 300 million people. Together, these counties constitute a $12 billion export market for Australian goods and a combined trade surplus worth $6 billion. That is $6 billion in markets that Australia has actively engaged—markets whose continued economic viability shapes Australia's future prosperity.
Market access does not simply occur. It is the result of effective bilateral relations and active participation in regional and multilateral organisations. Ten years ago Australia's exports to Thailand were worth $224 million; today they are worth $1.7 billion. Ten years ago our exports to Indonesia were worth $528 million; today they stand at $3.3 billion. In the case of Korea, Australia's exports a decade ago were $1.5 billion; today they are worth $7.1 billion.
This crisis provides a unique opportunity to extend Australia's presence in these markets through active participation in the IMF programs. Australia and Japan are already world leaders in this field—the only two countries actively participating in all three IMF programs. This is quite an achievement for Australia, and it is a leadership role that will not go unnoticed by our regional leaders. This is also an exercise in Australia's involvement in world affairs that will help determine Australia's future participation in these valuable export markets.
We need to ensure the economic viability of these countries for Australia's continued prosperity and the security of our region. The continuation of economic and political reforms in these countries enhances peace and prosperity in this dynamic region of the world. Australia has the opportunity to participate in an international program to provide loans to our neighbours that will help alleviate their short-term economic difficulties. These are loans—not charity—that are repaid with interest.
The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill provides Australia with an opportunity for doing good and doing well. The loans administered through the IMF offer 
 far more than an opportunity to collect interest; they give Australia a say in the economic restructuring of countries with which we conduct a significant volume of trade, countries which consume much of our exports, and countries whose economic and political stability greatly affects our own. Participation in these IMF programs will allow Australia to shape the trading relationships that are of critical importance to our economy.
Australia does not enjoy a trade surplus with America or England—quite the opposite. Our trade deficit with the United States is over $12 billion and with the UK, some $3 billion. It is Asia who needs our resources, it is Asia whose children who are educated in our universities and, increasingly, it is Asians who spend their tourist dollars in Australia.
Trade also enhances security. Australia and Japan are trading partners because we stick to the principle of comparative advantage—exporting what we have and importing what we need. This is the relationship that we have cultivated with Indonesia, Thailand and Korea, enhancing not just our bilateral links but also regional security. It is an ongoing process that could suffer if these countries are unable to overcome their present difficulties.
The Asia-Pacific region has not historically been peaceful. Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea all possess the potential for political unrest. Tensions between ethnic minorities, between the haves and the have-nots, coupled with territorial disputes, present serious potential for the destabilising of regional security. Notwithstanding this, the transformation of the Asia-Pacific region since the Second World War has been profound. Nations that were amongst the oldest outposts of colonialism have been transformed into successful exponents of capitalism where the seeds of democracy have begun to bear fruit.
Critical to Australia's economic survival is our ability to conduct international trade, namely, the ability to get our exports into foreign markets. This is critical to Australia because of our relatively small population and vast natural resources. Australia's population cannot consume what we currently export, and we need the revenue from these exports to buy imports that our economy cannot 
 produce. The sea lanes in the Indonesian Archipelago are critical choke points for Australia's national interests. Australia's economic success is linked to South-East Asia's markets—markets that have a less developed land infrastructure, with most trade being conducted by sea. Over half the world's shipping passes through these southern entrances to South-East Asia. Closure or blockage of the sea lanes would increase the price of Australian exports, through increased freight rates, and create temporary shipping shortages for regional economies
As these countries have evolved economically, they have also advanced politically. Sizeable middle classes have been created—middle classes that demand a greater level of political participation. These countries have lifted millions of citizens from poverty and are now active participants in regional and international organisations. One only needs to look at countries isolated from economic development as examples of what could occur to Asia's political landscape  without structural economic reform—countries such as North Korea and Burma. A similar fate could have been the case for other Asian countries if the pace of economic and political reform had not been arrested by the lack of political will from developed nations.
Fortunately, this has not been the case. As these countries have undergone economic development, they have also undertaken political liberalisation. In the process they have become better neighbours, they have become more stable and they have taken a greater interest in regional security issues. A good example is Indonesia, a country that has contributed to peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia and Angola and supported non-proliferation efforts such as the comprehensive test ban treaty.
Economic development in Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia has brought a better life to millions of people and reinforced peace and stability throughout the region. As a part of the world once known for authoritarian governments and domestic instability, this region is now characterised by viable democracies that are adopting more open economic policies and alleviating poverty. The present 
 danger is that this economic development will be arrested by the currency crisis and these countries will lose the momentum for further economic and political liberalisation. The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill gives Australia the opportunity to reap the rewards of our neighbours' future prosperity rather than opt out and suffer the consequences.
Without our involvement in this plan, we could see our export markets shrink and our trade surpluses disappear. This would have a profound impact on our domestic economy through reduced demand for our exports and the subsequent increase in unemployment. In the longer term, this could spill over into regional instability, causing security problems for Australia. Australia has a vested interest in ensuring that these regions  continue to advance economically, continue to be major purchasers of Australian exports, and continue with their economic and political liberalisation programs.
The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill is not a cure-all for the countries effected by the Asian currency crisis. Economic recovery in these countries will take time as markets undertake necessary economic reforms. Successful completion of these reforms will underpin a brighter economic future, not just for these three countries, but also Australia. These reforms will not be easy as protected industries are exposed to competition, as prudential supervision is tightened and as these economies become more transparent.
Access to capital is the most immediate challenge facing these three countries and one that this bill aims to address. In the longer term, greater financial transparency in these countries will ensure the inflow of capital as investors are better able to assess the financial standing of prospective investment opportunities. The reforms will also be a major step in liberalising market access and introducing investment rules in these three countries. Using this as a foundation, Australia's trade opportunities will expand as our market access improves.
The situation in Indonesia is the most serious of the three countries affected by this 
 crisis, not because Australian exports are most exposed but because the political consequences that could follow the economic problems pose risks to Australia's security. If something is not done to shore up the Indonesian currency, the fourfold rise in the prices of basic necessities will have crippling effects on many Indonesian families. Without a corresponding increase in wages, which are already low in Indonesia, how long can the Indonesian people support these costs? How long will it be before the people vent their dissatisfaction against the government and, in the case of Indonesia, the ethnic Chinese population who own the shops and businesses?
Indonesia has been the hardest hit by the Asian financial crisis due to a number of structural weaknesses in the Indonesian economy. These include import monopolies, a lack of transparency in the business environment and a weak banking system. Accordingly, the IMF package, in which Australia is involved, is aimed at liberalising foreign trade and investment, dismantling Indonesia's domestic monopolies and increasing the transparency of public sector activities. Successful implementation of these reforms will assist Indonesia's economic recovery.
This bill enables Australia to ensure its future peace and prosperity by taking a leadership role in the economic restructuring of the economies with which we are most integrated. These measures ensure that our neighbours, with whom we enjoy huge trade surpluses, will have the funds and expertise to reduce the shocks of the Asian currency crisis. These three markets account for 11.5 per cent of Australia's exports—a $12 billion export market growing faster than almost any region in the world. If we do not participate in the IMF program, the rules of the trading systems will be written without Australia's interests in mind. We will not be remembered as a friend in times of need, but rather as a fair-weather friend. Our export markets will shrink, jobs will be lost and Australia's future access to these markets could be placed in doubt.
If the pace of economic development and political liberalisation is arrested by the 
 current difficulties in these countries—as may well be the case without IMF involvement—the stability, peace and prosperity of the region could be threatened, ruining the progress made over a generation.
The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill is about Australian leadership and participation in international affairs. It is about engaging Asia and investing in Australia's future peace and prosperity. We cannot afford to let our destiny be written by anyone else.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1998-03-26,"—It has become fashionable in the financial press and in the corridors of Treasury to dub any critics of globalisation as dinosaurs, out of touch, out of date and acting contrary to the best interests of this country and the wellbeing of the global village. I am not a dinosaur, but I am certainly a sceptic when it comes to international financial dealings.
This bill proposes a legislative framework for Australia's participation in so-called IMF rescue packages. These are emergency arrangements to rescue economies from collapse. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) says the current unstructured process is inappropriate and cumbersome when swift action is required. The parliament and the people will have no say in this blank cheque arrangement, as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) so rightly pointed out.
Such financial assistance, like that offered recently at short notice to Thailand, North Korea and Indonesia, is over and above what we currently pay in the standard membership subscription to the IMF club. The key role of the IMF when it was set up at Bretton Woods in 1944 was to provide balance of payments support for countries suffering from short-term balance of payments problems.
Some may argue the IMF played a very important role in recycling petrodollars during the 1970s oil crises to enable Third World countries to ride out the massive impact of the sudden increase in outlays for their energy needs. But the loans made at this time through the IMF have had a great deal to do with the parlous economic situation and foreign debt these countries now find themselves facing. The IMF has sought to remedy 
 this situation through structural adjustment programs, but this simply replaces one debt with another.
The difficulty I have with the IMF is the membership qualifications for the club, where control is directly related to the amount each country contributes. In the same way that the US can underwrite export insurance schemes for its producers for far longer and for far greater amounts than we for instance can ever afford, so too can it and the ten wealthiest members of the club direct the fund. As in the case of Indonesia, the IMF imposes a structural adjustment program on the country in trouble; in trouble, I might say, not through its economic mismanagement alone, but through the profligate lending and investment from the very countries whose membership constitutes the top ten of the IMF club.
Let me remind the House of the IMF's role in the so-called Operation Peso Shield, set up in January 1995 to deal with the Mexican crisis. A devaluation of the Mexican peso triggered panic among investment managers all over the world, because over $50 billion had been invested from these sources into Mexican government bonds, shares and debentures. In three days Mexico lost 30 per cent of its dollar value as money was pulled out of the country. In a frenzy of activity the IMF and Bank of International Settlements—in fact just half a dozen people acting without any endorsement from the US congress or any member parliament of the IMF—had used $50 billion worth of taxpayers' money from industrialised western countries to protect the investments of borderless speculators.
Michel Camdessus, the boss of IMF for the past decade, answered his critics then who claimed the disaster saving exercise had plundered the tax assets of IMF contributors for the benefit of the international financiers. Camdessus admitted that speculators had taken advantage of the $50 billion credit lifeline, but, as he said:
The world is in the hands of these guys.
Hans Peter Martin so rightly asserts in his Global Trap  treatise that:
More and more often politicians and electorates throughout the world see how the anonymous actors of the money markets are taking control of 
 their economy so that politics is left only with the role of impotent bystander.
How many in this House can honestly say that this description does not largely fit their role, especially when we hand over power like this to the executive unchallenged and unscrutinised?
Malaysian leader Mahatir was roundly condemned for daring to question the motives behind the currency speculation and international financial raids on his economy. Not for one moment do I endorse any of the racial overtones in his criticisms, but there were certainly grains of truth in what he was saying about the manipulation by the international financiers. Yet former British Prime Minister, John Major, complained in 1995 that it was unacceptable for things to occur on money markets `at a speed and on a scale that risks running beyond the control of governments.' French President, Jacques Chirac, also condemned these international financial pirates who were `the AIDS of the world economy.'
Are we, as the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) said in his contribution, assisting countries in need, or are we assisting financiers in greed? The relaxation on the cross-border exchanges of currency and the abandoning of the international exchange rates in the 1970s sowed the seeds for this epidemic. The fixed rate system based on the US dollar and gold disintegrated and the faceless, anonymous currency dealers took over the whole system, setting the exchange rates between themselves.
The so-called structural adjustment programs—as our library research team so rightly pointed out—usually had the result of guaranteeing repayment of private bank debt. The World Bank is on record as saying:
For the IMF the need to protect Western Banks is the driving force.
Funny, that. As our major banks enter further into this globalised economy, the need to protect their interests also appears the driving force in the marketplace deregulation at the expense in this country of the small businessman and the farmer—those who were offered the bait, just like the Asian tigers were offered the bait, but are now blamed for their predicament. 
This is not to defend the policies of the Indonesian regime, which has been demonstrated to be self-serving, corrupt and having little regard for the impact of its actions on the living standards of its people. The IMF has, it seems, begun to realise that the demands it has made of Indonesia are too stringent and may, in fact, be economically counterproductive, and certainly socially counterproductive, and racially counterproductive.
Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the former Prime Minister Mr Keating have raised strong concerns at the social and political impact of the IMF adjustment program in Indonesia. As the Bills Digest, the research paper prepared for this legislation, points out—and I must commend its authors for the thorough, detailed and balanced manner in which it was prepared—many experts argue that the Asian crisis is partly the result of excessive financial deregulation and a `willingness of international financiers to lend to private firms with no government regulation, resulting in a run on local currency and domestic assets when the economy showed strain'. As these rescue packages are premised on further financial sector deregulation and trade liberalisation, `this strategy will serve to further entrench key conditions which led to the crisis'.
Mr Deputy Speaker, if this sounds like a gambler being told that he can get out of gaol by borrowing money from the gaoler but having to pay back the loan before he gets out, then you are not very much wide of the mark—in hock forever. Ultimately, as far as can I see, the IMF funded `rescue packages' not only rescue risk capital from the besieged Third World markets but also prepare the ground for ripe pickings for the financing sources after the struggling country's economy has been grounded. Who else but the very same international financiers are able to step in and pick up the assets of the embattled country at bargain basement prices? As I have said: economic colonialism. Just like the transfer of wealth from the middle and lower income groups to the top 20 per cent in most Western countries, so too we have this transfer of wealth on a global basis.
Wade and Veneroso—two economists who the free marketeers and globalists might like to dismiss as `leftist alarmists' or `loopy loonies' or whatever—believe that the `combination of massive devaluations, IMF-pushed financial liberalisation and IMF facilitated recovery may even precipitate the biggest peacetime transfer of assets from domestic to foreign owners in the past 50 years anywhere in the world'. For, just as there is justifiable suspicion about the motives of the international Multilateral Agreement on Investment and the free kicks and unjustifiable concessions it might offer the multinationals, so too there is widespread concern in the Australian electorate about the role of the IMF.
But this is not to say that everything about globalisation, deregulation and free trade is necessarily bad and that agreements like the MAI might not provide benefits for some Australians. Foreign investment capital is crucial for a small nation like Australia; there simply is not enough capital to get the investment going that we need to keep growing the economy. We have to be rational about globalisation and weigh up the costs with the benefits. We have to ensure, though, that the environment is protected, that labour standards are maintained, that foreign investors pay their fair share of tax and, most importantly, that we maintain our national identity.
What we are seeing at the moment through globalisation are massive winners and massive losers. The winners are those who are fortunate enough to be involved in high-tech, high demand jobs; the shareholders in these companies; and the whole of society through the lowering of prices of consumer goods. But there is a whole raft of people displaced by globalisation and relentless improvements in technology. As I have said, parliaments can be rendered powerless in the face of such ultimatums from the IMF club, and the IMF itself is now at the beck and call of the world financial markets.
So we are confronted with this amendment. We will allow the Treasurer to enter into an agreement to lend money to the recipient country or enter into a currency swap; the money is to come from consolidated revenue.
I told a gathering in Bathurst several months ago that the billion dollar currency swap we made with Thailand was in our best interests, because the rescue of the Thai economy was going to be worth far more than $1 billion to us in the long run. I still believe that we need to help Thailand out. But I wonder whether we really have helped to pay out the international financiers who helped Thailand get overstretched and in trouble in the first place. I wonder whether the IMF rescue packages are really only rescuing the value of the assets of international money lenders. I do not really believe that is what our taxpayers expect me to support—especially those taxpayers so cruelly hurt by banks in this country that have entered the globalised marketplace now, with scant regard for their domestic clients' needs or financial difficulties over the past decade and a half.
For those reasons, I oppose these amendments as they stand. I would ask—given the fact that haste in providing these loans is not everything, as Indonesia is showing—that any agreement to lend money to the IMF for such packages be referred to the parliament for debate prior to any such commitment. I do not believe that the opposition amendments flagged by the shadow Treasurer go far enough to satisfy my concerns or those of many Australians who do not believe that executive and cabinet decisions alone of this magnitude should be implemented prior to scrutiny by the parliament.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—In summing up the debate on the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 , I welcome the support that the bill has received from both sides of the parliament. This is a bill which is unquestionably in Australia's national interest. It is unquestionably in Australia's national interest for Australia to be part of international efforts which have the capacity to stabilise the economic situation for its neighbours and, in some cases, social and political difficulties which would flow from extreme economic maladjustment.
This is a bill which enables the Treasurer of the day to advance moneys by way of loan or currency swap and to make a contribution 
 which is not just in the interests of those countries concerned but also in the interests of Australia itself. And I re-emphasise that, if a loan or a currency swap is made, the amount will be repaid in full—not only repaid in full but, in most cases, repaid in full with interest. In those circumstances the Australian taxpayers get value for money not only by having their loans repaid in full, and repaid in full with interest, but also by having a contribution made to those of our neighbours who should be part of those international financing packages and have their economies strengthened, which is in the interests of the export earnings of Australia and in the interests of a stronger Australian economy.
I want to make the point—and this is an important point to make—that we have no interest in having weak economies amongst our neighbours. There seems to be a view which is being propagated in some quarters in Australia—the quarters that like to feed on fear in the Australian community, some of whom have opposed this particular measure on populist grounds—that somehow it is in our interests to see our neighbours poor or that somehow it is in our interests to see economic dislocation in the economies of our neighbours. It is not. It is in our interest to have strong economic growth amongst our neighbours, because strong economic growth amongst our neighbours is good for strong economic growth in Australia, is good for job opportunities for young Australians and is good for rising living standards in Australia.
—Who has claimed otherwise?
—The opposition has not claimed otherwise, but there are Independents in this parliament who have claimed otherwise. Also, there are newspapers which circulate widely, I notice, in rural areas of Australia making precisely that claim on populist grounds. Some of the complaints that have been made by the previous speaker in this debate, the member for Calare (Mr Andren), about international money lenders and those sorts of phrases are well known to people in this parliament, and we know who uses them and we know why they are used. The fact of the matter is this: this is not a 
 proposition for Australia to bail out any international lenders, nor is it a proposition for Australia to help the rise of world globalisation or all of the other phrases that were being used by the previous speaker. This is a proposal for Australia to advance Australian national interests. This is what this is about. This is a proposal for Australia to see that we are good neighbours and it is a proposal for Australia to strengthen economic opportunity in our region. I welcome the fact that the opposition has joined with the government in supporting this legislation and I look forward to the bill being passed.
I have had some discussion with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) in relation to some amendments which he proposes to move during the consideration in detail stage. I indicate to the parliament that I fully accept and will agree to the proposals that are contained in those amendments for the Treasurer to publicly release and table in the parliament a national interest statement which would indicate the reasons the government had entered into an agreement under this act, and I fully support the proposal that that statement have a description of the nature and terms of the agreement and the reasons the agreement is in Australia's national interest. I make this clear and I have said this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
The agreements themselves will be commercial-in-confidence and there will be a lot that will be confidential about them. In particular, what will be confidential about them will be the interest rate at which the money is advanced, because there will be some sensitivity for both borrower and lender in relation to that, not just as to the bilateral agreement between the two of them but, because there are likely to be numbers of countries involved, there may well be different interest rate differentials between the countries. As has been the case, some of the borrowers have asked us to keep these matters confidential. Obviously, it is a matter of some sensitivity to them if they are negotiating different rates, and obviously it is a matter of some sensitivity if the terms and conditions available to the lenders are different according to the country that is concerned. So there will 
 be much that is commercial-in-confidence in relation to that. It will not be possible to table the agreement itself, but I have discussed that with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and am happy with the formulation that there be a description with as much detail as practicable. I make the point that it will not be practicable to disclose matters which are commercial-in-confidence or which otherwise relate to national sensitivities.
The other part that is contained in the amendment which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition proposes is that the statement itself be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and report within two months. I welcome this amendment and the government will agree to this amendment as well. I think that the joint standing committee will have a useful input into that, and this is consistent with the government's general view that treaties generally should be referred to parliamentary committees. We have no concern at all that a national interest statement be referred to a parliamentary committee. In fact, I think it will be a positive thing to actually engage other members of the parliament in consideration of these issues.
I have indicated in advance that the government will accept the amendments which are going to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Part of our reasoning in accepting them is to emphasise the bipartisan nature of the support for this and a full expectation that the amendments, as incorporated in the bill, will therefore enjoy considerable support in the Senate without the need for further amendment and that the legislation can secure a quick passage because the legislation is required before Australia will be able to advance any moneys. By reason of the situation now developing, it may be necessary to secure and advance those moneys within a very short time frame. So, having accepted these amendments, which I think are good in themselves and which I hope will clear a quick passage through the Senate, I hope that the legislation can be enacted with all due haste so that we can have these arrangements in place as soon as possible.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I appreciate the opportunity to speak during the second reading debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998 . I know there have been claims made that there is no crisis in Australia's health system. Let me refute that. I certainly would not suggest that the situation in the Australian health system would necessarily place it among the health systems of the developing world. But, in terms of the health system that the Australian people have come to expect and the health system that this country can afford, there is no question at all that the Australian health system is in crisis.
The member for Dobell (Mr Lee), the opposition spokesman on questions of health, has drawn attention, as last night did the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), speaking for the government, to situations where, for example, hospitals are identified as bypass hospitals—not because they are providing bypass operations but because the ambulances are told that they have to go past them, bypass them, because there is no room in those hospitals to take emergency cases. We have had examples where, in the process of people being shuffled and shuttled from one hospital to another, their health circumstances have seriously deteriorated, and there have been cases where it has become so serious that death has eventuated. There are other examples as well where after serious operations people are left lying on trolleys in hospital corridors. We might find, and we will find, worse examples of health and hospital care in the developing countries of the world, but Australia should be able to apply sufficient resources to make sure that our 18 million Australian citizens have access to top quality health care and hospital care.
Of course, that was the purpose initially of the Whitlam government when the old Medibank was introduced. We well recall the 
 very firm, unqualified promise by the leader of the coalition at that time, Mr Fraser, when prior to the election in 1975 he said, `We will maintain Medibank.' No qualifications, no ifs, no buts—`We will maintain it.' There were seven changes in eight years, and it destroyed it. I well recall, as everybody else should recall, that when we came back into government in 1983 there were over two million people in Australia who were not covered by any sort of health insurance. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as do all of my colleagues, that there were mothers and fathers who were not covered, who did not take their kids for necessary medical treatment at the time and whose kids now are carrying the scars of that lack of treatment and will carry the scars of that lack of treatment until they die.
We were not prepared to accept a situation where that prevailed, so we said in 1983, `We are going to reintroduce it, we are going to restore it and we are going to seek to lock it in.' We called it Medicare. We saw before the last election the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) emulating the comments of Mr Fraser, when the spokespeople for the coalition said, `We will maintain Medicare.' There have been no major changes to the structure of it, but they have ripped the heart out of it. `Oh no, we will maintain Medicare,' they said, `but where the funding is coming from is another question.' We know, for example, that, in addition to the demands that were put on the states in 1996 with the first budget of the coalition, when the states were told that they would be required to help the Commonwealth to the extent of $1.6 billion, we had $800 million ripped out of the public hospital system, we had $400 million taken from the dental health program and we had $479 million taken from the mental health and the palliative care programs.
The present Commonwealth government, the coalition government, is saying to the 18 million Australians, `We are packing this money back into the system. We are going to increase in real terms the funds available to the health and hospital system by 15 per cent over the next five years.' The only reason these funds are going in is that the system 
 was on the verge of collapse as a result of the funds that were ripped out. What this coalition government now proposes to put back into the system is the money it took out.
I urge people in the Australian community to understand that, and I would like in this connection to remind everyone that the 1996 Australian of the Year, Dr John Yu, a former head of the Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney, made the following comments. These expressions of concern are not just coming from us. Dr John Yu said:
I am not sure how well briefed the Prime Minister is. . . . I'm certainly disappointed that Dr Wooldridge does not have a better understanding of what's happening.
Dr John Yu is not talking about some backbencher on the government side; he is not talking about some Liberal Party branch member out in the mid-west of New South Wales. He is talking about the Prime Minister of Australia and the member of the government who has primary responsibility for the administration of government programs in relation to health and hospitals and in relation to something that we still will continue to call Medicare, even though the government is trying to get away from that word. John Yu also said:
Public hospitals . . . deserve a better deal.
Yes, they do. We have pre- and post-operation cases lying on trolleys in hospital corridors, kids being shuffled from one hospital to another because there is no room for them, mothers in anguish taking their children into hospitals and being told to go somewhere else and mothers being told to take their kids out of the hospital before the kid should be released from the hospital.
You know who is causing this, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I want to let everyone know who is causing it. It is being caused by this coalition government—a coalition government which has an ideological fix on anything that is private and an ideological fix against anything that is public. So they are happy to support all of the private health arrangements. You will recall that they did, for example, put 
 in place a subsidy for people to pay private hospital fund fees. One would have thought that those people who were members of private hospital funds would have expected to benefit from that. Did they? Of course they didn't. The fees now, even taking into account that rebate, are higher than they were when the scheme was introduced. The sum of $1.7 thousand million has been spent on that, and it has not worked. In New South Wales there are 400 people leaving private health funds every day. The coalition government's scheme was supposed to halt the loss to the private health funds and to reverse it. People would say, `Here is a subsidy for me to go into a private health fund.'
The situation is compounded by the fact that people in private health funds have themselves gone through this experience. We all know that this is true. You can have a public Medicare patient in a public hospital occupying a bed alongside a private patient for the same ailment, for the same operation, with the same doctor, with the same services, and at the end of that treatment the public Medicare patient leaves that hospital not owing one cent. The private fund  hospital patient will leave that hospital owing in some cases hundreds of dollars, despite the fact that the private hospital patient has probably for decades being paying into a private fund. I would say that after one experience of that kind the private fund member would say, `Thus far and no further. Why should I pay my Medicare levy through my tax and in addition to that pay private health funds, and in the face of that leave the hospital where I occupied a bed alongside another person who had the same ailment, who had the same operation with the same doctor and who received exactly the same services owing hundreds of dollars and the Medicare patient comes out owing not one cent.'
I am very conscious of the time constraints. I have been prevailed upon to cut my remarks short. There are plenty more points that I would welcome the opportunity to make, and at some time in the future I am going to take the opportunity to make them. But my colleague Michael Lee, the member for Dobell, 
 carries this fight right out into the national community, exposes the deficiencies of this government, puts up the alternative policies and programs and says, in effect, to 18 million Australians, `We will not tolerate the dismantling of the public health and public hospital system. We will fight them right to the line.' Within the next 12 months there is going to be another election, and we will take them right to the line, and this is one of those issues on which we will win.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (HEALTH CARE AGREEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has asked me to make the following statement on his behalf. The Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998  provides the basic framework for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with states and territories for the provision by the states and territories of acute health services to public patients free of charge in return for Commonwealth financial assistance. The bill does not contain the substance of the agreements, nor does it influence the funding of those agreements. The agreements are bilateral between the Commonwealth and each state and territory. The bill replaces sections of the Health Insurance Act 1973 which contain the provisions for the Medicare agreements from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1998. The new provisions will facilitate agreements from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2003.
The bill contains the Medicare principles by which the states must abide. These principles are similar to those in the current act. Eligible persons are to be given the choice to receive designated health services free of charge as public patients. Access to health services by public patients is to be on the basis of clinical need and within a clinically appropriate period. The arrangements are to be in place to ensure equitable access to designated health services for all eligible persons regardless of their geographical location.
Other key parts of the bill include a requirement for the development of a public patients charter, provisions for national health development special assistance and the establishment of a health care information commis 
 sioner. Financial assistance under the new health care agreements is conditional on the development of a public patients charter. This charter will be a document for the dissemination of information about the provision of health services and the means by which complaints about the health system can be made. National health development special assistance will provide for major projects to re-engineer the acute care system, improving the efficiency or effectiveness of the delivery of health services, improving patient outcomes in relation to the delivery of these services or addressing the factors that lead to avoidable or unnecessary hospitalisation. For example, projects that seek to improve the integration of the acute care sector with the wider health care system or improve the linkage of information technology across the system may be funded. I thank members for their contribution to this debate.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add to an answer that I gave yesterday.
—Indulgence is granted.
—Yesterday during question time the Leader of the Opposition raised the case of Murton v. Lemmon Investments, in which the Industrial Relations Commission found that the employment of an employee of a small business was terminated for taking sick leave to which he was entitled, amongst 
 other reasons. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that this was an example of an employee who would be stripped of protection by the government's small business exemption, but the facts are completely otherwise.
The fact is that all employees in such a situation will have continued protection under the government's legislation. I inform the House that the small business bill, which was rejected by the Senate, will not affect any employee's protection against termination for a prohibited reason. One of the prohibited reasons is `temporary absence because of illness or injury'. This covers an absence of up to three months because of illness or injury or any longer period if it is wholly on paid sick leave, provided the employee gives the employer medical certificates for the illness or injury or otherwise substantiates the reason for the absence as required by any industrial award or agreement. The government's bill will continue this protection. The bill should have been passed, and by blocking it the Senate is destroying 50,000 new jobs in this country.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL RESPONSES</title>,<title>Industrial Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,speech
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, when last year you withdrew Labor's legislation attacking trafficking in trust losses and substituted your own watered down legislation, did the relevant ministers with family trusts exclude themselves from the cabinet decision or at the very least declare their conflict of interest when the matter was considered around the cabinet table? Or was your reckless attitude to the concept of conflict of interest already in operation then?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—I would like to say a couple of things about trusts, including the legislation that was passed by the Senate. The first observation that ought to be made about trusts is that you had 13 years to fix the abuses and you did nothing. For every question that you ask about this, you will be reminded that you had 13 years and you did nothing. You had 13 years to fix the ramshackle tax system. It got worse every year 
 that you were in office. For you now to come into this parliament and pretend some kind of latter day outrage and with confected concern talk about the state of our taxation system, I think that is an outrage that the Australian people will see through. I can say to the House that the deliberations of cabinet are not things that I normally talk about.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—Mr Speaker, before the next question is asked, could I add to an answer I gave earlier to the member for Hotham.
—Proceed.
—The member for Hotham asked me a question about Senator Parer and Lacetal and Mr Shand. I should inform the House that I have just received a letter from Mr Shand, which reads as follows:
I understand the question has arisen as to whether Senator Parer or any company associated with him or his family has now or ever had an interest in Lacetal Pty Ltd. The answer is no.
—That wasn't the question.
—You owe Senator Parer an apology.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Members of the opposition will remain silent.
—Mr Speaker—
—It has been tabled. The honourable member for Hotham will sit down.
—That wasn't the question—
—The member for Hotham will resume his seat. You have not got the call.
—You are making an extraordinary allegation against my colleague. You are a phoney muckraker.
—Mr Speaker, I ask you to ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that statement against me.
—If the honourable member is offended, I would never want that to happen. Of course I withdraw the allegation. Of course I withdraw the allegation against the phoney. Of course I do.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The expression that the member for Hotham asked to be withdrawn was `phoney muckraker'. It was not withdrawn by the Prime Minister, as is required by standing orders. We would request that you get him to do it.
—Prime Minister, the member for Hotham asked that you withdraw the words. I understand that you have partly withdrawn; will you withdraw them without qualification?
—It is true that I substituted another one but I would never want him to be offended. I think I have made the point that you misled the parliament about Senator Parer and you owe him an apology. Therefore, I am very happy to substitute that for what I previously said.
—Withdraw!
—He is a muckraker.
—The House will remain silent—on both sides.
—I raise a point of order again. The Prime Minister was invited or requested 
 by the member for Hotham to withdraw the words `phoney muckraker'; he withdrew one. He then substituted one of the other words which he now says is the word that he puts in its place. Unfortunately for him it happened to be one of the two it was asked of him to withdraw. I might say, Mr Speaker, the thing that he thought he had done as he got up there to explain himself through that letter, I am afraid, missed the entire point. Nevertheless, we want it withdrawn.
—I understood that the Prime Minister withdrew the remarks. Is that so?
—Yes.
—The Prime Minister has withdrawn the remarks—both remarks.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I wish to draw your attention to standing order 144, which says:
Questions should not contain—(a) statements of facts or names of persons . . .
Mr Speaker, I put it to you that the people that wrote that standing order were the people of this House and did not believe that you should defame people by questions. I ask you to consider that in the future, considering the evidence just brought to the attention of the House.

"O'Keefe, Neil, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—My question is also to the Prime Minister. Is he aware of the plight of the 250 meatworkers from Grafton Abattoirs who have lost their jobs and $3 million of pay and redundancy entitlements? Prime Minister, do you recall your Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business saying on 10 March in this place that these workers should approach the Office of the Employment Advocate and that `the government will stand shoulder to shoulder with the employees'? Are you aware that these workers have approached the Office of the Em 
 ployment Advocate, which has responded in writing that:
There is no provision under the Workplace Relations Act . . . to take action against directors of insolvent companies.
How is it that you can make such an effort to protect the interests of wealthy people like Senator Parer but you will not lift a finger to help these ordinary workers?
—That question is very close to being out of order.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Grafton Meatworkers</title>,Questions Without Notice,22,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—I will be happy to answer it. First of all, I certainly share the concern of many members in this House about the position of those 250 workers. I understand that my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, met them. I also understand from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business that there is a possibility—and I do not want to put it any higher than that but I certainly hope it is realised—that the company may be sold to another interested party in which event it may be possible that the situation will turn out to be better than we now think it is. That is the advice that the minister has been given and I pass it on to the honourable member.
The other point I would make is that I was a little puzzled at the member's reference to the Employment Advocate not having the power to pursue the directors of the company. Certainly I would be surprised if it had been suggested that he did because the power to pursue directors and so forth is something that would be done by the Securities Commission rather than by the Employment Advocate. Of course the government is very concerned about these situations. I think the honourable member would be aware that when his party was in power there was a very detailed examination of the law and you looked at and specifically rejected some of the things you are now asking us to do. So you cannot parade a monopoly of concern about workers in these difficult situations. I say to the honourable gentleman that everything will be done to help the workers concerned. I do not think you advance their cause by trying to draw some phoney long bows with other people.

"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—Yesterday during question time the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business purported to read from a letter he had received from a wharfie in Brisbane. Under standing order 321 I asked him to table the letter. He did not have the letter with him, and he gave an undertaking that he would give me a copy of it later in the day. Of course, as usual, he has broken his word.

—He has misrepresented me, and I can do that now if you have a look at the standing orders.
—The honourable member will resume his seat. The minister has the call.

I even have `Wharfies work for strip show Reith'. I would be happy to table that one. What about this one? This is a cartoon in the Western Australian. That is a good one.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister was asked to table one letter—the one that he alluded to yesterday 
 and he did not. That is what you should require him to table.
—Has the minister the letter?
—Mr Speaker, I am going to table absolutely everything. In my file yesterday—

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—The Bulletin  said it all this week: `Medicare's Dr No: health cuts crisis, worse to come.' The missing Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge)—Dr No—is not brave enough to come into the chamber and debate health legislation, Medicare legislation, agreements on Medicare and even whether or not Australia's public hospitals system is receiving sufficient federal funds.
It is no surprise that the Bulletin magazine is referring to the minister for health as Dr No. The minister has been Dr No on public hospital funding negotiations with the states. He has been Dr No on rebates for GP services, which is discouraging bulkbilling. He has been Dr No on the increasing costs for ordinary Australians for essential medicines. He has been Dr No on the ability of ordinary Australians to get fair access to emergency dental care. He has been Dr No for the 44 Medicare offices around the country that have been closed by this minister and this government, including one in Wynnum and another one in Belmont to close tomorrow. They are all closing because of the decisions that this government and this minister have made.
These funding cuts were needed to fund this government's failed and discredited $1.7 billion health insurance tax rebate—the tax rebate flop in respect of which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the minister for health will not admit publicly what every Australian knows: that it has failed to make any difference whatsoever in the level of 
 membership of Australia's private health insurance funds.
Before the last election the centrepiece of the coalition's health policy was to subsidise private health insurance. They said it would make the premiums cheaper, they said it would increase the membership and it would take the pressure off public hospitals. We love to remind the government of this promise every opportunity we have to discuss health matters. That was your promise: lower premiums and higher membership. The intention was to take the pressure off public hospitals. But what has happened? Premium increases have hit ordinary contributors like tidal waves. Time after time health funds have jacked up their premiums after they have been approved by this minister and this government. Most of the benefit of that tax rebate has already been swallowed up by premium increases, and it is no wonder that, as a result, membership of health insurance funds has been falling by 700 a day. According to the latest figures, 700 Australians a day are leaving private health insurance funds.
Instead of taking the pressure off public hospitals, this government, in its inability to turn around the decline in health insurance, has increased the pressure on our public hospital system. Added to that, in its first budget—the August 1996 budget—the government cut federal funding for Australia's public hospitals by a massive $800 million. To make it worse, this Minister for Health and Family Services—this government—has even allowed one of the health funds to impose an added fee on any of their members who have the temerity to be treated in a private hospital rather than as a private patient in a public hospital. So one of the major health funds has now introduced a new penalty fee which is imposed on any of those health fund members who are treated in private hospitals rather than public hospitals.
If the intention was to take pressure off public hospitals, why is this government approving new and additional burdens and costs and fees on ordinary Australians who do have private health insurance who use a private hospital rather than a public hospital? At the end of the day, the Prime Minister 
 said, when this government launched its health policy at the last election, that they would get such a response to their health insurance tax rebate they would lift the level of private health insurance coverage from 35 per cent of the population to 40 per cent of the population. The Prime Minister's prediction was that he would, by the year 2000, get the level of private health insurance up to 40 per cent.
—Fat chance.
—We had a fat chance, as my colleague the member for Reid interjects. It has no chance whatsoever of being achieved, and that is because ordinary Australians are questioning whether they are getting good value for money from their private health insurance premiums. They are questioning that every day. That is why 700 Australians a day are leaving private health insurance.
The minister for health, in that 1996 budget, put his name to the health portfolio budget document predicting that there would be an increase to 35 per cent—an increase to 34½ per cent because of the tax rebate and then, in his own press release, another one per cent increase because of the Medicare levy surcharge on high income earners. So we have both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services claiming that their $1.7 billion rebate would actually increase the level of private health insurance and take the pressure off public hospitals.
But what have we seen actually happen? The levels just keep falling as each quarter the figures come out. The decline in membership of private health insurance is a straight line. The government says, `It was a straight line under the former government,' and that is true. There was a decline of health insurance membership under Labor and it is a straight line today. The only difference is that this government has spent $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money to get the same result—to get the straight line. That is why Jeff Kennett—
—They could have put it into the public hospital system.
—As my colleague the member for Denison interjects, that is why Jeff Kennett 
 has been saying that that rebate was money down the drain. That is why the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, said the rebate is a dud, and it is why the AMA has been saying that the money should have been spent directly on patient care.
If we want any independent evidence about the pressure on the public hospital system, let us turn to a former Australian of the Year, Dr Yu. Dr John Yu is a former chief executive of the new children's hospital at Westmead and he made the following comments yesterday:
I am not sure how well briefed the Prime Minister is. I am certainly disappointed that Dr Wooldridge does not have a better understanding of what is happening.
Dr Yu went on to say:
Public hospitals deserve a better deal. There is really a crisis in the public hospital system. We are faced with the denial of treatment for things many of us would believe were the right of any Australian.
Hear, hear! When an Australian of the stature of Dr John Yu, who is not associated with either side of politics, sounds that warning bell about the need for additional funding for our public hospital system, a responsible government would be trying to find the extra resources that our public hospital system would need.
Instead of this government trying to find new ways to ease the crisis in our public hospital system, we have government members trying to justify this government's cutbacks. Let me give you a good example of this brought to my attention by my friend the member for Denison. In the Hobart Mercury this morning we have a very good story that I am sure some of my colleagues will be keen to hear about. Under the headline `Liberal MPs cross swords: health funding discord widens' the article says:
A major brawl has erupted between the state and federal Liberal MPs over cuts in federal health care funding.
Health minister Peter McKay yesterday accused the Canberra MPs of repeating like parrots the Federal Treasury line that state health cuts were a major factor in funding problems. 

He warned the five senators and two MHRs they would be picked off by the voters at the next federal election.
He went on to say:
Mr McKay accused his colleagues of using manipulated and selective figures and said he believed they had been pressured by Prime Minister John Howard.
I will leave it up to my colleagues to decide who the two Tasmanian members of the House of Representatives might be. I am sure it was not the member for Denison or the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) or the member for Lyons (Mr Adams). Can you believe that the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) or the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) would be so stupid as to put their names to a press release which parrots the Treasury line according to Health Minister McKay?
—I believe it.
—The member for Grayndler believes it. Seeing that the Howard government's Titanic  is taking on water, the minister for health is abandoning Chisholm with a margin of 2.7 per cent, desperately pushing people out of the way to get onto the lifeboat of `SS Casey' with a margin of 6.6 per cent.
You can imagine the disappointment that that has caused for the member for Bass, left behind as the minister for health scrambles on to the electorate of Casey for which there had been rumours that the member for Bass might have actually have had a chance of endorsement. Having been left in the electorate of Bass, he puts his name to a press release which says that the Tasmanian hospital system has got enough money already and that the federal government should not be putting extra resources into the Tasmanian health care system.
Even if the members for Bass and Braddon were silly enough to put their names to this document, why are the conservative Tasmanian senators agreeing to this Treasury line that there is no need for extra federal money for the Tasmanian health care system? Remember the line that they used to give us that the senators do not take partisan political views on things, that senators speak up for their state, that senators are there to represent the 
 states and speak out for what is needed for individual states?
What about those five Liberal senators from Tasmania? What comes first: speaking up with their Premier and their health minister and the Labor members and senators in the federal parliament that are arguing for extra resources for the Tasmanian public hospital system? No, they put their name to the line of the Prime Minister and the member for Chisholm, Minister for Health and Family Services, that the Tasmanian hospital system does not need those extra resources. And they will pay the price. The health minister was right when he said that the five senators and the two MHRs, the members for Bass and Braddon, will be picked off by voters at the next federal election. And they deserve to be picked off, because they are not prepared to speak out for their local public hospitals in their own electorates.
Tasmania is an interesting case because it was only a few weeks ago that we saw something that had never been witnessed in the national parliament. We had a delegation with representatives from the Australian Medical Association's Tasmanian branch, surgeons, nurses and unions that work in the hospital system in Tasmania. They brought up a unified delegation to point out to members of the national parliament the need for extra federal funding for the Tasmanian public hospital system. What has been the response? The member for Braddon, the member for Bass and the five Liberal senators signed their names endorsing the federal Treasury line rather than speaking up for the citizens of Tasmania and the public hospitals of Tasmania.
The point we make and the great tragedy is that, to fund that $1.7 billion failed and discredited health rebate, the government cut the funding from the public hospital system, they abolished the Commonwealth dental health program and they increased the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for ordinary Australians. If they had spent that same amount of money, that same $1.7 billion, directly on patient care, they could have opened an extra 3,000 hospital beds right across the country or treated another 100,000 
 patients. That way they could have kept the operating theatres open longer.
—How many beds?
—That is a 100,000 extra patients who could have been treated with that $1.7 billion. You can imagine the difference that could have made to the constituents of the member for Lyons and you can imagine the difference it would have made to the Tasmanian public hospital system if they had got their share of that $1.7 billion. The problem is that this government and this minister are obsessed with private health insurance. They have tried to walk away from their responsibilities to the public hospital system because of the obsession the Prime Minister has with private health insurance. We on this side of the House are not opposed to private health insurance, but what we say is that, whether or not you have got private health insurance—
—Do you have any?
—I do have private health insurance and I challenge the minister to tell us how long he has had his. How long have you had private health insurance?
—Since I was 18; about 40 years.
—Let us use the example of the minister at the table. He has got private health insurance, but if he or a member of his family is really sick they will be depending on the public hospital system to provide that emergency care and treatment. That is what we depend on. Whether or not we have got private health insurance, when we are really sick we depend on the public hospital system to make sure that we are okay. You cannot simply rely on the private hospitals: they provide the supplementary care which assists. The public system maintains proper and adequate standards and we do not want to walk away from the public system, as this government has.
At the Labor Party National Conference in Hobart, we made one very firm commitment: public hospital funding will be our first priority in health care under a Labor government. The contrast is that this government's agenda is to undermine Medicare by stealth. They undermined Medicare by slashing that 
 $800 million from public hospitals in their first budget. They undermined Medicare by squeezing the GP rebate to force more GPs to switch from bulk-billing to charging up-front fees. They undermined Medicare by making it more expensive for ordinary Australians to afford their essential medicines. They undermined Medicare by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program, to force ordinary Australians to have their teeth pulled out rather than having them filled and having the ordinary preventative dental care they are entitled to.
These are the reasons that we think this government have done the wrong thing in not providing the funding that our state public hospital systems need. That is the reason why all the Premiers and the Northern Territory Chief Minister walked out when this government were not prepared to put more resources into the public hospital system. That is the reason why this government will be defeated at the next election—because of the disgraceful and miserly level of funding they are seeking to offer the state public hospital system.

"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—The shadow minister for health and member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has once again displayed his ignorance of the way the health system works. He has a lack of understanding of what Labor did over 13 years—or perhaps suitable deafness to that; not just plain misunderstanding but not wanting to know the realities. He continues to allege that this $800 million cut that he constantly refers to is just a cut from health but, of course, it is not that at all; it is the contribution that the states agreed to make when we first came to government to help fill in that horrible $10½ billion deficit. The fact that he can attribute all that to health is beyond my understanding.
He has also made comment about the fact that there are Medicare offices closing around the country. There are, but what the coalition government wants to do is to spend money on providing health care rather than finding ways to be constantly administering it. Now there are 130 Medicare fax change facilities in 
 chemists in rural areas, and we will soon have another 400. That is the way we are doing things: we really want to be sensible and cost effective about the way we are spending our very precious health dollars.
We should very briefly look at Labor's record. We have only been in government for two years, and I am proud of what has been achieved. But Labor cannot be too proud of what happened over those 13 years. The member for Dobell has made much about private health insurance. To be perfectly honest, you would think the only thing to do with health was public hospitals and private health insurance. The health debate is much larger than that. We have to be tackling it in all areas. It is complex and I know it is difficult to get around, but we have to do it. It is important to the people of Australia that we do do it.
In 1983, there were 65 per cent of people covered by private health insurance. That fell by more than 30 per cent during the time there was a Labor government. Labor handed the immunisation program over to the states but failed to monitor it, and never checked on what was going on. In 1996, when we came to government, the immunisation rate among Australian children was 53 per cent. That is well below China, Algeria and Vietnam. The current rate now is still lower than some rates in Aboriginal communities around Australia.
Labor refused to acknowledge our ageing population. I used to say from opposition, `When is it going to be acknowledged? When are we going to be planning for it? When is something going to be done about it?' So this government is facing up to those realities.
Despite the fact that private health insurance figures are not quite what we would like them to be, there are 5.885 million Australians with private health insurance, and they do value that. We have provided incentives of up to $450 per family. This benefits 713,000 families with incomes less than $50,000; half a million couples earning less than $50,000; and another half a million singles earning less than $35,000. Presumably, if there is such a commitment, member for Dobell, when you hope to be health minister—although I think that might never occur; I am quite sure it will 
 not because the Australian people will be much smarter than that—the whole idea is to throw that all away so that private health insurance becomes even more important to the people of Australia.
Last November there was legislation introduced which allows doctors and private hospitals to draw up arrangements ensuring that there is informed financial consent, which puts an end to multiple billing and which addresses the out of pocket expenses. So we are tackling these problems on a number of fronts, not just thinking, `Let's hand another bucket of money to public hospitals.' I think public hospitals are very important. They must be adequately funded. They are a very important part of our health system, but so are the private hospitals. There are empty beds in them now. If there had not been such a disgraceful decline in the private health insurance numbers over 13 years we would not be having to battle with the problems we are now.
But, as I have already said, we cannot just be thinking about what happens in hospitals. We should not be just waiting for people to get sick before we treat them. We should be promoting preventative health measures. We should be looking at early intervention. We should be looking at the whole gamut of the way we ensure Australians get a good health care system and adequate health care. It is still, despite the criticisms that are made of it, one of the best systems, if not the best system, in the world.
That is something we should be trumpeting. It does not mean we do not have change. It does not mean we are not always looking at things that can be done better. There will always be changes. There are scientific advances and more medical research and we are getting the benefits of that. There is telemedicine and there are different ways of doing things. If we stand still and just trumpet public hospitals and that funding them is the only way of looking at health care, then we are closing our eyes to reality.
The government has introduced coordinated care trials to help 1.4 million Australians with asthma; 650,000 Australians with diabetes; and a countless number of Australians who 
 are suffering from chronic pain. These are just some of the examples of looking at the whole gamut, the whole health picture. It should not be forgotten that the 1995-96 figures show that Commonwealth expenditure was $2,300 in health care dollars for every person, or 8.5 per cent of GDP. That does not count any private contributions that are made.
The member for Dobell has mentioned the stand-off now with the states. I would have thought that stand-offs with the states were a fairly regular event when health ministers or premiers come to Canberra. That has been part of the games that one expects to see played. As long as I can remember, I have seen games being played in that respect. I personally think—and I have said it quite publicly—that every one of the premiers who walked out of that meeting was jolly stupid to have done so because they were yet to discuss guns and tax reform, which I would have thought would have been fairly important for them and their own budgets.
But let us look at some of the realities. Victoria, for instance, reduced its spending on health by 23 per cent in 1993-94 and is still spending 18 per cent less in real terms than in 1992-93. Queensland reduced spending by 15 per cent in 1993-94 and did not begin spending more until 1995-96. Western Australia made similar reductions. Tasmania—and the member for Dobell was quick to cite Tasmania—reduced spending by 25 per cent in real terms in 1993-94 and has since reduced it a further five per cent. By contrast, the Commonwealth increased its funding by 13 per cent in 1993-94 and by a further six per cent over the life of the Medicare agreements.
The truth of the matter is that spending on health and spending on public hospitals is very important, but let us have some honesty about it. I have to say, with almost some regret, that I recall my friend and then health minister in South Australia remarking publicly how good it was to have saved $60 million out of health spending. I thought at the time that this was really a bit of a tragedy—and we have been proved to be right. The reductions in South Australia, I hasten to add, have not 
 been anywhere near some of those in other states.
If we were to rely on the previous Labor government's forward estimates, there would be $27.3 billion to be spent over the next five years over the current Medicare agreements. But this government has increased that figure to $30.2 billion—a growth of 15 per cent over five years. In addition to this—and this is what I really think is very important, something we have not seen a lot of in the press—there was to be $83 million available for each one per cent decrease in private health insurance should that occur. However, I am also confident that as some of the incentives and a bit of the hard stick we have taken to the high income earners come into effect we will see private health insurance numbers going up again.
If, by any tragedy, that should not occur, built into these Medicare agreements was $83 million for each one per cent decrease. So for the states to argue that we were letting them down over this has been less than honest. If we were to give the states exactly what they were seeking, this would amount to a 33 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding.
We need some honesty in the health debate rather than just playing politics. So often it is said to me in my own electorate and other institutions and electorates that I visit around the country that ideally health would be removed from being a political debate and it is far too important to people to be a political debate. Unfortunately, while there are such philosophical differences and while the opposition chooses to play politics on this, that is unlikely to occur.
Mr Lee interjecting—
—The member for Dobell was not listening. The member for Dobell was actually speaking when I was giving the figures and the arguments that the state Premiers had put forward and why they have been wrong.
—There's $750 million for the veterans.
—That is right; there is $750 million for  veterans. I think it was in the member for Dobell's speech last night that I 
 was reading in Hansard  where he was saying that the states did not even know about it. It is the classic example of why they should have hung around to discuss these details. I just reiterate that if the Premiers had stuck around to talk about these things they would have been better informed.
I was about to give some examples of where Labor would rather play politics, and in fact cheat and mislead the Australian people and the Australian electorate, rather than face up to some of these real issues. I offered the member for Dobell a briefing on the therapeutic group premiums. He said he would like that, but perhaps he felt he did not need it. We made sure that every member and senator in the parliament, no matter what their political persuasion, background or loyalty, received this pack of information, which provided accurate information not put together by politicians or bureaucrats but put together by some very key and well-qualified independent medical and scientific experts.
—Any mistakes?
—I am so pleased the member for Dobell has made this interjection because what we do have here, which I can present today, is a pamphlet that is being distributed around the electorates of Australia, including in South Australia and in my own electorate, headed `Unsafe and unfair'. It refers to medicines on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. They are `unsafe because patients will be pressured to switch to cheaper, older and less effective drugs.' `Even Mr Howard's own experts have said that some of the cheaper drugs are not as safe.' I would love to use the word that we are not allowed to use, but I will not. I will just say that this is a gross misrepresentation of the truth. There would be many manufacturers of medicines, and good manufacturers at that, who would find that deeply offensive. It does not stand up to any scrutiny.
I can provide the member for Dobell, and anybody else who would like to see it, a list of the medicines that are part of that policy, the dates, for instance, that they were listed on the PBS and the premiums. I could go chapter and verse on this, but I will show it to the member for Dobell afterwards so that 
 he can be better informed and not make statements like this. In fact, I hope he will show leadership and actually ask the Labor Party to cancel this misleading brochure so that they will not be misleading the people of Australia in such an improper and shameful way.
This list shows beyond any doubt at all that it is the medicines that have been most recently, except for one example that I am out on, listed on the PBS that have no or the smallest possible premium. It is other medicines that have been there much longer that have a premium. I challenge the member for Dobell to go away to the Labor Party machine and say, `Look, my integrity is at risk here. I would like you to get this right and stop putting out this stuff because really we are misleading the Australian public and, if we are going to have credibility, we should not be doing that.' The wellbeing and the health care of all Australians is far too important to be doing that.
There are other initiatives that the government has taken—further examples that show we should not just be talking about hospitals and hospital funding. I would rather talk about how we care for people before they get into hospitals. There have been major initiatives for carers, unsung heroes in the Australian population who must be cared for. We have resource centres available for them. We have respite centres available for them.
We have a community education program now funded to $17.25 million over the next three years for a comprehensive community-wide education on drugs and drugs of abuse and rehabilitation. We need young people to be aware of the problems they are letting themselves in for. We have made major inroads into the treatment of mental health and we are taking a national and strategic approach to that. We need young people to know that drugs of abuse as well as harming them will also cause them mental health problems. That is something that we have to be taking a lot of care of. We have embarked on the biggest campaign of all time. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1,speech
"Brown, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I am pleased to have this opportunity 
 not only to support the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), on this matter of public importance but, in the process of doing that, to supplement some of the remarks that were made by the member for Dobell on behalf of the opposition as far as this general area is concerned. The matter of public importance refers to `widespread community concern about the damage being done to Australia's health system by the Howard government'. I suppose some people could say, `Well, we might expect the Labor opposition to say that.'
On Friday of last week an unprecedented event occurred. With the exception of one territorial Chief Minister, every Premier and the other Chief Minister at a Premiers Conference in Canberra left the meeting. Unlike on previous occasions, they did not leave the meeting to go out and regroup, redetermine their strategy, come back in and fight again for their states and territories. On this occasion they walked out and went home.
—With good reason.
—As my colleague the member for Throsby says, with good reason. Yes, indeed, with good reason—as I will indicate. Following that walkout we had these comments, for example. The first one I am going to quote is the comment from the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. I want to mention him first because we know that Bob Carr is our political colleague. He is our political comrade as far as pursuing health improvements in Australia is concerned and he is a colleague of the shadow minister, who more than any other person, at least on the government side, has brought to this question integrity, vision, policy development, determination, dedication and commitment. They are just some of the qualities he has brought to this question.
But what did Bob Carr say after that exercise last Friday? He said:
Under John Howard (the government) is treating people with contempt, people who need access to our public hospitals.
Bob Carr is speaking on behalf of every citizen in New South Wales. So when we say that there is widespread community concern about the damage being done to Australia's 
 health system by the Howard government, they had better believe it.
One might well say, `Why wouldn't Bob Carr say that? He is a Labor Premier and he is tied up with that mob in opposition.' But let us have a look at what some of the others have said. The Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett—
—No friend of Labor.
—Exactly; no friend of Labor. Nor necessarily a friend of Bob Carr's. He is a member of the Liberal Party; a member of the conservative coalition. What did Jeff Kennett say? He said that it was `absolutely essential' the base rate of public health funding be lifted by $1.1 billion over five years in the wake of the collapse of private health insurance. Listen to this. He went on to say:
We have been substantially let down because the door's been slammed in our face.
By whom? By this coalition government.
I have just quoted Jeff Kennett. He is a member of the Liberal Party. Let us go to the National Party. Let us go to the other coalition party. He is a colleague of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, and from the minister's own state. What did Rob Borbidge say? He said:
There is not much point all of us coming down here—
that is, to Canberra—
if when we get into the room what is given to us before is `first, final and absolute', regardless of the logic and the argument and the common sense we can bring to the debate.
So Rob Borbidge said, as did Jeff Kennett, that they had the door slammed in their faces by their political mates at the national level.
What did we have from John Olsen, the South Australian Premier? He warned:
. . . the elderly would be the first to be hit by the funding shortfall with delays also likely in the introduction of new technology.
That was John Olsen. What did Richard Court from Western Australia have to say?
—What party is he from?
—He is another member of the Liberal Party.
—Is he a friend of the Labor Party?
—Once again the question is asked of me: is he a friend of Labor? Let me answer that question. No. Is he an enemy of Labor? Yes. Is he a colleague of the present national coalition of the Liberal Party and the National Party? Yes. What did Richard Court say? He said:
What I plead the Federal Government is to look behind the actual dollar figures being provided. There needs to be a recognition at the federal level that the current finances simply can't provide the services that the public is demanding.
Let me repeat that. We said that there was widespread concern about what this government is doing to health. Richard Court said that the present level of funding:
. . . simply can't provide the services that the public is demanding.
That is perfectly correct. We have made the point repeatedly today, and we are going to continue making it, that the federal government, the minister, Dr Wooldridge, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, chose to in effect take the states and territories for a ride and in the process of doing that to also take for a ride 18 million Australians. They said, `We are going to pump extra funds into the health and hospital system. It is going to represent a real increase of 15 per cent over five years.' And it has all been exposed. There are no additional funds at all. They are simply replacing the funds that this coalition government ripped out of the system. 	 I am genuinely sympathetic for members of the government who find themselves in a public position where they have to get up and defend the indefensible. I say that particularly about Mrs Trish Worth, the member for Adelaide, who just led for the government in seeking to defend it. Mrs Worth had a very successful background in the area of health before she came into this parliament. She has now the responsibility of defending what she knows to be indefensible. I am going to give only two examples out of the comments that Mrs Worth made.
—Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their titles.
—The member for Adelaide referred to the games they play when they come to Canberra. She was talking about the premiers. The premiers and the chief ministers were not playing games when they came to Canberra. The people playing the games were the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). The member for Adelaide also said that spending on health is very important, but then she said:
. . . let us have some honesty about it.
Let us have some honesty about it, indeed. What are these games that are played when premiers and chief ministers come to Canberra? And who plays the games? We are talking about the health of Australians. To my mind that is something objective; it is something for which measurable and quantitative judgments can be made about the volume of funds which are necessary for it.
Let me just go over some of the childish, stupid tactics of the federal government. The initial proposal, as you know, was an offer of $3 billion extra from the Commonwealth. That was over and above the amount of $26 billion that had been provided under the previous agreement. That made it $29 billion that the Commonwealth offered. After that, the Commonwealth offered another $80 million to 100 million and then upped that to $120 million because the states and the territories had dug their heels in, saying that it was not enough. The Commonwealth increased its offer from $29 billion to $30.17 billion. This is like a Persian market. These are the fun and games. This is the way the present federal government responds to the legitimate concerns on the part of state premiers and territorial chief ministers.
The Sydney Morning Herald on 26 March said that the Prime Minister had indicated yesterday that the states might not get a better offer than the 15 per cent increase but he left open the possibility that they would. These are the games being played by this national government. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1,speech
"West, Andrea, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—I have heard a lot today. It seems to me there is a lot of huffing and puffing going on from the other side. Health has always been a critical issue in this country but I have never come across the hypocrisy of the ones elected to the other side who are just trying to cover up 13 years of guilt. It is guilt that has been expressed by the honourable members on the other side, who are trying to cover up their inefficiencies, their inadequacies and their inability to address the same problems we are facing in 1997 and 1998 as they were facing in 1990 and 1983. The more they went on nothing seemed to change, but we are now in the box seat to reform what you failed to address over 13 years of ineffective administration.
—You reformed the Wynnum Medicare office!
—Yes, the member for Dobell brings up an interesting point. It is all very well for you to talk about the Wynnum Medicare office closure. It is an unfortunate situation. The reason it is closing is that there were not enough accounts going through that office.
—So it should have been closed?
—Yesterday you indicated your widespread community concern in Wynnum. The Macquarie Dictionary  defines widespread as `distributed over a wide region, or occurring . . . among many persons or individuals'. You attended a protest at Wynnum yesterday in my electorate. You saw around 70 people as representing widespread concern. Of course it was reported in the press as being over 100 but, then, people do tend to exaggerate when they want to make things seem more important than they are.
—Labor Party branch, was it?
—Absolutely; all their hacks, because my people were among the crowd as well and they asked the people in the protest about whether they used the service. They did not use the service and the people they asked did not use the service either. Get your facts right. The reason the Medicare office is closing is that people are voting with their 
 feet. They were beating up a storm in a teacup.
We are in trouble if the member for Dobell becomes the minister because the public purse will be hit and hit hard. I suggest that the Labor Party will also have the old bankcard out, spending and spending or increasing taxes to satisfy the shadow minister's understanding of what he calls `widespread concern'. Who allowed the private health system to run down?
—Labor.
—Labor. They presided over a system which, in 13 years, saw private health insurance coverage of Australians fall from 65 per cent to 34.5 per cent. It is still falling. This decline in private health cover has placed intolerable demands on the public system. The Labor legacy in 1982-83 was a cost for health of $220 per capita. In 1997 the cost has risen to $1,150. The costs of private health insurance in 1983 were $505 for a family; today they are $2,500.
We have only been in office for 24 months. All that grief was not of our doing. All those increases were not because of a coalition government. Who was in power? Labor. The Labor Party created a system of unsustainable proportions. And if the trend of the decade continues, we will have gone from a $3.4 billion allocation towards health in 1983 to over $20.7 billion in the next four years. For a population of 18 million that is a huge impost. If Labor come to office again, where will they get that kind of money? There is more too, because the different shadow ministers argue amongst themselves over how much is going to be needed to address the current health care problems. Where are they going to get it? Let me think: what did they do last time? Can we trust them? Can we risk it? I do not think so. They will whack it on the bankcard and create problems for the whole Australian community.
Which party created the chaos in our public health system? Labor. They presided over a clearly unsustainable budget situation. They left the Australian people a legacy of $10.5 billion in deficit. In 1996 our nation's Medicare benefit schedule was $6.2 billion. 
 That is more than the budget of Western Australia, and it is expected to rise a further 40 per cent in the next four years. Labor increased the Medicare levy by 1.5 per cent after promising not to do so. This increase failed to add any benefit to the health system as pressures were occurring because of the declining cover of Australians by private insurance. Labor has not delivered. In 1996 Australia's immunisation rate was only 53 per cent, well below China, Algeria and Vietnam. Even the smallest island state of Samoa has a higher immunisation rate of 97 per cent.
Labor's national Aboriginal health strategy collapsed; in fact in 1996 the state of health of indigenous Australians was relatively worse than it was in 1983. I am pleased to say that I am part of a standing committee that is looking into a 20-year reassessment of indigenous health problems. We are going to make recommendations, and Labor will be held accountable for the changes that need to be made by a committed government that will ensure that the health of all Australians is of a high quality. The coalition government has committed $1.7 billion to private health insurance to allow battlers to maintain their health cover in an effort to reduce the flourishing waiting lists created by 13 years of Labor government. The coalition has preserved funding for hospitals. The state governments are reducing hospital funding, not the coalition. I commend the state minister for health in Queensland, Mr Horan, who is doing an excellent job of maintaining public health facilities and doing very nicely. In fact, my electorate has two projects that will see benefits directly linked to services provided in the community by a coalition led state government.
Which party watched as the aged care system declined under the cuts to funding which were invoked, despite the advice that they had received from their best mates? You could not even take the advice given by your best Labor mates to improve the system. And what happened? You did not take their advice and after 13 years you are in opposition, we are in government, and the country is absolutely awake to the lies and mythology that you perpetrated for 13 years.
We inherited your mess. During your time in office there were widespread concerns. I draw attention to a briefing note from my colleague Dr Brendan Nelson, who last night quoted what the Australian Financial Review of 10 April 1992 had to say when Mr Brian Howe was the health minister. The article said:
Federal and State government health ministers are expected to open next week's negotiations on the new five-year Medicare agreement with a clash over hospital funding.
So what has changed? Mr Keith Wilson, a member of the Carmen Lawrence Labor state government of the day, said:
. . . I want to draw attention to the major issues which are of primary concern to me as Minister for Health in Western Australia—the provision of hospital services in that state.
He goes on:
The pre-eminent issue, which I believe this conference must focus on, is that seriously sick Australians are daily unable to gain access to needed hospital treatment.
That was in 1992. What did you do for the last six years? Nothing. There were problems in 1992, so why didn't you fix them? Why didn't you fix the Commonwealth-state funding issue? Why didn't you see the problems that needed to be addressed and do something about them? After 24 months, we are in the process of doing something positive for the health system. It will not happen overnight; it might not happen in one term, but it will happen if the community of Australia gets behind those with faith, and we have faith that the coalition government will overcome these health problems. We have a `get tough on drugs' campaign. For the first time this nation's mentally ill will have genuine representation. (Time expired)

Note:	 If a State does not enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth before 2 June 1998, the purpose of this Part is modified by the operation of section 28.
(2)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 5 (line 7), after ""section 26"", insert ""(including section 26 as varied in the circumstances set out in subsection 28(4))"".
(3)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 7 (lines 12 to 14), omit section 28, substitute:
	 28  Financial assistance conditional on entry into agreement
(1)	 Financial assistance is payable to a State under this Part in respect of the 5 years starting on 1 July 1998 only if the State has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth before 2 June 1998.
(2)	 If a State does not enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth before 2 June 1998, the Commonwealth may, in a law providing for the annual appropriation of money in respect of the year starting on 1 July 1998, provide for the payment of financial assistance to the State in respect of that year on such terms and conditions, including terms and conditions requiring adherence by the State to the Health Care Agreement Principles set out in section 29 of this Act, as are determined in writing by the Minister. 

(3)	 If a State enters into an agreement with the Commonwealth on or after 2 June 1998 and before 1 July 1999, financial assistance is payable to the State under this Part in respect only of the 4 years starting on 1 July 1999.
(4)	 For the purpose of the application of this Part in circumstances where a State enters into an agreement with the Commonwealth on or after 2 June 1998 and before 1 July 1999, this Part has effect as if each reference to the 5 years starting on 1 July 1998 were a reference to the 4 years starting on 1 July 1999.
The government amendments are intended to provide a mechanism to honour the government's commitment to provide funding to the states for health care next year on the basis set out in the Commonwealth offer, regardless of walkouts by petulant premiers. If the states will not sign up, we will provide the funding through an annual appropriation on the condition that the states adhere to the principles set out in this bill.
Once the states come to their senses some time in 1998-99 and sign up, the amendments will allow them to receive funding under this bill for 1999 to 2000 and later years. Many payments to the states are provided under the annual appropriation and I see there is no good reason why the Commonwealth contribution to state health budgets cannot be provided in this way for 1998-99. Of course, it will be difficult to achieve the reforms we are seeking without agreements with the states, but that is another reason why I am confident that the states will sign up sooner or later. They value reform and endorse and welcome it just as much as the Commonwealth.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (HEALTH CARE AGREEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in detail</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Lawrence, Carmen, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—Not satisfied with cutting expenditure on the public health system by almost $2 billion and states grants by much the same amount since its election, the government has now made the states an offer under the new Medicare agreements which will seriously exacerbate the already parlous state of our public hospital system.
If we need an example, it was provided today in a story in the West Australian under the headline `New hospital hits budget 
 problems'. The state government's first fully privatised public hospital has actually had to cancel all elective surgery because of a budget blow-out. It has not been able to get extra funds from the government, demand has been much higher than anticipated and already in the northern suburbs of Western Australian there is a two-tiered system. What is happening is that the hospitals are offering people a place for elective surgery if they can pay for it and if they cannot it has been cancelled altogether. That is what we are `looking forward to' with these changes.
Having served in both levels of government, I am very well aware of the manoeuvres which can be employed by each side to make the other look culpable for any budget cuts and any systems failures. Sadly, our federal system does invite such behaviour, particularly when the governments are of opposite political persuasions. This makes this dispute all the more puzzling, because these are the mates of the conservatives in government.
On many occasions during my time as minister I had to draw attention to the behaviour of conservative state governments, particularly Victoria and, at the time, New South Wales and Western Australia, who were cutting their own funds for hospital services while the Commonwealth was steadily increasing funding as a result of the 1993 Medicare agreements. The result then was a zero sum game and no discernible improvement in either the quality of services or in waiting times for elective surgery. What the Commonwealth put in with one hand, the states took out with another.
I also very clearly recall the derision with which this observation was greeted by the current Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). In their eyes, the conservative state governments who were pulling these funds out could do no wrong. Even the very blatant cost cutting and cost shifting being perpetrated by the Kennett government in Victoria aroused no censure at all from members of this government, including the current health minister whose state it is.
It was clear at the time, and it is clear now, that any future agreements would need both 
 stiffer sanctions—and we do not see that at all in this legislation—and better incentives to ensure that both sides stick to the rules and abrogate any tricky devices to make someone else pay the bill, often the private health insurer or the individual. The focus needs to be firmly on achieving quality services for the patient and the community at a reasonable total cost. There is no point in shifting the burden around if you are gradually increasing the costs to the community.
While the Prime Minister has in recent days tried to use my arguments to bolster his current position in relation to the states, he simply demonstrates to me and to many others that he does not know, or pretends not to know, what is really going on now. The Prime Minister need only examine the figures produced by independent researchers at both the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Bureau of Statistics to understand the wails of the state governments. Why are they shrieking so loudly? Why have they walked out on their own political colleagues?
The funding game which Dr Wooldridge boldly claimed he would personally eliminate has—courtesy of this government's budgetary strategy—now seesawed in the opposite direction. The states, poor souls, have actually been increasing their funding in the last couple of years and the Commonwealth has now pulled the funds out from Commonwealth sources. Again, the net result is no increase in hospital funding.
From the time the Labor government was elected in 1983, the proportion of health funding provided by the Commonwealth increased while the proportion from the states and territories declined. We have seen a turnaround in the last couple of budgets. What has happened, of course, is that from 1990 onwards the states pulled out substantial funding. I do not know if it is permissible to incorporate this, but I have here a table drawn from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare statistics which shows very clearly what happened. As the Commonwealth was increasing its funding under the 1993 agreement, the states were clearly decreasing theirs. By the end of 1996 they had put it back in again, and they have continued to do so. The result is a zero sum game, because the Commonwealth has not only taken money out in the last two budgets, but also is threatening to take even more in the new Medicare agreements.
As a former health minister and premier, I call on this government to actually make a decent offer which takes account of the cost escalation, including the increasing number of people who need the services because of the ageing of the community and demographic changes, and not to bury its head in the sand.
—Order! Is the honourable member for Fremantle seeking leave to incorporate?

—Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum to these amendments.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (HEALTH CARE AGREEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in detail</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—As I speak on the amendments which have been moved on behalf of the government in relation to financial assistance conditional on entry into agreement, I think we need to reflect on the Labor Party's record on health care over the 13 years from 1983 to 1996. That record was absolutely appalling, as we all know—and even my Labor colleagues in this chamber would begrudgingly agree.
Speaking of poor records, let us look at New South Wales. For all appearances, the New South Wales health system seems to have been run into the ground. This is despite the absolute dedication of the health professionals in my electorate of Paterson and the operation of both private and public hospital institutions in areas such as Maitland, Dungog, Gloucester—and, of course, not forgetting the polyclinic at Nelson Bay. Indeed, this extends right across the Hunter, including the acclaimed John Hunter facility. No slick PR campaign across our airwaves which is supported, authorised and endorsed by the New South Wales government is going to change bald facts.
The New South Wales health system has some major problems—problems such as are had in any other Western health care system—which the current health care agreement on offer now on the table will help to address. Just to keep things in perspective, the New South Wales 1997-98 base grant entitlement funding equates to $1.472 billion. The base funding under the new AHCA for 1998-99 equals $1.528 billion—an increase of 3.76 per cent for New South Wales. It equates to an extra $55.4 million extra in one year alone for base funding for New South Wales hospital services, and $58.2 million in new funding for veterans' health services provision in my state. It would deliver up to $41.3 million under the `cut waiting lists' incentive and, of course, extra money for capital works.
But NSW's claim—from the mouth of Dr Refshauge—to obtain, with the rest of the 
 states collectively, an extra $1.1 billion in the first year and $5.5 billion over five years in hospital funding is just not cricket. And that is even on top of the growth in forward estimates, which I outlined earlier. Indeed, the good doctor's claims for additional funding under the new health agreement are about wanting to take his bat and ball and head home. They ring hollow when the extent to which costs are shifted onto the Commonwealth by the New South Wales public hospital system is taken into account.
According to Dr Refshauge, New South Wales does not cost shift to the Commonwealth. But example after example of cost shifting has been exhibited. For example, there is the Nepean Hospital in outer Sydney, admitting patients from accident and emergency as private patients when they have asked to be admitted as public patients. There is the St George Hospital, reclassifying public patients to private status. Then, locally in the Hunter region, there is the John Hunter Hospital, reclassifying public day-only patients for gastroscopies and colonoscopies to private outpatients, and billing Medicare. It is pretty difficult to understand how Dr Refshauge can claim to be short-changed by the Commonwealth when it appears as though cost shifting already funded under the current Medicare agreements back to the Commonwealth is endemic in the New South Wales health system.
This issue is not a game; it is not about kicking the political football of health care funding around the park just for the hell of it. In fact, we should not be playing this game at all. Not only are the people of NSW—including, specifically, the people of the Hunter—quite frankly, fed up and mentally exhausted, having little idea as to what the belligerent states or Commonwealth are really on about over all this debate, but so are the people of Australia. Millions are being jumbled with billions; politicians, unsurprisingly, are taking opposite ends of an argument to, presumably, suit their own ends and their own political needs.
But I do have to say this: if the likes of Bob Carr and Andrew Refshauge want to make a significant contribution to the health 
 care debate, they need to do a few things. Firstly, they have to sign the latest Australian health care agreement; secondly, get their own financial act in order to sustain their promises on health care; and, thirdly, if they want to make a contribution in the area of private health insurance, let us go about it collectively and in an orderly fashion in the right way.
I am a big supporter of private health insurance. We need private health insurance. Indeed, the time may soon come where we need to sit down and have a good hard look 
 at prospects for its possible tax deductibility, even an assessment of the continued effectiveness of community rating or even gap insurance. But if and when that time comes, we need to do it in the right way and at the right time. In conclusion, I seek leave to table this graph: `Growth in own source recurrent hospital expenditure—Commonwealth and all states'.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I rise in support of the amendments put forward by the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). I also want to express my outrage that I have been denied, once again, an opportunity to participate in the second reading debate on this bill—as I was denied the opportunity yesterday to participate in the debate on the Aged Care Bill. Both bills are very important to the people of my electorate, and they are very important to the people in the electorates of all those members on this side who have been denied that opportunity.
I am a little bit disappointed with the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Baldwin). I issued an invitation to him last night during the adjournment debate. Having seen his name on the speakers list for this bill, I extended to him an invitation to come in here today and stick up for his constituents for a change. He has done nothing to support the coalminers; he does not even return their phone calls.
—That's crap. You're a liar.
—His opportunity here today was to forget about party—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. You might not have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the member for Paterson accused the member for Hunter of being a liar. I ask that you remind him of the normal rules of behaviour in this place.
—As the honourable member for Dobell quite rightly put it, I was distracted at the time. But, if the honourable member for Paterson did use that expression, even by way of interjection, he should withdraw it.
—I withdraw it and replace it with—
—Order! No, the honourable member for Paterson—
—`poorly handling the truth'.
—No. The honourable member for Paterson should withdraw unreservedly.
—The member for Paterson had a golden opportunity today to come into this House and, for once in his two years here, defend the people he is meant to be representing—to come in here and criticise and recognise that his own government is screwing the people in his own electorate.
What did he do instead? It was the same old line. He came in here with a written speech which was basically a tirade against the Carr Labor government. There was no mention of Borbidge or Kennett. There was no mention of the fact that all of the conservative premiers, as mentioned earlier by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), walked out of the Premiers Conference last Friday. There was no mention of any of the conservative premiers or territory leaders. The member for Paterson simply wanted to single out the Carr Labor government.
But he cannot have it both ways. I am a bit mixed up about his logic. He spent half of his time trying to tell us, fairly poorly, about the situation in his electorate. He named each of the hospitals; he got them into the Hansard so that he could spit them out to the various groups in the electorate. He got all of the names in. He did not suggest any of them were in need of additional funding. What he said was that they were all doing wonderfully. But then he told us that the whole system was under stress because of the Carr Labor government. You cannot have it both ways.
There is a simple fact in life, and that is that the coalition got bitten on Medicare at the 1993 election. In my view, they probably lost that election on Medicare alone. The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was not going to get caught twice. They went to the 1996 election with a definite different view. On this occasion—
—Mr Deputy Speaker—
—He's just using up my time, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—Order! The honourable member for Paterson on a point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. When I spoke previously the Deputy Speaker at the time drew my 
 attention to the fact that we were supposed to be debating the amendment before the House. The amendment before the House is financial assistance conditional on entry into an agreement. The member for Hunter has gone everywhere else except that.
—Order! The honourable member for Paterson will resume his seat. I am sure the honourable member for Hunter knows the requirements to keep relevant to the question before the House.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I am addressing the amendments before the House but the member for Paterson does not like it. What does he do? He pops up—usually twice in every speech I make—to try to use up my time. I have already been denied a speech on the second reading stage, and the member for Paterson wants to deny me a contribution at this stage because he does not like what he is hearing.
I want to return to my point. What did the member for Bennelong do in 1996? He went to the people this time guaranteeing them that he would leave Medicare alone. What has he done since? What he is doing is dismantling it through the backdoor. He is dismantling it by taking a ridiculous attitude at the Premiers Conference. He is doing it through the backdoor by squeezing Medicare rebates, which is causing general practitioners, particularly in the electorate of the member for Paterson, to abandon bulk-billing at a rate of knots.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,1998-03-26,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.
—Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?
—Most grievously.
—Please proceed.
—There was a question today in the House asked by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) which I wish to respond to because I have been misrepresented. At no time did I claim that the government had begun a review of the results of the successful employment tenderers in the Byron Shire. Beyond the results of the Job Network 
 tender, there are additional employment issues which I have raised and have written to the minister about and which he indicated his understanding on a recent visit to the Byron Shire. The Commonwealth's Northern Rivers Areas Consultative Committee—better known as ACC—will be looking at employment services in the Byron Shire. The ACC advise that they are examining this situation and that the minister has requested that they advise the government of their findings.
—With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am trying to determine whether the member for Richmond has just indicated to the House that the minister earlier misled the House?
—The chair is in no position to judge that.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, to relieve you of what is clearly a difficult situation, let me say that I was in conversation with the shadow minister. He has sought the call briefly and I am prepared to concede that to him at this stage.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—These particular amendments before the House at the moment seek to give the government the flexibility to negotiate basically a one-year agreement or to allow the government to continue to pay the states funding for public hospitals for one year. We have a number of questions about this matter. I am sure that the parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), has a detailed knowledge of these issues, especially considering the quality of the experts that are in the advisers box at the moment. So I am sure he can answer these detailed questions.
We would like to know whether the government has received any legal advice on whether these amendments provide the same level of protection as would be the case if the five-year Medicare agreements had been concluded with the states. In particular, we would like to know whether there is an equal amount of reassurance for the patients of Australia that they will not have a state government or 
 territory government introduce new charges or fees if they are treated in public hospitals. There is a lot of scuttlebutt in this building that, if Mr Kennett and the other premiers and territory ministers do not sign agreements with this government and you end up going down the route proposed in these amendments, this is a second-best option; that this will not provide the same level of protection as the five-year Medicare agreements.
Firstly, is that the case? Will there be the same level of protection? Secondly, does the government have legal advice seeking to confirm that there will be the same amount of protection for patients and that they will not be slugged with new fees and charges? Because at the end of the day these agreements are about making sure that public patients are not charged for treatment in public hospitals. One of the essential elements of Medicare is that every Australian should have reasonable access to a public hospital in a reasonable amount of time. We would like to know before this debate finishes whether the government can give us the answers to those two questions. Will there be the same amount of protection? Does the government have legal advice to justify such a reassurance? And will they make a copy available to the opposition?

"Andrew, Neil, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—I rose somewhat provoked by the allegation of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) that the government had in some way sought to so compress this debate that he was denied his democratic rights to represent the people of the Hunter. As the Chief Government Whip, I am painfully aware and I suspect that he is reasonably well aware of the fact that the very issue we are debating in the half an hour devoted now is well above what was originally negotiated and was designed to accommodate the opposition. I would have thought he may have been a little more gracious about that.
In dealing with these health amendments, everyone in this House, regardless of which side they sit on, recognises the real problem. The real problem is the escalating cost of 
 health care. No-one in this House at least over 30 years of age is not well aware that health care is inevitably going to cost whoever is in power more and more of its share of the taxpayers' revenue.
Let me illustrate the point. Perhaps before the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) was thought of, 30 years ago I had an appendicectomy with little more than a kitchen knife on a table, if you know what I mean. Today, if I fronted up to my local GP and he said, `You need your appendix removed,' I would say, as I suspect every other male and female around here would, `With a body like mine, you really cannot afford to scar it. So I would like keyhole surgery. I would like laser treatment—I want to be back at work tomorrow—and as little bloodshed as possible.' That is fine. He will do it for me. But, effectively, it will cost a great deal more than the treatment using a kitchen knife on the kitchen table.
Precisely the same analogy applies to any one of the medical practices that we now take for granted. Thirty years ago a heart condition diagnosed in someone my age may well have been fatal. Today the doctor says, `We will replumb.' The question of the cost scarcely even enters into it. Even more remarkably—and thankfully—diseases of 30 years ago that effectively would have killed us, terminal illnesses, can now be kept at bay because of modern surgery. All of these practices cost money, and they cost an increasing proportion of the health budget. That is the bind that the government faces, it is a bind that the opposition faced when they were in government for 30 years, and it is a bind to which there is no easy solution.
It is compounded by the fact that, for people in our salary bracket, going to the doctor is a ridiculously cheap exercise. Let us say it costs $25 for a consultation: the government picks up $18 or something like that. For those on the other end of the salary scale, going to the doctor remains an expensive exercise, much of which rightly is picked up by the general taxpayer. It is exacerbated by the fact that in 1989 many people on well below average weekly earnings, who therefore were unable to afford private health insurance, probably were forced to spend more money 
 on maintaining their car than maintaining their health. This is the bind the government faces: how do you bridge this gap between the escalating cost of health and the willingness of people in our salary bracket to pay and the ability of people in a lower salary bracket to pay?
That is why health is becoming an increasing problem for state governments. The federal government has not walked away from it, as the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) had suggested. State governments increasingly have tended to depend on the federal government. As the minister made it quite obvious, the federal government is picking up more and more of the share of the health cost but, in doing so, the state governments—whether conservative or not—have tended to walk away from some of their responsibility.
In the time remaining, I must add that, while this is a complex and difficult problem, it is not a problem which we should shirk. On the world scale, Australia still delivers a first-class health service at a very competitive price. We have a problem we have to resolve, but relative to our surrounding countries and relative to the rest of the world—with the possible exception of the Swedes and the Japanese—we have a health system that is the envy of much of the rest of the world, and the government is committed through this legislation to maintaining that system.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (HEALTH CARE AGREEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in detail</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Morris, Peter, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—The previous speaker cannot move away from the fact that it is not the availability of resources; it is what you do with the resources. The $1.7 billion that your government has pumped into trying to prop up private health insurance is your problem.
This government labours under its own mythology that the solution to health care problems is in the private sector. Fewer than one person in three across this nation, from coast to coast, thinks that putting money into private health insurance funds is value for money. So the more than two out of three persons who are left are condemned to the degradation of the health service because your government refuses to allocate resources.
—Because those people will not accept their responsibility.
—It creates a triple barrel effect. You can labour on in your mythology, but do not interrupt me, please—I listened to you quietly. There are three barrels coming out of this. The first is that you slashed $800 million out of the public hospital program. Second, the movement of people into the public hospital sector, because of their lack of confidence and trust in the private health sector, is added to the burden of the public hospitals. In Maitland, which is in the electorate of the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who has just left the chamber and who supports this system, the cost of running its hospital has gone up by $1.5 million a year because an extra 610 patients are now being treated by that hospital because they have walked away from private health care. They do not see value in it. Do you opposite not understand that?
The third effect is that, while government members are saying, `We support Medicare; we want the best health care system,' they are busily closing 43 Medicare offices across this country, striking at the people in our community who most need immediate cash payments from Medicare. They do not have the money to go to the doctor, outlay $70 to $100 and then wait two or three weeks to get the money back. They need the money immediately to go from the doctor, to the pharmacy, to the supermarket. Do you not understand that? That is the problem. They are the people you are hitting at.
The member for Paterson had the temerity a few weeks ago to support the closing of the Belmont Medicare office in my electorate. Again, he is somebody who labours in mythology. He ought to face up to the facts of the situation. Medicare is desired by the vast majority of the Australian community.
Let me draw your minds to 1986, when the same man who is now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), said, `Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster.' Those opposite should have the guts to go out to the community and say that to the people now rather than doing it as a subterfuge. He then went on to say that radical surgery will need to be performed on 
 Medicare and that bulk-billing will be abolished. You are trying to create a situation where Medicare will become unacceptable and people will be angry with it, then justifying the need for another health care system. Please give a thought, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker—
—That is better.
—For the people who need support through cash payments through Medicare facilities and treatment in public hospitals. As the honourable member said earlier, what needs to be done is to provide support for the improvement of care in the public hospital system. What are you asking, Mr Deputy Speaker? My five minutes have not elapsed. Why are you looking at me?
—I just wanted you to be aware that when I sit in this chair I do not have the problems you are alerting that I have.
—I am required by the standing orders to address my remarks to you—and far be it for me to do otherwise.
—Do it through the chair.
—I am doing that; that is exactly my point. Please do not take up my time.
—You will address your remarks through the chair; do not address them to members across the chamber.
—You know that I am doing that via you. I shall not comment on it; others can hear it. As the current Prime Minister said in 1986, just 12 years ago, his belief was—and the policy of those opposite was—that Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster, that it needs radical surgery and that bulk-billing will be abolished. I want to tell those opposite this: you can pretend to yourselves—like the member for Bowman (Mrs West) said—that those who turned up at her Medicare rally were Labor hacks. I dearly wish that the almost 14,000 signatures that have been gathered just around Belmont alone in my electorate in support of the retention of 
 Belmont Medicare office were those of Labor hacks. But they are voters and, regardless of their political colour, they know they have a good service. They want that service. To hear this mythology again coming from the other side of the House shows they do not understand. My friend the member for Paterson has come back. My friend—through you, Mr Deputy Speaker—you look after your Medicare offices; I do not want you supporting the closure of my Medicare office.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—During the debate the shadow minister raised a couple of questions which I wish to respond to briefly. I think that his questions really revolved around the certainty of protection—to make sure that there is the same protection for individuals and for people who might be using hospital services—and around the prospect of states making further or new charges. I would like to draw his attention to the Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998 , which clearly states that it will provide for payments of financial assistance to the states in respect of that year on such terms and conditions including the terms and conditions requiring adherence by the state to the health care agreement principles. So the health care agreement principles must be contained in any agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the states. The Commonwealth minister determines the broad conditions, but those principles must be contained within those conditions.
—But is it as good as the five-year agreement?
—I am advised that the government's role in these things is to improve health conditions; so, yes, it certainly is as good as the five-year agreement. Those health care agreement principles are the five-year principles; they are embodied in the five-year agreement.
—The second question was: have you had legal advice?
—The legal advice available to me is that the conditions are determined by 
 the minister but that the minister must include adherence by the states to the health care agreement principles within those conditions.

"Morris, Peter, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—This afternoon I want to draw attention to action by the Federal Airports Corporation to massively increase landing charges at Sydney airport for regional airline operators. The effect of that in the Hunter area would be to increase, for instance, charges per passenger for Impulse Airlines from $6 per passenger up to $28 per passenger by the year 2000, and similarly for aircraft operating out of Belmont for Aeropelican the total effect of the increase would be to increase by 332 per cent the cost of the landing charges they would be eligible to pay—in other words, from $135,000 to $450,000 per year.
What that scale of charges constitutes is effectively a strategy to lock regional airline operators out of Sydney airport. The people I represent in the Hunter and on the Central Coast are not going to accept second-class treatment in respect of airline services from this government. We, as non-metropolitan Australians, are as much entitled to easy air access to the international and national airline network as are metropolitan Australians in the Sydney region. Access to that service is critically important for family reasons, for the conduct of business, for industry reasons, for access of our customers to the Hunter region to visit and see the products we sell and to inspect the services we provide, and it is of extreme importance for the growth of our tourism industry.
I call on the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) to direct the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), who has now joined in the attack on regional airlines in his newsletter, to cease his attacks on regional airlines and regional airline passengers. I refer to the newsletter put out by the Minister for Finance and Administration in his own electorate entitled `Airport News for Macarthur', March 1998. A paragraph in that reads:
If regional and other smaller flights such as these—
referring to regional and non-scheduled flights—  
can be diverted to another airport, perhaps Bankstown, it may be that a second airport is not required for decades to come—it's a possibility that would require detailed investigation.
That is a fallacy from beginning to end. Bankstown is not an alternate airport in terms of service and accessibility for regional airlines. The linkage for regional airlines is into the national airline network and into the international airline network in both its inbound and outbound services.
I also call on the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to direct the Federal Airports Corporation—he has that power under the act—to abandon its proposed increased charges. That matter would be most detrimental to the people I represent, and particularly to the people of the Hunter.
I make one last plea in these few minutes to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I have spoken in this House several times already in support of the retention of Belmont Medicare office. I have written to the minister this week and I have spoken to the minister this week. It is scheduled to be closed tomorrow. I want to be able to go back to Belmont tomorrow and have a celebration for the people of Belmont. Not for me—it does not matter to me; it is not me that is affected—but the people in the families who need immediate cash payments after they have been to the doctor.
I want him to reverse that decision. I cling to that hope. I am waiting on a response from him. I have indicated to him that there would certainly be recognition of that reversal of opinion. Sure, it would take some courage, but it can be done and in this case it ought to be done. Almost 14,000 signatures have appeared on petitions I have presented to this parliament in support of the retention of that office. That ought to be a clear indication to everybody how important that service is to Australians. They want their Medicare service. They want access to reasonable health care, to quality health care, and they want access to immediate cash payments after they have been to the doctor and paid their bills.
So I appeal to the minister again, remembering also that we have seen from this government in its commitment to health care 
 $800 million stripped from the public hospital system. We have seen a situation where $1.7 billion has been pumped into private health funds when less than one in three people in this country believe that private health funds are value for money.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I want to share with parliament a big mystery. Where is the television video camera from Port Kembla wharf? I suspect many of my colleagues have video cameras either at home or in their offices, but this one is different. This television video camera—closed circuit television camera—happened to be installed in a building at the Port Kembla grain terminal. It was installed to monitor activity on the grain berth and I actually saw it during a tour of Port Kembla last year. But this piece of technological equipment, I am informed by sources, has gone missing.
I was informed last year in October that it had a technical problem and was taken back to Sydney. Information I have been provided with suggests that it is still in Sydney, probably in a packed box, a full 80 kilometres away from where it is supposed to be. It is in Sydney at a time when Port Kembla is a wide open import centre for drugs.
The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) last week made an outrageous statement that I was playing party politics with the drug issue. I do not apologise for raising this issue or campaigning to ensure that the customs officers at Port Kembla are provided with essential resources to protect the community. I cannot understand or accept that a customs service with only five officers can adequately cover an entire area from Sutherland to the Victorian border. There were 16 officers two years ago. This government, perennial penny-pinchers, are responsible for this.
How can just five officers cover this massive area in a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift? Now I am advised that their current office at the coalface in Darcy Street, Port Kembla has just been sold off for $180,000 and they are all to be relocated in the Wollongong central business district. If it were not so serious, it would be funny: a port, which is wide open with only five officers, one hand tied behind their backs, operating on a ludicrous office hour shift, with no monitoring equipment, and now moved away from Port Kembla itself to the central business district of Wollongong. And I am accused of playing party politics.
If the minister wants me to provide bipartisan support, I am happy to do so, but only when the Port Kembla customs service is resourced properly to do their job of protecting the community. Port Kembla is in my electorate. It is the gateway to drug importation and I see kids able to get hard drugs for less than the cost of a packet of cigarettes. I will not stop raising this issue until this government takes the fight on drugs more seriously.
If the minister wants me to shut up, it is possible. Put the Port Kembla customs service in a position, fully resourced, to close the huge gap which allows drugs into New South Wales and Australia. Always bear in mind that Port Kembla is less than an hour's journey from Cabramatta, the drug distribution centre of Australia. It is essential that the service at Port Kembla be restored to what it was when Labor was in power.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Customs Service: Port Kembla </title>,Statements by Members,35,1,speech
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I would like to conclude my much postponed and interrupted speech by focusing particularly on the issues about the death benefit. If we look t the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 , which is before the 
 Committee, in relation to this issue of death benefits there is a proposal—which I believe is a big step forward from the current situation—to allow fund members to nominate those who are to receive the benefit in the event of their death while they are at work. However, there are some preconditions on this flexibility: there is a three-year expiry date on any nomination; the sole purpose test must be applied to the nomination—in other words, you cannot nominate a friend as a beneficiary; the nomination must be witnessed; and the nomination is to be disclosed in the member's annual members statement.
The last two matters are unobjectionable and, indeed, I believe are very desirable—that is, the nomination be witnessed and that it be disclosed each year in the annual members statement. Both those things are fully supported. However, with respect to the three-year expiry date, I believe that that is a fairly patronising attempt in the legislation to limit people's choice about the way in which they nominate beneficiaries.
Most people do not anticipate their early demise. If that is to occur during one's working life, it would often be very unexpected and often quite sudden. And people do not plan well for their early death—that is the obvious reality of daily life. We all hope to live into retirement and to fully collect on our superannuation benefits. Therefore, a three-year expiry period automatically means that many people will not have a valid nomination at the very point when they need it because, if it expires every three years, only a small percentage of people will remember to renew that nomination every three years. So I would suggest that most will end up being expired at the point when they are actually required.
The reality is that people are not required to update their will. A will remains valid notwithstanding the elapse of three years, five years, or any other period, for that matter. The nomination is to be disclosed each year on the annual members statement. I support that and I think that is an adequate safeguard. If people change their minds, which is presumably the intention of the three-year expiry period, then the fact that they are reminded of their nominees each year when they get their statement—and most people do look at the statement, given that it discloses the amount of money they have in the fund; it is a matter of some interest to people—means they will have the opportunity to check their nominations each year.
The statement could, of course, draw their attention to the fact that they can easily change that nomination if they wish to. So while I accept that people's life circumstances do change, the reality is that for most other legal documents of much greater import than this we do not build in an automatic three-year expiry. I think that is a serious shortcoming of what is otherwise a reasonable advance in the law.
The other issue which needs to be examined, but is more controversial, is the issue of the sole purpose test being applied. This seeks to limit the range of people that you can nominate. This is a very difficult question, because obviously if people had retired in the normal course of events, they would have received their cheque. They are then free to do two things. They are free to spend that money or give that money away in any way they see fit, absolutely without limitation. The other thing they are permitted to do is to leave that money in their estate through their normal will in any way they see fit. Again, there are not limitations on the way they dispose of that money, post retirement, either through their estate and their will and testament or through their spending patterns.
The reality of this is that if we limit this test in this way, we are imposing an additional hardship on those who happen to die early, while still working, prior to the vesting date of their superannuation policy, and limiting their choice in a way we do not limit the choice of 
 those who have retired. As I said the other day, it is my contention that death is the ultimate bona fide retirement. The reality is that if you have died, clearly that superannuation policy vests. While we would all want to see that fund go to the immediate family of the member, the reality is that it is the member who understands best what their needs and aspirations are and who needs to benefit from the superannuation proceeds of their estate.
Often people have complicated family relations, often not following the traditional pattern these days. Therefore, to specify it to a legally predetermined limited range of beneficiaries that we decide, as the parliament, are the right people to receive this money will in many cases be correct. But in some cases—and I am aware of some from my own constituency work—this will impose a significant hardship on those people who the member would otherwise want to have benefited from their estate and who, in normal circumstances, in the event of a normal retirement, can ensure that they benefit from the estate. It is only in the event of the early death that we impose this extra hardship on people.
I believe this is a significant improvement in the existing law and I believe we should empower people in relation to their superannuation to allow them to make a binding nomination. In one case in my experience a member had made a nomination, but of course, under the old law, it was not binding. Because the nomination was in some degree controversial—it left 25 per cent of the proceeds to a friend of the member, 25 per cent to a close relative and 50 per cent to her mother—the reality was that the mother and the sister did not qualify as normal beneficiaries of this person. Therefore they had to contest this payment, because the superannuation fund wanted to exercise their discretion to pay all of the money to the friend who was claiming to be a beneficiary because they were in some way that they attempted to demonstrate—which was not particularly valid, but they attempted to demonstrate it—dependent on the member.
So the mother and close relative, the sister, are going to miss out on this payment because the fund wanted to ignore the nomination form of the deceased member. This law would still perpetuate the trustee's right to ignore those people. I think that is quite wrong. In this particular circumstance, those people were entitled to the member's payment. I know one can always conjure up bizarre circumstances where that would not be right, but it is better to place trust and faith in the wisdom of the member concerned to best know their own family circumstances. Therefore, I would appeal to the government to review these two particular areas and to comment on them further in the committee stage. We can re-visit this matter in another place if, on the balance of those inquiries and responses, that appears to be desirable.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  will make various miscellaneous amendments to the superannuation legislation to maintain and strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the superannuation supervisory framework.
Many of the points are contained in the second reading speech. I would like to reflect on a few of those points which have an effect on the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, the SI(S) Act, as it is known. These specific amendments include permitting a trustee of a fund to amend the governing rules of the fund to enable the acceptance of binding death benefit nominations from members.
I would like to particularly focus on this proposed amendment. Unfortunately, there continues to be some discrimination in the way that we treat some nominees of people who hold superannuation accounts. I am referring specifically to the way that homosexual couples 
 are treated. At this stage, there has been no attempt by either side of politics to permit a binding nomination to be enforced so that a partner of an individual is the beneficiary either at the time of death or at the time of maturity of the superannuation policy.
As a member of the Liberal Party and as someone who believes passionately in the principles of liberalism, I strongly believe that people should be judged not on their sexuality or on issues where the community may treat them unfairly. People should be treated as individuals and equal members of the community, provided they do not themselves give up that right to be a fully fledged member of the community by committing an unlawful act resulting in gaol.
I cannot for the life of me understand why a binding nomination provided by a gay person—either a lesbian or a male homosexual—should preclude a partner, a friend or any other person that they may be in a relationship with, if that is their nomination. This cuts to the very core of the principles that I believe underpin modern liberalism, which I enunciated in my maiden speech.
It is time for this parliament to take a strong stand and to provide the opportunity for an individual to nominate a partner or a friend notwithstanding their relationship. That person should be a binding beneficiary of the estate, the superannuation part of the estate or the policy itself.
That is particularly applicable, given the announcement by the Prime Minister on International Women's Day, which I strongly applaud and which puts on the table, at the time of the marriage break-up, the accrued superannuation entitlements of one of the working partners in the relationship. It applies equally to men and women: I may be able to access my wife's superannuation and vice versa. That is only fair and just, and at the same time it is a fundamental part of liberal principles that people should not be discriminated against on the basis of their sex or, for that matter, their sexuality. It is something that we should take forward as a parliament.
This bill deals with a new division in the SI(S) Act which applies alternative in-house asset rules to certain defined benefit funds with large accumulated surpluses, subject to appropriate actuarial controls. Also, it extends from 5 June 1997 to 5 June 1998 the transitional period during which tax file numbers already quoted for superannuation purposes may be taken to have been quoted for surcharge purposes also.
The bill provides greater power to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner so that the commissioner can revoke an approval of the trustee without ministerial clearance where the revocation is requested by the trustee. That is a particularly important power to protect the beneficiaries in this case. The bill also strengthens the arm of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in relation to monitoring and investigation powers, by expanding the number of parties to whom existing powers apply and—importantly, given the size of the funds and the large risks that are involved in the funds management—by increasing the penalties for non-compliance.
This bill also amends the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act to enable the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to be constituted by one, two or three members, rather than the present mandatory three members. This improves the efficiency of the tribunal. The bill provides for an improvement in the transparency and the process of constituting tribunal panels. It will require the tribunal chairperson to make available to the public guidelines concerning the circumstances under which the tribunal may be constituted by fewer than three members.
The final principal act amended by this bill is the Bankruptcy Act, which is amended to ensure consistent treatment of the superannuation benefits that are bankrupt, regardless of whether the bankrupt's benefits are in a regulated superannuation fund or an exempt public sector superannuation scheme. What this does is to create a level playing field. The playing field has for some time discriminated against members of private sector funds. But, importantly, this legislation is, in effect, again trying to repair some of the problems that have been passed on to us by the mismanaged introduction of superannuation.
I personally regret the fact that we had to introduce the superannuation surcharge. It would not have been necessary but for the $10.5 billion Beazley black hole which we inherited and which we have set about repairing. We have set about repairing it for a distinct purpose: to shore up Australia for the next downturn in the world economy, to shore up Australia so that it can benefit from a sustained level of economic growth and low inflation, and to create better work practices that make us more internationally competitive.
The superannuation surcharge basically ensures that the three per cent of people in the population who happen to be earning more than $70,000 a year are on an even playing field with the rest of the community. But the fundamental problems with superannuation go to the fact that governments over the last few years have continually been moving the goal posts. That is a source of great frustration to many accountants, to many lawyers, but most significantly it is a source of great frustration to contributors.
I will give credit where credit is due. When superannuation arrangements were first introduced in the 1980s by Bob Hawke, it was the right decision. People had to start to put away, in a very defined way, money for their future. If you like, it was a private contribution to their own retirement.
Over the last 20 to 30 years we have seen a demographic change in Australia. People once had two very distinct parts to their lives. The first part involved their education, their teenage years and their growth phase, while the second part involved their working phase and a retirement period, which for some was a comparatively short period, quite tragically.
However, these days the population is living longer and there are three long phases in people's lives and retirement is a key third part. Previously, retirement was regarded as a period of 10 or 15 years from the age of 65. If we all lived to 75, that would be great. Well, of every three women born today, one is going to live to be 100. You are seeing a major demographic shift in the nation. Therefore, we need to provide for our future. As I said, I give credit to Bob Hawke for taking the major step of establishing superannuation.
But the taxation arrangements in relation to superannuation have been fiddled over the years, and quite tragically so. People are now taxed on their contributions on the way in and they are taxed on their contributions on the way out. We should have followed the original UK model where tax is only applied at the point of collection and the funds accumulate pre-tax profits over the years. Regrettably, these days we have a very confused and unstable system involving the taxation of superannuation.
At some point someone is going to have to take a tough decision with those people taking a lump sum payout when their superannuation matures, taking a 100 per cent payout of their funds. Quite frankly, for many people that will be the most significant amount of money they will ever have in their lives. Despite all the accumulated wisdom and despite the fact that it is their money, we need to be able to protect people from shonks out there who are prepared to say, `I want your money. Come and invest in this nice little corner store in Upper 
 Cumbucker West and you'll be rich forever.' Some people will be tricked and will pour their life savings into that corner store in Upper Cumbucker West, a place where there are only two dingoes and a Cobb & Co cart that passes by every three months. That is tragic. We have all seen examples of that.
At the same time, there is no doubt there are many people in the community who would be more prudent investors than certain fund managers, and that needs to be taken into account at well.
However, I do have reservations about the current entitlement to the bulk payout. I do have significant reservations about the current taxation treatment of superannuation. We have inherited a very confused and difficult system and, at some point of time, there needs to be a bipartisan commitment to redress the imbalances of the current system and to provide people with long-term certainty about the direction in which superannuation and the taxation arrangements relating to superannuation are taken.
Finally, I strongly support the proposed amendment bill before this House. I do reiterate my strong support for the entitlement of beneficiaries of superannuation accounts to be nominated and be binding in relation to all individuals and specifically in relation to gay couples. I also reiterate the fact that we do need to focus as a parliament on providing greater certainty in relation to superannuation entitlement and taxation and provide the community with that certainty, so that those young girls that are born today that will live to be 100 will not be relying on the generosity of the state in 2098. They will in fact be able to provide for their own retirement so that they can live with dignity and certainty and so that they can ensure that they pass on to their children—and I would expect their great-grandchildren even by that stage—a quality of life that is indeed better than that which was passed on to them.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) was making some quite thoughtful observations about the complexity of the taxation treatment of superannuation. But it ought to be said, certainly I have found as I go around the superannuation industry, that there is no one measure which has done more damage to superannuation and which has made the taxation treatment of superannuation more complex than this government's superannuation surcharge. It was said to be a measure which would impact on high-income earners, but it has in fact damaged all workers, low- and middle-income earners as well, because of its complexity and because of the load that it has thrust on superannuation funds in requiring them to obtain tax file numbers and things of that nature. It threatens all those low- and middle-income earners who do not declare their tax file numbers with the 15 per cent surcharge. No single measure could have been calculated to do more damage to superannuation than that measure has done.
To turn to the  Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  itself, this is a bill which allows trustees to accept binding death benefit nominations. Trustees' responsibilities and duties come from trust law and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. They place a prudential and fiduciary responsibility on superannuation fund trustees to exercise care, skill and diligence in undertaking their duties on behalf of superannuation fund members. Trustees regard the discretionary allocation of death benefits as an important part of the prudential responsibilities. There is no question of that. It ought also to be noted that generally trustees are not paid to undertake their role and do not benefit financially from that discretion to allocate death benefits.
In the area of death benefits, a superannuation fund trustee may accept a nomination by a fund member to pay any death benefits to any person or entity. However, under the present arrangements, the member's nomination is not binding on the superannuation trustee. Trustees have to ensure that any payment meets the sole purpose test, which is that a superannuation fund should be maintained solely for one or more core purposes or one or more ancillary purposes relating to the provision of benefits for use on or after retirement. The sole purpose test also allows for the provision of benefits on or after a fund member's death if the death occurred before the member's retirement and/or age 65 and the benefits are provided to the member's legal representative, to any or all of the member's dependents or both. A fund member's legal representative can also be a representative of a deceased estate.
The government has before us a bill which contains technical amendments which permit superannuation fund trustees to amend the trust deed of their funds to allow them to accept binding death benefit nominations from members. There are a number of advantages in having a trustee discretion and there are also some advantages in not having a trustee discretion. This is a very interesting debate to which the members for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and North Sydney have made contributions.
In the area of advantages, if benefits are to go directly to an estate, you find that other creditors may have access to the funds before any dependents get access. State assets are subject to additional taxes from which superannuation eligible termination payments are exempt, so that can erode the value of the death benefit. In most cases, trustees are able to quickly deliver death benefit payments to appropriate dependents. This is unlike the delays which all too frequently occur where the assets are dealt with pursuant to a will and you get disputes and so on.
Trustees can approve advance payments in specific cases to alleviate immediate financial hardship. In some cases, there may not be a will which determines who should receive assets and that can cause further delays in the payment of benefits to dependents and additional legal costs.
As against that, there are advantages in not having trustee discretion. Established precedents which already exist in a state law attach rights of certain parties, either in law or by direction through wills. Probate courts have specific knowledge of these laws compared to trustees. Leaving everything to the estate creates an area for potential disputes. Discretion creates more administration delays and costs to trustees and the superannuation fund. Making it binding will improve the time and money spent on these cases, reducing the trustees' workload. We could anticipate perhaps reduced legal costs and fund administration time. We could eliminate the cross-subsidies of expenses and we could reduce disputes over trustees' decisions.
We have also heard quite powerful arguments from the member for Bonython and the member for North Sydney in favour of the person who has the superannuation fund in their name being able to have their wishes given effect to and that their wishes ought to be paramount in these areas. An interesting article in the Sydney Morning Herald from Annette Sampson talked about the present situation where superannuation funds will ask you to nominate who you want the money to go to. In her words, `This is an illusion.' If someone else can convince the trustees that they have a better claim to the money, the trustees are obliged to override your preferences. She expresses the view that it is outrageous that fund members cannot treat their super and/or any death benefits emerging from it in the same manner as assets held outside the superannuation system. She points out that, while dependents 
 can challenge a will, it has clear legal standing as a statement of your wishes and a strong case is needed to overturn it. With super, all you need is to prove dependency, which can result in some unfair distributions. She welcomes this legislation as a step forward on that basis.
It is probably fair to say that there is the potential for some injustice to occur under either arrangement. If you have a situation where someone has nominated that their death benefit ought to go to a particular person and trustees determine that it should go to somebody else, that may well be a situation of injustice and inappropriate outcomes. Equally, if someone nominates that their death benefit should go to a particular person and then circumstances change, it is probable that in some cases people would not change a death benefit nomination which was many years outstanding and did not reflect their own personal circumstances. You might find the trustees being forced to give effect to that binding nomination in circumstances where it would not be just to do so and the personal relationship which had given rise to that nomination had long since fallen by the wayside. It is probably fair to say that some injustices would occur under either arrangement and it is a question of coming up with the best possible arrangements.
In terms of Labor's position, we would see the measure in this bill as being a step forward. We would like to see it referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for further examination to see whether there is indeed a case for taking the matter further.
The bill goes on to apply in-house assets test rules to individual subfunds. The in-house assets test rule provides protection for super fund members' contributions by strictly limiting a company from borrowing from its own super fund. The reason is that, if an employer fails, employees' super benefits are protected. This measure closes a loophole whereby some individual super subfunds—separate super funds which are subsidiaries of a larger super trust fund—have been allowed to avoid the in-house assets test. Labor supports this measure.
The next provision in the bill extends the transitional period from 5 June 1997 to 5 June 1998 for funds to use already quoted tax file numbers for surcharge purposes. This will assist super funds that, for other purposes, collected members' tax file numbers before 5 June 1997 to also use it for surcharge tax purposes, thereby improving the administrative efficiency of collecting the surcharge. Labor supports this measure, as it may help some low income and middle income earners to avoid paying the surcharge.
As I said at the outset of my remarks, the surcharge has been an administrative disaster from start to finish. The only thing from this government which has fared worse is the Prime Ministerial guidelines on the ministerial code of conduct. It has been a disaster. Even as recently as Tuesday, in the Sydney Morning Herald there was reference to Murray Wyatt, a director of Morrows Pty Ltd, saying to an industry conference that the collection of additional tax by the federal government through the super surcharge is turning into a debacle and threatening people's confidence in superannuation. He said that it was becoming clear how complex, unnecessary and unwieldy the surcharge was, and that the surcharge `has disrupted and undermined public confidence' in superannuation. This is entirely regrettable, and the government really ought to be condemned for the damage that it has done to superannuation through such things as the surcharge, its abandonment of the government co-contributions in super, and various other measures that it has taken.
The next provision in the bill is to expand the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's monitoring and investigation powers, to widen the category of parties to whom they apply to 
 include custodians, and to increase the penalties for non-compliance. This provision will increase the protection of members' contributions and is supported by us.
It is also the intention of the legislation to allow the chairperson of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to convene either a one-, two- or three-member panel hearing, instead of the current requirement for compulsory three-member panel hearings. This is set to improve the efficiency of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The changes to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal are intended to speed up the current backlog of complaints, many of which are non-controversial and may not need full three-member panel hearings.
While the bill does not specify what type of cases will be heard by how many panel members, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal chairperson is required to publicly release written guidelines setting out how the tribunal will be constituted for different classes of complaints. Labor has been in contact with Mr Neil Wilkinson, the Chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, about the release of these guidelines, and we are satisfied that the appropriate transparency will take place.
We need to understand that these measures occur against the backdrop of the recent Federal Court decision in the Bishop case, which has prevented the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal from making determinations which are binding on superannuation trustees. This is not an uncommon problem facing tribunals where, under the separation of powers that we have constitutionally in this country—and properly so—challenges are taken to the courts on the basis that any given tribunal is exercising judicial power which ought properly to be exercised by the courts and is therefore acting unconstitutionally.
In the Bishop case, the Federal Court has held that this is indeed the case for the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. That Bishop decision has effectively gutted the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal's powers. There is no doubt that that decision has done the tribunal some damage. That is a matter of concern to Labor, as, indeed, it ought to be a matter of concern to the wider community. Labor established the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal as a low cost, reliable, fast, dispute resolution mechanism and we think it has worked well. The alternative for low- and middle-income earners in the past was that you had to go off to the court to seek resolution of any problems that you had with superannuation trustees. We think the tribunal has functioned pretty well and has been a better alternative.
I understand that the government has appealed the Bishop case to the High Court. That is a proper thing to do. But, generally, the government has been very slow in reacting to what is likely to have a massive impact on this part of the superannuation system, an important component of the system—dispute resolution. We believe that the government has not taken this issue as seriously as its significance deserves. I again call on the government, as I did at the time of the Bishop decision, to urgently address this issue in the interests of consumers. We would certainly welcome any indications from the government about the actions that they are taking with the superannuation industry to try and ensure that the very good work of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal continues, notwithstanding the Bishop decision.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a second reading amendment which I wish to move and I think now is the right time to move it. I understand that copies have been made available to the Main Committee. I move:
That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 

""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its concern about the Government's administration of Australia's superannuation system and, in particular, calls on the Government to:
(1)	 admit that its policy announcement on divorce and superannuation was vacuous and designed to deceive the Australian public into thinking this Government has a policy on superannuation and divorce;
(2)	 explain why it has taken two years to announce it is having discussions with industry when a substantial amount of work was done by Labor, in government;
(3)	 release what policy information it has developed on this issue to date, if any;
(4)	 ensure that the principles of division of superannuation apply to the ending of all relationships, not just divorces, but also common law marriages which dissolve; and
(5)	 ensure that any policy proposals brought forward are consistent with broader retirement incomes policy"".
In moving that amendment, I think the government ought to be condemned for what was a vacuous policy announcement on superannuation and divorce made on International Women's Day. This is a government which has attacked women in all sorts of fashions—in relation to child care, to looking after aged relatives, to job opportunities—
—Order! I ask the honourable member for Wills to speak to the contents of his amendment—
—I am certainly doing so, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—which represents superannuation legislation.
—That is correct. I want to—
—You should apologise to all the women who did not get pre-selection.
—I had the courtesy not to interject on you. I would appreciate the same courtesy.
—Order! The honourable member for Wills will resume his seat. I remind the honourable member for North Sydney of where he is. We must allow the honourable member for Wills to speak to his amendment.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to bring the honourable member for Wills back to the original amendment. Instead, he is drifting off into some spurious talk about how the ALP is meant to be very supportive of women, yet they do not have any women in any of their safe seats. In fact, they do not have them in any seats, apart from Canberra, I think.
—There is no point of order because I had asked the honourable member for Wills to relate his comments directly to the amendment that he has moved. I am quite sure that the member for Wills will do that.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The amendment which I have moved condemns the government for deceiving the Australian public in announcing a lightweight policy proposal on divorce and superannuation. The fact is that this government does not have a policy proposal to release. They looked around on International Women's Day. They could not come up with anything better, so they said, `We are going to do something about superannuation and divorce.' Well, this simply is not good enough, Mr Deputy Speaker. What the government ought to do is to explain to the Australian public why it has taken two years to announce that it is going to do something about superannuation and divorce.
—What did you do for 13 years?
—I will come to that. You are less further advanced in 1998—
—Order! I ask the honourable member for Wills to pass his remarks through the chair and not directly across the chamber to the member for North Sydney.
—The government is less advanced in 1998 than Labor was in 1995 and 1996. It is simply not good enough to get up here in 1998 and say, `We are going to start doing something about superannuation and divorce'. There is a failure, on the part of the government, to recognise and build on work that both Labor and the parliament generally have done on the issues of superannuation and divorce.
Let me point them out to the honourable member for North Sydney, who seems to be unaware of them. A Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act recommended in 1993 that superannuation be considered as property and that the Family Court be given discretionary power to split a benefit between spouses in proportion equal to the length of marriage or cohabitation, by reference to the total period of contribution to the fund.
Labor established a working group to examine this issue. It had an extensive name—the working group to develop a scheme for splitting entitlement to superannuation under the Family Law Act. It consisted of representatives from the Attorney-General's Department, Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Office of the Status of Women, Treasury, Finance, the Australian Taxation Office, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, Social Security, Family Court, Law Council of Australia and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. It was a substantial working group, and for good reason.
That working group was to report in 1996 and was formed to develop a scheme whereby superannuation would be dealt with as a separate and discrete asset. That was its first term of reference. The second term of reference was that the asset would be distributed between the parties, upon breakdown of marriage, equitably within the operation of law. The third term of reference was that the distribution of the asset would be determined by the period of cohabitation and the period of contribution to the fund. The fourth term of reference was that the proposal should be consistent with Labor's retirement incomes policy generally.
In June of 1995, the attorneys-general outlined their planned approach to the scheme. This was that superannuation should not be treated as property but as an asset or as a financial resource for the future. It would retain its identity as a retirement benefit for both parties—meaning that superannuation benefit would be split into two separate accounts, one for each divorced spouse, at the time of the divorce or the divorce hearing. The accounts would operate separately until vested in each individual.
It is my understanding that a draft Family Law Amendment Bill (No.2) was at an advanced stage of development at the time of the last election. Why hasn't this government used this information, and this work, to come forward with a real policy rather than this vacuous announcement, saying, `We are going to do something about this; we are going to go out to industry; we are going to consult'? So we have got this deceitful announcement which is designed to—
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—There has been a change of government. And what has happened for the last two years? Nothing; absolutely nothing has happened for two years and 
 now you get up and say that you are going to do something. The Australian people are not going to be deceived by such a vacuous announcement. They are too smart for that. The treatment of superannuation assets in the event of a marriage breakdown can impact significantly on the financial security of divorced women, particularly those women who have not accumulated retirement savings due to other demands being placed on them which limit their participation in the paid work force.
The issue of the splitting of superannuation after the ending of relationships has been handled by the Family Court on an ad hoc basis, often without the appropriate legal jurisdiction. The difficulties for the Family Court result from the question of whether superannuation falls within the definition of property under the Family Law Act 1975—that is, whether the Family Court has a jurisdiction to include it in orders—and, secondly, how and when superannuation assets are valued. At the point of divorce, for example, they may be worth considerably less than in the future.
Superannuation is not generally considered as property unless it is vested in the individual member's name. The Family Court has no power to order superannuation fund trustees to release superannuation assets before they are vested in the individual, which usually occurs once preservation age is reached or upon resignation or retirement.
To date, the Family Court has been forced to adopt one of two approaches to the splitting of superannuation, neither of which has resulted in a balanced outcome. We tend to have a situation which disadvantages either women or men. If hearings are adjourned or orders deferred until superannuation becomes payable, this potentially disadvantages women. This approach does not accord with the clean break principle, which the Family Court generally supports, and it could see the property settlement deferred for many years, during which time the personal circumstances of both parties could change.
Alternatively, superannuation gets considered as a financial resource rather than as property, potentially disadvantaging men in the sense that ex-wives are often compensated for the loss of the interest in their ex-husband's superannuation by increased amounts of other assets. This can disadvantage men who cannot access their superannuation and may not have sufficient other assets. They are forced to borrow, to go into debt to pay that compensation.
In 1996, the coalition said that it would examine the treatment of superannuation following the dissolution of marriage. The policy stated also:
Termination of marriage through divorce . . . poses a major threat to the economic security of women, particularly those who are unpaid workers.
The regrettable thing is that in two years we have gone backwards from where we were in 1995 and 1996. Paragraph 8.19 of the Labor Party's national platform of 1988 states:
Labor supports a fair and equitable retirement incomes system which:
. . . in the event of the ending of a relationship, ensures equity and fairness in the division of benefits . . . 
While we can give in principle support to the government's policy announcement, which is consistent with our national policy platform, the more we look at it the less there is to see. This, in effect, has been a do nothing announcement from a do nothing government which is—
—You should apologise for 13 years of incompetence in relation to superannuation.
—Let me assure the honourable member, in relation to superannuation, that we built it up from something which was a privilege for the well-off few to something which became available to ordinary workers. We set in place a decent retirement incomes system for this country, something which did not exist before the Hawke and Keating governments. Superannuation is one of our proudest achievements and we are happy to talk about it any time, any place.
We are concerned that the government has failed to act on the working group's recommendations. It has taken two years for the government to announce a policy, which is to conduct yet another review.
There is no question that this is a complex area and cannot be solved overnight. There is no question that, in terms of dealing with superannuation assets at the time of marriage dissolution, there are issues involving the taxation arrangements. I noticed that Daryl Dixon, in a quite substantial article in the Age recently, talked about some of the issues that occur.
If we were to have legislation which, for example, permitted the splitting of superannuation pensions as well as lump sums between spouses, that would place divorced couples in a more favourable position than intact couples where one spouse receives all the superannuation pension and the other spouse has very little income. It would not be appropriate, in my view, for us to seek to develop policies that would encourage marriage dissolution for superannuation tax reasons. I think we would all agree that that would be an undesirable outcome.
It is also the case, in my view, that superannuation ought to be treated as something for retirement, rather than something that people can or should have access to pre-retirement. So it is important in terms of developing appropriate policy that we keep sight of that and keep sight of the purpose of superannuation. There are a number of issues which Daryl Dixon identifies in that article. I think that all those who are interested in this area need to take account of those things.
What we have from the government so far is a failure to release the report of the joint working group on family law reforms. We have in fact the history of inaction in this area by government, and it is something for which the government ought to be condemned. They ought to get on to some serious work in this area, taking advantage of the preliminary work which was done by Labor in years gone by.
In the other areas of the bill, we support what is being proposed and we think that these things are worthwhile. We think that there is a role for the Senate committee in examining death benefit nominations to see whether that principle of people being able to make binding death benefit nominations ought to be taken further. We will take a great deal of interest in the work of the Senate committee in that area.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I am pleased to support both the amendment moved by my colleague, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), and this bill today. I could not agree more with the parliamentary secretary, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), and I do not always agree with the honourable member on a lot of issues. I agree with him when he said in moving that the bill be read a second time that superannuation plays a significant role in the government's commitment to increase national saving, and in its retirement income policy.
Superannuation is, indeed, an important part of our national savings plan. Legislation introduced by the Keating Labor government has ensured that all Australians have access to superannuation. Some decades ago it was the case that, whilst parliamentarians had access to 
 superannuation, ordinary workers and those who were not at the top of their field did not have access to this. However, the Labor government put in place measures that ensured that a minimum employer contribution for wage and salary earners in Australia is contributed for everyone.
Thanks to these initiatives introduced by the former Labor government, more than 93 per cent of full-time employees, 67 per cent of part-time employees, and 59 per cent of casual employees, are now covered by superannuation. It is the responsibility of government to ensure that people are encouraged to contribute to the superannuation scheme because it is a win/win situation. Individuals win because when they retire they are assured of an income. The nation wins because national savings increase, thereby delivering great benefits to the economy.
Furthermore, if superannuation is to play a role in the government's retirement incomes policy, then all people who contribute should have equal access to their super upon retirement. That is an issue that I wish to go to today. I am pleased to see that in the debate earlier today, the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) called upon the government for action to ensure that all people have equal access to their superannuation because at the moment that is not the case.
 There is discrimination based upon people's sexual preference. There are a significant group of wage and salary earners in Australia who have little incentive to contribute to a superannuation scheme because their spouses do not have access to superannuation benefits upon their death. As the legislation currently stands, gay and lesbian couples are discriminated against. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 aims to improve the monitoring and investigative powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. This improvement in accountability must be applauded and must be supported.
The bill also aims to improve the efficiency and productivity of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, once again a positive initiative. But what power does the tribunal or the commissioner have to address the legitimate equity concerns of same sex couples? The answer is `none at the moment' because this legislation is currently flawed.
I have here some 450 letters addressed to federal members of parliament which I will be delivering today. These are from people who live in New South Wales in 42 different federal electorates and they are asking for the legislation to be amended. The letters draw attention to:
aspects of current Commonwealth superannuation law which are highly discriminatory, particularly in regards to the payment of superannuation death benefits to surviving partners of lesbian and gay relationships.
The letters go on to state:
In effect, the current legislation prevents equitable payment of a person's own money, should they pass away, to their chosen partner on the basis of their partner's sex.
The Labor Council of New South Wales is currently conducting a campaign which is being coordinated by members of the Inter-Union Group against Discrimination in Superannuation. They distributed pamphlets around the time of the Mardi Gras in Sydney, and they are also distributing pamphlets and information throughout workplaces to raise awareness of these issues.
I applaud the Labor Council of New South Wales for taking this stance because quite often issues like this are hard to take on. I remember that the first time I raised this issue in the parliament I was heckled by another member on the basis of making an inference about 
 people's sexual preference. In the community there is still a great deal of discrimination and a great deal of angst concerning gays and lesbians. However, the Labor Council have shown that they are prepared to provide leadership on this issue, and I am pleased to hear that members on both sides of the House have indicated that they are prepared to show leadership on this issue also.
I would like you to consider this scenario which comes from the Labor Council campaign. This document says:
Susan and Juan have been in a de facto relationship for less than six months.
Richard and Vincent are lovers who have lived together for twelve years.
Juan and Richard are co-workers. On their way to a work-related event they are killed in a car accident.
Juan and Richard have both been in their industry superannuation fund for ten years and accumulated $100,000.
Juan died without a will, having never completed a nominated beneficiary form. Susan is identified as his spouse by the trustees of the fund. Susan received a $100,000 benefit tax-free.
And she should. However, Richard has gone a step further. He has done everything humanly possible to ensure that his partner receives the same treatment, receives benefits as a result of his death. The document continues:
Richard has maintained a will which names Vincent as the sole beneficiary, as does his superannuation form. Although this assists the trustees in making the payment to Vincent, he is considered a ""non-dependant"" and is required to pay $15,000 tax on the $100,000 benefit.
So Richard only receives $85,000 whereas if it was a heterosexual relationship the full $100,000 would be paid. The document goes on:
If Vincent had died without a will, Richard would quite possibly have received even less.
Certainly, if he had not nominated his partner as a beneficiary on his superannuation form, that would have made it even more difficult. The document continues:
He might have received none at all and could quite possibly have been forced into prolonged legal action over the decisions regarding Vincent's estate.
To me it really is an absurd situation to suggest, and I have had it suggested to me, that people might pretend that they were in a gay or lesbian relationship in order to receive benefits. Underlying it is an assumption that heterosexual couples would not do it and that somehow gay and lesbian couples are prepared to be more deceptive than heterosexual couples; whereas I think the chances of people lying about a relationship are far greater in a relationship which is totally accepted by everyone in society, as heterosexual relationships are. I do not think that a change in the legislation would lead to any abuse by people.
This bill is a lost opportunity to redress the wrong in this legislation. Part of the bill seeks to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act of 1993. Item 8 of schedule 2 of this bill will insert a new subsection 59(1)(a) relating to death benefits. The amendment would allow the trustee to provide any benefits in respect of the member on or after the member's death to a person or persons mentioned in the notice being the legal personal representative or a dependant or dependants of the member.
There are two issues here: firstly, the amendment does not require the trustee to abide by the member's death benefit nomination. There is no mandatory requirement for a superannuation fund to change its rules to allow for such a nomination. Secondly, same sex 
 couples continue to be excluded because of a very narrow definition of spouse. Spouse is defined in the same way as in the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936 to include:
Another person who, although not legally married to the person, lives with the person on a bona fide domestic basis as the husband or wife.
The point for same sex couples is that they do not live as husband and wife and so cannot fall within this definition. 	 To allow death benefits to be distributed to a member of a same sex couple, the definition of spouse would need to be changed.
With this amendment there are only two possible ways a partner in a same sex relationship can therefore access their partner's superannuation but, ultimately, this remains at the discretion of the trustee of the fund. The first possible way is if the partner can prove financial dependence. It is not necessary to prove financial dependence if you are in a heterosexual relationship; the access to your partner's superannuation is accepted, regardless of your own financial position. Therefore, what this bill is really doing, even though it is a step forward, is suggesting that people in same sex relationships are discriminated against if both partners are working and contributing to the nation's economy by earning their own living. What irony we have here when this superannuation bill will benefit someone if that person is a dependant of their partner. I think the right to work, to seek employment and to earn your own living should have nothing to do with sexual preference. I think that is the problem that is identified in the changes in this bill.
The other way that death benefits can be accessed is if the partner is named the sole beneficiary in the member's will. The estate can then be named as a death benefit nominee. However, apart from limited access to what should be a right, this also presents a number of problems. Instead of easily accessing the payment, the surviving partner may have to wait for probate, and the payment is likely to be taxed, therefore, at a rate of up to 21.5 per cent instead of being mostly tax free. Furthermore, the beneficiary will have to stand in line behind any creditors to the estate.
I am certain that the member for Braddon and his friends in the Lyons Forum would be horrified that the legislation makes it possible—albeit by the back door—for gay and lesbian couples to have limited access to superannuation death benefits. This amendment to section 59 of the SI(S) Act goes some way towards allowing same sex couples better access to death benefits. It does not address the fundamental issue of discrimination. Certainly it is possible to access death benefits but only by convoluted means and that is not an equitable solution.	Access requires a good working knowledge of the legislation. That therefore excludes people who do not have the education or the economic means to access this information.
On top of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference, you effectively have discrimination on the basis of economic or class position in society. In order to address this issue of discrimination, the definition of spouse needs to be altered to include same sex partners. This is not only a view that exists on this side of the House. I have said in the House previously that, unless the government rectifies this legislation, which is possible I hope through the committee we are proposing the legislation be referred to, I have prepared a private member's bill to do just that. I am pleased that the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who is here in the chamber today, last week in parliament said:
. . . I have considerable sympathy for what I understand will be a private member's motion to be brought on by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) in relation to superannuation entitlements for same sex couples. 

Today we have seen the member for North Sydney come out in support of superannuation for same sex couples and that is a very positive development.
I am sure the member for Chifley (Mr Price) would be prepared to come out in support of this legislation as well. 	I hope that this will not be necessary because I fully support the call of the member for Wills for the bill to be referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation so that this issue of death benefits can be more closely examined.
I have hopes that this committee will concur with the findings of the Senate legal and constitutional committee's inquiry into sexual discrimination. The report was tabled in December 1997. Recommendation 7 states that all Commonwealth superannuation legislation and related legislation directly or indirectly affecting payment to people on the grounds of their sexuality or their gender status be reviewed and amended. That recommendation draws support across the party boundaries and is deserving of action. With this bill we have an opportunity to take action.
The report further recommended that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation be asked to consider and report further on any barriers to superannuation contributors being able to nominate a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries of lump sums, pensions or other payments. That goes to the heart of the question. Why is it that someone who contributes to their superannuation fund simply cannot nominate their partner and that partner, regardless of their gender, have full and equitable access to their superannuation benefits?
In conclusion, I support the bulk of this bill. It is a positive step forward, but it can only be improved if it is referred to the Senate committee to ensure that the discrimination that I have identified is rectified. Australian society has moved a long way and, no matter what perspective you come from in this parliament, there is something to be said for rectifying this situation. If you are an economic rationalist, then surely you believe in the level playing field and therefore oppose discrimination on economic grounds. Even some people whom I would not agree with on many issues can support the thrust of what I am saying.
Secondly, if you are a liberal of the small `l' variety, you have to support this proposition that I am putting forward today that people should not be discriminated against in any area of their lives. In terms of superannuation, people will live much more comfortably knowing that if something were to happen to them—say, an accident on the way to work, as in the Labor Council example—their partner will not have to engage in legal action on top of the trauma that he or she will already be suffering. This bill ensures that people in a same sex relationship will be treated in exactly the same way as people in a heterosexual relationship.
I call upon the House to support the bill and the second reading amendment, and to take action on this issue. If the House does not support it, I will be introducing a private member's bill on this issue in the next session. Hopefully, I will be able to rectify it that way, with the support of all fair-minded members of the House of Representatives.
Mr Hockey interjecting—",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) draws to my attention that, in the debate on superannuation, I am allowed—and I am honoured—to follow the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), who has raised an important issue about superannuation for same sex couples. I previously said in the House but I think it is worth reiterating that one of the regrets of my life is that, in chairing the committee that looked into child support, I did not address the issue of same sex couples in the report, although fully cognisant of the problem.
I took the view that the recommendations we were making were sufficiently widespread that that would be a complicating factor. My optimism about either my own government or subsequent governments implementing the recommendations was widely off the mark and, hence, I have always regretted that we did not tackle that issue. I certainly think it is entirely appropriate that we should have superannuation rights for couples, whether they are heterosexual or same sex couples. I hope that the Senate committee will conscientiously look at that recommendation that has been referred to it.
If we look back at the 13 years that Labor was in government, perhaps one of the best things we did—the thing that has perhaps stood the test of time most—was with superannuation. It often amuses me that we see history repeating itself. The Chifley government's National Welfare Fund was gutted by the Menzies government and then finally abandoned. We were the government that delivered the last stroke because the National Welfare Fund was a mere shell with no money in it. It is important to remind people that under that scheme—if you go to senior citizens they will certainly remind you—people paid a separate amount of income tax and a separate amount into the National Welfare Fund. To that extent, it was a fully funded fund.
More is the pity that, in terms of national savings, it was not allowed to survive, because everyone who was in the work force was participating in it. The government of which John Howard was Treasurer left us in a pretty sorry state where basically public servants and executives in private enterprise were covered by superannuation but not very many other people in society. In other words, people were basically dependent on their own private savings and a pension in terms of their own superannuation.
Of course, it is a pity that, if you like, the coalition—having championed the idea of the importance of national savings, both public and private—should, in the very short two years that they have been in office, have started emasculating the coverage that was inherent in the Labor Party's proposals. Of course, the real losers in all that are the ordinary men and women of Australia.
I wanted to comment on the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of his intention to have a policy about superannuation as property in marriage dissolutions. I have never seen an announcement about a mere intention to have a policy receive such wide publicity. Perhaps the member for North Sydney could enlighten me. This is a new approach by the coalition that you do not merely make policy announcements but you make announcements of an intention to have a policy.
—Your mob are doing that right now! Come on, Roger!
—Well, this is the Treasurer I am talking about.
—For 26 months you have had the intention to have a policy on tax. And what about your intention to have a policy on airports?
—Order! Order!
—The member for North Sydney is making a quite valid point that not only do you have the intention to announce a policy in terms of superannuation—
—Order! The member will direct his remarks through the chair.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I bring to your attention the fact that they have now announced that—
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—after having all the information about family trusts, they are probably going to do something about—
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—With your sordid record of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and looking after mates! I want to make the point that, in this bill, there are ordinary workers—
—Order! I would ask the honourable member for North Sydney to contain himself. I remind him of where he is. Whilst interjections of a reasonable nature may be accepted by the chair, the constant badgering of the honourable member for Chifley will not be tolerated.
—I am used to being constantly badgered, but thank you for your assistance, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to make the point that, in this superannuation legislation, those workers who do not provide their tax file number are being caught up in the superannuation surcharge. I want to make the point that, if they retire or if they are retrenched, that money is caught up into it. Of course, you have the cosy and typically Liberal scheme of hitting the old PAYE taxpayer but, if you have got an accountant and a solicitor, you can get a family trust going and you can evade and avoid your fair share of tax, in this legislation.
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—If the honourable member for North Sydney—through you, Mr Deputy Speaker—is very proud of that situation, shame on him. I repeat: shame on him!
Let me make the point about tax reform. Isn't it a pity that, when it was announced, there was no intention by either the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who announced it, or the Treasurer to invite a bipartisan approach to tax reform? From a Labor perspective, we will always be concerned to ensure that the system is equitable, that it is fair and that all people pay their fair share. That will always underscore a Labor Party approach. But of course the Prime Minister and Treasurer just want to play a partisan game. Of course, the opposition is not on board on tax reform in the manner that they have announced—that is, through imposing a GST and failing to pick up—
—Order! I would ask the honourable member for Chifley to contain his remarks to those relevant to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  that is before us, regarding superannuation and divorce.
—The superannuation surcharge is in fact a tax, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to wind up with the point that I think an opportunity has been missed.
—You're the one who missed it.
—The coalition has absolutely missed the opportunity to try to do something in the national interest and to develop a bipartisan approach to it.
I want to return to this aspect of announcing the intention of a policy on superannuation. People have said to me, `What do you think about it?' In a sense, my first response has always been to say, `I think it is a bit unfair,' and then I have said, `No, actually there is nothing unfair in the limited amount I have known about it'—that is, that superannuation should be considered as part of the property settlement—`but the problem is that you are not fixing all the other problems at the same time.' It is as though in family law matters superannuation is the most important issue.
Of course, what the Treasurer does not say is that the courts are already taking superannuation into account. You cannot go to the Family Court without your superannuation being taken into consideration. Does the government think this is a brave new policy to win over the women's vote and to give the perception that this is the government's biggest concern in family law matters? If so, it is already happening. All you will be doing is codifying it in some way but without having a decent debate about how property should be split up.
I think we should have a debate about it, because it is certainly not a 50:50 split. It is certainly not proportioned between the parents with some left for the children—and I think that is worth while investigating. Let me make this point: the courts will always award more than 50 per cent of superannuation to that parent in residence with the child. I do not have a difficulty with that; that sounds logical to me. But what happens in three years time when residency is reversed? Is that property settlement looked at? Of course it is not. Is that fair? I do not think so. Can we do something about it? I am not sure, but it is worth while having a debate on it. It is typical of this sleight of hand government.
I would say to you that there are many more important issues in the family law area that affect women than just superannuation. Firstly, you are carrying on the grand tradition of governments of throwing all the federal money at dead marriages and relationships. I think this is crazy—absolutely crazy.
I do not know how members of parliament can sit contentedly and suggest that superannuation is the most important issue in family law, when people cannot afford the family law processes. We have absolutely no idea of what individuals are spending on family law. I can tell you what the federal government is spending: more than $100 million on the Family Court, more than $100 million on legal aid, and nickels and dimes out of the Attorney-General's Department in supporting families through the family program before the relationship or marriage is dead.
The Family Court, for example, is very proud to say, `Only five per cent of cases get to the court,' as though this is some fabulous success measure. There is a very good reason why more cases do not get there: absolute financial exhaustion. People are exhausted; not only do they spend all their own money, not only do they borrow on their bankcard to the limit and borrow from their parents for as much as they can possibly afford, but they never have enough money.
There is this basic lack of equity and access to family law. We are talking about what the rational economic approach should be, what the small `l' liberal approach should be. Let me tell you what a working-class, western suburbs approach is. It is to say to the parliament, to the courts, `Don't give us rights, don't tell us we have legal rights as citizens, if we cannot possibly afford to exercise them, if there are no avenues to exercise them.' I know that applies in other areas of the law. At the end of the day, when we talk about family law, sure, we are talking about parents who, for whatever reason, can no longer live together as a family, but the Family Court sees or deals with cases involving 150,000 children. So, if people cannot spare any compassion or thought for the parents, think about the children. There is urgent need of rapport.
Just as the Bishop case, which has an impact on this legislation as far as the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is concerned, is saying that the tribunal cannot exercise judicial power, there is a huge gap in the Commonwealth's constitution—that is, our ability to set up proper tribunals, like the states do in residency and tenancy matters, a guardianship board, small claims tribunal, the list goes on. With the greatest respect to the High Court, they have 
 interpreted the constitution in a way that leaves people with the perception that some of their rulings are more reflective of their desire to preserve the prerogatives of the judges than of dispensing justice to ordinary citizens.
As in any area of activity, whether it is this parliament or organisations out in voter land, we all need to go through processes of change, of refining what our core missions are. Any system that seeks to preserve something that only the elite in society can afford is ultimately bringing itself into disrepute, if not threatening its own very existence. I think both the legal profession and the judges have been very selfish in these matters, and it is up to the parliament to try to work around these particular cases. Although I am scoffed at by my colleagues opposite and, I must say, one alongside, I think there is a real opportunity to do something good for ordinary people by working together.
The honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) deserves the credit for raising this issue about employees who have superannuation and their ability to nominate the person they desire to get their superannuation in what he describes as the ultimate form of retirement—death whilst at work. That is, we have a situation where, if a person makes a valid nomination—which can only last for three years; there is a time clock on it—for a partner or a person to be the beneficiary, the trustees have the power to override that nomination. I find the power of the trustees in this matter quite extraordinary.
There is also the issue with some superannuation schemes that there are not regular meetings of trustees. So the matter gets held up for their first meeting and if they decide that they want to closer investigate the nomination, or, indeed, overturn the nomination, it may not be done at that meeting. And it can take some two or three years after the death of the person with superannuation for the final decision to be made.
I certainly welcome the legislation. I sincerely hope that it will find its way to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that has done so much good work. But I also support the amendment that has been moved by the opposition in this area. In particular, with the announcement of the intention to develop a policy on superannuation in family law matters, the government is really disappointing a lot of people. There is need for reform in the family law and child support area, but this superannuation matter has already been dealt with by the court. There are many other matters that the government should focus its attention to. I rather regret that it was a sham announcement.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Rocher, Allan, MP",IND,1998-03-26,"—Perhaps the most interesting schedule in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  is schedule No. 3, which proposes to strengthen the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the SCT. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) touched on it in his remarks and, I guess, earlier speakers did also.
It is interesting because this bill was drafted and introduced into the parliament long before last month's Federal Court ruling that the SCT was unconstitutional and that it can only review procedures and not decisions, thus throwing the superannuation industry into turmoil. While the intent behind the third schedule, to improve the productivity and efficiency of the tribunal, to enhance its role in promoting public confidence in the superannuation regime, is an honourable one and one that is entirely supportable, it seems somewhat redundant under the circumstances. Of course, the government does not bear any responsibility for the decision of the Federal Court in this matter and nor should it. However, in the event that an appeal to the High Court is unsuccessful, it is vital that the government be prepared to legislate so that 
 the tribunal is endowed with the power needed to resolve disputes about the distribution of benefits.
Since its inception in 1994, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal has formed a critical part of the fabric of the superannuation industry. Its present impotence does not preclude any of Australia's seven million superannuation fund members from pursuing action in the court system, if they believe they have been unreasonably and unfairly dealt with by their trustee. However, litigation can involve a substantial cost to the agreed fund member whereas disputes to the SCT could be made in writing and without requirement for legal representation.
The Federal Court's determination that the cost-effective independent Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is unconstitutional in part of its deliberations and operations represents a significant lost opportunity for superannuants. As one independent analyst has noted, the SCT was `vital to protect fund members against wrong decisions by trustees'. Mr Noel Davis, a lawyer with Clayton Utz, echoed that sentiment by saying, `In some instances, trustees make decisions adverse to members that they should not make' and that the SCT was necessary for maintaining consumer protection.
Assuming that the final outcome of this situation is that the SCT continues to be able to review decisions as well as procedures, the government's plan to correct the anomalies in subsections 14 and 15, which currently prevent certain complaints from being heard by the tribunal, is a sensible one. Of course, it needs to be remembered that the court decision only affects those cases where the SCT has determined to amend a trustee's original decision which, in turn, affected the distribution of payments.
I understand that there have only been around 50 such cases industry wide in the four years that the tribunal has been operational. However, the total number of complaints that have been heard by the SCT is much greater, at around 4,300 cases. Experts fear that many of those who may have pursued legitimate action through the tribunal will not opt to do that in the court system simply because of the cost involved.
Dr Michaela Anderson, policy director of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, was reported in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 13 February 1998 to have said:
It leaves us without a proper avenue of dispute resolution. We've always wanted something that's fair, quick and cheap. But all that's left now is for people to go to the courts, and most members of super funds can't afford to do that.
The most common cases to have gone before the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal over the past four years have been those relating to the payment of death benefits and termination of employment payments. However, the recent announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the coalition will legislate to have superannuation benefits taken into account in the distribution of assets during a divorce proceeding will almost certainly see an increase in the number of complaints to be brought before the SCT. As Ms Jill Ferguson, journalist with the Age , postulated in her article of 14 February 1998, the decision to increase fund choice to all new employees as set out in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997 —currently before the House and on the Notice Paper —`merely underscores the need for a tribunal that is judicial in nature to deal with members' concerns'.
The proposed amendments to subsection 9(1), to allow the tribunal to be constituted by either one, two or three members, selected by the tribunal chairperson, is a sensible one and will allow the SCT to deal with cases in a more timely manner. Given the predominance of disputes 
 before the tribunal that relate to the payment of death benefits, any move to expedite the hearing process is most welcome.
If the Federal Court's decision is upheld, industry experts predict that many trustees will become increasingly sensitive when directing the allocation of benefits in controversial cases. It is an untenable situation that trustees who have implemented past decisions at the direction of the tribunal may now be challenged in a court of law over their actions. Worse still is the prospect that a fund trustee may be able to be sued retrospectively by someone disadvantaged through a tribunal determination.
In the interests of maintaining certainty and stability in the superannuation industry, there must be an immediate clarification of the position of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. If the Federal Court's decision is confirmed by the High Court, then, as a matter of urgency, legislation should be prepared and introduced in this place immediately to clarify the liability of a trustee in the event of a challenge to the earlier decision or decisions of that trustee.
The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) explained in his second reading speech that the coalition has taken steps to make superannuation a more attractive long-term savings vehicle for Australians. However, all the signs indicate that initiatives like the savings rebate have, at least so far, had a negligible impact on national savings. The 13 November 1997 edition of Savings Pulse, an organ of the Perpetual Funds Management organisation, noted that over the past two years the percentage of Australians who did not save at all rose from 17 per cent in 1995 to 28 per cent in 1997. The author of that article suggested that the government `needs to develop a more useful mechanism to affect the Australian attitude to long-term savings.'
If government is going to reduce the growing trend towards household indebtedness, as was documented in a recent study by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, the government will have to act promptly in this instance.	Superannuation is still regarded with great suspicion in this country, and the gutting of the SCT by this latest setback will do nothing to reverse that. So I commend the amendments outlined in schedule 3 of this bill to the committee and anticipate a timely and responsible determination of the status of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Miles, Chris, MP",LP,1998-03-26,"—I would like to thank the honourable members for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), Grayndler (Mr Albanese), Chifley (Mr Price) and Curtin (Mr Rocher). They raised a number of issues in relation to the bill that I will address in turn.
Firstly, in relation to the quotation of tax file numbers, the amendments contained in the bill extend from 5 June 1997 to 5 June 1998, the transitional period during which tax file numbers already quoted by employees to employers for superannuation purposes may be taken to have also been quoted for surcharge purposes. This transitional arrangement ensures that employees do not have to quote their tax file number twice. Importantly, to take advantage of this arrangement, the employer must notify the employee of the intention to use the employee's tax file number and provide an opportunity to the employee to object.
Secondly, the honourable members pointed out that the amendments to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, the S(RC) Act, contained in the bill, do not address the effect on the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal of the recent Federal Court decisions of Bishop and Leshem. The Federal Court found that the tribunal review powers are invalid because they involve the exercise of judicial power. The government is fully committed to 
 ensuring that superannuation fund members continue to have access to an efficient and effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism. The government is still examining options in this area.
The government has also made an application seeking special leave to appeal the Federal Court decisions to the High Court. In addition, the government is carefully examining other options to ensure that superannuation fund members continue to have access to an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. These options include replacing the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal with an industry based scheme, or restoring the tribunal's powers through legislative amendment. If this proves to be possible through the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, the relevant merits of these options, including all the legal, policy and administrative implications, need to be examined very carefully so that a sustainable solution to the problem can be found.
It was not the intention of the amendments in this bill to address the effect on the tribunal of the Federal Court decisions of Bishop and Leshem. The amendments contained in this bill, which were developed when the tribunal review powers were fully operational, are intended to improve the operation and efficiency of the tribunal. It would be premature to withdraw these amendments while the possibility of restoring the tribunal's review powers remains on foot.
The third issue concerns the amendment to permit trustees to accept binding death benefit nominations from members. The honourable member for Bonython questions the reasons for the proposed three-year expiry of such a nomination, and the application of the sole purpose test which limits the persons whom a member can nominate as a beneficiary. It should be pointed out that any time limit on the life of a nomination is to be placed in regulations. These regulations will be developed in close consultation with industry and consumer groups. However, as a starting point, it is our view that a three-year expiry of a binding nomination provides a safeguard against the payment of the member's death benefit in accordance with an old nomination where the member's domestic and personal circumstances have changed since the nomination was made. It should be noted that it is intended that the regulation, subject to consultation, will provide that a member will be able to easily confirm a nomination by signing a form provided to the member with the member's annual statement. The three-year expiry period will begin to run again from the date of the member's confirmation.
It should also be stressed that the sole purpose test does not prevent a death benefit being paid to the deceased member's estate. Therefore the death benefit can be paid to a person who is not otherwise a dependant of the deceased.
The amendments in this bill to permit trustees of superannuation funds to accept a binding nomination from a member for the payment of death benefits will provide greater efficiency in the processing of death benefit claims by superannuation trustees and more certainty for members.
In conclusion, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the superannuation supervisory framework. It is vital that an effective regulatory regime is maintained to ensure the security of superannuation savings, and public confidence in the superannuation system more generally.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question unresolved.
—As it is necessary to resolve this question to enable further questions to be considered in relation to this bill, in accordance with standing order 277, the bill will be returned to the House for further consideration.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—The Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997  contains numerous technical amendments to the taxation legislation. These include fixing drafting errors in legislation, clarifying existing provisions and reducing the compliance requirements associated with various existing provisions. We are approaching this legislation as non-controversial in the community as it appears that there are no significant policy issues raised by the bill and no representations have been received by us at this stage suggesting amendments to the proposals.
The bill appears to be a move towards the United States system of an annual taxation technical amendment bill. That is to say, it is attempting to group all the non-policy legislative matters together in one piece of legislation instead of including purely technical amendments in bills with significant policy matters, as has previously been the case.
The general concept of a technical amendments bill is certainly not one which is opposed by the opposition. We are not proposing that no minor policy items could be treated in such a piece of legislation in the future. It is the case that it may be appropriate for minor issues of policy detail to be addressed in the context of addressing technical problems in legislation. Indeed, it would be silly to redraft a particular provision and not deal with a minor policy issue that has arisen in the same provision.
However, that is the sort of format that could be open to abuse. It must not be abused by slipping through major policy changes under the guise of purely technical amendments. If the government were to attempt to do that, then clearly goodwill from the opposition towards this type of minor legislative reform would be dissipated.
The second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum explain the precise provisions and proposals. I think it is worth saying while we are discussing the issue of taxation laws that we have a situation at the moment where the government are saying in this country, `We want to have a tax debate. We have got tax reform on the agenda and we want to have a tax debate.' But in fact they do not want to have a tax debate. Everything they are doing is shrouded in secrecy. It is said that we have got a task force examining tax reform options. That is a process that has been couched in incredible secrecy. Officials have admitted that there are no written records being kept of the meetings of the task force. There are not even written agendas produced before the meetings. That is not the usual workings of a public service. That is political use of the Public Service by the government. While the government have been asserting that tax reform is essential, they have not engaged in any public debate about the plethora of reform options that are available. They confine themselves to statements getting stuck into the existing system—in my view, often without foundation. But they do not say anything about the reform options that are available. None of the information produced by the Treasury has been released about the options considered nor the relative merits of different approaches that could be taken to address various issues.
We have got a situation where the government simply does not want to have a debate about the merits of various proposals. It simply wants to hide its proposals until as late as it possibly can and then pretend that its preferred model is the optimum. This is a form of deceit. It is an attempt to fool the public by not allowing sufficient time for scrutiny. The government ought to release the various options that it is considering and the options that are available. It ought to release them now so that the public can properly assess the decisions that the government is proposing to take.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to contest the idea that there is a crisis in the tax system. Indeed, the Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997  that we are debating now reflects the way in which tax works. Problems arise from time to time in any taxation system; it is the responsibility of government to address those problems as they arise, as indeed the government is doing with this piece of legislation. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been running around for the past six months—probably longer now—pretending that the tax system is not sustainable. The primary purpose of a tax system is to raise revenue. The taxation system, it has to be said, has to be in pretty good shape because it basically collects enough revenue to finance surpluses throughout the whole forward estimates period. Indeed, the Treasurer, in one breath, said, `The taxation system is rotten. It's had it. It's got to be thrown out.' In the next breath he went around boasting about the fiscal position. He might be prematurely boasting, but he is boasting about the fiscal position.
—Hang on! Revenue we're spending.
—Order! We will have all comments made through the chair. The honourable member for Gippsland will have an opportunity to respond to any provocative statements when he has his 20 minutes.
—I was entertained to hear the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) suggesting that the tax system which raises revenue bears no relationship to the government's budgetary position and prospects. It is the first time I have ever heard such a proposition advanced that there is no connection between tax and the budget.
—I didn't say that.
—Nevertheless, the member may wish to explain his position when he gets the call. The tax system is serving this country well enough to produce a situation where the books are balanced. The tax system constantly needs renovation and refurbishment. We, in government, always acted to improve the tax system and to address problems that arose. We will continue to do so. We do not accept the argument that the system is broke and therefore we have to have a GST. We have no intention of imposing a new tax on goods and services. What we have is a government which is frightened of the tax debate and, indeed, in the House yesterday, when there was a matter of importance concerning the taxation of discretionary trusts, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was nowhere to be found. He did not participate in that debate and he has not come forward with proposals to address the problem of the abuse of family trusts for tax purposes. That is a problem that the taxation commissioner has indeed identified for quite some time now. He put a report to the previous government just prior to the change of government drawing attention to this problem and, in particular, to the way in which high-wealth individuals were evading their fair share of tax and to the fact that family trusts were playing a major role in their doing so.
We have seen precious little in the way of action from this government to address that problem and so it has got worse rather than better. We know that one of the reasons for this 
 is that many in the government, both senators and members, have family trusts. Therefore, it appears that it is not in their own interest that the government should crack down on family trusts. Instead what they say is, `The tax system is broke and we're going to have to tax ordinary people on food and on clothing, and going to the footy, or going to the theatre, or anything they might want to do by way of entertainment; we are going to have to put those taxes on because we are not prepared to address the family trust problem.'
It is worth noting that, in the trust loss legislation that did pass the Senate in the past week, we saw an exemption which dramatically diluted the effect of the crackdown on trafficking in family trust losses set in train by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), back in 1995. What we need to get from this government is evidence that it is fair dinkum about cracking down on tax avoidance through the use of trusts. That is the sort of thing that the community needs to make the tax system work better and work as well as it can, rather than say that this system is broke and, therefore, we have to throw it out and replace it with a system which is fundamentally unfair.
Those who have had the opportunity to have a look at how a GST would work would understand that it is inherently regressive and that there is no way of addressing those problems with a compensation package. Lower income people have a higher proportion of their income go in paying the costs of a GST than do higher income people. It is inherently unfair and there is no way of fixing it up.
You could have problems both with a high level of GST and with a flat rate GST. One of the problems is that the government is simply unwilling to come up with its GST model. It is scared by its previous experiences when it produced quite a detailed model that was rejected by the Australian electorate which had the opportunity to have a good look at it. It has decided, `Oh well, we're going to change; we're going to do it differently this time; we're going to hide that model; we are going to unveil it at the last possible moment'—if indeed we do see it prior to an election being called.
We also have problems with what is referred to as the `compensation now' problem—that is, no-one can be guaranteed that he or she will not be worse off at the outset. This idea that you can design an effective compensation scheme to ensure that no low or middle income people are made worse off through the introduction of a GST simply cannot be done. Indeed, even if you can seek to design such a system, you have what is referred to as the compensation in the future problem. No-one can be guaranteed that they will not be worse off further down the track.
One of the interesting things about a GST, and the experience in other nations of a GST, is that the rate of GST can and does tend to be increased, whereas the compensation package tends to be decreased. That is the sort of thing that has happened in New Zealand. The international experience of a GST is that, despite assurances to the contrary, the initial rate at which it is introduced is inevitably increased over time. Of the 27 OECD countries which have a GST, 21 of these have already increased the standard rate of tax from its initial level. In the United Kingdom the VAT was initially 10 per cent and now it is 17½ per cent. In New Zealand the GST was initially 10 per cent and now it is 12½ per cent. In addition, over time governments tend to eliminate or reduce the concessions on certain goods and services which are initially introduced. History shows that, once this form of taxation is introduced, it never gets repealed.
The other sorts of problems that it throws up that simply are insurmountable are the problems for small business. The first problem for a small business is that of becoming an unpaid tax collector. The wholesale sales tax is a relatively easy system to administer and comply with. There are presently around 75,000 registered tax collection points. Most small businesses are not registered. They are not wholesalers. They do not need to get involved with this. But a GST would require around one million additional taxpayers to register and remit GST on a regular basis. Small businesses are not going to get paid for that tax collecting role.
The second problem is that they will have high compliance costs. They will have the initial transitional compliance costs and they will have ongoing compliance costs. The initial costs will include self-education, new equipment, new business systems and related professional advice. Those things will vary considerably between businesses but you will see new hardware such as cash registers with a GST tax capacity, computer software, accounting software, new sales dockets and forms to include provision for GST, and that is on top of the time that small businesses will need to spend learning how a GST works and registering with the Australian Taxation Office. The ongoing compliance costs will include the time taken for GST paperwork, professional advice, record keeping for possible GST audits, the cost of being audited and so on. We will see very significant problems for small businesses.
I also want to refer to the black economy problem. A lot of people say that one of the problems with our existing tax system is the problem of straight evasion. There is no question that that is a problem but a GST will not fix it. Indeed, it increases the incentive not to report transactions because by doing that you not only avoid the income tax that may be payable on those transactions but also you avoid the GST.
I have spoken to people in Canada about this matter. I said to them, `How is it that the progressive conservative party managed to be reduced from a parliamentary majority to two seats in a single election?'—that is a pretty crushing election defeat; it makes some of the election defeats we have seen in Australia seem pretty mickey mouse—and they said, `GST.' When I asked them why the GST was such a debacle, one of the things that they mentioned was the avoidance. No-one wanted to pay it so they were not reporting transactions. So far from dealing with the black economy it provides incentives for the black economy to increase in size.
In addition to those things, it is clear that GST is no solution to unemployment. Internationally, there is no relationship between consumption taxes and unemployment rates. The United States, for example, does not have a GST and it has one of the lowest levels of unemployment among advanced economies. We have the inflation problem. There is no doubt that a GST would generate a price surge, an inflationary surge. For example, a 15 per cent GST would generate a surge of around five per cent. There is no guarantee that inflation would fall quickly to its pre-GST level.
We have a whole series of problems with GST. The government has failed to put forward a model so that we can have some discussion about how that will impact on ordinary Australian people. I call on the government to release this model, not to keep us in the dark. It is time that we had a decent tax debate in this country, not a phoney one. The obligation is on the government, which is arguing the case for change, to put forward its model and not hide its light behind a bushel with secret meetings that are not even being put down on paper. It is high time that that was done. Having said that, as I indicated at the outset, the opposition does not propose to oppose this legislation.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS (TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,1998-03-26,"—On behalf of the government, I accept the congratulations of the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) for this innovative reform, namely the Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997 . Again, it is a reform introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) after Labor's 13 barren, hollow years of inactivity on tax. I will come to that in a short moment. We have introduced a housekeeping measure that those opposite applaud.
A central feature of the address to the chamber by the member for Wills has been that there has been no tax debate, that we are hiding details regarding the introduction of a goods and services tax or the like. Where has he been for the last few months? You cannot open a newspaper these days without columnists or editorialists waxing lyrical on the subject. There is enormous debate in the community, very much fostered—indeed, generated and promulgated—by the government.
We started the whole tax reform debate, and, indeed, the first instalment of the government's transparent encouragement of public transport has been the Treasurer's publication In need of reform, which is easily available to the member for Wills and to any of his constituents. It does two things. The first is that it shows that the government is serious about an informed public debate with regard to tax reform. People are not going to be able to participate fully and in a knowledgeable way until they accept the case for reform—which you do not. That is the second thing: you do not believe there is any need for tax reform. In fact, your incredible statement—as I took it down accurately—was this: `The tax system works satisfactorily and the books are balanced.' We have not balanced the books by raising taxes. We have not used the tax system to introduce fiscal discipline. We have cut government spending and have eliminated waste to a very large extent.
Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting—
—You are saying that there is no need for tax reform because we are in a balanced budget or a budget surplus.
—The honourable member for Wills has had his go.
—For heaven's sake! You would have used the tax system to balance the books by way of increasing the taxes—as the Labor party sought to do in the Dawkins budget of 1993. The only way they could address the budget deficit which they created themselves was by increasing taxes. We will not increase taxes; instead, we will reform the tax system. The idea that the government's departmental task force on tax reform should involve the opposition is so absurd, so ludicrous and so impossible that the member for Wills could not have said it with any seriousness.
Why would a government involve an opposition that has already declared its hand on the issue of tax reform and has again reinforced that, through the member for Wills, here today? Why would we involve such blind opponents of tax reform in the tax debate and the discussion within government ranks? It would be rare enough anyway for any government to involve their opposite number in internal policy making, let alone involve an opposition that has categorically ruled out any support whatsoever for tax reform involving a GST.
It is an absurd and really pointless argument for the member for Wills to make. It shows how shallow has been not only his contribution this morning but also the whole opposition approach to tax reform. Who does not believe we are in need of tax reform—other than the member for Wills, who has told us that the tax system works satisfactorily and that the books 
 are balanced? The Treasurer, in the booklet he has published in the past few weeks, makes out a compelling, convincing and unassailable case for tax reform.
I could not help thinking, when I decided to speak on this legislation, `Here we go again: yet more legislation on tax!'—even though they may be technical, correction types of amendments. After this debate, we will debate the tax law improvement bill; there is a welter of tax legislation entering the parliament and being imposed on taxpayers, their financial advisers and accountants and the like—and the Treasurer knows it. The Treasurer is not happy about this at all. In fact, he states how complex this system has become.
He states that the income tax legislation is just too complex. When the Income Tax Assessment Act started off in 1936, it was 120 pages long; now it is 3,300 pages long. It has doubled in size over the past seven years, and it may well double in size over the next seven years. It is an intolerable situation. Again, with regard to sales tax the Treasurer, in the interests of an informed public debate, sets out what an administrative and compliance nightmare it is, with its complexities that are mind-boggling even for specialists in the area. It leads to absurd situations, as he points out, where basic necessities of life, such as toothpaste, are being taxed but where others, such as toothbrushes, are not being taxed.
Then there are the philosophical arguments about incentive and reward for effort and work. So there is a need for tax reform. We would happily involve the opposition with it, as we do other members and representatives of the community. The tax task force is of course taking advice from right across the economic, even political, spectrum. But we have to exclude the opposition. Who will ever forget their conduct during the 1993 election campaign—the distortions, the exaggerations, indeed, the outright lies often told. We are not going to involve—
—I remember it well.
—The member for McEwen was one of the major spokespersons for the then opposition at that time, putting the case in a very genuine and honest fashion and finding that, at every turn, her political opponents were distorting her message dishonestly. So, really, why do I even have to rebut the suggestion that the opposition wants to be involved with the government's tax reform task force. The absurdity of it is only too obvious to anybody.
At the same time the member for Wills tried to tell us about family trusts and the like. This is a very important area of public policy. It deserves an informed debate. Reforms or amendments to tax laws may well be needed, and that is under active consideration by the government. But do not blame us for this. In fact, the member for Wills cited, in a very generalised, unattributed way—
—A what?
—Unattributed. You know how you unattribute things? Well this was an unattributed argument that he made about tax losses—tax avoidance he called it. Tax avoidance is a crime. Tax minimisation is a moral issue. Of course, most of these family trusts involve tax minimisation, not tax avoidance, I would have thought.
In any event, without getting into a discussion of the merits or otherwise of this area of taxation, let me make the point that the figures now available to us surrounding family trusts and any tax lost to the revenue were during Labor's years. Again, he was pontificating about the need for reform for an area of tax that his government studiously, and deliberately, ignored or neglected over many years. So don't, for a moment, any member of the opposition think 
 that they can lecture the government about tax policy and the need for tax reform. But, again, they are confused here. On the one hand, the member for Wills will tell us that the tax system works satisfactorily, the books are now balanced, but, on the other hand, for political reasons he will selectively pick out different areas that may suit his attacks on the government.
The point is that this government is serious about tax reform. It has nailed its colours to the mast on the need for tax reform. It will see this through. We will not shirk. We already see the beginnings of a scare campaign being mounted by the opposition. It will not distract us from what we know needs to be done—that is, a fundamental overhaul of the tax system for the benefit of all Australians.
I will draw my remarks to a conclusion and again make the point that the bill before the chamber is a very important one, despite the fact that it is adding further to the length of the Income Tax Assessment Act. One final point I will make is that there is a technical amendment to those provisions dealing with capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. A major reform of this government when it came to power was that we assisted small business to deal with Labor's capital gains tax, so as to provide that incentive and that reward so necessary for people who invest their life savings and their family security in small business. The way we have reformed that area very substantially is something we are very proud of.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS (TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—It is always a pleasure to follow my colleague the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) in debates about taxation reform or anything else, because we get an opportunity to remind each other about a few of the facts associated with the whole issue of tax reform over the past 13 to 15 years and to set the record straight. Even my colleague would have to concede that, in 1983 when there was a change in government, one of the priority areas of the new government of the day was to look at the tax system to see what reforms were necessary.
Similarly in 1996, it became an issue for the incumbent government to say what was necessary to try to improve the tax system, and to build on what was there—admittedly, in line with the different philosophies that political parties have to see whether other emphases needed to be placed. I am interested that, in the next bill to be debated here, we are talking about another issue associated with taxation and taxation reform. I am sure a few issues will be raised there. This particular bill, though, does tidy up a few of the existing taxation laws and, far from introducing any sweeping changes, it simply makes some technical amendments to the existing legislation.
I agree with the member for Gippsland when he says that, over the last several years, taxation law has grown enormously in size and complexity. That is, I think, without dispute. Anybody who has had anything to do with the taxation system knows this is the case. There have been a lot of cases, and I have witnessed some in parliamentary committee work in previous years. One of the reasons that has occurred is that there is always a group of smarties that are out there trying to be ahead of the Australian Taxation Office and the government—and I use that in a broad sense—to see ways in which they can not only minimise their taxation obligation to Australia but also engage in outright avoidance. Therefore, any government is caught behind the eight ball and always has to play a catch-up game in this respect.
The Treasurer (Mr Costello) might think that, by putting out this document, he is trying to get ahead of the game. In fact, what he has signalled is his government's belief that there is a need for some further taxation reform. If you believe what the member for Gippsland has 
 said, it has stimulated debate in the community. I think debate has been stimulated in the community but not necessarily for the reasons that he believes.
Debate has been stimulated in the community because the taxation system does have a need for reform. I believe that to be a fundamental case that cannot be argued. But the methodology that is required in that reform is where we see the difference, and where we see people in the community expressing differences of opinion. For example, very early on in the piece when it was suggested that, by eliminating a wholesale sales tax regime and replacing it with some form of a goods and services tax across the board with minimum exemptions, there was a group in the community who thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Organisations, such as the Business Council of Australia and ACCI—representing large businesses with their own taxation departments, corporate and taxation lawyers and a string of accounting departments willing to put in place the necessary wherewithal to introduce something like that in terms of a change in the taxation system—were quite happy about that. But I am not so sure that those one million small business people out there were exactly rubbing their hands with glee.
As my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) pointed out, the compliance costs associated with existing systems, let alone the compliance costs associated with the imposition of a goods and services tax, are yet to unfold. On the GST itself, we are now really talking about the grandson of GST. It got a run back in 1986; it got a run in 1993; and it is getting a run in 1998. One has to wonder when it will actually run out of legs. Despite the best endeavours of the member for Gippsland and the Treasurer, you cannot escape from the fact that, whatever proposals the government has to reform the tax system, there is nothing out there for people to judge it by. He is right that debate has been stimulated throughout the Australian economy and the Australian electorate, but it is not necessarily informed debate because we do not know what form the taxation reform proposed by the government will take.
Yes, there is the document that is referred to, and yes, you can point to discrepancies between toothbrushes and toothpaste. You can talk about the fact that, for example, you pay wholesale sales tax on a brand new motor vehicle but you do not pay it on a used car. There are the fleet systems and so on, and those at the upper end of the spectrum are the ones that buy the new cars, but most of the punters in Australia do not. They go for the used cars, so they are not going to be caught with that. If they get a 10 per cent or a 15 per cent goods and services tax, however, that is going to increase the actual cost of that particular product that they themselves want.
My point on this is quite simple: it is all well and good to talk about the need for tax reform, and Treasurer Costello was trying to make a case for that, but we do not know what that reform is going to entail. We have had people talking about eliminating things like the payroll tax; we have talked about BAD and FID that operate and are collected by the Commonwealth on behalf of states. Those are two state issues, so when are we going to see what the Commonwealth government has in mind to recompense the state governments for, perhaps, taking off those taxes and taking away the ability of the state governments to raise much needed revenue to replace the revenue they are not getting from the Commonwealth at the minute for things like hospitals, nursing homes, child-care centres and all the rest that have been slashed and burnt out in the last couple of budgets?
The states have a vested interest in this. They have a clear interest to say to Treasurer Costello and Prime Minister Howard, `Show us what you have got in mind, so that whatever 
 necessary adjustments we have to make at a state level to change our taxation regime we can put in place.' Similarly, when we start to talk about eliminating wholesale sales tax and replacing it by a goods and services tax, what rate are we talking about at which that is going to apply?
There seems to be a general view in the community that we are talking about 10 per cent only. Why? It is because politically we could not go any higher than that. We saw the nonsense that the Treasurer tried to put out a couple of weeks ago, when he was trying to suggest to people that the government would absolutely, in legislation, lock it in that it would be at a rate that would never change. He knows, I know and even the member for Gippsland knows that that is just impossible. It is impossible for technical reasons, but it is impossible also because governments just cannot do that.
In every country where a GST has been introduced at a particular rate it has changed, and never downwards. If it becomes the major source of a government providing income to itself, then to be spent on a variety of programs which the constituency at large expects of the Commonwealth government, then clearly the government cannot lose revenue by locking itself into a particular rate.
When we start to talk about some of the other taxation measures that perhaps are going to be examined, there are issues of fuel taxes. I know the member for Gippsland, representing a rural community, very much has an interest in this. What is going to be the outcome there? What about some of the other provisional tax arrangements that might be in place? What about the arrangements associated with superannuation? Are these going to be picked up as part of the broader taxation reform process? That we do not know is the simple answer to that.
We read in the financial press today that it will be at least two months—or at least that is what the government is saying—before the actual package is dropped. I hope it is not so long. I hope it appears a bit sooner so that we can sit back and debate the issue. The member for Gippsland has repeated a nonsense that has been stated in the House in the last couple of days when the issue of taxation reform has been debated, both in question time and on a matter of public importance, that Labor did nothing. Half of these technical amendments that we are debating here this afternoon are fixing up the taxation changes which Labor put in place.
I remind the honourable member for Gippsland, and many other people on the other side, that in 1983 the biggest growth industry in Australia was tax avoidance and bottom of the harbour tax schemes. Who fixed it up? P.J. Keating, Treasurer, Labor Party. What was the next thing that he did? He looked at what the personal income tax scales were in this country and said, `This is unfair. Most people are getting very close, with bracket creep and everything else, to the top marginal tax rate', which was 60c in the dollar. He then dropped it to 47c or 48c, and then when you add the Medicare levy you get another 1½c on top of that. The bottom rate was 30c in the dollar, for people in Australia who are the so-called battlers that the Prime Minister likes to talk about; now it is 20c, with a changed scale in the middle. That was tax reform of a personal tax nature and yet people say that Labor did nothing.
We then had the tax summit, and arising out of that, of course, was an options paper prepared by Treasury with the famous options A, B and C. There were various elements of a consumption tax in option C, with capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax and a whole range of the other so-called nasties. If the Treasurer of the day had not been knocked over by the Prime Minister of the day and the ACTU at the hotel up the road, that might have been put in place. That is history. That is the way of it.
As a consequence, we ended up with taxation reform sponsored by the Labor party. It saw the so-called nasties—which really are an important element of taxation revenue—put in place. These reforms attacked the avoidance and minimisation areas, fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, and so on. As a government we went to great pains on capital gains tax to say that we were not going to tax it on the nominal value. We were actually going to make some allowances for inflation, and all the rest of it that was tied into that. There were reforms and a carefully thought through taxation system put in place to deal with issues on the way through. That raised the issue of things like dividend imputation, so that taxes were not levied twice on businesses. We saw the business tax rate lowered to stimulate the businesses in this country—and on it went.
I simply say to those people that would argue that there was no reform under Labor that they should go back and read their history books. There was. Those on the other side of the House may not agree with it. They may not think that the crackdown on bottom of the harbour tax schemes, or tax in capital gains, or putting fringe benefits things in to knock off the free lunches by some of their mates in the Victorian parliament—these sorts of things—were Labor reforms, but that is the way of it. That was bringing equity into the system, but it was also attacking it at the source in personal income tax rates. Those people who march around this place and say that Labor did nothing should go back and read their history a little bit.
The other thing that we have been talking a great deal about here is the issue of trusts, because it is picked up in the legislation we are debating today. It is a very important issue. As was suggested yesterday—and I think that the member for Gippsland also talked about this today, asking why Labor had not done something about it—in 1995 when the size of the problem became known to the Treasurer, Ralph Willis, he did do something about it. He put a piece of legislation into the parliament to crack down on the use of trusts for tax avoidance. An election was called—we lost—and it was two years down the track before the government then put in, last week, their watered down version of this issue.
My friend the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) has a bit of a smile on his face because this was an argument he used yesterday in the MPI. But it is true. It is simply a fact that it took two years before you decided you wanted to do something about it—or at least the government did.
The simple fact is that the amendments here contained in the Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997 go to a number of tidying up exercises that are required to give some further transparency and ease of understanding of what is required. I wish it speedy passage through the parliament.
Motion (by Mr Rocher) agreed to:

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-03-26,"—My speech on the adjournment debate goes to the need for additional federal funding to complete the greater western Sydney orbital roads 
 system and for further development of cross-regional links between employment zones and regional centres.
The completion of this roads network is to allow full development of industry in western Sydney and to ensure that this region benefits economically both during and after the Olympic Games. The federal government has recognised the western Sydney orbital between the M2 at Seven Hills and the M5 at Preston as part of the future national highway link through Sydney. As such, its funding is the responsibility of the federal government.
The western Sydney orbital is estimated to cost $800 million to build to a national highway standard with divided carriageways and graded, separated intersections over its 43-kilometre length. The previous federal government in its May 1995 budget committed $260 million to commence construction of the first stage of the western Sydney orbital between Prestons and Cecil Park. Construction was to start in 1996. Additionally, in August 1995 the then federal minister for transport committed $220 million for the second stage of the western Sydney orbital between Cecil Park and the M4 at Eastern Creek. Construction was to start in 1998.
The present federal government has reneged on that commitment. In November 1996 the then federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), announced that the federal government had set aside only $109 million, over five years, towards restructuring works comprising environmental assessment, land acquisition and other planning activities.
Based on advice from the federal minister at around that time, the New South Wales government has included $7 million in the New South Wales budget for the western Sydney orbital in 1997-98. However, the federal minister has yet to announce the funding allocated for this project for that 1997-98 period.
The completion of economic development of a region is affected by the capacity and efficiency of the existing transport network to service commercial vehicles and freight movements. Greater western Sydney has a population of 1.6 million people. It has a gross national product of $35 million and produces 10 per cent of New South Wales's agricultural output, yet it has not one freeway standard cross-regional road.
Road transport is the major contributor to the distribution industry. New and expanding industries are increasingly seeking proximity to major road networks to reduce transport costs. Development in technology also leads to companies locating near other industries and local markets rather than close to their own headquarters.
The existing road network out from Sydney's metropolitan CBD is radial and lacks direct cross-regional links between employment zones and regional centres. High levels of congestion are increasingly being experienced on the existing freight corridors serving greater western Sydney, including the M4, the M5 and Cumberland highways. The capacity of the M4 has already reached 4,200 vehicles at peak hour traffic times.
This congestion is threatening the competitiveness of industry and commerce located in greater western Sydney due to insufficient freight movements and longer transport travel times. If real industrial and commercial development is to be achieved, attention needs to be paid to the movement of freight both within greater western Sydney and to the major terminals at Port Botany and Kingsford Smith airport and to the rail terminals at Chullora and Enfield.
There is also a need to take into account the likely trends in freight demand based on both future industrial growth and changes in freight activity such as just-in-time, centralised 
 distribution, cross-docking, outsourcing of transport and distribution processes, smart warehousing and electronic trading.
The region's business community has identified the completion of what is termed the arterial road grid consisting of the existing M4, the Cumberland Highway, both Windsor Road and Old Windsor Road, the M2 under construction, the planned M5 East, and the western Sydney orbital as essential for western Sydney's economic development.
Finally, this clearly means that the federal government has to add additional finance to complete this work.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Roads</title>,Adjournment,38,1,speech
