"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-12-04,"—I move:
Omit the following bills:
Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Special Benefit Activity Test) Bill 2002
National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]
Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2].
In speaking to the motion I will not take up a significant amount of the Senate's time—we have legislation before us at the committee stage—but it is at least necessary to set out the opposition's position. We will not be supporting the motion. We are in the penultimate sitting week of the Senate for this year. At this very late stage of the sitting, with the legislative program in front of us, we need to look at the program critically and make an assessment of and a decision on the priorities that need to be dealt with.
We have only six days remaining, including today, and numerous bills still to consider. Much of this legislation is, according to the government, urgent. The ASIO bill, for example, is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that we will consider in this sitting, in my view. We anticipate a lengthy and complex debate in respect of that stage, and we have not started it as yet. The committee report was handed down only last night at 11.19 p.m., and as yet the chair of the committee has not spoken about the report. I am sure most members will not even have an opportunity to read the committee report before we end up debating it. We note that the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2] has already been considered by the Senate. In these circumstances, we do not regard it a priority that it be considered. When you look at the substance of that particular bill, the reason it is being proposed as urgent is:
The Government has on several occasions sought the introduction of protections for business, and particularly small businesses, against secondary boycott actions.
There is no claim for urgency within the text of the statement by the government to support the passage of the bill. If you look at the history of that particular piece of legislation, the exemption from the cut-off was—to say it again—firstly, to avoid the great haste with which this government might want to drive through legislation and, secondly, to enable the Senate to have more control when determining which matters are urgent or important and which matters can be dealt with later. The opposition, in relation to the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2], have to then examine each bill upon its own merits. The opposition have been extremely generous to date in terms of our position to the exemption of bills from the cut-off date. In this sitting year alone we have agreed to something in the order of 34 bills for exemption from the cut-off. 
Each bill, as I have said, should stand on its own merits. It should be highlighted that this government has failed to convince us that the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is urgent. The opposition have already made their position on this particular bill quite clear. That position remains unchanged since the bill was first introduced. The government has had the debate on that bill a number of times before. It knows our position and it knows what our position will be. It is clearly no surprise to the government. The bill does not meet the priority test when applied. Already, as I have said, there is a significant legislative program to be dealt with. There is no practical reason for dealing with this legislation in an urgent way. Similarly, in relation to the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2], the government states in one sentence the reason for urgency:
If the Bill is not introduced and passed in the 2002 Spring sittings, projected savings to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will not be achieved.
That may be a fact, but it is certainly not a reason for urgency for the bill. The bill does not contain urgent measures. There is no adverse effect on Australians if the bill is not considered. There is a program of essentially urgent bills that the government requires to be dealt with in this sitting period. This bill does not fall within that group. Similarly, the reason put forward by the government for the urgency of the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Special Benefit Activity Test) Bill 2002 is hollow. The initiative contained in this bill is to commence on 1 January 2003. This is a fact—one put forward by the government. It then claims that it is critical that the bill be passed in the 2002 spring sittings ahead of the commencement date so as to have sufficient time to finalise supportive administration. But this bill had only just been reported on in the Senate, with the majority and minority reports only tabled earlier this week. There were over 50 submissions received in relation to that particular bill. The important issue to recall is that there is no stated urgency in the grounds to support the particular bill. The date is the only reason this government has been able to suggest that the bill is urgent, but the date in itself is not a claim for urgency. Therefore there is no merit in considering this bill ahead of other essential bills that we need to deal with, given the small time that we have available to deal with the legislative program in a way that ensures proper debate.
If the government were serious about the program and about having sufficient time to debate the legislation in the program this year, then it would have considered not setting aside some 10 or 11 days fewer than the number set aside in what might be considered more usual sitting periods. In 2000 there were 71 days set aside. In 2001—an election year, which was terminated from 27 September—there were 52 days. This year, to date, there have been 53 days. In relation to hours, 449.42 hours were set aside this year. Last year there were 442. When you look at the figures for the pattern of sitting, the opposition has met the requirements to expand the program to deal with the hours. We have, to date, provided an additional 55 hours and 24 minutes to meet the government's legislative program—in other words, to allow the government time to deal with the legislation. That is notwithstanding the fact that the government lost something in the order of 22 hours and 58 minutes out of the program due to early adjournment.
When you then examine the fact that there have been five occasions when the opposition has allowed government business to be dealt with during general business on Thursday, you will see that the opposition has ensured that the legislative program, notwithstanding the tight sitting days that were scheduled, has allowed the government to have sufficient time to deal with the program to date. In total, there have been 231 hours and 32 minutes spent on government business this year compared to 223 hours and 11 minutes spent on government business last year. The percentage of time this chamber has spent dealing with government business has remained in the order of 55 per cent to date, but in the last sitting period it was 68 per cent. The figure of 55 per cent is consistent and not out of kilter with earlier years but, if you look at the last session in this period, the opposition has ensured that there have been sufficient hours to deal with the program, which has been put forward to allow those bills to be debated properly and appropriately and considered sensibly. 
The position we have now is that the government wants to treat the exemption from the cut-off in a manner that does not allow appropriate bills to be considered in the last few days—six in all—that we have, including today. Therefore, it is our position that we do not support the exemption for those bills.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-12-04,"—The Democrats will be supporting Senator Ludwig's amendment. All the reasons have been stated and I do not need to go into them again, but I wanted to indicate the Democrats' position on that.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-04,"—The Greens were partly instrumental, through Christabel Chamarette, in having the cut-off brought in so that bills could not be landed in the Senate and passed through without time for the senators to go back to the community and discuss the ramifications. The Greens are inherently opposed to the repeated use of the cut-off and its increasing use by the government.
There is not on this list legislation that could not have been brought here earlier. What happens here is that the government ministers who are responsible for these bills do not get them together in time and do not get them brought to the House of Representatives, knowing that there is a delay between then and when they come to the Senate, and do not allow the Senate adequate time. This happens at the end of every year, but we are now seeing the cut-off being used more and more throughout the year as well. I feel very defensive about it.
The mechanism was brought in by all parties, I think, except the Labor Party at the time, because they were in government— please correct me if I am not right about that. It was brought in so that the community could be adequately consulted. All of the pieces of legislation that are on this list are of intense interest to different sections of the Australian community. To accede to the cut-off is to simply say, `Anything goes.' We are back where we were. Ministers who have not done the work and who have not ensured that the bureaucracy, at their assistance, did the work to get the legislation before the parliament in time for it to be properly canvassed with the community by parliamentarians are not going to be rebuked over that. I think they should be, and we oppose this cut-off motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-04,"—I accept much of what the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate said in terms of cooperation and additional hours. This year has been unusual in terms of the number of sitting days for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was the first year after an election. If you go back through the records, you will see that in the first year after a general election is held in the summer period the parliament has tended to sit late. I noticed that some almost pro-forma objections were lodged early in the year when we announced when the parliament would sit—
—They were not pro forma; they were genuine.
—I have got to say that I privately canvassed this with a range of parliamentarians from around the Senate and I did not receive one single objection from a single Labor senator about how late the Senate was resuming— 
—I raised it as the Whip, thank you.
—You would have been a lonely person in the Labor Party in saying, `Let's come back early; let's come back in January'—
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Let us not have conversations across the chamber.
—The historic reality will record that parliaments generally resume slightly later; I think we resumed about a week later. The other event that occurred this year was CHOGM, which was delayed from last year due to the events of September 11 and which interrupted the normal sitting pattern. So certainly in the first half of this year we had fewer sitting days. I acknowledge and thank the opposition and all honourable senators for assisting the government in finding additional hours to deal with the busy program of a reformist government that has come back after the last election with a heavy number of reforms.
The one point that should be made is that the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] and the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2] are two bills for which the arguments put—and, I think, quite reasonably—by Senator Brown and others are the fundamental case for the cut-off provision: that is, the Senate should have adequate time to review the provisions of bills, the community should have the time to put their views to the Senate, the processes of the Senate should be allowed to work and, therefore, bills should only be introduced in one session and debated in the next session. That is an entirely reasonable proposition that the Liberal Party supported in opposition; it is a proposition that we continue to support in government. That is why the democratic provisions of the Senate apply. You obviously need a majority of the Senate to say, `This is an exemption.' So you need to demonstrate to the Senate that this bill does not need to wait around for a few months and that it can be dealt with straightaway. Traditionally, the Senate has given us the exemption.
But I have to say, having agreed with all of those arguments, that I do not think it is logical to apply the same argument for bills that have already been dealt with by the Senate and which have come back here in exactly the same form. In fact, I pre-empt my referral of this matter to the Procedure Committee. I think it is something that should not be looked at in the light of a particular bill or a particular tactical situation at the time. I think the Senate should give due consideration as to whether bills that have been already dealt with by the Senate should still be subject to the provisions of standing order 111.
You cannot logically make the same argument for the cut-off—that the Senate has not had time to consider it—for a bill that has already been, potentially, through a legislative committee, through detailed consideration by the Senate and the Committee of the Whole, been voted on and been sent back here after insistence by members in the other house. Logically, the Senate has already given that legislation detailed consideration. So I will be referring that matter to the Procedure Committee for consideration as to whether bills that have already been dealt with by the Senate once should be considered subject to standing order 111.
Having said all of that, we would of course have liked to have dealt with the pharmaceutical benefits measures; they are key budget measures. They will of course have an impact on the federal budget. The Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is a key reform measure of the government to help small businesses. We would have liked to have had those bills passed into the law of the land prior to the adjournment at the end of next week. If the Senate votes to not allow that to happen, the government will of course respect the democratic processes of the Senate. But we would have preferred to have seen the measures in place, because they would have improved the Australian economy and improved things for small business.

With this time management motion, while I am endeavouring to ensure that the government continues with its commitment to seeing this bill debated fully and wholesomely in an informed and diligent manner, I am putting in place some parameters for that debate. I have sought in discussions with the minister to allocate times to the remaining groups of amendments, which will allow a full debate on each section of them. After the drafting of this motion, I have suggested to people—and I would like to put on the record the government's intention here—that if those particular break-ups of groups of amendments remaining on the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 unnecessarily curtail debate—for example, if there were to be more debate on the first group of amendments and we have allocated too much time to the last groups—it will remain open to the Senate to change those allocations, and the government would do that. 
The government's main motivation is to see that the debate will be concluded by lunchtime tomorrow. These time allocations will have ensured that the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 and the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 would have been debated in excess of 47 hours. No-one could possibly argue, even for the enormous gravity and importance of these two pieces of legislation, that that is an entirely unreasonable amount of time—in fact, it is an incredibly lengthy amount—dedicated to those bills. This time management motion which I am moving today will ensure that the Senate spends just under nine hours—in fact, I think it is much longer than that—debating these bills between now and when the debate will conclude just before the lunchtime suspension tomorrow.
A number of suggestions have been made, and I regard them as suggestions that are seeking to be helpful to the government, to me and to the chamber. Senator Murphy, Senator Brown and Senator Harradine have come to me at different times over the last 24 hours and suggested perhaps sitting late tonight. I do not blame Senator Brown for that one—that was not his idea—but some people have said, `Why don't we sit late tonight?' Others, including Senator Harradine, have said, `Why don't we sit on Friday?' Sittings on Friday create significant problems for senators when we do not have the number of airline seats available that we had prior to 14 September last year. It is very hard, if you change the sitting times late in the week, for the airline—or airlines, in some cases—to rearrange seat availability, and so the government tries very hard to ensure that we can give senators advance notice of late sittings and changes of sittings. For senators who come from Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory, for example—
—Tasmania!
—and Tasmania, which happens to be in the same time zone, Senator Sherry, which is a major advantage for some—it is particularly hard. For those of us who come from the most outlying states, sittings on Friday ensure that, if you are lucky, you get home either late Friday night or Saturday morning. You then have to turn around at lunchtime on Sunday and fly back here again. We have looked at all those options. I have spoken to various people involved in the debate. I have been told by some strong opponents of the bill that they would in normal circumstances expect the bill to have been completed by close of business today. This motion certainly will not stand in the way of that occurring. I would welcome that occurring, because it would allow the government to get on with a number of other bills on the program. This motion will allow us to consider the bill for all of today. I note that it will all be in daylight hours. A very good point was made by Senator Harradine yesterday that it is preferable not to have late night sittings. We will have all of the daylight hours of today to deal with this bill and we will have—to use cricketing parlance—the entire morning session tomorrow to deal with it as well.
The government commends this motion to the Senate. We think it is a civilised way to conclude the remaining stages of the bill. I think the debate has been full, whole, well informed and diligent. The government has sought to encourage that. We are trying here to ensure that we create enough time to deal with the remainder of the government's program. My earnest wish—and I think it can be achieved with goodwill around the chamber, and it is a goodwill that has existed throughout the year—is to have the Senate conclude at the time that is published in the program; that is, at a reasonable hour on Thursday afternoon next week. I will seek, with all senators in this place, to manage the program. If there are bills that have to go back to the other place and then come back here again for reconsideration, we would like to ensure that all of those processes can be concluded by the normal adjournment time next Thursday. 
I am going to work hard with Senator Ludwig, the Manager of Opposition Business, with senators on the crossbenches and with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure that we do not have to have an all-night sitting on Thursday and have the House of Representatives come back on Friday morning. If we can avoid that, it would be desirable. We want to handle the program, ensure that we have vigorous, full debate on the bills on the program, have the votes, and leave this place at a sensible and civilised time next Thursday. We have not been able to achieve that very often in the past but, if we are able to get this motion through this morning, deal with this bill and move through the remaining bills, then the hope of leaving here at a sensible time next Thursday is achievable.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Declaration of Urgency</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-04,"—The Greens totally oppose the guillotine being applied to a great debate in this place on a matter of conscience. The debate on the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 is extraordinarily important not just to the wider Australian community but to the consciences of all members who have been involved, particularly those who have sat here hour through hour determining, listening to, arguing and settling the extraordinarily complex issues that are involved. This bill entails a great matter of conscience. It is about testing of embryonic stem cells. It is about the commercial impulse that is behind the experimentation that takes place there. It is about our regard for life on earth, in the end. It is about human and scientific manipulation of the natural fabric of life on this earth, not least human life. As such, it measures up with the debates on the death penalty, on abortion, on gay law reform, on the Family Court, on euthanasia—enormously important matters which have been conscience matters and open to all members to debate and ultimately decide as best they could on their conscience and on the debate available. I do not know if ever before such a bill has been subject to the guillotine in this place. I do not know that that has ever happened. I find it extraordinary that the government and the Democrats voted en bloc to put this rolling guillotine or gag—the government puts the nice term of `time management' on it— onto a matter as important as this.
That this extraordinarily important piece of legislation is being debated in the second last week of sitting for the Senate is not in the hands of senators here, except those opposite—the government itself and the Prime Minister himself. But to apply implicitly, if not explicitly, a gag on this and to have that threatening the debate is quite outrageous. That the Democrats have supported the government in potentially gagging a vote on a matter as important to the conscience as this is must in itself be quite unprecedented for the Democrats, who have always determined—I think, quite wonderfully—that there should be open and free debate in this place on the most difficult of matters to do with the shaping of our society and its future.
I would have thought that, in the course of events—and the debate quickened last night—this matter would have been dealt with by today or tomorrow anyway. I think that will still be the case. But now we have a guillotine hanging over our heads. It is a very bad move by the government. Members have not been wasting time in here, I can tell you that. I think that everybody who sat in here would agree. It has been a heartfelt, informative and important debate. To trivialise it by saying that it can be cut off at the whim of the majority—maybe the uninterested majority, at that—and to prevent those who find this matter extraordinarily and hugely important and deserving of the greatest consideration is very bad parliamentary process. I think it is unconscionable: the unconscionable is occurring to what we proclaim as the conscionable. It is bad parliamentary process and a total abrogation of the whole idea that, when we get to complex and important ethical mileposts like this in the progress of our society, the matter should be given greater importance and should not be cut down by a guillotine—one which, on this occasion, is imposed by the government and the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Declaration of Urgency</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-12-04,"—That is the best example I have heard yet of weasel words, sophistry and hypocrisy from the Greens, who are trying to get on the moral high horse whilst actually getting in the way of the Senate doing what it is supposed to do, which is to enable proper consideration of legislation. This proposal— which gives plenty of time: people who are involved in the debate are saying that we will probably be finished by then, in which case it has no effect at all; but that does not stop all the moralising, anyway—enables a disciplined and responsible approach to important issues, rather than trivialising the debate by allowing it to waffle on for endless hours. 
The alternative is midnight sitting after midnight sitting. Nothing trivialises a debate more than endless speeches that repeat the same thing. We have already seen amendments that have failed being put up again and again, and attempts by those who do not support this legislation—although I respect their right not to support the legislation—and who have the majority of the amendments, continually lengthening the debate, to prevent the legislation going through. Those people are trying to prevent the consciences of those who support the legislation from being exercised. This does not gag a vote. That has been said to the Senate, but it is a falsehood. This enables votes. It enables more informed votes because it will not be at midnight, when people are brain-dead and sick of listening to the ongoing repetition. It will enable an informed vote and it will enable that vote to happen rather than continuing to prevent it coming to the conclusion that it needs to come to.
Nobody is more passionate or more informed about this issue than the Australian Democrats—with the possible exception of Senator Harradine, who is certainly passionate about it—and we have contributed constructively. But we have also had a committee stage, a comprehensive committee process, committee inquiries with very many witnesses and a comprehensive report. There is no requirement for every senator to be involved in the committee process, but it is worth noting that some people ignore all of those attempts to get informed consideration and do not participate in the committee process. We have heard the moralising from the Greens, but the Greens did not participate in the committee process, turn up to any of the hearings, listen to any of the evidence nor contribute to the report. Then they come in here and talk about an informed debate.
We have responsibilities if we are going to exercise conscience votes. The Democrats have pioneered, and continue to highlight, the importance of the conscience vote. For us every bill, if someone feels strongly enough about it, is a conscience vote. I wish the other parties would take that into account. That is why we want to ensure that legislation is dealt with properly. It is not just about this legislation; it is about all of the other legislation that we have to deal with and ensuring that it gets proper consideration. If people want to scuttle this legislation—and clearly the Greens are amongst those, by the stance they have taken—that is fine; they can vote against it. But they are trying to prevent the will of the majority of people who support this legislation and these important scientific advancements from prevailing. They can vote against it as they are entitled to, but the majority eventually should prevail on this bill, whether it is a conscience bill or any other bill.
As I said, for the Democrats on every bill there is the prospect of a conscience vote. But that includes all of the other bills we have to deal with. There are some very important bills to do with refugee issues that the Democrats are strongly concerned about. That legislation will not get proper consideration if we all sit here midnight after midnight, through into next week. For those who want to scuttle this legislation, it is quite reasonable to expect that they would do so. I have sat in on meetings before where we have tried to figure out a decent time line for this bill. People say that we will be able to deal with this in a certain length of time but, when it comes into the chamber, that does not happen.
So this is about enabling a democratic outcome, an approach where the majority who support the bill—and it is clear that the majority do—will be given the opportunity to have that vote taken. This has been an open and free debate; it will continue to be an open and free debate. The amount of time that has been put into the committee stages of these two bills will add up to 32 hours once the final vote is taken. I believe that is about the second largest time frame for debate in the history of the Senate—far more time than that taken for the euthanasia laws, for example, which had a total debate time of under 18 hours. The total debate time for these two bills will be over 47 hours, plus the committee inquiry and over 38 hours of debate in the House of Representatives. Every issue that needs to be explored and considered in relation to this bill has been dealt with in this committee stage, and there will be ample opportunity for arguments to be put forward in the remaining time. We have another full day. We have until the middle of tomorrow. That is ample time, given the number of issues and the amount of information that is already on the table.  
It is difficult to suggest any other reason why people would oppose this motion than that they oppose the bill and therefore are trying to prevent it from getting through. As I say, if people oppose the bill, that is fine, they can vote against it, but they should not prevent others who support the bill from being able to ensure that it goes through in an appropriate length of time after proper debate. This will enable all the other important pieces of legislation—which, from my perspective, in some respects deal with much more important life-and-death issues than this legislation—to get proper consideration. So it is about being responsible, it is about being democratic and it is about ensuring that we take our responsibilities properly as senators, that we do not just chew up time for the sake of it and that we do not contribute in an uninformed way to debates that have already had extensive examination by people with expert evidence. 
This approach is one that the Democrats not only support but strongly endorse. There is a suggestion that, because it is a conscience vote bill, it should not be guillotined. I can understand the superficial attraction of that argument, but the view of the Democrats is that every bill before us is a potential conscience vote bill, so it makes no difference to us on this bill as opposed to any other. I recognise that this is a rare opportunity for others in the larger parties to actually exercise some of their brain cells and get their head around an important issue, and we have given them ample opportunity to do that. But this motion does not prevent them from exercising that conscience vote. That is the whole point. If it prevented them, if it somehow or other said, `No, you now have to vote the way we say,' then there might be a point. But it does not curtail their exercising of that conscience vote; it does not curtail the opportunity for people to have their conscience informed, if they wish to do so. Of course, if people had really wished to do so, they would have participated in the committee inquiry stage of this legislation. Every senator was free and able to do that if they wished. All of us have had the opportunity to read the report. All of us have had the opportunity and will continue to have the opportunity to listen to the debate in the chamber as it continues through today and tomorrow. So people will have the opportunity not only to have their conscience vote but to make an informed conscience vote, and they will be far more informed than they would be if they were trying to listen to a debate that waffled on endlessly until midnight, night after night.
Nonetheless, the Democrats make the point, as always, that we should be sitting more often. I note in Senator Ludwig's previous contribution that he expressed a similar view that we are not sitting often enough. That is something that we should explore as a Senate, because we do have a responsible and important job. The Democrats support this motion because we believe it is important for us to be responsible in the way we act in this chamber. We have a great privilege to serve here. We have a particularly major responsibility and requirement to ensure that we fulfil that job in a responsible manner, and that means enabling all senators to contribute to debate, enabling all senators when they are able to do so to vote according to their beliefs and enabling every piece of legislation to get the consideration that it deserves. Voting against this motion will prevent other legislation from getting the consideration it deserves and will clearly be an attempt by those who oppose the bill to scuttle what is, in the Democrats' view, an important piece of legislation. It contains some significant scientific advances that Australia should be getting behind rather than trying to scuttle. So we support this motion.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—Senator Bartlett's comments are a serious reflection on senators who strongly oppose the guillotining of a measure for which a conscience vote has been allowed. In all the 27 or 28 years that I have been here, I cannot recall one instance when that has occurred. The cut-off motion for the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 sets a precedent by the government, with the support of the Australian Democrats. Senator Bartlett has got up here and reflected upon the intention of those who will vote against this guillotine motion. Senator Bartlett's comments were a reflection on Senator Brown. That was an improper reflection, because Senator Brown has taken a keen interest in the debate on this bill. I would have thought that the Democrats would uphold the importance of a conscience vote, but no, they do not. In fact, they voted against an amendment of mine which would have given effective protection for those who have a conscientious objection to working in relation to embryonic stem cells. So workers and students were not properly protected in that regard by the vote of the Democrats. That is all it needed; it was a close vote.
I am not going to take my full time, as Senator Bartlett did; I am just going to raise a couple of questions with Senator Ian Campbell. I notice that by, I think, five o'clock we need to have completed divisions 1, 2 and 3 of part 2. Clause 19 is the last provision relating to those matters. I notice that some of the amendments which fall within that area are listed right at the back of the running sheet. Perhaps they should come up in order to ensure that they are dealt with in that particular period of time. If you have a look at the last page of the running sheet, perhaps we could get the amendments to clause 12 up in the order a bit. They could then be dealt with as from now so that they fall within those areas. Possibly we can keep on with these discussions at a later stage. I do not want to eat into the time that is set for this discussion.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Declaration of Urgency</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-12-04,"—The opposition will not be supporting the urgency motion. The reason for that— and I think it is worth articulating this—is that we have a unique period in this sitting of parliament where we have a conscience vote on this legislation. I will not be taking my full 10 minutes; I will be relatively brief. The opposition will not use the procedural motions they have at their disposal to forestall the vote on this motion. Our position is clear: we will not be supporting the guillotine in this instance. As Senator Harradine has in part mentioned—and it is worth while reiterating this—the usual course of events would be for the committee stage to continue until its completion. With the cooperation of senators, my view is that that would have been completed some time this week.
There is no pressure on the legislative program that would require this bill to be declared an urgent bill and a motion such as this to be put in place at this time. We are still in the penultimate week of the sitting period—we are not in the last week. Bills do need to be dealt with in these last two weeks. Essential bills do get dealt with, with due consideration and appropriately, by this house. The use of this device should not be abused. It should not be used to deal with legislation in the committee stage in a way that has been enjoined by all the senators here. It seems to me that there is no pressure to require such a motion before us. Without wishing to take up any more of the time which would otherwise be devoted to the committee stage of this bill, we reiterate our opposition to this motion.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Declaration of Urgency</title>,Bills,2,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-12-04,"—There are two issues that I want to briefly address, and I have just briefed informally with Senator Ian Campbell. I take the point he made earlier that there is some level of flexibility to ensure timeliness in this debate. Some issues have already been deferred because they relate to a cluster of issues that can be dealt with all at one time, following the report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that we are anticipating being tabled around four o'clock this afternoon. There may be some limitations to take account of that report before five o'clock this afternoon, so I foreshadow that that is a likely issue in relation to the timeliness. The issues around a proposed regulation in regard to the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 relate to clauses 8, 11 and 21. My suggestion would be that we deal with them together in looking at the issues around clause 21, and deal with them once, so that we are not duplicating the arguments. That has been the justification for deferring those issues in the debate so far. I should say that I have got Senator Ian Campbell's assurance that that flexibility is what he was envisaging when he said that there would be the ability to be flexible around those issues. 
The other issue I wanted to address follows on from Senator Bartlett's comments about the debate. I can appreciate that someone who is not intimately involved in this debate might have a perception about it taking up excessive time. I could agree, for instance, that the debate we had yesterday on Senator Harradine's amendment (3) stayed around that particular amendment for quite a considerable period of time. However, that debate was in fact dealing with a series of amendments. The debate related to at least the next half-dozen amendments, and once the debate occurred around one amendment the committee moved very quickly through the next half-dozen or so.
This is the second time the issue has been raised that there are attempts to scuttle this debate. I have not heard them directed to me personally, but I find those comments quite offensive. I do not believe that the character of this debate in committee has been of that nature. Unlike the debate in the House of Representatives—where there was no realistic prospect of most, if not all, of the amendments being carried—in this case anyone looking at the running sheet will see that we are considering serious issues related to the character of the regime to be established. 
The question that has been addressed by most of the amendments is that COAG had promised that there would be a strict regulatory regime. This issue was addressed by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Various recommendations were raised in the various Senate committee reports, and this committee has been addressing them quite seriously in a series of amendments. Some of those amendments have succeeded, some of them have failed— in some cases they have been very close failures—and some matters have been resolved by agreement. This is how the Senate committee process works. I understand why for some people the amount of time that might be involved is frustrating, particularly if they are not intimately involved in the debate. But there has been concrete work occurring in this committee process, and I find obnoxious any suggestion that the time being taken to do this is simply an attempt to scuttle the bill and I do not think it in any sense accurately reflects the work that has been going on in this committee.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Declaration of Urgency</title>,Bills,2,1
"Senator EGGLESTON,",LP,2002-12-04,"—I want to talk today about the shortage of doctors—both of general practitioners and specialists—in Western Australia. This shortage was amply demonstrated by the results of an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey entitled Private Medical Practitioners, which was released in late October this year. Although the conventional wisdom, including that of the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee— AMWAC—is that there is an overall surplus of GPs in Australia, with an oversupply of GPs in metropolitan areas and an undersupply of GPs in rural and remote areas and outer metropolitan areas, a relatively recent Access Economics study commissioned by the Australian Medical Association has challenged this and asserted that there is in fact a national shortage of GPs. Using a demand model, the study estimated that there is `currently a shortfall of GPs of between 1,200 and 2,000'. Under a conservative scenario, Access Economics estimated that the `rural shortage is estimated at 700 FTE GPs and the urban area shortage at 500'. This study took issue with AMWAC's benchmarking, stating that `most Australians do not share AMWAC's view of adequate GP supply' and that `AMWAC's assumption of the acceptability of the benchmark is not backed up with any analysis or justification'. 
Under the policies of the Howard government, the number of GPs in regional Australia has significantly increased. However, demand for increased numbers of GPs is expected to continue over the next decade, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimating that Western Australia's population will rise by 13.1 per cent. Over the same period, the number of people aged 65 years and over in Western Australia is estimated to increase by 1.7 per cent. Elderly people generally consume more health care services than any other sector of the population and present with more complex health problems and with more chronic conditions that require management. Access Economics has estimated that the `demand for GP services based on an ageing population will increase by 1.27 per cent per annum over the next 10 years'.
The medical work force problem has been alleviated somewhat by a reliance on overseas trained doctors. In 1993-94, there were 664 temporary resident visas issued to overseas trained doctors throughout Australia. By last year, this had risen to 1,923 such visas. Western Australia is very heavily reliant on temporary resident overseas trained doctors to fill positions in hospitals, general practice and locum services; for example, the WA state hospital system is heavily dependent on overseas trained doctors and, without these doctors, the WA state hospital system would undoubtedly collapse.
In 1997-98 temporary resident doctors comprised 14.9 per cent of the WA medical work force, and 77.1 per cent of temporary resident overseas trained doctors were employed within metropolitan health services. Thirty-six per cent of Western Australia's rural medical work force are overseas trained doctors. There were 646 conditionally registered overseas trained doctors within Western Australia as at November 2001. This comprised: `unmet area of need', 427; recognised specialist qualifications and experience, 90; foreign specialist qualifications and experience and undergoing further training, 11; temporary registration in the public interest, eight; conditional registration for rural and remote general practice, 50; supervised clinical practice, 24; postgraduate training, 32; medical teaching, one; and medical research, three.
In 2002, 456 temporary resident overseas trained doctors were approved to work in general practice positions in areas of need in Western Australia. By way of contrast, only 58 temporary resident overseas trained doctors were approved to work in general practice positions in areas of need in New South Wales—with a population of 6.5 million in 2001, compared with Western Australia's population of just 1.9 million. The number of overseas trained doctors who were registered in the unmet area of need category has therefore increased by something like 380 per cent since 1996.
According to the Medical Board of Western Australia, the reliance placed on overseas trained doctors continues and it is considered that the number of locally trained doctors who take up appointments within the public health systems falls well short of meeting the needs of the community. As of September 2002, towns such as Broome, Collie, Donnybrook, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie and Mount Barker are all listed as areas of need with practice vacancies. The Access Economics report points out that due to competition with other countries, such as Canada, it will become increasingly difficult for Australia to recruit overseas trained doctors. The report notes:
As this competition intensifies, simple demand pressures will push up the remuneration that medical practitioners willing to move to the country will be able to demand. 
Making matters even worse, other countries with doctor shortages are trying to poach Australian medical practitioners.
A recent study by Monash University and Melbourne University researchers Lesleyanne Hawthorne and Bob Birrell has brought into question the qualifications and fitness to practise of some overseas trained doctors. This study had a particular focus on permanent resident overseas trained doctors and revealed that, in some cases, doctors are working in public hospitals and as GPs in areas of need without having had their skills formally accredited. Permanent resident overseas trained doctors have been required to have their skills accredited by the Australian Medical Council. However, according to this study:
... in recent years this policy has been effectively thwarted as State Medical Boards have provided `conditional registration' to permanent resident OTDs who have not completed their accreditation or have failed in their attempt to gain this accreditation.
The study found that the great majority of temporary resident overseas trained doctors are from Britain, South Africa or other societies with medical skills similar to those in Australia. However, it found that the bulk of permanent resident overseas trained doctors:
... have graduated from non-Western medical schools in Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Their training varies greatly in quality, relevance to the kinds of health problems encountered in Australia and preparedness for the advanced technology they encounter in the Australian hospital environment.
These doctors can also experience difficulty in communicating with staff and patients. Surely it has to be said that English language skills are very important when it comes to practising medicine in Australia.
The President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, Dr Ken Mackey, has made the point that the skill levels of overseas trained doctors are variable and the continuity of care provided by the long-term general practitioner is lost. Similarly, the President of the Rural Doctors Association of Western Australia, Dr Graeme Jacobs, has said that there are some problems with overseas trained doctors and those problems are not only in clinical skills areas but also the social and cultural problems of putting overseas trained doctors into a remote area. For example, the WA Medical Board used to send overseas trained doctors to places like Meekathara in the Eastern Goldfields where there was no effective support or supervision, and the doctors concerned felt very vulnerable and exposed. It was hardly a prudent solution to the needs of such isolated towns and hardly fair to the doctors concerned, who felt they were being thrown in at the deep end.
All of this helps to demonstrate that over-reliance on overseas trained doctors is not in the overall best interests of the health and welfare of Australian patients; although in this regard it should be noted that, in response to concerns raised by hospitals, Western Australia has recently introduced an assessment procedure for overseas trained doctors seeking to be employed in unmet area of need positions in Western Australian hospitals in non-specialist and non-specialist training positions. The process is designed to reduce the potential for OTDs to be in a position where there is insufficient supervision and professional support.
The use of overseas trained doctors to fill medical work force shortages is essentially a stop-gap measure, and longer-term solutions are needed. One long-term solution would be to increase the number of Australian trained doctors. The University of Notre Dame in Fremantle has come to the conclusion that the only acceptable long-term solution to the doctors shortage problem is to increase the number of medical practitioners training and graduating in Western Australia. This is especially the case because the number of locally trained doctors who take up appointments within the WA public health system currently falls well short of meeting the demands of the community.
What is therefore required is an increase in the total number of medical school graduates produced in WA. Graduates produced in Western Australia will be more likely to practise within the state. Notre Dame University has pointed out that very few Eastern States medical graduates are prepared to spend their working lives in Western Australia. For some reason, the Nullarbor proves to be an enormous barrier. It is feared that, if there is not an increase in the number of locally produced graduates and trainees in WA, WA will become increasingly reliant on overseas trained doctors. Accordingly, Notre Dame is giving consideration to the establishment of a medical school at its Fremantle campus, using the facilities of other locations in the metropolitan area for teaching purposes as well. Notre Dame University proposes to establish a four-year postgraduate course for a medical degree. 
After meeting with the people involved in planning the format of the proposed medical school, I came away very impressed with Notre Dame's case, not only on the grounds of the need to increase the number of doctors graduating in Perth but also because the focus of the curriculum will be on general practice medicine. Additionally, a new medical school would offer a choice of courses to WA students, the University of Western Australia being currently the only institution in the state that offers medicine. If Notre Dame medical school went ahead, it would be the first private medical school in Australia. It is proposed that the school develop partnerships to deliver its courses, with other universities, such as Curtin, delivering the basic medical science requirements in their curriculums. The school will also make use of the private sector for clinical placements in areas such as private hospitals, the aged sector and general practice.
It is proposed that the school will take 60 Australian students annually. If the school goes ahead, it will of course be some years before the first graduates are produced and even more before they complete postgraduate training and enter medical practice, but the importance of the initiative is that it will assist to provide a long-term solution to Western Australia's doctor shortage problem rather than the bandaid fix represented by overseas trained doctors. It is said that from small acorns great oak trees grow and, just as the now very large and prestigious UWA Medical School had small beginnings back in 1957, I am sure that, once established, the proposed Notre Dame medical school will develop into an important Australian medical institution.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Western Australia: Shortage of Doctors</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-12-04,"—Senator Murphy asked me a question yesterday about the patenting of human biotechnology products. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows:
Answer to Questions by Senator Murphy on 3 December 2002.
The patent system rewards useful innovation by providing patent owners with the exclusive right to exploit their invention for a limited period in return for publicly disclosing the innovation. In deciding whether or not a patent should be granted, IP Australia which encompasses the Patent Office, examines whether the invention concerned is new, inventive and useful. There are no specific requirements for considering human interest and public health implications when assessing patent claims.
In Australia, biotechnology inventions are patentable, provided the invention meets the requirements of the Patents Act. The raw data obtained from the mapping of the human genome, that is the total human DNA, is not patentable. However, patents may be granted for inventions involving human DNA and gene fragments or human cell lines that are new, inventive and useful. Not all inventions in the field of biotechnology are patentable. Subsection 18(2) of the Patents Act expressly excludes the patenting of human beings and the biological processes for their generation.
The Government recognises that patenting in the human biotechnology area is both a sensitive and important issue, raising fundamental concerns that include moral and ethical issues, the impact on freedom of research in Australia and ensuring Australians have access to the latest health technology and health care. Without patent protection, neither foreign nor Australian enterprises will be encouraged to manufacture medical innovations and make them available in Australia.
In light of recent concerns regarding patenting in the human biotechnology area the Government is giving active consideration to a review of this issue. The Government is currently considering the Terms of Reference for a review to be conducted by the Australian Law Reform Commission on gene patenting.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>National Stem Cell Centre</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-12-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senators Conroy, Collins and Cook today relating to her pecuniary interests.
I wish to specifically take note of Senator Coonan's answer to my question on executive remuneration, particularly the use of protection deals by executives. These protection deals are outrageous. Executives are using derivatives to lock in the value of shares and options granted to them as part of their remuneration package and so avoid any fall in the share price. Shareholders, unfortunately, are not able to avoid any fall in the share price—falls which can often be attributed to bad management. So executives are protecting their interests but putting at risk the investment of shareholders. That is what this latest scam is about: taking the risk out of it for some but leaving all of the risk in the hands of the poor mug shareholder who knows nothing about it. This is wrong and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer should have been prepared to say so, but she did not. Now she goes scurrying out of the chamber and will not stay to debate the issue. She had the chance to say, `This is unethical, this is wrong, and I'll do something about it.' But no, she is running out of the chamber.
The minister's inaction and silence on this matter is condoning these protection deals. If the protection deals had not been exposed in the press, I am sure that the minister would have been happy to let these greedy executives keep doing exactly what they had been doing. It is totally inadequate that more action is not taken. ASIC have simply written a letter. They have stated that the practice of protection deals is undesirable—not illegal, just undesirable. It is clear then that this is a problem calling for a legislative response. ASIC have written to the ASX Corporate Governance Council. If we are lucky, that council may prescribe some voluntary guidelines. That is the form of Senator Ian Campbell, Senator Coonan and the Prime Minister in dealing with corporate greed: `Just a bit more self-regulation, boys; she'll be right. Greed is good.' That is the message from Senator Ian Campbell; that is this government's preferred response. But executives have shown, through the use of these protection deals, that they cannot be trusted. These deals have come up under self-regulation, under the `We'll look after ourselves, don't you worry about us' culture.
Australian investors need strong regulation. They need to know that their investments are safe, that management are acting in the best interests of the company. The minister and the Howard government, however, do not want to repose any restraints on the big end of town. We all know why it is— because Senator Ian Campbell, deep down, is nothing more than the spivvy real estate agent he has always been. Deep down, he is just a spivvy real estate agent.
—Order! Senator Conroy, you should withdraw that comment.
—Spivvy? 
—You should withdraw the comment which is a reflection on the senator.
—I withdraw. The minister and the Howard government do not want to impose any restraints on the big end of town. Small business know that big business are closer to government than they are. Big business concerns are listened to; small business concerns are ignored. Australian investors and Australian workers are being more than ignored: their retirement incomes are being jeopardised by these protection deals which this minister and parliamentary secretary will not act against. Executives receive shares or options so that their interests are aligned to the interests of shareholders.
—You've got $32 million of taxpayers' money in your back pocket.
—Protection deals completely undermine this. It is not good corporate governance but unethical, and it should be stopped.
—You are a mob of thieves.
—Executives already receive exorbitant salaries—an average of $1.68 million per year. But that is not enough for some executives: some executives want to make sure that the value of their shares—
—$32 million is not enough for you, you thief!
—Senator Conroy, resume your seat. Senator Ian Campbell, withdraw that comment. That again is a reflection on a senator. You should withdraw that comment.
—I would be happy to withdraw it if he pays back the $32 million he—
—Senator Ian Campbell, I am not asking for any qualification.
—I withdraw.
—Thank you. You should be in your own seat when interjecting.
—As I said, $1.68 million is not enough for some of these greedy executives. They want to make sure that the value of their share and option package is secured—not through working hard for the company but through entering into one of these protection deals. They want to distort the very corporate governance practices put in place to ensure that they work in the best interests of the company and the shareholders and then they want to have a system of corporate governance that relies on self-regulation. This government supports them 100 per cent in this approach.
The minister has said that a letter has been written and that she will wait for deliberations to conclude before she announces the government's position. But this situation will not go away without more action, without more resolve from this government to get tough on the big end of town—the greedy executives. Unfortunately, that will not happen with this government. It is sadly lacking in determination to deal with the big end of town.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-04,"—I wish to speak on the motion moved by Senator Conroy in taking note of answers to questions on matters affecting Senator Coonan. In particular, I wish to speak about the constant barrage of slurs and defamatory statements about Senator Coonan and about conflicts of interest that arise. In that context, I think it is very important that the Senate be aware of a classic example of misuse of parliamentary position for personal gain. This relates to Senator Faulkner's ongoing battle with Sydney Water. I referred this matter to ICAC because it did raise some matters of very serious concern to the public interest and I was advised as follows. If Senator Faulkner's property involved a sewer lead-out being constructed for a customer where the adjoining property was in different ownership, construction of the extension to the border of the property would be at Sydney Water's cost. However, the practice at that time was that Sydney Water sought payment from the customer. Where the customer rejected this and made a reasonable case, Sydney Water would then comply with the policy and assume responsibility. 
It appears from interviews with Sydney Water officers that when asked to pay for the extension in this instance Senator Faulkner complained vigorously to a number of people in Sydney Water but did so in a personal capacity. Can anyone in this Senate believe that—that Senator Faulkner rang up a number of people and said: `I'm just ringing in a personal capacity. My name is Senator John Faulkner, just in case you did not know, but I am ringing in a personal capacity. That, presumably, means that I shouldn't be regarded as trying to lean on you'? What then happened was Sydney Water, of course, accommodated him, and the answer I was given— after preliminary inquiries were made but not an investigation held—was that Senator Faulkner was treated in the same manner as any customer that complained vigorously. In other words, Sydney Water has a policy of treating some pigs in a different manner to others, which is classic—
—What?
—That is George Orwell, if you do not know Animal Farm— some pigs are more equal than others. In other words, ordinary, decent citizens who were asked to pay money cough up without realising—
—Have you read it?
—Yes, many years ago. They cough up without realising that if they kicked up enough of a fuss they could avoid paying—as in Senator Faulkner's case; from memory, in excess of $25,000—many thousands of dollars. Senator Faulkner managed to put himself in a position where he did not have to pay an amount asked of him because he jumped up and down—as they say, `complained vigorously'—to a number of people and he did so in a personal capacity. If that is not a classic example of a conflict of interest where a member of parliament is using his position to avoid a payment of a sum of money—a privilege that is not accorded to ordinary citizens, who get an account rendered and pay up without realising that they can carry on a treat and avoid paying—then I do not know what is. If the Labor Party are serious about these sorts of issues, they ought to ask Senator Faulkner to take a good hard look at himself and to explain on what possible basis he can make vigorous representations which one of the officers actually noted on the file as `As a matter of urgency, i.e. political influence, work has been started today'. The officer said in explanation that he was aware that the works were being carried out for a senator who had made complaints and he made his own assumption that political influence was behind the expedition of the works.
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. This is a scurrilous attack upon a senator who is not present— not to his face but behind his back when he is absent from the chamber. There is a convention in this place that if senators are going to mention in unfavourable terms another senator and he is not likely to be present they should notify him directly so that he can defend himself. That convention appears not to have been observed in this particular case. On the point of order further, the attack is unjustified and unwarranted, because in the minister's own submission he says that he referred the matter to ICAC and ICAC cleared Senator Faulkner.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: I think the Senate ought to be aware that Senator Cook has been in this chamber from the beginning of my contribution. He sat there and listened and deliberately chose not to intervene. If he were really acting in Senator Faulkner's best interest, he would have been on his feet at the outset. He was not. I think Senator Faulkner will be very grateful to you for allowing all that matter to be put on the record. It is very plain that Senator Cook is simply going through the motions on this, and he is not making a serious point of order.
—I waited for anything of relevance to come forward from Senator Alston. Of course, nothing did. I waited for anything improper to be highlighted by Senator Alston. Of course, nothing was. I waited for Senator Alston to rise out of the sewer that he was talking about, but he never did. It then became appropriate to make a point of order.
—There is no point of order. I remind Senator Alston that the issue before the chair is the motion moved by Senator Conroy, and I ask you to address your remarks to that, please. 
—I am delighted to do that in the short time available, Mr Deputy President. Senator Faulkner is here. He understands the line of questioning, because he has presumably been responsible for it all week. It is all to do with the propriety of the actions of a senator and the conflict of interest that he and others in this place and in the House of Representatives have been carrying on about ad nauseam all week—making no progress, I might say, but nonetheless absolutely determined to make these sorts of allegations. I am simply putting on the record a classic example of someone in a position of influence as a very senior parliamentarian being able to wriggle out of a very substantial debt by making enough complaints to enough people and then pretending that he did it in a personal capacity. I would like to know if it is Labor's official policy that members of parliament can do whatever they like; as long as they say it is in a personal capacity, then we should not be critical of them. I am delighted to hear it and I would like Senator Faulkner to confirm that that is the view Labor takes.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-04,"—I only heard the tail end of Senator Alston's contribution. I thank those who drew my attention to it. As senators would realise, Senator Alston has now spoken about this at quite considerable length in this chamber. I think there have been two matters of public interest speeches, each of 15 minutes duration. Senator Alston made many a grand claim and he referred this matter to the ICAC in New South Wales. I am not aware of the document that Senator Alston refers to. I am of course aware of all those documents, which he has referred to again, that were tabled in the Senate a considerable time ago—I think in mid-2001. As I have said before, I behaved absolutely properly in this. Senator Alston did accuse me previously of using my public position to exert political influence for private gain. I have got no idea what happened after the reference to ICAC. Apparently they have responded to Senator Alston.
I do know this—and I would refer anyone who is interested to it. I doubt anyone is, because Senator Alston has been spectacularly unsuccessful in interesting anybody in this. That is because when people look at the facts of this particular matter they are absolutely satisfied that not only did I act properly but I acted at great personal cost. This matter ended with an excavation for a sewer line under my house that caused persistent flooding. I personally spent over $20,000 to fix this particular problem. I have indicated to the Senate and shown the two journalists in the press gallery in this parliament who are interested my personal documents in relation to this. I took out a second mortgage on my home to fix a problem that should never have arisen.
Senator Alston is still speaking about it in this chamber 6½ years after the event. That is his right. I said at the time that I could not care less who he referred this matter to and I still do not, even though I am not aware of the outcome of any of those particular references. I made it very clear from day one in relation to this particular matter—and I do not know how it relates to the matter that is being discussed in the chamber today—that I paid my contribution to that work. I do not think Senator Alston understood it at the time. As far as I know, he still does not understand it. Of course I did not pay Sydney Water; I paid the contractor. I paid my contribution towards the extension of that sewer line under my house. The sewer line should never have been built—but it was—and has never been used. It remains an extension to a vacant block. I was informed as recently as two months ago that there has never been any intention for anyone to use it at any stage. I am also told, for what it is worth—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise at this late point on a point of order, otherwise I think Senator Faulkner will talk the matter out. I want to make it plain that, as Senator Faulkner himself has said, he has not heard what I have said, so he should take a considered opportunity to respond and not treat this as the end of the matter.
—Point of order! 
—Just a moment. 
—Resume your seat, Senator Cook. I will take this point of order first.
—ICAC said to me that it was their policy to require the payment to be made by the customer but where people complained loudly enough they changed their mind. That is what they said in relation to Senator Faulkner. For Senator Faulkner to simply say—
—Order! What is the point of order?
—For Senator Faulkner to say that he paid certain moneys has nothing to do with it. I am simply saying on the point of order that Senator Faulkner should not regard this as a sufficient response to a matter that he did not hear.
—Senator Alston, through that I did not find a point of order being raised by you. I heard `debate' and that is why I asked Senator Cook to remain silent for the moment.
—My point of order has now been ruled on by you, Mr Deputy President, but the point of order was—
—If it has been ruled on, Senator Cook, let us proceed. There is no point of order.
—If I may, Mr Deputy President, there was no intention by Senator Alston to raise a point of order at all. He never addressed the chair in the appropriate manner and he never referred to a reference in the standing orders. He abused the institution of a point of order to engage in a diatribe and to restate a smear. He should have been sat down immediately it became obvious that there was no such point of order. That is my point of order.
—Senator Cook, on your point of order, there is no point of order. I was listening very closely to what was being said by Senator Alston in his point of order and I was hoping that at some stage he would come to a point of order. I did not hear a point of order. I ruled that there was no point of order. I would ask Senator Faulkner to proceed.
—Of course, I did not know that Senator Alston was going to address this matter and I did not hear all his remarks, but I can again say absolutely clearly to anyone in the press gallery who is interested—and I doubt anyone is—that they can get in touch with me and they can look at all the documents. I want to say this, and I will say it to the Senate very clearly: anyone who is interested in this matter is entitled to look at all my financial records—all records. I categorically deny any allegation by Senator Alston or anyone else that I used political influence in relation to this matter. I did not. Senator Alston has never had any return from his efforts on this matter. As I have said before, if I had influence, that sewer line would never have been extended under my house. I certainly would not have had to pay thousands of dollars towards it, and I certainly would not have had to pay in excess of $20,000 to fix the problem that was caused by it. I accepted the decision; I put the sewer line through. There was no political influence and this is an outrageous slur. I am more than happy to answer any questions in relation to this matter.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-12-04,"—What a stark contrast! For a whole week Senator Faulkner, as the Leader of the Opposition in this place, and his fellows behind him have been using question time to trawl the gutter to try to raise allegations against Senator Coonan. But, as soon as the blowtorch is slightly turned towards Senator Faulkner—and he is now racing out of the chamber—he cannot take it, like a glass jaw. 
In his contribution, Senator Faulkner said that if there were anything of concern with his sewage pipe he would invite people to look at the documents before they make allegations. Isn't that in stark contrast to what Senator Faulkner and his troops did to Senator Coonan when they falsely alleged in this place in question time that Senator Coonan had made a fraudulent enrolment? They had not seen the document but they made the assertion. Indeed, Senator Faulkner's deputy, Senator Conroy, made that assertion publicly. The form and the document have now been presented. Senator Coonan's signature is not on it. Have we received an apology from either the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? No—because there is no grace when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this place. They will trawl the gutter and if they end up in a dry gully, in a dead end, what do they do? They just drop it and move to another smear. They do not even have the decency to apologise and say that they have used parliamentary privilege—indeed, abused parliamentary privilege—in an inappropriate way. 
The Australian Labor Party, during these past few days, have been fumbling around like a Dad's Army trying to get some questions to make some mud stick on Senator Coonan. Those of us on this side who have the privilege to know Senator Coonan will vouch for her integrity each and every day. I know that Senator Coonan, for example, would not sit in a ministry that allowed the $36 million Centenary House rort which benefits the Australian Labor Party. And when I say it is a $36 million rort, that is $36 million above and beyond the market value of the property. Just in case people cannot remember, in the dying days of the Keating Labor government, the government entered into a contract with Centenary House—a Labor Party operation—to force the Auditor-General in there with a 15-year lease at exorbitant rates, which was completely and utterly uncommercial. At the end of the 15-year lease period, the Australian Labor Party, above and beyond what would be a fair and normal market rate, will have scooped $36 million into Labor Party coffers.
We know that sort of history; we know it as fact—and Labor have not denied it—yet we on this side have to listen to the galling exposition from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asserting that somehow we on this side say that greed is good and that we look after ourselves. `Action speaks so much louder than words,' I would say to Senator Conroy and his party. Their actions with Centenary House—for which they have never apologised and for which they have never sought to remediate—show that they are greedy, that they are unprincipled and that they look after themselves.
It is most unfortunate that the opposition in this nation have no policy to put before the Australian people and therefore think they can avoid criticism by the media for that by trawling the gutter and trying to raise allegations against the minister—none of which have stuck. I remind the Senate of an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 9 April 1998 by Kate McClymont as to what happened in a royal commission when a certain senator wished to have his name repressed because of his relationship—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2002-12-04,"—I also rise to take note of the answer by Senator Coonan. In so doing, I simply make a couple of points about the scurrilous and low attempt at a defence of Senator Coonan by both Senator Alston and Senator Abetz. Senator Faulkner has quite clearly shot to pieces the claims made by both Senator Alston and Senator Abetz in his response to them; but he went further than that. Senator Faulkner has said in this chamber that he is prepared to make available all his documentation with respect to his case to anyone who wants to have a look at it to prove that he is beyond reproach on this issue.
Had Senator Coonan made the same offer, the issue of her matters would not have lasted for two days in this chamber; but she did not. Never at any stage did Senator Coonan make the same offer to this chamber as Senator Faulkner did in relation to his matter. Senator Coonan herself has contributed substantially to the mystery surrounding the issues that have quite properly been raised here in question time in relation to her ministerial responsibility. I do not think we need to go any further with the matter than that—to put clearly on the table what Senator Faulkner has offered in his defence and the lack of any offer from the other side concerning the issues raised with Senator Coonan.
I raise the issue of the answer given by Senator Coonan on the question of corporate governance. Since this government came to power in 1996, we in this chamber have seen legislation consistently brought in aimed at trying to curtail, run over the top of or restrict the operations of the trade union movement—to reduce the capacity of the trade union movement to represent the interests of workers in wages and working conditions. But have we seen the same urgency displayed on corporate governance issues? Of course not. Have we seen this government show any concern about the rip-off that has been occurring at the big end of town with executive salaries? Of course not. 
In fact, it is interesting to note the contrast. When those issues get raised, senators on the other side of the chamber immediately jump up to defend the big end of town. We have seen some shocking examples of exorbitant executive salaries being paid in this country in the past few years. They have all been in the public arena and people are aware of who the individuals have been— people like Peter Bartels at Coles Myer, George Trumble at AMP and a whole raft of others.
—You didn't mention Nick Whitlam, did you?
—Nick Whitlam is one and David Murray at the Commonwealth Bank is another. If you want me to list them I will list them all, Senator Campbell—because they are all well known. The rip-off that is occurring at that level is well known. It is argued—you have argued it and your government has argued it—`We have to do that so we do, because we need creative executives in this country. We need to be able to attract the best.'
—What about the $32 million you've got in your back pocket? Pay back the $32 million!
—I make the point—I put it on the public record, Senator Campbell—that there was a royal commission held into Centenary House.
—And it said it was a shonky lease.
— There was a royal commission held into Centenary House, and it cleared the Labor Party—
—It did not; it said it was a shonky lease!
—Why don't you hold a royal commission into Greenfields? Why don't you pay your dues in respect of Greenfields? You won't do it, because you know that it is a shonky deal.
—Senator George Campbell, resume your seat. Senator Ian Campbell, it is disorderly to shout across the chamber. If you want to participate in the debate, you are entitled to put yourself on the speakers list.
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The point of order is that Senator George Campbell is yelling across the table, pointing his finger at me and yelling at me. I am trying to get him to focus on the fact that the Labor Party has stolen $32 million from the people of Australia in Centenary House, and he is reacting by yelling across at me. I would like Senator George Campbell to be called to order.
—Senator Ian Campbell, you are now debating the issue. There is no point of order. If you had listened to what I said, you would have heard that I called both Senator Campbells to order. Senator George Campbell should continue his remarks.
—I was trying to get to the point with executive salaries that we are seeing—and anyone who looks at this morning's newspapers will see—the networks that exist between these chief executives who are ripping off the system, the members of the boards of directors and the Liberal Party. There are charts in the newspaper this morning. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-12-04,"—On behalf of Senator McLucas, I present the 15th report of 2002 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 15 of 2002, dated 4 December 2002.  
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
On 19 November 2002, I tabled on behalf of the Committee a special Alert Digest, No. 14 of 2002, the purpose of which was to comment on the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. Those comments related to the delegation of legislative power and the incorporation of material as in force from time to time. The Committee wrote to the Minister about these comments.
The Minister has now replied to the Committee's letter in time for it to finalise its consideration of this bill and to report on it today. The Committee is most grateful for the Minister's prompt response, which was of considerable assistance in its non-partisan scrutiny.
It is at this point that I should briefly describe the Committee's response when scrutinising provisions of bills which appear to delegate legislative power. The first step is to determine that the power in question is actually legislative and not administrative. For instance, in the same Research Involving Embryos Bill the Committee looked at some provisions for guidelines which it concluded were administrative. In such cases, the Committee under its terms of reference scrutinises the administrative provisions to ensure that the power is suitably defined and limited.
Assuming that the powers are in fact legislative, the next step is to ascertain whether it is appropriate to delegate the powers, or whether the powers are so significant that the bill itself should provide for their exercise. In relation to the Research Involving Embryos Bill the Committee made no comment under this head of its terms of reference.
The final step is then to determine whether the delegated legislative power is subject to adequate parliamentary scrutiny, which in most cases will mean that it will be subject to disallowance. It is in this context that the Committee scrutinises provisions which provide for the incorporation of extraneous material as in force from time to time. It is one thing for a bill to incorporate, say, a single discrete set of guidelines with legislative effect. It is quite another to provide that those guidelines may be amended with continuing legislative consequences. In this situation there may be a compelling case for full parliamentary control of each exercise of the power. The Acts Interpretation Act recognises this in the case of regulations, providing that they may incorporate existing extraneous material but not such material as existing from time to time. This provision may, however, be negatived by an express provision in primary legislation and I will come back to this later.
Applying these principles to the Research Involving Embryos Bill, the Committee identified two provisions for the delegation of legislative power. In both these cases, power was given to issue guidelines and codes of practice which, being legislative, it appeared should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by possible disallowance. In both cases there was the additional consideration that the power included not only the initial legislative guidelines or codes, but also amendments as made and in force from time to time.
Clause 8 of the bill provides for the issue of guidelines with legislative effect, defining “proper consent” firstly by the Ethical Guidelines on Assisted Reproductive Technology issued by the NHMRC in 1996. That provision alone would have been acceptable, because those guidelines were identifiable and not subject to alteration. However, paragraph (b) then provides for the NHMRC to specify further guidelines, apparently from time to time, which will have continuing legislative effect but which will not be subject to parliamentary disallowance.
Clause 11 creates an offence of using an embryo which is not an excess ART embryo. Breach of this provision carries a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment, so it is clearly a serious matter. The Committee's comments on clause 11 relate to the definition of ART program, which is an integral part of the offence. Subclause 11(2) defines ART program as one which is carried out under a Code of Practice issued by the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee of the Fertility Society of Australia, as in force from time to time. Alternatively, the subclause provides that an ART program is one carried out under any other code or document prescribed by the regulations, as that code or document is in force from time to time.
Clause 11 therefore effectively delegates legislative power initially to the RTA Committee, who are given authority to issue variations of the Code of Practice from time to time, each of which will, as noted above, form the basis of an offence punishable by a substantial term of imprisonment. It appears that none of these subsequent Codes of Practice will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The alternative power in clause 11 is for the regulations to prescribe any other code or document at all, produced by any person at all, and which will be in force as different versions are made from time to time. In this case the regulations are subject to disallowance, but the object of the provision is to subdelegate continuing legislative power which will not be scrutinised and controlled by Parliament. 
The Minister's response to the Committee's comments on clause 8 advised that another Act required all NHMRC guidelines to be tabled within 15 sitting days of being made. The Committee report, however, concludes that while this is a substantial safeguard, it does not provide the same level of parliamentary control as possible disallowance.
The Minister also gave reasons why the guidelines should not be subject to disallowance. Firstly, the Minister advised that only a small part of the relevant guidelines would address matters related to the bill, to which the Committee replied that it would be possible to disallow only that part. Next, the Minister suggested that disallowance may affect the independence of the NHMRC, but the Committee did not agree that full parliamentary scrutiny of a continuing legislative power would do this. Lastly, the Minister advised that it would be unusual for guidelines made for the purposes of one Act to be disallowable for the purposes of another. The Committee noted, however, that something may be unusual but nevertheless be appropriate.
The Minister's response to the Committee's comments on subclause 11(2) provided helpful background information on the provision. The response, however, also advised that the Code of Practice itself cannot be made disallowable because it is made by a non-government body. The Committee makes no comment on this, but notes that the same result could be effected by the current formula in subclause 11(2), under which the regulations prescribe the code or other document, although not as in force from time to time. The regulations are then subject to full scrutiny. The Committee's report on the subclause concludes that as presently drafted the constituents of an offence provision punishable by up to 5 years' imprisonment may be determined by non-government bodies without parliamentary oversight or even knowledge.
The other main bill in the report is the Trade Practices Amendment (Liability for Recreational Services) Bill 2002, which concludes a scrutiny during which the Committee wrote twice to the Minister for advice. The Committee has now finished its consideration of this bill, which provides for corporations to exclude liability for death or injury in relation to the supply of recreational services. The Committee accepts that there are problems in this area which need to be addressed, but the question is to what extent these should affect the personal rights of those who use such services. The Minister's advice and the Committee's comments on it in the report present what I believe is a good survey of these difficult issues.
Finally, I would like to remind honourable Senators of the usual end of year breakfast sausage sizzle at which Senators and Ministers get together with Committee members in an informal way to celebrate another year of legislative scrutiny by the Committee and the Senate. It is, I believe, a measure of the non-partisan nature of the Committee and its work that we can hold such an event year after year. It illustrates that the Committee is interested only in personal rights and parliamentary propriety. On behalf of the Committee I would like to see as many of you as possible at the function, to which you have all received invitations.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,12,1

	(6)	Before sealing the package of documents not immune from seizure the person appointed under paragraph (2) shall cause such documents to be copied and the copies of the documents shall be forwarded to Senator Harris at the same time as the originals are forwarded to the Queensland Police.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. This is an extremely long notice. I do not want to interrupt Senator Harris but, if the notice is much longer, could I suggest that he just hand it to the Clerk, because it will have the same effect. Senator Harris, you can actually lodge these notices in writing and they have exactly the same effect.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-12-04,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I will move a motion which is quite a long one, and I do not propose to read it. It is a motion which effectively congratulates the journalist from the Australian, Natalie O'Brien, who has won the 2002 Press Club award for her story in November last year entitled `Overboard incident “never happened”'. This journalist was also awarded an honourable mention for the same story in this year's George Munster Award for Independent Journalism.
—Senator Cook, I think you should lodge that with the Clerk in the normal process.
—Sorry, I was just giving a summary of what the notice contained.
—There is no need to give a summary. Just lodge the notice with the Clerk.
—That is fine. I thought the Senate should be aware of what I was proposing to do, but if this is in order I will do it this way. I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: 
That the Senate—
	(a)	congratulates Ms Natalie O'Brien for maintaining the highest standards of Australian journalism in reporting the fact that the `Children Overboard' incident never happened and on receiving the Perth Press Club Award, an honourable mention at this year's George Munster Award for Independent Journalism and a nomination for, and an honourable mention in, this year's Walkley Award for journalist of the year; and
	(b)	notes that:
	(i)	in reporting her award the Australian stated that, `the story broke through the wall of official misinformation surrounding the “children overboard” affair. The resulting furore became a major factor in the 2001 federal election campaign. The story forced the Prime Minister to release the video of the episode and sparked a departmental enquiry',
	(ii)	the Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident records, at 6.194 of its report, that Ms O'Brien's article reported comments from Christmas Island residents claiming that HMAS Adelaide crew members had said that children had not been thrown overboard,
	(iii)	the report notes at 2.53-4 that the strictly centralised control of information through the Minister's office meant that:
	(a)	Defence was unable to put out even factual material without transgressing the public affairs plan,
	(b)	the instruction that no information was to be released to the media by Defence personnel was explicitly reinforced on the day after Minister Reith had been told by Air Marshall Houston that no children were thrown overboard from SIEV 4, and
	(c)	as Mr Humphreys said, `no public correction to information could be made unless the Minister agreed to those misrepresentations being corrected.',
	(v)	consequently, legitimate inquiries by the media were not answered and, by Ministerial directive, were required to be referred to the Minister who did not answer them, and
(vi)	the publication by the Australian of Ms O'Brien's article played a key role in bringing to light the truth about the alleged children overboard incident.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,13,1

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—I also wish to raise the question of indemnity organisations in other states, particularly in my state of Tasmania, as has been mentioned by Senator Brown. This is the states house, and I believe we do have to ensure that there is justice done in this particular area—I just flag that particular point because of the time. I realise that we have only a very short time before the guillotine falls or, rather, before the arrangements that have been proposed by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate take place. I want to take every opportunity that is available to insist that senators and the Treasury take note of the grave concerns of medical practitioners and others in my state, including those to do with the issue of midwives throughout Australia.

—You have had your opportunity. Please give me mine.
—I have not, but I will.
—The fact is that Senator Knowles is wrong in moving to amend this Selection of Bills Committee report. We should be having an investigation into the matters as listed, because that would help sort out some otherwise quite big problems looming as far as the government's medical indemnity legislation is concerned.

Senator Kerry Nettle
Whip/Selection of Bills Committee Member",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,14,2
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-04,"—I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to orders of the Senate which were successfully moved by Senator Nettle on 2 December. In view of the time, I think it might assist if I seek leave to incorporate it and provide Senator Nettle with this copy.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
On 2 December Senator Nettle moved that the Minister for Health and Ageing lay on the Table by 4 p.m. 4 December 2002 all documents relating to the Inter-Departmental Committee examining the effectiveness of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, including but not limited to submissions received by the IDC, the IDC's recommendations to the Minister, and any response by the Minister to those recommendations. The Minister has advised that unfortunately, it will not be possible to meet this request within the timeframe proposed by Senator Nettle. There were 35 submissions received from stakeholding organisations by the IDC, and consultation with each of them will be necessary before their submissions could be released. The Minister wishes to assure Senator Nettle that her Department is dealing with the request as a matter of priority and a response will be provided at the earliest opportunity.
On 2 December Senator Nettle also requested that the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Trade lay on the Table by 4 p.m. 4 December 2002 all documents relating to the possible inclusion of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as an item for discussion in negotiations for an Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, including but not limited to correspondence between the Australian and United States governments, recommendations to the Australian Government and/or any Commonwealth Government minister, and any Australian Government response to those recommendations. Senator Patterson has advised that neither she or her Department hold any documents falling within the scope' of Senator Nettle's request.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-04,"—Mr Deputy President, Senator Nettle wanted to seek leave to have her remarks recorded so that she could speak at a later date. I ask the Senate to accord her that opportunity.",SENATE,<title>PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-04,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-04,"—Madam Temporary Chairman, I had the chance to speak to Senator Harradine during the formal notices period and I tried to speak to Senator Brown, but he was bobbing up and down and moving motions very vigorously. I say to all senators that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, is required to be before the ERC for a period. We tried to rearrange it but were unable to do so.
—She'd rather be here, I'm sure.
—She would rather be here. I have agreed to take the debate until she returns. She should not be too long; they are pretty ruthless in there. She will be back fairly shortly, so if honourable senators would put up with me for a little while I would appreciate it.
 (Senator Knowles)—The committee is considering the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002, as amended, and amendment (7) on sheet 2751 revised, moved by Senator Harradine. The question is that the amendment be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—Just to enlighten—if that is the word—the Manager of Government Business as to where we are at, I have moved amendment (7) on sheet 2751 revised. That amendment requires a new clause to be added, and it is listed in the documents that you have before you on page 2751. I believe the amendment would improve accountability and transparency and, of course, it is consistent with paragraph 6.4 of the COAG communique about the need for the system to provide for public reporting of research involving embryos so as to improve transparency and accountability to the public. If we are going to have accountability to the public, I believe that the public is entitled to know and to be able to have a say, even if only by way of submission to the NHMRC Licensing Committee, about the suitability or otherwise of the application for a licence to access excess—and I hate that word but I am using the technical term—ART embryos.
The minister has come back and talked— and it is really a non sequitur—about the history of the assisted reproductive technology of IVF. I did not really understand what that meant, given that my amendment is clearly designed to deal with applications for licences for ART embryos. The response from the minister did not go to the question as to why the public should not have a right or an opportunity to comment on an application. I am proposing this amendment so as to allow 10 working days from the day that the application is placed on the Internet for the receipt of public submissions in relation to the application for a licence. I think that is consistent with COAG and transparency. Through you, Madam Temporary Chair, I am putting that suggestion to the Manager of Government Business: why not allow a period—and I have suggested 10 working days—for the public to make submissions to the NHMRC Licensing Committee about the propriety or otherwise of the proposal?",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-04,"—I have been handed the notes in relation to this, and apparently when we adjourned prior to question time today the minister was about halfway through reading that. From what I can understand of Senator Harradine's question and from what I have read of these notes, I think they will go some way to answering the question, so I will put them on the record. I apologise for reading the notes; I know that it is not particularly good Senate practice and that it is pretty boring but I will give it a go. 
When COAG made their decision that an additional layer of oversight should be provided on a national level by the NHMRC Licensing Committee, they recognised the changing environment, including that brought on by the potential benefits, that may be gained through the derivation and use of stem cells. COAG did not say, `The existing system is fundamentally flawed,' or `Not only must HREC and the NHMRC Licensing Committee consider all applications, but so must all members of the public.' Nor did they say, `All applications and all assessments must be made publicly available.'
However, recognising both the desirability and importance of public accountability and the frustrations that many people have felt about the absence of information about approv-ed uses of embryos in Australia, the bill in-cludes a requirement for the establishment of a publicly available database of information about licences. The database will include the following information: firstly, the name of the person to whom the licence was issued; secondly, a short statement about the nature of the uses of excess ART embryos that are authorised by the licence; thirdly, any conditions to which the licence is subject; fourthly, the number of excess ART embryos in respect of which use is authorised by the licence; fifthly, the date on which the licence was issued; and, finally, the period throughout which the licence is to remain in force.
The extent of the information that will be provided is significant. Not only is it the first time that such information will be available in Australia—I might note, after approximately 30 years of ART clinical practice— but the level of information provided to the public is, to my knowledge, unparalleled anywhere in the world. For example, in the United Kingdom the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 does not require the release of any detailed information to the public, nor the maintenance of a publicly available database of the type that we are proposing. The only information that the HFEA—that is, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority—publish is in their annual report, which includes a one- to five-line summary of the types of research approved. It includes no detail of licence conditions or licence periods. The system proposed for Australia already provides significant disclosure and opportunity for public scrutiny. That is the reason why I will not be supporting Senator Harradine's amendment.
—Before I call Senator Harradine, I advise honourable senators that we are just completing the amendment moved by Senator Harradine prior to matters of pub-lic interest at 12.45 p.m. today and then we will move back to page 5 to the group of amend-ments that are listed for debate after 4.00 p.m.
—I am not too sure whether I understood that.
—As you know, Senator Harradine, we are dealing with the amendment that you moved prior to the lunchbreak, which has to be disposed of prior to moving to the group of amendments that are listed for discussion between 4.00 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. They will commence with Senator Barnett's amendments (R2) to clause 8 and (R3) to clause 11.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—In response to Senator Campbell's comments, all I have to say is that, by the time that that information is provided, the horse will have bolted. All the decisions will have been made. The public will not even have an opportunity to offer their views as to the relevance, or otherwise, of the application. It has been said that all of the matter had been through the human research ethics committee of the institution. I dealt with that last night. The whole point about it is that, if you are a drug company and you want to use human embryos to test drugs and so forth, you send it to your ethics committee appointed by the institution, which has been appointed by the drug company. That ethics committee is not going to be terribly much of a barrier, as it has been appointed by the applicant. As I said, the horse will have bolted by the time this information is provided. I am seeking to give the people an opportunity to have their say. If it is to go to the NHMRC Licensing Committee and to be decided by that, so be it. I would rather it were done in a different way, but that is the structure of this legislation. 
Question negatived.
—We move now back to page 5, and I call Senator Barnett to move his amendments.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-04,"—I postpone moving my amendments (R2) and (R3). The running sheet is a little bit skewed. Amendment (R2) to clause 8 relates to the definition of proper consent, and I wish to postpone dealing with that until after the debate we will be having on the disallowance of the guidelines, as per page 7. I would like to come in immediately after that debate with my amendments (R2) and (R3) on sheet 2757 to clauses 8 and 11.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-12-04,"—Amendment (1) on sheet 2718 listed in my name, on labelling, was dealt with under Senator Harradine's amend-ment. I now withdraw that amendment. I move amendment (R1) on sheet 2702 revised:
(R1)	Page 11 (after line 5), at the end of Division 2, add:
12A  Offence—International trade in human embryos, human embryonic stem cells or any product derived from human embryos
	(1)	A person commits an offence if the person engages or seeks to engage from Australia in international trade of human embryos, human embryonic stem cells or any products derived from human embryos except for the purpose of placement in the body of the woman for whom it was created.
Maximum penalty:  Imprisonment for 10 years.
On Monday night, there was a discussion between the minister and me on cloning. I gave an explanation which was incorrect, and the minister pointed that out to me. I would now like to correct the record and state that the claims that human embryonic stem cells could be used in the cloning process have a scientific basis. Firstly, like any other cells in the human body, embryonic stem cells may be fused with an egg, in the `Dolly' process known scientifically as somatic cell nuclear transfer. Secondly, there are reports of mouse experiments in which a mouse was wholly derived from embryonic stem cells.
See, for instance, Andras Nagy et al, `Derivation of completely cell culture-derived mice from early-passage embryonic stem cells' in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, volume 90, pages 8424 to 8428, September 1993; and Janet Rossant et al, `Report to the Serono Symposium on Preimplantation Embryo Development', published by Springer, New York, pages 157, 165, edited by B. Bavister, 1991. A similar event is reported by James A. Thomson in relation to embryonic stem cells from marmoset monkeys. See James A. Thomson et al, `Pluripotent cell lines derived from common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) blastocysts,' Biology of Reproduction, Volume 55, pages 254 to 259, 1996.
These reports on animal experiments indicate that it would be possible to derive a human embryo wholly from embryonic stem cells. This possibility was noted by the Australian Health Ethics Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council in its December 1998 report to the Commonwealth health minister on human cloning, at section N220, referring to uncertainty about the potential of individual ES cell lines and quoting the article by J.A. Thomson et al entitled `Primary embryonic stem cells':
It is not known whether human ES cells could form a complete viable embryo by any method, but this possibility has raised the greatest concern about the derivation of human ES cells.
In the same paragraph that they refer to the Thomson article, AHEC also cite the article by Andras Nagy et al in which there is a description of the production of a completely ES cell-derived mouse. AHEC describes these tetraploid embryos as being incapable of progressing through to development themselves, but as being able to provide an environment in which ES cells could do so. Given that embryonic stem cells have produced embryos in mice and marmoset monkeys, there would appear to be a good chance that human ES cells could, if suitably manipulated, develop into embryos. The history of research in this field would certainly imply that extensive studies of a variety of approaches would be required before one could dismiss this possibility with any confidence whatsoever. 
I mention that because during the debate I was assured by many scientists that it was possible to actually use a stem cell to clone. Unfortunately I gave the minister the wrong reference, which she pointed out to me. That is not the only reason that I am moving this amendment. The amendment is to prevent us from trading in embryonic stem cells or human embryos or any derivatives from those. The reason I put it forward is that in Australia we have certain standards according to which we treat embryos, stem cells and human tissue. We have an AHEC, which is the ethical standards association, and we have a number of NHMRC guidelines. It is illegal to trade in human tissue. I think that would be a position that most Australians would agree with. But it is no good for us, as senators, to say that we will set up strict guidelines and strict regimes for human tissue in Australia if, when these embryos or embryonic stem cells are moved from Australia, we then have no control over them at all.
I pointed out in my last speech that, if we sell guns or some types of radioactive material, we always sell them overseas with a rider that says that you cannot on-sell these products and you can only use them in certain ways—you cannot develop an atom bomb; you can use this particular uranium in a certain way. It is called an end-user certificate. But we do not have any such thing in Australia for this case. At the Senate committee that investigated the evidence on this, I asked on a number of occasions what happened to embryonic stem cells that went out of Australia. At the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on 29 August, Ms Matthews said:
The results of the research would be able to be sent overseas. If you are talking about the embryonic stem cell lines and whether they could be sent overseas, yes, the embryonic stem cells could be sent overseas.
	...	...	...
If stem cell lines are subsequently sent to Singapore, the use of those stem cell lines is permitted in accordance with Singaporean law.
Dr Morris said:
The licence would only apply to the work undertaken in Australia. If something is exported to another country, the laws of that country would apply.
Ms Matthews said:
Leaving aside the customs regulations, under this bill there is no prohibition on the export of the products of embryos, such as embryonic stem cell lines and other products.
The NHMRC provided additional responses to the Senate committee. The response to questions raised indicated that the bill does not directly regulate the exportation of an excess ART embryo and the exportation of human embryonic stem cell lines. It said:
It should be noted that COAG did not address the matter of exportation of human embryos from Australia. It is proposed that the NHMRC, in consultation with the Department of Health and Ageing, Customs and other relevant agencies, develop further advice ...
It clearly states there that there is no provision to regulate the use of our Aussie embryos and embryonic stem cells that are sent overseas.
On the cloning bill last week or the week before or whenever it was—time get confused—we all voted down cloning in Australia. It was a unanimous vote of both houses of parliament. Yet here we have today, a week or so later, that we can actually send stem cells over to Singapore. BresaGen and ES Cell have said that they will operate a company in Singapore. They will open an office in Singapore to develop embryonic stem cell lines. I pulled off the net this morning a news report from the ALS news entitled `Singapore backs embryo cloning'. It says: 
The Singapore government will allow the cloning of human embryos for certain research projects giving the island state some of the world's most liberal guidelines for stem cell research.
Singapore hopes the guidelines will allow local firms to take a leading role in stem cell research that could lead to both profits and cures for disease.
I have established that animals have been cloned from stem cells—both monkeys and mice. I now establish that the Singapore government does allow cloning. It is well established that ES Cell and BresaGen are opening an office in Singapore.
I want to say that it is no good us passing a bill that says that we prevent cloning in Australia, which was carried unanimously by both houses of parliament, and then turn our backs and say that we can send embryonic stem cells and other stem cell products to Singapore—or to anywhere in the world, for that matter—and from then on, once they are out of the hands of the Australian law that we set up on trading in human tissue, it is a freewheeling, laissez-faire situation out there, where you can expect anything from any country that does not have our high ethical standards. I said in my previous speech that we cannot say that we have done the right thing, that we can sleep easily in our beds tonight and that we have put down guidelines and legislation that will prevent cloning and then turn our backs when embryonic stem cells go out of Australia.
I am very concerned about this. I think there are two very important issues in this bill. One is the testing of drugs and the other is the export of embryos and embryo stem cells. I just cannot think how we can say with any justice, any conscience or any degree of morals or ethics, `Let's look after our Aussie embryos in Australia; but, when they go overseas, it is up for grabs.' I do not think that anyone believes that. I do think the punters out there—the voters—believe that. I think they would say that, if it is good enough to put in very strict regimes in Australia for Australian grown stem cells, then surely the same rules and the same regulations must apply when those stem cells go overseas.
Unfortunately, I must have asked about this half a dozen or a dozen times, and no doubt Senator Harradine will back me up on this; and we were told constantly and honestly—and I thank them for that; there was no obfuscation—that, once they are out of Australia, anything goes. The only way I can see that you can stop this is to support the amendment that I am putting up, which says that you cannot trade in human embryos overseas. Otherwise we are really hypocritical. We would be hypocrites to pass legislation in Australia but walk away from it when the embryos go overseas.
I would like the people who are listening in to this debate and watching it on the screens in their offices to give this very careful consideration—not just to come down here and say, `I voted on this side and I'm going to continue to do so; I'm going to lock in to that.' I am asking them to think about this, to think about what will happen and whether they believe that the people who elected us would want that to happen. I know there are a great many people in Australia who find this repugnant. There would be a great many people in the conservative churches, or any churches, who find this repugnant. Not only the people who have a religious commitment but all people would find repugnant our walking away and washing our hands of embryonic stem cells so that Singaporean companies and governments can make a profit. I must admit that they were honest: they want to make a profit. That is a great motivation; I am a person who likes to think in terms of making a profit, but not at the expense of ditching every ethic that we have.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—I will be very brief, because it is almost five o'clock. We have this and two other matters to deal with by then, as I understand it.
 (Senator Knowles)—That is correct, Senator.
—The issue is that this legislation prohibits the export of embryos; the bill, though, allows for the export of embryonic stem cells. As was explained by the minister previously, they must get the approval of the donors if stem cells are to be derived. The fact of the matter is that the donors do not have any control over where the stem cells go. They have control over the embryo but once they give consent to the dissection of the embryo for the purpose of extracting embryonic stem cells they have no way of having control over them. Under those circumstances, the extraction may take place and those embryonic stem cells may be sent overseas.  
The other night, the issue was whether or not a human embryo could be derived from that embryonic stem cell. If it is the case that an embryo can be derived from the treatment of an embryonic stem cell, that is using that embryonic stem cell to create a clone of the donor couple who gave the approval. In the debate the other night, the minister was asked whether or not that was possible. I am asking a question, but before the response I want to let you know this: the National Health and Medical Research Council, in paragraph 2.20 of the Scientific, ethical and regulatory considerations relevant to cloning of human embryos report, which was sent to Dr Michael Wooldridge on 16 December 1998, says, `Yes, there are examples where embryonic stem cells have been placed on a bed of tetraploid embryos. This happened in the mouse example and, yes, a mouse embryo developed and then developed into a mouse.'
—And a monkey.
—And a marmoset monkey, as my friend here said. That was stated in paragraph 2.20 of the NHMRC document. I am very surprised that the other night the minister was told something contrary to this, presumably by the NHMRC, when in their own document they have said that this is a possibility. It has not occurred with humans to the present moment, but what happens to a stem cell donated by a couple here if it is able to be developed in a country that does not have the ban on cloning that we have? You could have a clone of the donor couple. The question is: should that be allowed? Clearly, in my view, we should not allow that. As Senator Boswell says, it really undermines the purpose of the bill that was adopted unanimously—that is, the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, which bans the cloning of human embryos.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-04,"—There are a number of things I would like to respond to in the remarks made by Senator Boswell and Senator Harradine. Senator Boswell pleaded to our colleagues, who are glued to their monitors following this debate—I do not mean to sound sarcastic—to listen to the arguments. I think it is fair to say that most senators have probably concentrated more on this debate than any other debate in recent times. Certainly, because of my role as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I have had to speak more than just about anyone else in this place to the supporters of the bill and those who are opposed to this bill. I think that there is a very deep understanding of many of the issues that are being discussed. That clearly means that the outcome will be representative of the views of the Senate as a whole, ultimately. I join with Senator Boswell in his plea—not to the extent of suggesting that people are not concentrating on the debate but to pay tribute to the level of interest that there has been in the debate.
I know, from coming in here for divisions, that senators do not always know exactly the amendment that we are dealing with at the time, but overall they have been following this debate very closely. I do not think it is fair to pretend or to even assert that all senators are not following it or taking an interest in it. I think we are all taking it very seriously. Some senators, such as Senator Harradine, Senator Boswell and others, are living it and breathing it, amendment by amendment. Not everyone is as interested. I think we should be all proud as senators that the debate has been well informed and that most people are paying attention to those areas that are of particular concern to them. I know that Senator Patterson, for example, is approached regularly by colleagues saying, `What is the amendment? Do you have details?' Everyone is trying quite hard to make informed decisions, and I think that generally the debate in this place has been of a significantly better quality, as in most cases, than the debate in the other place. 
I turn to Senator Boswell's and Senator Harradine's particular remarks—and I have been provided with these notes by the ministers and officers. Senator Boswell did cite a paper by James A. Thomson and others, a co-author of which was John Hearn, who gave evidence before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The paper was one of the original papers describing the isolation and culture of embryonic stem cells. The paper did not show that embryonic stem cells could form embryos. Rather, when cultured at a high density, these cells formed embryoid bodies. These are collections of cells of different lineages but they have no ability for organisation, as occurs in an embryo. The ability to form embryoid bodies was evidence that the stem cells were pluripotent. John Hearn, who is from the Australian National University, has advised that human embryonic stem cells do not have the capacity to form advanced embryoid bodies, as described in the paper for marmoset stem cells.
Senator Boswell has indicated that the reason he moved this amendment—which was, as Senator Boswell would agree, defeated in a slightly different form earlier— was the concerns that embryonic stem cells could be used to create human embryos or could be used in cloning experiments overseas. They are obviously very legitimate and sound concerns. In relation to this, yesterday Senator Boswell provided the minister with citations from three peer review journals which he says support his claim that a mouse has been wholly derived from embryonic stem cells. The minister has obtained expert advice on these articles and can assure the chamber that this is not the case. 
The articles cited by Senator Boswell relate to work that was undertaken about a decade ago. That work was undertaken prior to the discovery of the technique known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SNCT, which was used to develop and create Dolly the sheep. The work reported in these journals shows that, when the mouse stem cells were mixed with certain other mouse cell types in culture and the combination of cells was placed in a mouse uterus, it was possible to achieve a viable mouse embryo. The technique reported was cumbersome and had a very low success rate in mice. As a technique for the cloning of animals, this research was overtaken by the development of SCNT, which has been used successfully, albeit with a low success rate and significant health problems, in resultant cloned animals in a range of mammals, from mice to cows.
However, in relation to the concerns raised by both Senator Boswell and Senator Harradine regarding the possibility that human embryonic stem cells could be used in the cloning of human embryos, this is theoretically possible. The technique of SCNT, whereby the nucleus from any cell of the body excluding sperm and eggs—for example, skin, liver, muscle, brain and theoretically any stem cell, be it embryonic or adult—is transferred into an egg which has had its nucleus removed, could theoretically be used to clone a human embryo. However, in this respect a human embryonic stem cell has no advantage over any other human cell that has a full human genome. Any human cell can be used in the SCNT procedure, along with a healthy human egg.
Under the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, this technique, or in fact any other technique that may be developed to clone human embryos, is banned with strong penalties. The export and import of prohibited human embryos is also banned and, as announced during debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill, the government is banning the export of all human embryos and the import of viable products of human embryo clones through changes to the customs regulation. In relation to Senator Boswell's concerns that human embryonic stem cells will be taken overseas and used in the cloning of human embryos, I hope I have explained that human embryonic stem cells are not unique in this regard. Senator Boswell wants to prohibit international trade in embryonic stem cells, and I can see that this concept will get some support. However, this bill is not the appropriate forum in which to address such concerns.
I say in parenthesis that Senator Harradine, in the introduction to his remarks, said that this bill allows this to occur. It is not actually this bill that allows it to occur; that is not quite specifically accurate. I think Senator Harradine and Senator Boswell would agree with me that they would like this bill to not allow it to occur. This bill does not particularly change the situation, and we are saying that this is not the bill to address those concerns. I think it is also fair to say that the government, during the debate on the cloning bill, did in fact give an undertaking to ban the trade in materials from related human cloning and to review it in 12 months. So I think it is fair to say that the government have shown their bona fides in relation to this issue and the concerns about the trade in human embryonic stem cells that Senator Boswell and Senator Harradine have raised. 
This amendment is outside the scope of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. Of the two bills considered, it would have been more appropriate for such an amendment to be moved to the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill. In fact, such an amendment was discussed but not supported. I mentioned during the debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill that the Prime Minister has undertaken to amend the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 to provide for a 12-month prohibition on exporting human embryos, during which time the government will determine the most appropriate way of regulating such exports. I have also stated the government's intention to amend the customs regulations to implement a ban on the import of viable materials derived from human embryo clones, and again this bill will be reviewed after 12 months.
With regard to Senator Boswell's revised amendment, considerable work is required to understand the ramifications of such a proposal and to work out the details, if it is considered desirable. Some of the details to be considered would include, firstly, whether the proposed ban would be extended from embryonic stem cells to other human tissues, given that any human tissue could be utilised in cloning techniques. I understand that such an arrangement, for example, may prevent the transfer of human tissues required for transplant. Secondly, would the proposed ban only cover trade where money is exchanged? What about where cells are given freely to colleagues in other countries? Such an arrangement would set a dangerous precedent, as the international scientific community relies on collaborative research programs that depend on international sharing of resources in order to extend global research efforts.
If these proposals were to gain support it could result in the Australian research and medical communities being isolated from international counterparts. Such a result would have disastrous effects on Australian research efforts and, therefore, on the future health and wellbeing of Australians. It is also fair to say it would have a disastrous effect on the development of world-wide leading edge research. Therefore, it would have an effect on the attraction of scientists and medical researchers to develop their careers in Australia or in fact to enter into those careers in the first place. I am sorry for delaying the Senate for so long, but I think Senator Boswell and Senator Harradine in particular would appreciate the detail we have gone into in responding to their concerns and also the sympathetic nature with which the government has viewed similar concerns in relation to its consideration of these trade issues with regard to the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill. For these reasons, we will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-04,"—I certainly thank Senator Campbell for his contribution. He raised some good points, including the notion of free trade—that is, the free exchange of materials—which I suspect he might get questioned on in a moment. I think that is an interesting point to put on the record. In relation to Senator Boswell's comments—and I think once again there has been reference to examples that were raised in the previous debate on a similar amendment—I want to put on the record the proposition that embryonic stem cells are in fact totipotent. I will use the definition in the House of Representatives human cloning report. It states that totipotent `describes a cell or structure that can produce all cell types including placentas'. That means one that is capable of giving rise to an organism. That notion is not proven and that was the point I made in my contribution to the debate on Senator Boswell's previous amendment. 
The evidence that we have to date suggests overwhelmingly that that is not the case. As I alluded to when speaking about the previous version of this amendment, I acknowledge that there is a case of mice embryonic stem cells giving rise to an embryo, and I described some of the circumstances involved in that at the time. It is very important to remember that in this experiment, as I pointed out last time, the ES cells were on a bed of embryos. It is important to note that we do not know exactly what it was that gave rise to the embryo, whether it was the embryos or whether it was the ES cells. I think it is important to note that, in the evidence to the committee, Dr Tonti-Filippini qualified very carefully any claims that this experiment proves that ES cells are totipotent.
The point that I want to emphasise is that the whole proposition is highly speculative and I suppose we acknowledge that, by virtue of it being an innovative field, science is speculative. Presumably we want to guard against things that we perceive as dangerous, and we want to regulate for things that may or may not happen. But I think this is a very difficult and inappropriate area at the moment. I think that, if there is evidence that ES cells are totipotent, we should come back and amend the legislation. But I do not think this highly speculative proposition and discussion should result in the amendments before us. I do not mean to have `Groundhog Day' on this matter. I understand that there was some allusion to the comments that were previously made and the examples that were put on record, but I advise the chamber that the Democrats will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-12-04,"—I thank Senator Ian Campbell. He conceded that it was possible to clone if you put any sort of isolated nucleus from an embryonic stem cell or any stem cell into an egg. I think that is what he said. This is a well-thought out amendment. I have said `trade' and trade means commerce, and it means trading. It does not mean exchanges in science; it means getting a commission, a remuneration or a consideration for what you have done. This is why I changed it. It means that someone must make money. Someone must get a commission or a remuneration out of it. I very clearly said it is only human embryos, human embryonic stem cells or any product derived from human embryos. It is nothing to do with blood or any other human tissue that may have to be exchanged. That should put down the fears of Senator Ian Campbell. AHEC, which is the ethical committee of the NHMRC, were so concerned about these papers that they put a report in to the minister at the time. That shows that it can be done and they were concerned. They are part of the NHMRC and they were so concerned that they reported these papers to the minister at the time. 
We only have five minutes and I do not know whether anyone else wants to speak. I refute what you have said, Senator Ian Campbell. I know you said it with goodwill but in effect you conceded my point. You conceded it could happen although you said it was remote. You conceded that it happens in animals. To our knowledge, there has never been a human clone in the world so you cannot say, `It has not been done with people,' because cloning has never been done with people. Cloning has been done from stem cells with monkeys and mice. The next step could be human cloning but no-one has ever done that. It is illegal around the world except in Singapore. The two partners of the stem cell centre are setting up in Singapore, where cloning is legal.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-04,"—I will speak briefly in support of Senator Boswell. As I said last night, there has been a startling admission made by Professor Carl Wood, who said:
... at one stage despondency about the techniques persuaded the team to try for fertilisation of a human egg and sperm cell and embryo growth in a sheep. 
This is not overseas; this was here in Australia, in Victoria, carried out by Australian scientists. However, they go on to say:
In some ways we were relieved at the failure of the experiment as it may have been difficult to convince the community that the sheep was an appropriate place for human fertilisation and early human development.
I would like to place on record that One Nation supports the amendment.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—I move amendment (11) on sheet 2696:
(11)	Clause 26, page 18 (lines 27 to 31), omit the clause, substitute:
26  Suspension or revocation of licence
		The NHMRC Licensing Committee may, by notice in writing given to the licence holder, suspend or revoke a licence if:
	(a)	the Committee believes on reasonable grounds that a condition of the licence has been breached; or
	(b)	the Committee has evidence that there has been insignificant or no advances in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment.
Clause 26 of the bill deals with the suspension or revocation of licences. I am proposing to omit the clause and to substitute a new clause 26. This amendment would allow the NHMRC Licensing Committee to require performance from the licence holder on a key requirement that the committee must consider when deciding whether to issue a licence. Clause 21(4) of the bill states:
In deciding whether to issue the licence, the NHMRC Licensing Committee must have regard to the following:
	...	...	...
(b) the likelihood of significant advance in knowledge, or improvement in technologies for treatment ...
Quite simply, my amendment would ensure that licence holders who are not performing against this criterion could have their licence suspended or revoked. I would have thought that that is reasonable enough. It is not really adding to the legislation; it is reinforcing that requirement. This is consistent with Commonwealth legislation, and there are a number of examples of that. I refer to section 106 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which states:
Suspension or revocation of licences at the instance of the Commission
(1)	If the Commission considers it appropriate to do so, the Commission may, by written notice given to the licensee:
(a)	suspend the licence for a specified period; or
(b)	revoke the licence.
(2)	Before taking action under subsection (1), the Commission must follow such procedures, if any, as are specified in the Minister's directions as procedures preliminary to the suspension or revocation of a licence at the instance of the Commission.
I am simply referring to that, and there are a number of other examples in legislation. Accordingly, the existing clause and the proposed amendment are certainly not controversial. I move the amendment accordingly.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-04,"—The Australian Democrats will not be supporting Senator Harradine's amendment. Clause 26 allows the licensing committee to revoke a licence if a licence condition has been breached. We have discussed or alluded to that on a number of occasions during the committee stage of this bill. This amendment is obviously intended to add an additional criterion for revoking the licence, in relation to this notion of `insignificant or no advances in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment'.  
I understand the intention behind this. I would certainly describe it as well intended, but I suspect that, scientifically, it is potentially naive. Any judgments on the results that are obtained may not be assessable before that project is completed. And how do we make a determination as to whether or not the results constitute a significant advance in knowledge? I think that is incredibly difficult. This is a very difficult provision, in a scientific sense, to apply to the licensing committee. On a practical note, by the time the lab work is complete and written up, the licence probably will have expired anyway. There are problems with this amendment. While I acknowledge the intention behind it, I think that it is a very difficult thing to assess in practical terms and, once again, I am sure that our views as to what constitutes a significant advancement could vary substantially as well.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-04,"— Senator Harradine's amendment seeks to amend clause 26 to include an additional ground on which the NHMRC Licensing Committee may suspend or revoke a licence, and that is if the committee has evidence that there has been insignificant or no advances in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment. I will be opposing the amendment because I am of the opinion that the licensing committee should have the discretion to set conditions and make decisions on the basis of the merits of each case. 
Firstly, it would be difficult to judge any project before it is completed with respect to whether or not it led to a significant advance in knowledge, and the NHMRC Licensing Committee would only cover the work involving the use of an embryo and not all other aspects of the research project. At the stage in a research project when the benchwork has been completed and the results written up and published—at which point it may be possible to judge the outcomes of the work—the licence will have already expired. Therefore the amendments suggested by Senator Harradine would at best lead to a judgment being made after the licence has expired; at worst it may lead to projects being judged and terminated prematurely.
To illustrate how this would operate in the context of the legislation, I will go through a hypothetical scenario. A person applies for a licence to use an ART embryo to undertake certain research and satisfies the NHMRC Licensing Committee that there is likely to be a significant advance in knowledge which could not reasonably be achieved by other means. Assuming that the licensing committee is satisfied that all the other requirements for the issuing of a licence have been met, the committee then issues a licence for the use of the embryo for the purpose detailed in the application. The licence holder subsequently uses the embryo and fulfils the reporting requirements in accordance with the conditions of licence. The NHMRC Licensing Committee then decides that the results of the research do not constitute a significant advance in knowledge. Given that the embryo has been used and the licence is no longer in operation, what then would be the point in suspending or revoking the licence, because the embryo would already have been used for the purpose described in the application and in accordance with the licence conditions? I believe that this is an important area in which the licensing committee should have discretion to make decisions on the basis of the information available to them, and for these reasons I will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-04,"—I rise to indicate that One Nation will support Senator Harradine's amendment. The reason for that is that both the minister and Senator Stott Despoja have referred to clause 26 of the bill having the head of power to revoke the licence. The minister also went on further, immediately preceding me, to say that if the person uses an embryo then the licence ceases to exist. I do not believe that that is technically correct. A licence can be to use multiple embryos. If a person has not been able to show that there is a significant improvement in knowledge and technology then that would be a reason for that licence to be revoked—and Senator Harradine's amendment will very clearly do that. 
If the conditions set down by the NHMRC do not actually have in them a requirement for that experiment to improve technology then there is no head of power under clause 26 under which they can revoke it. So, firstly, licences can be issued for multiples of embryos and, under clause 26, unless the licence explicitly says that one of the requirements of the licence has to be for the improvement of knowledge, there would be no way that the NHMRC could revoke that licence. The requirement that Senator Harradine's amendment brings in is that there must be a significant improvement in technology. Therefore One Nation supports Senator Harradine's amendment for those reasons.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-04,"—I move amendment (1) on sheet 2759 revised:
(1)	Clause 26, page 18 (after line 31), at the end of the clause, add:
	(2)	If a licence holder is convicted of an offence under this Act or the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002, the NHMRC Licensing Committee must, by notice in writing given to the licence holder, revoke each licence held by the licence holder.
I thank Senator Bishop for his comments and for the manner in which he made those comments. I think Senator Bishop's amendment is slightly more stringent, but this amendment is a good one and I would just like to make a few comments about it before allowing the minister and the Labor Party to respond.
This is about an automatic revocation of the licence by the licensing committee if a serious offence has been committed and a conviction has been incurred. It is an offence under not only the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 but also under the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. The NHMRC Licensing Committee must by a notice in writing given to the licence holder revoke each licence held by the licence holder. That basically makes it an automatic revocation of that licence. 
The penalty provisions in the bill are set out in clauses 10, 11 and 12 in division 2. They are for serious offences with penalties of up to five years imprisonment. We are not talking about being late with the reporting of an annual report or something like that; these are where there has been, in many of these cases, an intentional or reckless disregard for the licensing regime or the legislative or regulatory regime. So we are talking about serious offences. Indeed, it is only appropriate that there should be an automatic revocation of the licence. There will be an argument that the NHMRC, or the licensing committee at least, needs a level of discretion in terms of the suspension of a licence and the types of conditions and sanctions that may be imposed on the licence holder. But this is about penalties where convictions have taken place. We are talking about serious offences.
I draw the chamber's attention to the report of the Community Affairs Committee, of which I was a member. I asked this question of the witnesses on many occasions and it seemed to me that, for serious offences, a number of them supported an automatic revocation of the licence. I make the point again that it is relevant not only to this bill but also to an offence or a conviction made under the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002.
I have had some discussions with the minister's office and I want to thank the minister for the good grace and the manner in which those discussions have taken place and for what I understand will be her response in not opposing the amendment. I look forward to that. The only question that I have is with regard to the time period. It is an automatic revocation and it must be by notice in writing. A response stating how quickly that is to happen might be helpful. Obviously, they will use their best endeavours, and you can only assume that that will happen after the conviction has been incurred.

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-12-04,"—As I foreshadowed in the debate on the first component of the Greens' amendments dealing with the establishment of a stem cell bank—although the government threw out the recommendations from Senator Stott Despoja and Senator McLucas in relation to establishing a stem cell bank that the review occur—I thought it was important that we deal with the issue of the horse bolting on the commercialisation of stem cells extracted from human embryos. The way that came to my mind that this might be achieved was by picking up on some of the evidence brought before the committee on how the Europeans deal with commercialisation. Whilst this particular model might not suit us in the long term, it is a relatively simple way of ensuring that the horse does not bolt in relation to stem cell lines until we achieve a measure to deal with the commercialisation of this research that suits our particular circumstances.
I have accepted in part the concerns raised by Senator Stott Despoja that a stem cell bank per se, and certainly the British model of a stem cell bank, may not be ideal for Australian circumstances and our regime here. I made the point quite forcefully on the last occasion that that is not an excuse to do nothing. In particular, where we have COAG, the Premiers and the Prime Minister saying we have a strict regulatory regime, principal in the ethical position that many people take is that this work should occur for humanitarian purposes and not for profit or for commercially related purposes and that we should follow the lead of the many countries that have found a variety of different means of curtailing the profit or commercial motive in furthering this research.
Amendment (R8) seeks to do that by saying that, essentially, a licence holder would lose their licence if they sought a patent in relation to unmodified stem cells. I think it is necessary to make this point too, because I know that some of the responses to my amendment have said that this would have a substantial impact on investment and that this research should go ahead. With respect, that ignores what most other regimes established to deal with this type of research have put in place in their own circumstances and it maintains the position that we should just do nothing until somewhere in the never-never we might come up with something appropriate to our particular circumstances. Under a strict regulatory regime, we should have something that prevents the horse from bolting until, if we have not got it ready now, we have the appropriate system in place to deal with these commercial interests suitable to Australia's particular circumstances.
As I have said, I looked at the European model, which we heard evidence about in the Senate inquiry. I raised this in the earlier debate but I will repeat it for senators who may not have attended at that time. In his submission to the inquiry, Mr Ilyine from Stem Cell Sciences, even though they are part of, in a sense, the commercial interests in this area, said they supported the establishment of a stem cell bank. The interesting component when I started questioning Mr Ilyine was that he had some knowledge of the UK and the European models for dealing with commercial interests and in fact advocated that such should occur. When he spoke about the European model he said:
The unmodified human stem cell line in Europe, it would be argued, comes from nature and therefore should never be patented because a patent granted in this domain would be so broad as to be hugely inhibiting to discovery, because any discovery made on the back of that would have to relate to the original patent holder. So the European position is to say that discoveries made when using such cell lines are indeed patentable when they have novelty and all of the factors that go into making a patent. However, the unique biological material itself should not be patented because it is of human nature. 
There are two issues bound up in that quote. Firstly, there is the ethical position and, in part, even a sociological position that human nature itself should not attract patents. Some of that quote prompted Senator Stott Despoja's earlier remarks in relation to genes and gene sequences. As well as that, they said that there are good commercial reasons why this should not occur either. Mr Ilyine said that if we allow patents on stem cell lines themselves then we will create problems commercially because the patents will end up being so broad as to capture any further work in relation to those stem cells, and that will inhibit commercial work. That is an important point, too, because some of the arguments have been that this will damage commercialisation. Here is Mr Ilyine saying quite clearly that certainly from a European perspective the contrary is the case: you might inhibit research by, in a commercial sense, allowing commercial value to reside where perhaps it should not. I do not think that there is a great deal more that I want to say about this matter at this stage.
I am happy to deal with amendments (R8) and (R9) together. Amendment (R9) is part of that package. It essentially would ensure monitoring powers in relation to, at least, the Australian patent system. I accept that some concerns have been raised that internationally it might be difficult to keep tabs on whether someone who should not be seeking a patent has done so in Hong Kong, the US or the like. But, in a competitive industry, I think that if that does occur the industry itself can probably ensure that that information becomes available to the licensing committee. In the sense and terms of the limitations of our jurisdiction, that is probably the best we can do. At this stage, I seek leave to move amendments (R8) and (R9) together.

—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. Leave was granted to Senator Murphy to have his particular amendment deferred to this section of the debate so as to facilitate this debate. I make it clear to Senator Murphy that this is his chance and I will not be entertaining that option again. I thought the idea was that we would have one debate rather than three or four debates.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-04,"—I will obviously take some time to respond because this is an important issue. Senator Collins has moved an amendment to clause 26 of the bill which would require the NHMRC Licensing Committee to revoke automatically a licence if the licence holder applies for a patent under the Patents Act 1990 `for any unmodified stem cells from human embryos'. I think we could all agree that the patenting of biological lines raises difficult political, ethical and commercial issues. We discussed some of these matters last night, but I want to put them back together on the record. 
Patents law is a complex matter which cannot be addressed in an ad hoc way through this legislation. Any possible amendments should only be contemplated after very careful and detailed consideration to ensure that they do what is intended. This is a matter, as I have indicated before, much better dealt with in the context of a separate review process. The legislation was never intended to regulate stem cells; it only regulates the use of embryos. Any move beyond that would take the legislation far beyond the original intent of COAG. It is not absolutely clear to me what Senator Collins means by using the term `unmodified stem cells'. My understanding is that patents will be granted if inventions meet the statutory patentability requirements such as novelty, inventive merit, industrial application and adequate disclosure of the invention in the patents specification.
The amendments only catch a very limited class of people and therefore lead to inconsistencies and an unequal playing field. For example, what would be the impact on people who are not licence holders under the bill? Making amendments to this bill will not stop people who are not licence holders from seeking a patent. If these amendments were supported, we could have the situation where a licence holder had completed their initial research on embryos, the licence period had expired and the researcher would then be free to apply for a patent. It would also not stop people overseas registering patents in Australia.
A number of years ago, the US issued a patent known as the Thomson patent through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation for the commercial application of certain stem lines. WARF also filed for a patent in Australia but subsequently allowed the application to lapse. The point is that any amendments restricting what licence holders can do and what they cannot seek a patent for would have absolutely no impact at all on this scenario and the capacity of a US organisation to seek a patent in Australia. This reinforces the need to avoid ad hoc changes to this legislation and to address the matter at the source, as I said, through Australian IP legislation. In a similar vein, Senator Collins's amendments do not appear to deal with existing patents but rather only revoke licences from those who apply for new patents. This seems to be rather anomalous. Licence holders who make new patent applications will have their licence revoked and will be unable to continue the research. However, licence holders with existing patents will not be affected.
Further, under the amendments, a company that is a licence holder would still be able to grant IP rights under a patent—for example, an exclusive licence to another company to continue the work started by the original licence holder. There is nothing to prevent the company to whom the IP rights have been transferred from being granted a licence from the licensing committee, provided, of course, that it meets the criteria in the legislation. I would add that IP licensing arrangements such as these are extremely common. I am aware of a number of Australian companies that hold licences from organisations who have patented certain processes overseas and it would appear that they would not be affected by the amendments. All of the issues regarding the patenting of biological material apply equally to embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells and all other cells and tissues.
During the debate on this bill there has been much discussion about the developments that have occurred as a result of the use of adult stem cells. The therapies which were developed as a result of the use of adult stem cells would not have been possible without commercial investment and accompanying IP protections providing the capacity for companies to market the therapies. The same opportunities should be considered in relation to embryonic stem cell research. 
On the basis of the debate in the Senate it is clear that we all want to see the potential of stem cells being turned into therapeutic products which can help people—we might have a disagreement about whether they are embryonic or adult stem cells—but this must be done properly. To do this properly, to undertake extensive studies and trials and properly test the efficacy and safety of the therapies, takes significant investment. The size of the investment required simply cannot be met solely by governments and academic institutions, and therefore it must be supplemented by private investors. The fact is that private investors will not invest unless they stand to make a return on their investment, and they can do that only with proper intellectual property arrangements. 
Senator Collins has attempted to include a sunset clause to repeal the operation of her amendment if the review under clause 47 is completed and parliament enacts legislation regarding commercial interests. It is ambiguous as to what type of amendments would need to be passed to give effect to the sunset clause. The term `commercial interests' is very broad and it would be difficult to know as a matter of legal interpretation whether or not the sunset clause has become operative. It is very unusual to repeal a provision, and I am sure that lawyers would have to exercise their minds about that.
I want to add an important development that has occurred, but it has not just happened as a result of the bill; it has been under way for some time. I announce that today the Prime Minister has agreed to a proposal by the Attorney-General for the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake an inquiry into intellectual property. This is very important for those people who have a concern about the patenting issue. I would like senators who are listening in their rooms to take heed of what I am saying. For those of you who have half an ear on the debate, I would like you to really concentrate at this point because some people have a concern about the patenting issue.
I reiterate that today the Prime Minister has agreed to a proposal by the Attorney-General for the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake an inquiry into intellectual property issues raised by genetic information. The proposal arose out of a joint Australian Law Reform Commission and Australian Health Ethics Committee reference on the protection of human genetic information. The inquiry will focus on human health issues, including the impact of current patenting laws and practices relating to genes and genetic and related technologies, the conduct of research, and the Australian biotechnology sector. The inquiry will also focus on any problems with current laws and practices, with the aim of encouraging the use of intellectual property to further the health benefits of genetic research. Biotechnology Australia advised that stem cells would be in the scope of the review.
As I argue now and have argued earlier, it is vital that this be dealt with not in an ad hoc way but in an overall way, taking into account the fact that this bill is about embryos and not stem cells, and the fact that it does not cover adult stem cells. Therefore, I will be opposing the amendment, because I consider that it would pre-empt the outcome of the review. The government has already made a commitment to review the patenting arrangements of genetic material in Australia. To act on this bill in an ad hoc, knee-jerk way is simply not appropriate. I will be opposing Senator Collins's amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-12-04,"—Perhaps I should take this moment, if the minister has managed to attract the attention of people watching this debate, to respond to a few of those issues, because I think that they deserve a response now. The minister says that she is not clear on what is meant by `unmodified', yet that was the evidence that we received in the committee as to how the European model works. So I am a bit confused about why she is not aware of what seems to be a clear history of dealing with `unmodified' versus `value adding' or developments in relation to the stem cell lines themselves.
Moving on to other issues, the other day we covered the issue of the distinction between adult stem cells versus embryonic stem cells. The difference—and why many of us believe that we need to be very careful about what commercial interests we involve in relation to embryonic stem cells—is the simple fact that to create them involves the destruction of human embryos. If you have the ethical position that you want to restrict how many of these embryos are destroyed to create stem cells, you seek to limit the commercial interests to create more. That is the issue. If you have, as COAG told us, a strict regulatory regime, you do not leave dealing with this issue for `ron' when you might hear the result of an ALRC review. You do not wait that long; you have something in place that will prevent the horse from bolting now. 
Senator Patterson, I have not claimed that what you refer to as my `ad hoc process' is perfect. I have sought to draw on the experience that has occurred elsewhere in the world, and the principal areas that we can rely on are Europe and the UK. The proposal that we look at a stem cell bank has arisen from the UK experience. Senator Stott Despoja and others have raised many valid issues about why we should not necessarily go straight down that path now in the form that they have and that it would benefit us significantly to see how it has operated in the UK. With respect to the European experience, we have a reasonably straightforward way of at least introducing some constraint in this area.
While Senator Patterson says that it is ad hoc and that it should not be in this legislation, and a variety of other excuses, we already know that if the Prime Minister is serious about an issue he can give us a commitment that he will deal with it in another area. If that is really the only stumbling block then the Prime Minister will say, `We'll deal with it through customs regulations, for instance, in that case.' So the message that the Senate clearly gets from your contribution is that we are happy to leave the horse unbolted; we are happy to let the horse out.
You may say to us that establishing this review is significant and should impact on other senator's minds but, with respect, Senator, when will the result of that review happen? I do not think that you gave the Senate the benefit of the advice of how quickly that review will occur and when we might have the recommendations of it. But if it is not within the six-month period, then the horse will bolt. It is as simple and as straightforward as that.
One of your claims was that a licence holder could simply pass the stem cells on to somebody else who could seek a patent. That is why we have the word `associate' in the amendment. We are saying `a licence holder or an associate'. A licence holder is not going to pass these stem cell lines on to somebody else if they risk losing their licence. You did raise one valid issue in relation to what could happen once the research has been concluded and a licence is no longer necessary, but the point of the matter is that there is—as you referred to it, and I am glad that you reminded me—the sunset clause here. The sunset clause will mean that this restriction will not apply once an appropriate regime is established and in place.
Maybe I am being far too optimistic here. But I would hope, given the nature of research in this field, given how long it is going to take for the licensing arrangements to get up and into operation, given a myriad of other factors, that the government would get its act together on the alternative regime before research projects are being licensed, concluded and then traded. Seriously, Minister, if we are waiting that long then maybe we should have something far more significant here. Perhaps you are suggesting to all senators listening that they should really be favouring Senator Murphy's amendments rather than mine because you are just not serious.
If the government is serious about this review, it will accept that it is important to prevent the horse bolting now and at least establish an appropriate minimum line, which is that the stem cells themselves should not be patented. We have good evidence from Europe that says that there are commercial impacts of allowing that to occur anyway. If you pick up the argument that perhaps it is not going to be meaningless anyway because the patenting regulation would just deal with value itself on top of these stem cells, then your argument about the supposed large commercial impact of doing this is a bit circular. In fact, it is quite circular. On the one hand you cannot argue that there are going to be dire commercial implications of putting this restriction on commercialisation and on the other hand say that the commercial limits involved here are really so significant as to be meaningless. You cannot run both arguments. It is not logically coherent.
I am interested in how other senators respond to this issue but I can only reinforce the point that this is an interim step. Of course it is ad hoc, but the Prime Minister's sunset clause in this bill is ad hoc. There are many other ad hoc provisions in this bill. This amendment seeks to ensure that we are serious about this being a strict regulatory regime. For those senators who accept the ethical position that there is a middle way here but we are still concerned to ensure that human embryos will not be used willy-nilly, this is a way of trying to ensure that commercial interests will not prevail in utilising more embryos than might be necessary.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-04,"—I will begin my response to Senator Collins's amendment by reading part of an answer given to a question I asked yesterday, which was incorporated by Senator Minchin today. The answer stated:
In Australia, biotechnology inventions are patentable, provided the invention meets the requirements of the Patents Act. The raw data obtained from the mapping of the human genome, that is the total human DNA, is not patentable. However, patents may be granted for inventions involving human DNA and gene fragments or human cell lines that are new, inventive and useful. Not all inventions in the field of biotechnology are patentable. Subsection 18(2) of the Patents Act expressly excludes the patenting of human beings and the biological processes for their generation.
The Government recognises that patenting in the human biotechnology area is both a sensitive and important issue, raising fundamental concerns that include moral and ethical issues, the impact on freedom of research in Australia and ensuring Australians have access to the latest health technology and health care. Without patent protection, neither foreign nor Australian enterprises will be encouraged to manufacture medical innovations and make them available in Australia.
In light of recent concerns regarding patenting in the human biotechnology area the Government is giving active consideration to a review of this issue. The Government is currently considering the Terms of Reference for a review to be conducted by the Australian Law Reform Commission on gene patenting.
The Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, did raise that by saying that the terms of reference have now been issued to the Australian Law Reform Commission, and I am pleased about that.
With respect to my own amendment, I had given some thought to going down the same line that Senator Collins has proposed in her amendment, but I had some concerns that amending this legislation in that way would create some difficulties. That is one of the reasons why I suggested that the effective date of operation of this legislation be delayed until the Patents Act is amended. The Patents Act is the legislation that must ultimately be amended to give the type of protection that we need for potential investors in this areas and in order to ensure that any therapeutic, medical or remedial findings that come about as a result of stem cell research, particularly embryonic stem cell research, are going to remain affordable to Australians who are in need of them from a health point of view.
The government's vision for biotechnology—and this in the explanatory memorandum which I circulated with my amendment—states:
... consistent with safeguarding human health and ensuring environmental protection, Australia captures the benefits of biotechnology for the Australian community, industry and the environment.
That is an admirable goal, but what I cannot understand is that, given that the biotechnology age has been around for a little while, we have not proceeded to deal with one of the fundamental issues.
—Are you really surprised?
—I should not respond, because this is a very serious issue, but I am not really surprised. I take that interjection from Senator Stott Despoja. I know why she made it, and I think it was justified. But we are now proceeding with a piece of legislation that is going to allow more research that will offer up opportunities for patents to be claimed. Let us look at what has happened thus far in respect of patents in this area. Most of them have been claimed by overseas companies. How is that really going to assist Australian industry?
Why should it be the case that, at some point down the track, as a result of patents claimed now, patents which have been claimed previously or patents which are likely to be claimed in the future by overseas companies, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, Australians get to pay through the neck for the medical remedies and therapeutic services that might be provided to them through medical findings? Why should it be the case? I know we have all heard the minister in respect of the cost of the PBS. By way of an example in terms of the types of cost, a UK hospital received demands for $US6,000 to use a gene for cystic fibrosis which was employed to screen patients for that disorder. Is that the sort of process that we want to allow ourselves to be caught in? I would think not. I think that at the least we ought to be setting down some rules in respect of patentability. We ought to put them in place before we allow more research to be considered. 
I have heard Senator Patterson say, `This is all about stopping the bill.' This is not about stopping the bill. That simply is not the case. The Patents Act could be amended very quickly, and it could be amended by next February next year. There will not be any significant advances, given that nothing has really happened in respect of embryonic stem cell research anyway, but we should proceed to put in place the rules of the game first. Would such an amendment—be it mine or even Senator Collins's—have any impact on investment? Yes, it would. It would actually assist it.
The same sorts of rules apply in the UK, in France and in Germany as I have proposed in my amendment. They are exactly the same. The only difference is this: they apply across the board. They do not choose between embryonic stem cells, for instance, and adult stem cells. I am happy for that to be the case, because I think ultimately the Patents Act should probably be amended to take account of that. It should have that broad coverage. But there is a difference— and I think Senator Collins has referred to this difference—when you look at it from an ethical point of view. The ethical issue is that you actually have to destroy the embryo to extract the stem cells. That is why I restricted my proposal to embryonic stem cells. I think it is fundamentally important, given what has happened with the National Stem Cell Centre and given the evidence that has been drawn out in the course of the committee hearings in respect of who is in which position with which company, located where, et cetera.
It is of fundamental importance that we make sure with this type of research that we have got the laws in place to ensure, as I said and as the government said, that, consistent with safeguarding human health and ensuring environmental protection, Australia captures the benefits of biotechnology for the Australian community. That is what this has to be consistent with, and that is what we should be doing. If we do not do that, we will be back here saying, `Woe is us; the PBS is confronted with another massive blow-out,' because all the things that we have discovered—and in part publicly funded, I might add—have been patented somewhere else in the world. If you look at the patenting that is happening around the world, there is a trend towards more patenting of upstream research. That is the basic research area. In terms of the issues that I was looking at in the US, for instance, it has been estimated that over 90 per cent of current US patents—and I think I put this in the explanatory memorandum—are never exploited. That tends to suggest one thing—that is, that they are to block other people from using them.
In the US they have what is known as the Bayh-Dole Act, which deals with licences on a case by case basis and which sets down very substantial restrictions and intellectual property sharing requirements. I do not think that we want to do that but, if you look at what has happened in the US with regard to the restrictions that they have alone and the type of investment that has occurred since those things have been in place, you can see it has not hindered it; in fact, it has enhanced it. I am suggesting a very simple, straightforward approach. It is consistent with the WTO requirements on the TRIPS agreement. It is consistent in part with what happens with the US, only it is a different approach. It is consistent with those laws in the UK, France and Germany. The UK act states:
An invention of a method of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body shall not be taken to be capable of industrial application. 
The Patents Office manual sets out the definitions of surgery, therapy, diagnosis et cetera. In France, the Intellectual Property Code says:
Methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body shall not be regarded as inventions susceptible of industrial application within the meaning of Article L. 611-10. This provision shall not apply to products, in particular substances or compositions, for use in any of these methods.
I am talking about something that is already in place in other countries in the world. It is as straightforward as that. I do not want to take up any more of the committee's time, because I know we have our backs to the wall in terms of time. But I want to say that this is imperative; we do not have time for an Australian Law Reform Commission review that could take 12 months or longer. Then it could take another six months to begin developing legislation or amendments to the Patents Act. These things can be done very quickly. If they had any effect on the timing and operation of this act it would be very minimal. As I said, I am sure, given the legislation that exists around the world, that a legislative draftsperson could come up with a proposition that would be more than adequate to deal with these issues so that this parliament could pass the legislation in the first two weeks of next year. That would have no effect on the research that is proposed to be allowed under this particular bill.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-12-04,"—I want to address some remarks to both Senator Collins's and Senator Murphy's amendments. In doing so, I will place on the record Labor's formal view about these issues of commercialisation and patents. I will try to be brief because I know other senators want to speak in the time available. The first point I want to make is that the bill does not deal with the issue of patents and intellectual property, as it is intended that existing intellectual property and patent laws will apply to research involving embryos just as they apply to all other forms of research. A number of senators have moved amendments that are directed towards ensuring that research involving embryos which has been approved by the licensing committee cannot be patented or, alternatively, that if a patent is applied for then the licence will automatically be revoked. I think that raises fundamental issues about the purposes of patent law.
It might be worth while to set out the basis for Australia's laws and why we have patent laws at all. Patent law has the main aim of increasing the general pool of knowledge by encouraging researchers to disclose the outcomes of their research. In return for disclosing their research and to make it worth while for researchers to do so, the Patents Act grants the researcher certain rights during the period of the patent—currently 20 years for a standard patent. In this way, patent laws encourage research to proceed. Substantial effort and substantial investment are put into research with the aim of saving and sustaining lives. Without the protection of the Patents Act, which is offered for the benefits of the research, much of that research would not take place.
The purpose of the bill is to regulate the circumstances in which research involving embryos may proceed. At its core is a fundamental commitment to that research going ahead. I know a number of senators in this chamber do not want that research to go ahead. That is their view, but for those of us who are arguing for the research to go ahead the patent laws will provide some comfort and a part of that approach. Amendments which seek to cut off from stem cell research the rights which the Patents Act affords to all other research would fundamentally detract from that core purpose of the bill, which is to support continued stem cell research subject to the strong safeguards and protections contained in the bill.
At COAG the Prime Minister and each of the premiers agreed that properly regulated research involving embryos should proceed. I think these amendments are inconsistent with that clear intention. I also think that there is a problem in that we all know patent law is a complex area. Senator Murphy has further convinced me of that through his contribution. It is complex and it is difficult, and ad hoc changes to complex areas of law can create more problems than they solve. If stem cell research did throw up new issues which challenged the adequacy of existing patent law, Labor would prefer to see a considered approach which is well grounded and which seeks to preserve the balance between researchers and the community. 
In the majority report of the Senate committee that inquired into this bill it was suggested that the ALRC and the Australian Health Ethics Committee could be well placed to inquire into and deal with the issues raised. That report noted that the ALRC and the AHEC were already undertaking a comprehensive review of the issues relating to the protection of genetic information, and it recommended that it would be appropriate to give them another reference to consider the issues of patenting, intellectual property and stem cell science and that this reference should feed directly into the review of legislation. That seemed to me to be a most sensible suggestion from the committee and one that would allow us to deal with the issues in the appropriate place. I am very pleased to see that the minister has tabled a letter from the Prime Minister which does authorise that referral to the Australian Law Reform Commission.
—I have not tabled the letter.
—I have a copy of the letter. I presume the minister will seek to table it. I think that would be useful. It is a letter from the Prime Minister to the Attorney-General agreeing to the reference of these issues to the ALRC, and I think that is helpful. Labor welcomes that commitment and believes that it is the most appropriate means by which the complex issues relating to intellectual property and patent law should be properly further considered.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—Senator Evans has really said, `Go ahead; put the cart before the horse,' and Senator Collins has said, `Let's let the horse bolt.' Just for your information, this chamber did express its view as far back as 12 years ago when I moved to amend the patents legislation. As a result of that the patents legislation says that `human beings and the biological process for their generation' are not patentable inventions. I really was not aware of the existence of stem cells at that time and I am not sure that too many people were. Clearly, however we look at it, that was the intention of the legislation. If you look at the debate at that time, the intention was clearly to exclude that area of human life.
I am mindful of the time, although I would happily go on for quite a while dealing with this question of patents, because it is an area that I have been interested in for some considerable time. I was successful on at least that particular occasion, for what it is worth, in getting the Patents Act amended. I support the proposals that have been put forward by Senator Collins and Senator Murphy. I think that they are not mutually exclusive—in other words, both can be supported, and I support both of them.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-04,"—First of all, it is possible to agree with comments that have been made by both those in favour of and those against the amendment. I say that because I begin by acknowledging the complexity of the Patents Act. I think it was really interesting that, in response to Senator Murphy's question, Senator Minchin provided reference to the section of the Patents Act—the section that Senator Harradine was involved in—that refers to human beings and the biological processes for their generation as not being patentable inventions. I wonder, therefore, whether there is a legal interpretation that suggests that what Senator Collins is attempting to do might actually already be covered. I suspect that it would be a very grey area. As senators would know—and certainly Senator Harradine would know— that section of the act does not exclude the patenting of genes and gene sequences. 
I do not think the Patents Act is sufficient; I think it needs to be changed. I welcome the Prime Minister's announcement that there will be an inquiry—essentially a recommendation in my second reading amendment. I also echo, though, the concerns raised by Senator Collins in relation to the time frame. I think we need more specifics on this one. Certainly, people who have been debating the Patents Act since 1990—including some of us who have been debating it since 1995—want better assurances. It is a good win; it is a good announcement by the government—I do not mean to detract from that. But I also know that the ALRC and AHEC have full plates. I know that they are in the midst of the genetic privacy inquiry, which has taken a long period of time—mind you, it has been comprehensive and far-reaching, and I hope it will result in not only valuable recommendations but also legislation. That inquiry is perhaps the best example of how long these processes can take—yes, because they are complex but also, on the other hand, because they require political will.  
Absent from a debate about Patents Act reform has been political will. No matter how many times people stand up in this place and acknowledge that we all have sympathy, we all have concerns, we all have ethical debates—and it has been from people who have voted time and time again against changes to the Patents Act; I do not mean to detract from the complexity of the debate, I do respect the deeply held views of everyone in this chamber and I am not impugning anyone—the voting record shows that previous attempts to change the Patents Act to stop the patenting of things that occur naturally, such as biological materials and parts of a human—and I talk specifically about genes, gene materials, genetically engineered organisms, genetic engineering, genomes, altered organisms, progeny of genetically engineered organisms et cetera—have been stymied. 
This debate says three important things to me today: yes, we are ready for a debate about patents; yes, we are ready for a long overdue inquiry into the Patents Act; and, yes, there is finally the political will to change it. In the same way that Senator Collins is calling me on this one—I acknowledge that; Senator Collins knows my views and knows that I support her amendment—and now that I have heard other people's views, I am going to call her and them right back. In 1986, 1984, 1990—September 1990 was one of the attempts to change the Patents Act—
—Do you want me to argue for another conscience vote?
—Indeed. I do not want a conscience vote; I want the political parties to adopt these changes. I say that through the temporary chairman to Senator Boswell. Senator, in 1990 you voted against changes to get rid of the patenting of genes and gene sequences, but I can tell that that was not your view. I know that from personal discussions with you, and I want you to convince your caucus to that effect. I want the National Party and the coalition out there ready to make these changes. Maybe political parties will be, after this inquiry.
I acknowledge the difficulties, but I also wish to acknowledge a point that I think Senator Evans made well to the people in the chamber—that is, when we talk about the horse bolting, we have to acknowledge that research is taking place now. Just because we have just got around to dealing with some of the jurisdictional or regulatory issues in Australia in relation to, firstly, prohibiting human cloning and, secondly, dealing with research involving human embryos does not mean that this is not already going on. I understand that it has implications for our scientists and our researchers. I understand that it has implications in terms of intellectual property and whether or not there is the same incentive for people to get involved in the research. But it works in other ways, too; it works from the opposite perspective. I asked back in 1996:
Will the patenting of genes and gene sequences—
you can insert Senator Collins's references to unmodified stem cells in here as well—
inhibit the free flow of information on which science and the advance of science ultimately depends? 
If you have free access and availability, there is an argument that you encourage research. I do not want scientists and researchers to not be compensated for the work that they do, and that is where the debate comes in about whether you own the particular biological substance, the organism, the cell, the gene or whatever, as opposed to the processes involved in coming up with the products, inventions or what have you. There is a distinction which I think has been recognised in the past that says, `Yes, intellectual property rights are important, and so is compensation.' So in that respect I do acknowledge the argument that scientists could go offshore. I do not want that to happen, hence my support for this legislation. 
I am probably in a difficult position. Senator Evans made reference to those people who do not support this legislation but who may be supporting this amendment— not as to their motive, I acknowledge. There may be people who do not support the legislation but who support the amendment, but I am one of the people who are passionate about having some legislation in place and so having a regulatory environment. At the same time I am in favour of embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research going ahead. That is on record. That, hopefully, is well known by now. But at the same time I cannot resile from the fact that there is one thing I believe strongly—that is, you do not patent those biological processes, those aspects of humanity. There are reasons for that. They may be inspired among us by religious or spiritual beliefs. They may be personal reasons. It may be simply the abhorrence that human life should be owned in any way. It may be because commercial exploitation of humans is something that we strongly oppose. It may be because of those research implications and the fact that the free flow of information is potentially inhibited by commercial interests or people owning these substances.
It is not so much with mixed feelings that I support Senator Collins's amendment, because I support the intent of it, but I make it very clear too that this has been a long time coming and I will be moving very soon to see that we have a general business debate on the Patents Amendment Bill 1996, moved by me in this place on behalf of the Democrats. If we are going to do this properly, then let us talk about real patents reform that better reflects the ethics and the spirit not only of this debate but of our nation. Then we will be in line with the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in Madrid in 1995—I think it involved 114 national parliaments—which called for the prohibition of the patenting of human genes. The resolution underlined the `urgent need to ban the patenting of human genes' and `prohibit all financial gain from the human body or parts thereof, subject to exceptions provided for by law'. Obviously there are going to be arguments for exception, and I am sure that debate will happen through the ALRC-AHEC inquiry.
I acknowledge the Prime Minister's letter—I have seen a copy of that, and when it is tabled I am sure there will be more debate—and I appreciate the Prime Minister and the government taking on board those concerns in the ideas for the terms of reference outlined in the second reading amendment. I recognise all the other qualifications and arguments from all sides in this debate, because I do think Senator Evans and Senator Patterson made a good point about ad hoc reform. But, when there is an issue such as this and there is a core philosophical debate, I will support that debate.
I hope that the legislation is successful and I hope that, with the opportunities over the next two years as we review this legislation, and certainly in the short term, when we will have the broader AHEC-ALRC inquiry, we will come up with better ways of addressing patent reform issues. But for now I am called on this amendment: it is an issue— as I have said repeatedly ad nauseam, I have no doubt—that I have been more passionate about than just about anything in this place, so I welcome the opportunity to perhaps get that into law for the first time.
But this is only the beginning, and again I put on notice those other senators who have expressed their concern about patents. When the gene sequences bill or the next patents amendment bill comes up and I move amendments on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I will be looking for support, particularly from Senator Boswell on behalf of the Nationals. Senator Harradine's support has been there on this issue for a long time, so I know where he will be voting. Senator Murphy, your view is quite evident from your amendment. I think your amendment is quite broad ranging. I think its implications for not only the processes involved in research but also obviously the results of that research are quite far ranging. I am not sympathetic to having such a change to patents law unless we talk about it in the context of other changes to the Patents Act. It is not the same philosophical, easy, `vote for me' response, inasmuch as any of these debates is easy. Having said that, I hope in no way to hold up this legislation but I do see this as an opportunity to make a significant philosophical change to Australian law.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-04,"—In rising to support both Senator Collins's and Senator Murphy's amendments, I will firstly speak very briefly on Senator Murphy's amendment. I believe that it does have merit and that it also has practical application. Just recently I spent some time on the north coast—that is, the Sunshine Coast in Queensland—and members of the CSIRO were able to relate to me that one of the reasons that they could actually carry out the research and developments in technology that they were doing was that they could access intellectual property that was in the public domain. If they had had to take into account the paying of royalties in relation to either the technology or the samples that they required, that would have impacted on their ability to carry out that research. I support Senator Murphy's statement that he believes that, by not allowing the patenting of developments or actual samples deriving from embryos, we will encourage the actual research.
Senator Collins's amendments will provide for a licence to be automatically revoked if a person applies for a patent as a result of holding an NHMRC licence. The minister pointed out that there are problems in respect of an amendment that is not strictly designed to achieve that end. However, there is a considerable history in this place, even during the 3½ years I have been here, of legislation being brought in, which has had an impact on aspects other than those relating to the relevant bill. If it was the government's intention to eventually amend the Patents Act, all they would have to do is bring in a consequential amendment to delete the relevant section from the legislation. During the interim, the amendment will have carried out its purpose with clarity. It would neither hold up this legislation, nor detract from the assessment of the Patents Act.
In conclusion, I express One Nation's support for the amendments. The intellectual property right that is derived from any embryo research—and I believe that that should be only in relation to IVF—should stay in the public domain. There should be no commercial gain derived from a human being in that respect. Senator Murphy's amendment can coincide with that of Senator Collins and it would merely require the government to bring in a consequential amendment when they alter the Patents Act.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-04,"—I support this very important amendment. It sets out the terms and conditions relevant to a patent under the patents legislation for any unmodified stem cells from human embryos. It is good sense. The arguments have been put, and I urge the many senators who are sitting in their rooms to think through those arguments and to support these amendments.
Question put:
That the amendments (Senator Jacinta Collins's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-04,"—by leave—I move:
(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (table items 1 to 4), omit the table items, substitute: 

1.  Sections 1 to 48 and anything in this Act not elsewhere covered by this table
A single day to be fixed by Proclamation subject to subsection (1A)
 (2)	Clause 2, page 2 (after line 8), after subclause (1), insert:
	(1A)	A Proclamation under item 1 of the table must not specify a day that occurs before the day of commencement of amendments to the Patents Act 1990, which provide that no diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical methods arising from human embryo and human embryonic stem cell research can be considered patentable inventions for the purposes of that Act.
I want to be brief because I spoke in support of the amendments I have proposed during the debate on Senator Collins's proposed amendments. I want to pick up on some of the points that were made during the debate. Firstly, Senator Evans says that the Patents Act provides protection—yes, it does. It provides protection for patent claimants but it does not provide protection for the Australian community, from a health point of view, in findings that might go to therapeutic, surgical and other remedies. It does not provide protection to ensure delivery to the Australian community of those things in an affordable way. That is what it does not do.
I am not suggesting ad hoc changes. As I said, there is ample legislation around the world in countries like the UK, France, Germany and Canada—and even take account of what exists in the US—for a smart draftsperson to give consideration to this in a very considered way, not in an ad hoc way, and to develop legislation and to determine the shortcomings if there are shortcomings in the application of legislation overseas. That is not going to take a long time. If you read the Senate report you will see that medical treatment applications from embryonic stem cell research are yet to be made. We are not holding anything up here. What Senator Collins suggested in her amendments was very valid. Why should we proceed to put legislation in action that allows for research and subsequently allows for patents to be claimed? As I said, there is a tendency now for patents to be claimed more and more on the basic, upstream research and that is the fundamental problem. I do not want to see an ad hoc approach.
I welcome what the minister has said in respect of the Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry. That is great. But why now? It seems that this is a response to the circumstances that have arisen out of the debate on this bill. Yes, the Australian Law Reform Commission and AHEC may have made some recommendations that this needs to be further considered. But even the NHMRC guidelines, which have been around for a while, say that more consideration needs to be given to this. Why is it that we suddenly decide we should do something about patents right now?
—That didn't happen.
—Minister, I read out the answer that was tabled by Senator Minchin today, and he says:
In light of recent concerns regarding patenting in the human biotechnology area the Government is giving active consideration to a review of this issue.
Well, that is great. But, you see, actively considering a review is not going to solve the problem following the proclamation of this piece of legislation and the research that will occur shortly thereafter. Nor will it solve the problem of the potential for patent claims to be made. If the government were really serious about `safeguarding human health' and ensuring that `Australia captures the benefits of biotechnology for the Australian community', as was stated in the government's vision for biotechnology, then it would not allow this research to take place until it had put in place the types of patent laws that are necessary. I say to Senator Evans that there need to be patent laws that will enhance the investment in this area, not stop it or discourage it. I note that Senator Stott Despoja, although she is not here at the moment, said that this has been a long time coming. Yes, it has, and we should not allow legislation to pass through this parliament and to become active without doing this first. This is not a question of adhocery. This is a very serious matter. This is about protecting the national interest from a human health point of view. That is what we should be doing.
As I said at the outset of this debate, I do not have a philosophical or ideological position with regard to research involving embryos; I really do not. But I think the objective of this parliament should be to ensure that the legislation that we pass passes in a sound way and has the capacity to operate in the public interest. That is what is important and that is why the amendments that I have proposed should proceed. They do not stop the effect of this bill overall, but they will ensure that the right foundation in terms of patents laws is in place to make sure that we really do get the Australian public interest at the forefront and not on the back foot.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-04,"—I will be very brief. In speaking in support of the amendments, I would just like to very quickly run through a list of the countries world wide that not only have prohibited patenting but have even prohibited research. In Austria, stem cell research on human embryos is prohibited. In Belgium, stem cell research on embryos is prohibited. In France, research on embryos is prohibited. In Germany, stem cell research, the use of spare embryos and the production of spare embryos are prohibited. In Hungary, the life of the unborn child must be protected from the time of conception. In Ireland, the right to life of the unborn child is equal to that of the mother; stem cell research on human embryos is banned; and the production of spare embryos is prohibited. In Italy, in 2002, the lower chamber of parliament passed a bill that proposed to ban human cloning, experiments on human embryos and the freezing of embryos. Norway prohibits research on embryos and bans their use for any purpose other than reimplantation into the donor. In Poland, under law introduced on 7 January 1993 and amended in 1996, the life of the unborn child must be protected from its conception. In Switzerland, the constitution prohibits the use of medically assisted reproduction for research purposes and the fertilisation of more ova than are capable of being immediately implanted.
If there is this perceived problem that Australia is out of step with the rest of the world and that the rest of the world will run off and put all the patents in place, I say that there is a list of countries whose position is the same as Australia's. I believe that the inability to patent technology or products from embryos would assist the research world wide. I place on record One Nation's support for Senator Murphy's amendments.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—I move amendment (13) on sheet 2696:
(13)	Page 19 (after line 3), after clause 27, insert:
27A  Custody of excess ART embryos following suspension, revocation or surrender of licence
		Where a licence authorising use of excess ART embryos is suspended, revoked or surrendered, all excess ART embryos in the custody of the licence holder must be returned to the ART practitioner from whom they were obtained within 7 days of the suspension, revocation or surrendering of the licence.
That is self-explanatory. What happens to the embryos if the licence holder just gives up the licence, for example? Where do they end up? Can we have a quick response from the minister? This is a very important area. Where do they end up? If you follow COAG, you are talking about knowing where the embryos end up. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-04,"—I will be opposing Senator Harradine's amendment. It is seeking to make it a requirement that excess ART embryos in the custody of a licence holder be returned to the ART practitioner from whom they were obtained should the licence be suspended or revoked. It ignores the fundamental principle of the consent of the couple, which is integral to the current bill, as well as to ART clinical practice. The amendment requires that the embryos be returned to the clinic irrespective of the wishes of the couple who have already made the decision to donate the embryos to research. Under the bill, a couple can independently decide that they no longer require their ART embryos for the purposes of achieving pregnancy and then decide to donate their embryos for research. They would then decide whether to give consent to use their embryos in a particular licensed research project. As part of that process of obtaining consent, the couple will be given a number of alternatives to consider. One option will be to donate their excess embryos to research. Another will be to let their excess embryos succumb.
I want to be very clear on one point. As part of ART practice, couples must make difficult decisions about what is to be done with their embryos once they have finished their program. It is something that should not be taken lightly. Thousands of embryos succumb every year as part of the normal ART practice. I understand that the figure in South Australia alone is some 4,000 a year. The decision to allow an embryo to succumb is made by people often at the end of their ART treatment. Once a couple have made the decision to donate their embryos to research, I think that it is problematic to try and return these embryos to the couple—which is the only reason I can see for Senator Harradine requiring the ART clinic to take them back. Couples will make what they think is a final decision, only to be told later that the decision was not given effect to and that they have to make more decisions about their embryos. I am also concerned that Senator Harradine's amendment appears to impose a continuing legal obligation on the clinics, even though those clinics may not be licence holders in relation to those embryos and have no existing relationship with those embryos. It is not apparent what these clinics would be expected to do. I also note that, in many cases, it will be the ART clinic which will be doing the research under a licence and it is not clear how Senator Harradine's amendment would work in that situation. For those reasons, I will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-12-04,"—I seek leave to withdraw amendments (3) to (5) on sheet 2696 revised. For the benefit of the Senate, the reason is that those amendments formed, I suppose, the origin of discussions that have occurred about how we should deal with the guidelines. I will not go into the detail of why there have been quite a number of different types of problems related to the guidelines here, but they have been the subject of considerable discussion, in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee stage, the committee stage of this debate and in the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I understand that there is a generally resolved position that Senator Barnett is able to move, although, as I understand it, there is still some level of contention. However, there is a recent report of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee that senators might want to take into account as well.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-04,"—by leave—I move amendments (R2) and (R4) on sheet 2757:
(R2)	Clause 8, page 7 (lines 4 to 7), omit paragraph (b), substitute:
	(b)	if other guidelines are issued by the NHMRC under the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 and prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph—consent obtained in accordance with those other guidelines, rather than the guidelines mentioned in paragraph (a). 
(R4)	Clause 21, page 16 (line 13), after “NHRMC”, insert “under the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 and prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph”.
I will be very brief on this. As Senator Collins has indicated, I have an understanding that these amendments will not be opposed by the minister. These relate to the establishment of guidelines and the guidelines sitting under the bill. We are making sure that they are disallowable instruments so that they must be prescribed by regulations. This relates to clauses 8 and 21. Clause 8 includes the definition of proper consent, and clause 21 relates to the determination of application by the committee and the NHMRC issuing any relevant guidelines or relevant parts of guidelines. We are making sure that they are disallowable instruments. We are the body that is responsible for that. I am not going to debate that further. I want to focus on amendment (R3). I support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-04,"—I will quickly say that I have listened to the concerns raised by senators on these issues, and I am particularly aware that the AHEC Ethical guidelines on assisted reproductive technology are under revision and that the consultation draft will not be released until after the legislation is passed through parliament. I will not be opposing Senator Barnett's amendment (R2) to paragraph (b) of clause 8, on the definition of proper consent, which would make the revised ART guidelines be prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this legislation. I will not be opposing Senator Barnett's amendment (R4) for the same reasons. These amendments will allow parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the regulations, and I hope that this will allay the concerns expressed by some senators during the debate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-04,"—I move amendment (R3) on sheet 2757:
(R3)	Clause 11, Page 10 (lines 16 to 25), omit subclause (2), substitute:
	(2)	In this section:
		ART program means an assisted reproductive technology program carried out in accordance with regulations as prescribed from time to time.
Amendment (R3) is extremely important. As far as I am concerned, it is consistent with amendments (R2) and (R4). It relates to clause 11 of the bill and is the subject of very close consideration by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, of which I am a member. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee issued its 15th report of 2002 this afternoon. I draw it to the attention of senators and, specifically with respect to clause 11, I draw the attention of senators to the following:
In relation to the Minister's advice about the provision itself, the Committee confirms its earlier comments that the subclause provides for the continuing exercise of legislative power without parliamentary scrutiny. The incorporation of material into Commonwealth legislation, whether such material is government or non-government, is not exceptional. However, it is cause for comment when it is incorporated as in force from time to time with no parliamentary oversight.
It goes on:
In this case proper parliamentary scrutiny of the incorporated material could be effected by the current formula in paragraph (b) of the subclause, which is that a code or document must be prescribed by regulations. Regulations are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and possible disallowance and this would in the usual course ensure suitable oversight. However, provision for the incorporation of material as in force from time to time dilutes this safeguard.
The Committee notes that paragraph (a) of the subclause does not even include this protection, but instead provides for the RTAC—
that is, the Reproductive Technology Advisory Council—
to issue codes of practice directly from time to time.
The result is that under paragraphs (a) and (b) of subclause 11(2) the constituents of an offence provision punishable by up to five years' imprisonment may be determined by non-government bodies without parliamentary oversight or even knowledge. 
The Committee continues to draw the Senators' attention to the provision...
I think that sums it up. I really urge senators to think this one through as carefully as they possibly can. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has provided a good report. It is on the public record. We are saying that, if the bill goes through as it is and the amendment is not successful, then you are establishing a regime that sets up a non-government body to establish a code which can change from time to time without any parliamentary oversight and which can set up an offence of up to five years imprisonment. That, with respect, is bad law. It is bad for the Senate and for parliament in any legislature to set up a regime where you can have a non-government body providing such advice and consequences. 
I urge all senators to support this amendment which will have the effect of basically omitting subclause (2) and saying that the ART program means an assisted reproductive technology program carried out in accordance with regulations as prescribed from time to time. It is quite simple. It is set out in the regulations, which are a disallowable instrument in the Senate. They can be prescribed from time to time. It is simply a matter of drawing out of the code what is there now and writing the regulations, and you can set them up in a matter of days or weeks or months, however quickly you would like to do it and it is done—bingo, finished. And we have parliamentary scrutiny pursuant to clause 11. So I urge the senators to support this and I certainly urge the minister to do so as well, and I will leave it there for now.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-04,"—As honourable senators know, I have had longstanding membership of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and have a great regard for what they do. If the regulations were not made, the amendment would ban all uses of non-excess ART embryos. Non-excess ART embryos are those that are used for ART clinical practice. So by saying that these cannot be used, we are banning ART clinical practice. I am confident this was not Senator Barnett's intent, but on the basis of advice from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, this would be the effect. So I will not be able to support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-04,"—I have been advised based on the advice that you have been given by your advisers and that is on the basis that you do not have any regulations. That advice is based on no regulations being in place. This bill does not come into effect until 29 days after the royal assent. You have time to get your regulations in place, with the utmost respect. I urge all senators to consider carefully this particular amendment. If those regulations are in place, the advice that the minister has just provided is totally irrelevant and incorrect. She is correct, based on the advice given, if the regulations are not in place. The amendment puts it very clearly. It sets it out. Whatever is in the code now, you can just pull out and put into the regulations, and that is parliamentary scrutiny at its best. Let's go for it.

I know it is going to fit outside the arrangements but we have done it once before for Senator Murphy and I would like time to think through and read the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report, which I have not had time to do. That is not saying that I will concede anything, but I would like time to read it. I have a great regard for those two committees, one of which is the most powerful committee in the place—though those in the other house do not realise that. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has a long record and I would like to look at that report.

It seems to me that if that is the appropriate place then that is when it should be deferred to. 
 (Senator Knowles)—That is quite satisfactory, Senator Hogg.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

I do not think that is quite right but I am happy with that as well. We did it for Senator Murphy and I am happy to do it for this as well. That means it will fit into that group that we deal with in the first section in the morning. I think that was the intention.

(R3)	Page 7 (after line 20), after clause 8, insert:
8A  Meaning of proper consent
	(1)	In this Part:
proper consent, in relation to the use of an excess ART embryo, means:
	(a)	consent obtained in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines on Assisted Reproductive Technology (1996) issued by the NHMRC; or 
	(b)	if the Chairperson of the NHMRC Licensing Committee specifies, by notice in the Gazette, other guidelines issued by the NHMRC—consent obtained in accordance with those other guidelines. 
	(2)	It is a condition of proper consent that the donor:
	(a)	receives independent counselling; and
	(b)	receives written notification of, understands and consents in writing to the specific application to which the ART embryo will be put; and
	(c)	has a cooling-off period of 7 days.
	(3)	At all times a donor is to have access to the information about the use to which that donor's embryos were put.
In light of the time—I realise that we have 30 seconds left or something like that, so I am extremely disappointed—all I can do on this is to seek leave to incorporate the arguments in support of my amendments. I realise the position on that and I am doing that because I realise that we will not have the time. They concern the regimes for those consent provisions.
 (Senator Cook)—Is leave granted for Senator Barnett's arguments in support of his amendments to be incorporated into Hansard?
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
This amendment specifies some elements of the nature of the `proper consent' that this Bill will require be obtained from all responsible persons (parents, gamete donors and their spouses) in relation to an excess ART embryo before such an embryo may be used for research under a licence from the licensing committee.
The Bill refers to the present Ethical Guidelines on Assisted Reproductive Technology 1996. The consent provisions in these guidelines primarily deal with consent of participants to ART treatment. They do not adequately address the very different consent to the use of excess embryos far research.
The Guidelines allow for counselling (in relation to ART treatment) to be carried out either within the clinic where the treatment will be received or independently. This amendment specifies that counselling must be independent. Couples undergoing ART treatment at a clinic often form very complex relationships with clinic staff as they go through the emotional roller coaster ride of successive attempts at IVF treatment. It seems a better safeguard for ensuring fully free and informed consent for counselling in relation to the use of excess embryos to require it to be independent of both the clinic and the researchers seeking to obtain the embryos.
Legislation relating to organ donation similarly requires that discussion regarding such donation be conducted by a person independent both from the clinical team treating the patient and from the transplant team. 
The amendment requires the responsible person be notified in writing, and that they understand and then consent in writing to the research.
The amendment further requires a cooling off period of seven days. As the embryos that may be used in research as `excess embryos' will be in frozen storage and research projects require substantial planning time there seems to be no valid reason not to allow people sufficient time for reflection before they consent to the irreversible destructive research of embryos for which they are responsible persons. Cooling-off periods are standard for all sorts of contracts involving things less weighty than agreeing to destructive research on human embryos.
Finally the amendment provides that each responsible person be given access to information about what actually happens to their embryos. This is similar to the needs of donor families who are given information about the outcome of the donation. Not every responsible person will want to follow up on this, but those who do desire information about these things should have the legal right to obtain it.
—It being 7 p.m., the time allotted for consideration of amendments of division 4 of part 2— that is, clauses 20 to 28—has expired. The question is that amendments (R2) and (R3) sheet 2694 revised be agreed to.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—The decision taken this morning was that at 7 p.m. on 4 December, when time allotted for consideration of amendments to division 4 of part 2 had expired, questions were to be put on any remaining amendments. I was advised that the committee stages of this legislation would continue until 7.20 p.m., when the motion for the adjournment would be put. On what basis is the debate going to be truncated? In good faith we were trying to hurry things up. I specifically asked someone in an official capacity to confirm that we were going to 7.20 p.m. With due respect, we have got the Order of Business and normally government business continues until 7.20 p.m., when the adjournment question is put.
— Thank you, Senator Harradine. My advice is that the decision today did not override the normal provision for government documents. As a consequence, I proposed that we report progress. However, I am also advised that with the leave of the committee we could pursue this until 7.20 p.m., if that was the will of the committee.
—I seek leave for the proceedings on the bill to continue till 7.20 p.m.
Leave granted.
—We now move to amendments to divisions 5 and 6 of part 2—that is, clauses 29 to 32.
—Based on the advice that I had received, I incorporated my arguments into the Hansard because we would be concluding at 7 p.m. and I would not have adequate time to argue that particular amendment. I see that it is a done deal, but I am just making that point.
— Thank you, Senator Barnett. I understand what you have said, but there is no point of order. I now call for clause 29 amendments to divisions 5 and 6 of part 2.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—I move amendment (8) on sheet 2751 revised 2:
(8)	Clause 29, page 20 (lines 17 and 18), omit subclause (3), substitute:
	(3)	The database must be kept and made publicly available in electronic form, including being made available for inspection on the Internet.
There has been considerable reference to the COAG report and to the fact that COAG has been very concerned that the system should provide for public reporting of research involving embryos so as to improve transparency and accountability. The purpose of amendment (8) is just that. As mentioned, the bill gives the NHMRC Licensing Committee the discretion to make available to the public a database of licences in electronic form. This amendment that I have moved strengthens that provision by ensuring that the database is made available on the Internet for public inspection. It ensures that this occurs so that timely advice or information is provided to the public in accordance with the decisions of COAG. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-04,"—Very briefly, the conditions that Senator Harradine requests be amended are very similar to those that were amended in respect of the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. The decisions of that body are available on the Internet for public scrutiny. I believe that that is a step in the right direction. One Nation formally supports amendment (8) as moved by Senator Harradine.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-04,"—It would be very disappointing if we did not have from the minister a response to this amendment. I am hoping that she will not oppose it. We are setting up a public database so it will be on the public record. Amendment (8) is a very sensible one. It sets up the electronic database and puts it on the Internet. For the life of me I cannot think why anybody would want to oppose it. If there is a possible reason, I would certainly like to hear about it.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-04,"—I will not be supporting the amendment because, again, I do not think it is necessary. The clause makes it clear that the database must be made publicly available. The obvious way to do this is via the Internet. I have every confidence that the database will appear on the web site of the NHMRC, just as all other public documents of the NHMRC appear. As minister, I am prepared to give that undertaking: it will appear in that way.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—Having regard to that undertaking, I seek leave to withdraw amendment (8).
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-04,"—by leave—I move amendments (8A), (8B) and (8C).
(8A)	Clause 29, page 20 (line 10), after “licence”, insert “and the reasons for the decision to issue a licence”.
(8B)	Clause 29, page 20 (before line 8), before paragraph (a), insert:
	(aa)	the membership of the HREC which approved the activity for which a licence was granted.
(8C)	Clause 29, page 20 (after line 20), at the end of the clause, add:
	(5)	Information mentioned in subsection (1) must be made available on the NHMRC Licensing Committee Internet site within 30 days of the HREC assessment.
These amendments have been devised having regard to discussions that have taken place over the life of this committee stage of the bill. There is a regime, which has been established in this legislation—and I use the terms used in the legislation—for the use of excess ART embryos for the purposes of experimentation or research, whichever word you prefer. That whole structure is based upon two rocks. We have been told, `Don't worry, these applications for a licence to destroy human embryos are to go through a human research ethics committee.' That is the principal foundation of the whole structure: `Don't worry about things that go through this particular committee.' There is another foundation of this whole process and that is accountability and information. The bill does not provide for this information. In fact, it is a secretive approach because the decisions and the evaluation of an application for a licence from the NHMRC Licensing Committee are withheld and kept secret from the public.
I know that the NHMRC has had a culture of secrecy over a period. That has been loosened up a little bit, perhaps over the last two years. Before that, there was a culture of secrecy and I fear that elements of that are still there, and this is one of them. The human research ethics committee will not provide the information as to why it has decided to approve or reject an application. Let me again give an example: a drug company, or a scientist who is involved with a drug company, seeks to use embryos or embryonic stem cells to test drugs. Where does the application go? It goes to the human research ethics committee. Who appoints the human research ethics committee? The institution— the drug company. The minister will say, `But it's been established according to the NHMRC guidelines.' 
I do not have time tonight to go through all those NHMRC guidelines, but the fact of the matter is that the committee is predominantly research oriented. Two people from the community will be appointed under the guidelines, but preferably they will be from a community very close to the institution. I put it to you that it is not appropriate to have a situation where that organisation is not accountable to anybody. It is certainly not accountable to the public, because the public does not know and is refused the information as to why the committee has acted as it has about an application. I propose to ensure that at least that information is made available to the public.
I am concerned about the fact that the committee is appointed by the institute that makes the application for a licence. That creates many problems. In addition, these sorts of committees very often do not have the resources that are needed to give a truly independent evaluation of the research project for which a licence is required from the National Health and Medical Research Council Licensing Committee. I raise these matters and I would like some response in the first instance to the question: is the government going to do something to ensure that information is made available to the public in the interests of accountability and transparency?
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-12-04,"—Tonight I want to address some aspects of the trade relationship between Australia and the Middle East and the growth of that relationship. It is one of Australia's more important trade relationships. In the year 2000, a parliamentary report on Australia's trading relationship with the Middle East was tabled. Since then, an enormous amount of work has gone into fostering relationships and into identifying and engaging in new parts of the Middle East market. Recently, members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade participating in a visit to the Australian forces deployed to the international coalition against terrorism also spent some very valuable time in Dubai and received a number of briefings on Australia's success in trade with the Middle East and the Gulf region. For example, through groups such as the Australian Business in the Gulf group— known by the acronym ABIG, and which is now helping about 200 Australian companies to negotiate the trading environment of the Gulf region—and Austrade and in myriad other ways, we are taking great advantage of the opportunities that exist. 
During the time that we spent in Dubai, members of the committee owed much to Consul-General Peter Linford and his team, including Paul Morgan and Alex Fraser, who gave us a very interesting overview of our success in engaging in the Emirates market. The Emirates are consistently among Australia's top three markets in the region, and that is a steadily growing level of trade. Two-way merchandise trade between Australia and the UAE has risen by almost 60 per cent over the last two years, from $1.3 billion in 1999-2000 to $2.0 billion in 2001-02. Australian exports to the UAE grew by 43 per cent over the period and imports from the UAE rose by 87 per cent, so this is a very dynamic area.
The UAE is our second-largest Middle Eastern market after Saudi Arabia, but I think its importance extends beyond those statistics. It is the region's major transport hub and plays a key role in facilitating our flourishing trade relationships with the entire region. In fact, that two-way trade relationship between Australia and the Middle East grew by almost 50 per cent between the years 1999-2000 and 2001-02. It is an interestingly popular regional base for Australians. I myself have friends living there, and more than 4,000 Australians live in the UAE. Over 70 Australian companies have offices there.
I also want to remark upon the important development of the growing diversity of our exports to the UAE. Traditionally, we have been well known in the region as a supplier of quality foods and raw materials but it is good to see that manufactured products are now matching that success. Between 1995 and 2001, Australian-manufactured exports to the UAE grew on average by over 25 per cent per annum and the share of total Australian exports to the UAE rose from under 18 per cent to what is now around 30 per cent. These are creditable figures. 
It must be acknowledged that that impressive growth is largely due to the outstanding success of our motor vehicle exports. These exports only began in 1996, but by 2001-02 they had grown to a value of over $200 million. Australian-built Camrys, Chevrolets and Magnas have succeeded in the UAE because of their high quality, strong price competitiveness and ability to meet the requirements of that local market. These attributes also underpin other Australian manufactured exports to the UAE such as industrial machinery, ships, medicines, scientific equipment and furniture.
Australian exports to the Emirates in 2001 were valued at $1.2 billion while total imports were valued at $930 million. The major exports include alumina, motor vehicles and agricultural products. However, the really dynamic and great opportunity for Australia is the expanding market for Australian educational, architectural and other professional services. If we can make the most of that market, it will be of enormous benefit for Australian business. Petroleum products account for most of the imports.
This is not success that happens by itself. It is the result of a very concerted effort by the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, and his predecessor, Tim Fischer, to improve our trade performance in that part of the world. One good example is a problem that was identified in the timely allocation of tourist visas from the region, an issue which was raised with us on our visit and included in the committee's report. After discussions from Minister Vaile and others, and of course our diplomatic representatives in the region, I understand that DIMIA will allocate a permanent full-time migration officer to the post in Dubai in February next year. It is hoped that that will facilitate a more effective distribution and allocation of visas as appropriate.
As the committee's report mentioned, the delegation visited two very impressive facilities, the Jebel Ali Free Zone and the Dubai Aluminium Ltd smelter. The port in Dubai is quite mind-blowing. It is a large, modern deep-water port, with 19 cranes capable of moving 12,000 containers every day. That is a better rate of container processing than that which is achieved in either Singapore or Hong Kong. The free zone provides a tax-free operating environment for businesses, like those made available under our government's manufacturing-in-bond legislation. Businesses operating in the zone have access to a range of support facilities and services, and the important thing to note from Australia's point of view is that 20 of our own companies are located there.
The delegation also visited Dubai Aluminium Ltd, known as Dubal, which is the largest single-site aluminium smelter in the world—I have to add that, from close inspection, it is probably one of the cleanest. The smelter's location is very important for Australian suppliers of aluminium because it services markets in Europe, Asia, the Far East and America with equal ease. It is important to note that most of the alumina used by Dubal is purchased from Australia and that they use more than one million tonnes of Australian sourced alumina per year, so it is a very important market for us.
The Dubai experience mirrors the success that Australia is enjoying across the Gulf region. The Middle East, which includes North Africa in this case, was the fastest -growing regional market for Australian exports in 2001-02. Indeed, it is fair to say that that market is a pacesetter in terms of both growth and diversification—and has been for some years. Minister Vaile has been an advocate of the region's potential for some time and has visited the region on a number of occasions since he became the Minister for Trade in 1999.
For example, in the last six months alone, Minister Vaile has led two trade delegations to the Middle East to emphasise the importance that the government places on trade with the region and to underline that, despite the uncertainties that may exist, Australia is approaching the region on a business as usual basis. 
The first of these two trade delegations, in July, was to Libya, where new opportunities for trade have arisen since the suspension of UN sanctions in 1999. It was a very broad-ranging delegation with representatives from the agricultural, industrial, oil and gas, technological and services sectors. The wide-ranging discussions held by the minister in Libya identified further areas where we could provide both products and services. Substantial progress was achieved on the sale of agricultural produce, oil and gas exploration equipment and services and veterinary pharmaceuticals.
More recently, in September this year the minister led an Australian delegation which attended the ninth meeting of the Australia-Iran Joint Ministerial Commission. During that visit the minister met with President Khatami, former President Rafsanjani and a range of the economic ministers in Iran. That created the opportunity of reinforcing existing commercial ties and of opening new areas of cooperation. There were 53 members in that delegation, which represented 39 separate companies including AWB Ltd, BHP Billiton and Woodside.
It is also interesting that Minister Vaile's efforts in boosting our trade profile have generated positive media coverage in Iran. Australia is depicted as a modern, technologically advanced economy and a valued supplier of wheat and other primary commodities. Iranians have expressed strong support for Australian investment in Iran, and we now have agreement to negotiate an Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement between the two countries.
We have recently had the opportunity to help exporters achieve some important trade wins in Iran. For example, the AWB has confirmed a major contract for over half a million tonnes of wheat to Iran. The Australian company Seaspray has secured a deal to supply Iran with two Incat-designed ferries valued at $US12.2 million. Mr President, I know that will impress you, as a Tasmanian senator. That construction is to take place in Iran but, importantly, most of the materials and technologies are supplied from Australia. We also have the example of a South Australian company which has been contracted by Iran to provide a package of services designed to promote Iran as a tourist destination and for them to do that themselves. The package includes training, infrastructure development, tourism development, tourism planning and marketing advice.
Across the board, we have had very strong successes—successes which can only grow. It is important to look, for example, at education; that is an enormous opportunity for Australia's quality educational institutions to form a very strong presence. We need to further our investment links, particularly in trade-creating sectors. We have a number of measures in place to do that, and I can only comment favourably on a range of those and say that it is very important that, as well as focusing on our own region and on traditional trading partners, Australia makes the effort to develop our potential in areas such as the Middle East. That is certainly the leadership that the trade minister is providing.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Trade: Middle East</title>,Adjournment,23,1
