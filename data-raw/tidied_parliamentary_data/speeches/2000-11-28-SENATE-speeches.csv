"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-11-28,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Buckland today, relating to Business Activity Statements.
Senator Buckland questioned the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, about the evidence of the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office, Mr Rick Matthews, at the Senate economics estimates hearings last week. Mr Matthews had described the business activity statement as one of the simplest forms in the world. The business activity statement is the new form that has been introduced by the Liberal-National Party, and it is the centrepiece of collection of the goods and services tax. The business activity statement, known as BAS, is part of the goods and services tax administrative requirements introduced by the Liberal-National Party government.
Senator Kemp, in his response, did not express any particular concern about the ramifications and the complexities of the business activity statement. He did not express any concern at all that businesses, particularly small businesses, have been experiencing problems in relation to completion of the business activity statement. In fact, Senator Kemp said that the `system is working well'. He went on to relate his experience in talking to business, and he said that some had found the system very simple. If he has been talking to business, I am sure it would have been big business—and of course big business do not have problems with the implementation of the goods and services tax . They have in-house lawyers and accountants who can complete these complex forms. 
It is not simply the form, which is two pages long; it is the explanatory booklet—and it is a book—which you are required to read when completing the business activity statement. That booklet is some 150 pages long. It is not a simple matter, as Senator Kemp and the tax office would have us believe, of completing a two-page form. You have to read 150 pages of the explanatory booklet. If the business activity statement were so simple to complete, why have extensions been given by the tax office for completion of it? Initially the date for completion and lodgment was 21 October. This was extended by three weeks to 11 November. Then there was a further extension to 30 November. If the form is so simple to complete, why have there been two extensions to the completion date? The last extension, to 30 November, does come with the parameter that the form has to be lodged through an accounting firm. So tough luck for those small businesses which did not meet the deadline of 11 November and cannot lodge it through an accounting firm. Of course, this does add to the business that accountants receive.
For the other form, which is required to be lodged by 21 January, there has been a further two-week extension to 4 February. If the form is so simple to complete, why give the extensions? Why are there complaints from people in the business community? I read recently of a Mr Bolger, who lives in Townsville, employing 35 people. He said that the `basic information needed was fairly easy to come to but that the additional questions on page 2 were causing problems'. He said: 
The information on the back page is far too demanding. Most people don't have their records at their fingertips.
He is not the only one to complain. We had the Queensland president of the National Party, Mr Terry Bolger, saying that he was `concerned about the Australian Taxation Office demands for extra information'. The president of the Queensland National Party complains, but note that we have had no complaints from the doormats of the coalition, the National Party, in this place about the complexity of the BAS.
—They wouldn't know.
—If they do know they are not saying, Senator Hutchins, because they ignore their constituency out in rural and regional Australia, particularly their small business constituents. The answer from Senator Kemp today was simply head in the sand—ignore the administrative complexity and the additional cost that small business in particular is being snowed under by and suffering under.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Business Tax Reform: Business Activity Statements</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2000-11-28,"—The Senate is taking note of comments in relation to the business activity statement. I remind the Senate that this statement brings together a lot of information on one form that was previously provided on a number of forms over many periods of time. This business activity statement is required to be lodged on a monthly basis by the larger taxpayers and on a quarterly basis by the smaller taxpayers. It would appear that certainly the larger taxpayers are not having a lot of trouble. Not surprisingly, given the greater spread of information and the fact that the records of some small businesses will have to be somewhat modified to meet with the new compliance arrangements, there will be a little extra time required by some of the smaller businesses for what we might call catch-up.
I express my disappointment that Senator Sherry has disagreed that perhaps extra time is needed for some of these smaller taxpayers to lodge, in a correct form, information in this new business activity statement. We have a sympathetic Liberal-National Party coalition that recognises the needs of smaller businesses to adopt, and to adapt to, the new configurations and the new arrangements. As part of that there are actually two options that taxpayers are entitled to pursue. I for one would recommend that taxpayers use what is known as option 2, the alternative. Option 2 is sometimes referred to as the accounts derived basis. Under the accounts derived basis, the system is relatively simple. It does not need the detailed calculations required on the back of the business activity statement, which for some may be complex. So if taxpayers pursue option 2, which I recommend—that is, the accounts derived basis—they prepare their cashbooks on the basis of, say, date, particulars, cheque details, cheque amount, the amount of the GST deducted, and then the net amount. Obviously all businesses need to dissect capital into the capital arrangements and to other relevant columns. So the amount that is allowable for income tax purposes, or is attributable to capital or private purposes is deductible over a period of time. The capital component is derived from the net amount paid for the service. 
—You've lost me, John.
—It is very easy to lose you, Senator Sherry, so I suggest that perhaps you listen. We take the bank figure and deduct the GST on that payment, and then we get the net amount. It is the net amount that is applied for income tax purposes. That net amount is the same figure as would always be included in any income tax return. So what I am saying, Senator Sherry, is that the amount that is paid for any particular transaction, for income tax purposes, is after deducting the GST.
—Yes, but can small business understand this, John; that's what is worrying us.
—If they write up their cashbooks on that basis, small businesses do not have to do the various calculations and complete the calculation sheet on the back of the form. Have you understood that? Because I think everybody else does. If you use the accounts derived basis, where you take the information straight out of your book, it means one extra column in your cash payments book or, if you are a farmer, maybe two extra columns in your cash receipts book. That does not create too many complications. In fact, the time taken to prepare your business activity statement on that basis in terms of the GST is absolutely minimal because the figures are derived merely by taking the difference in the totals of cash payments and receipts journals, which is the GST payable. and I presume you would reconcile your books every quarter. Therefore, the system takes very little time.  
If you pay wages, the second component on the BAS statement, I think everybody would concede that there is no additional time needed for the amount of information required on the business activity statement for the payment of wages, total wages and amount deducted compared with previously. It should be a pretty simple exercise, Senator Sherry. (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-11-28,"—Perhaps we should have got Senator Watson to put his contribution on a whiteboard. We could have copied it down, sent it out to all those small businesses that are experiencing extreme difficulty in dealing with the business activity statement and, more importantly, to all those accountants out there who are providing them with advice and who are taking substantial amounts of time to complete these forms. Senator Watson makes it sound as if it is a walk in the park. From my point of view, I cannot for one moment understand why there are all these complaints out in the community about the business activity statement. Senator Watson has made it sound so easy. He is wasting his time in this chamber; he should be out there advising small business how to deal with the business activity statement and the application of the GST.
The reality is that it is not as simple as that. It is much more complex for ordinary business people out in the real world to deal with the GST. For example, at estimates, Mr Matthews from the Australian Taxation Office was asked about the degree of difficulty being experienced by people in completing and submitting the business activity statement. He fudged the answer to the question. He avoided answering the question because the tax office has never attempted to find out the degree of difficulty that small businesses are confronting in trying to complete these forms and to meet the timetables that have been imposed upon them in terms of the GST. That issue was avoided. But we do know there are substantial difficulties being confronted by small businesses. As part of the petrol inquiry that the Labor Party has been conducting, I took part in a hearing in Raymond Terrace where we had a small business person—an independent truck owner—give evidence. This person was not your average truckie, as we would define them as being—and that is not a derogatory term, Senator Hutchins, by any means. This person was an ex-schoolteacher. In fact, he still taught at one of the high schools in the Newcastle area. He said that in terms of completing his business activity statement, it took 18 hours of his own time, seven hours on the phone consulting—I think he said with his daughter or his sister who was an auditor/accountant—plus additional time with his accountant to be able to complete the form. This is someone whom you would regard as being fairly literate, who would be able to read and understand the form, but who took something like 25 to 30 hours to be able to complete that form and who says the impost being put on small business to be able to comply with the requirements of the law in that area is an absolute outrage. 
There are many other examples. In an article in the Australian Financial Review on 23 November, Brian Toohey poses the question:
Backed by numerous public comments from accountants and business proprietors, bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the business organisation, Australian Business Ltd, have suggested the BAS really needs to ask only two key questions so far as the GST is concerned. 
Both questions occur on the front page of the existing form: how much GST is payable, and how much of this can be offset by credits for GST paid. The difference between the two figures would give the amount to be forward to the Australian Tax Office or due as refund. 
He goes on to say that the form could be substantially simplified if that approach were adopted.
The questions that beg answering are whether or not the form that has been designed by the Australian Taxation Office is for the purpose of identifying the amount of GST required to be paid, whether or not it has a wider role in terms of tax collection and is being used to monitor the activities of companies on a broader basis to ensure that there is no tax evasion or the like, and whether or not the form is beyond what is needed in order to meet that commitment. The other headline that I would like to refer to is from 20 November in the Australian: `BAS has agents fleeing profession'.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,2000-11-28,"—I rise to speak on Senator Sherry's motion to take note of Senator Kemp's answer to Senator Buckland's question about the business activity statement and to remind the Senate and any listeners that we are talking about the reporting requirement for the new tax system. We have changed the tax system very substantially. We have got rid of wholesale sales tax. We have brought in a new tax—the GST. We have changed income tax. We have changed the reporting requirements on the pay-as-you-go-basis. The government is very sympathetic—all of us are sympathetic—to the confusion being experienced by businesses in having to adjust to the changes of forms. But I remind the Senate of what a typical small business had to do in the past. On an annual basis, if they had some employees, they had to complete at least four PAYE returns and payments, four provisional tax payments, up to 12 prescribed payments remittances and up to four fringe benefits tax payments. Some of them also had reportable payments systems and other separate withholding systems that they had to report on. Medium-sized firms had 12 reports per year for PAYE, four company tax instalments and 12 obligations for prescribed payments, up to 12 on sales tax payments, as well as the fringe benefits tax.
So we have a brand new system and, sure, there have been difficulties in learning how to adjust to it. That is what the trouble has been about—people learning the system. However, the facts are that the system has been well designed. The tax office and the government took advice internationally. In fact, at the estimates last week the tax office tabled a document from the International Monetary Fund which set out the international advice to countries on what should be in the returns on VAT or GST—and our forms fit in with that. It was also reported that the tax office studied in great detail the GST returns from New Zealand. The GST part of the BAS is in fact simpler in the Australian form than in the New Zealand one. The confusion has arisen because we have married the PAYE, the prescribed payments system and the FBT system into the pay-as-you-go in the one single form.
However, the system is working quite well. As was reported in Senate estimates hearings last week, 300,000 businesses have been reporting on a monthly basis since the start of this financial year, with only about one per cent `error rate' in timing. Of the smaller businesses reporting on a quarterly basis, 1.5 million have sent in their forms and their payments, and the tax office expects a total of 1.6 million. I remind the Senate and listeners that the deadline for quarterly reporting was the 11th of this month except if reporting through an accountant or tax agent, when the deadline is Thursday of this week—so there is still time for people to get their report in. As my colleague Senator Watson said, a lot of the confusion has derived from the fact that there are two options for doing the work. There is the option of doing it on the form with the calculation sheet on the back that has been sent out to all businesses, which is fine if your business is quite simple. As Senator Watson said, you just make simple modifications to the cash payments and cash receipts columns in your books. The alternative accounts derived scheme simply means you fill in the key bits from the accounts, which for lots of businesses are now done by computer.
The other interesting item tendered in the estimates hearings last week was that over 50 per cent of the quarterly returns from small businesses to the tax office were done by the businesses themselves, not with the assistance of an accountant. That says that a lot of people have been making their personal effort and getting on with the job. I am sure in the next quarterly return early next year, at the end of January and in February, we will see a much lower complaint rate, we will see a much lower error rate, and we will get a good result.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-11-28,"—Anybody who was listening to the broadcast this afternoon or reads the speeches of two very honourable and learned senators on the other side, Watson and Gibson, who lectured us on the basic niceties of this new scheme, would be confused that we have this new super-duper scheme that is `simple, fairer and more equitable'. If you think about it, Madam Deputy President, and you read the correspondence that you may have received in your role as a senator from New South Wales, you would come to the same conclusion that I and many other people in the community have come to: this system is not simpler or fairer but is far more complex and is indeed unfair, and in particular unfair to small business.
I subscribe to a magazine called the Owner//Driver. Unlike, I imagine, a number of other senators in this place, in my previous occupation for nearly 17 years I represented the interests of small businesses through the lorry owner-drivers in the TWU. So I might be expected to know a little bit about how they manage and operate their businesses. In this month's edition of the Owner//Driver, in one of their regular columns Mrs Pam McMillan writes about the difficulties with the business activity statement. I might add that I would not think Mrs McMillan, whom I think I may have met over the years, would generally be a supporter of some of the positions I would take. She asks, rhetorically I suppose, at the beginning of her article:
How are you all going with the figures for your Business Activity Statement?
She goes on:
I don't have a problem with the theory of it ...
So we have in this article a person writing about the GST and the business activity statement who is in general supporting the coalition. But what Mrs McMillan says is this:
My really major, major problem has been with recipient created tax invoices and the deductions made by prime contractors.
If anyone has any advice on how to deal with multiple deductions off an individual RCTI and then a lump sum deduction off the payment as well I would be really grateful.
I have spent literally hours and hours trying to get the figure right in my program, the programmers have not answered my emails, faxes or phone calls and the Tax Office says they don't know and they don't believe the computer people have it worked out either.
She then goes on:
I realise that I am just a little fish in a very big sea, but my protestations fell on deaf ears when all of this was being set up with governments, the Tax Office and our learned friends in Canberra.
She concludes in this part of the article:
And I would really love to know just how many of our decision makers were in actual fact subcontractors, who just like prime contractors have to balance their books and be accountable.
That is Mrs McMillan, a person who says she supports in theory the practice of what the government has done. As you well know, Madam Deputy President, since this scheme was introduced small businesses have had to go from filling out one statement a year to five. You know as well as I do that big businesses are much more advantaged in this scheme; they have a bevy of accountants and lawyers to assist them in assessing their books. They are overwhelmingly advantaged in this scheme. The firm Morgan and Banks conducted a survey, last month I think it was, and they reported that when they surveyed small business 92 per cent of them said their profitability was down because they were redirecting their activities from being involved in services and sales to making sure they filled out the taxation forms correctly. And rightly so, I imagine, considering that you will be stung with a $10 million fine if you are a small business and you have not filled it out correctly. But I challenge the government to go after any of the big business mates they have if they do not fill out their forms correctly, because the system favours them overwhelmingly. You know as well as I do, Madam Deputy President, that this Prime Minister said that he would reduce paperwork and get rid of red tape. That has not happened as a result of the introduction of this scheme. It is now more cumbersome and more unfair on small business.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-28,"—This proposition that the government has presented to the Senate today—that we do not press these amendments—I think demonstrates once again just how blatantly callous this government has become. The motion moved by the Senate in regard to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 requested that the House redress what is now quite transparently obvious for all to see: the unjust and vastly inflated increases that were going to the wealthiest private schools under Dr Kemp's SES funding model. 
The Senate has asked this government to have this money redirected to programs for disabled children in both government and non-government schools. It is the children of Australia who stand to lose under this government's proposals. We have this proposition today which suggests that the government refuses the Senate's request. It has refused to give more money to schoolchildren with a disability. I remind the Senate that government schools educate 80 per cent of all the disabled children in Australia. Some 85,000 disabled students in Australia go to government schools. There are some 13,000 students with disabilities in non-government schools, 8,000 of whom are in the Catholic sector. Under Labor's plan, as carried by this Senate and sent through as a request to the government in the House of Representatives, we were seeking to increase fourfold the funding for students with disabilities in government schools and to double the amount going to students in non-government schools who have disabilities.
Frankly, I find it difficult to understand why the government is doing what it is doing. Quite honestly, I find it difficult to understand how some ministers in this government can actually sleep at night. I just cannot understand how Dr Kemp and his colleagues can face the people of Australia and tell them that, no, the government is not prepared to take this amount of money away from these category 1 private schools—the $145 million that it is giving to these schools—and redirect these funds to children who need them most; that is, children with disabilities in both sectors. As far as I can see, this is straightforward callousness by this government. 
I can understand how some people might put the view that the vast increase, the largesse, that this government is heaping on category 1 schools is a result of some unintended consequence, an accident if you like. I can understand how some people might say that surely the government did not intend to heap all of this money on these schools, which already have such lavish facilities and which already cater for the needs of families who can afford up to $14,000 per year per child. I can understand why some people might say that surely Dr Kemp did not intend this with his new SES model. The problem is that Dr Kemp himself says that the aim of this bill is to provide extra funds to the neediest non-government schools. 
Perhaps it is just an accident, but in reality what happens under this bill is that it is not the neediest schools but the most elite, most powerful and most wealthy schools in this country which get the most out of it. We are entitled to ask why these measures have in fact occurred because, if it is just an accident, surely it is now up to the government itself to move to address the clear injustices that have been exposed through the processes of this parliament. Surely it is up to the government itself to acknowledge that it has made a mistake and that the funds that are going to the most privileged in our educational communities would be better directed to those in greater need. Surely it would do that.
Then again, perhaps it is the case that this government, under Dr Kemp's administration of the education department, has meant to do exactly what it has actually done. Maybe it is the case that the government is refusing to shift these funds away from the richest to the most needy schools because it had intended, right from the very start, to produce such unequal and unjust outcomes. Maybe it is the case that this government has simply acted callously and, as some would say, immorally.
The Labor Party take a different view on these questions: we sincerely believe that education should be funded on the basis of need. That principle ought to extend to both the government sector and the non-government sector. As far as we are concerned, Labor's policies on funding for the neediest non-government schools are clearly stated and have been spelt out on numerous occasions. While we were in office, we did redirect money to those particular communities. Labor have said that there are basic principles involved in the funding of educational options for Australia's children. If people wish to send their children to Catholic, Jewish or Islamic schools or to any others of different religious groups, and if those schools are poorly equipped, poorly staffed and their buildings are rundown, the government has a responsibility to provide assistance. That is, schools have a right, an entitlement, to minimum community standards.
What we have seen of course is that under this government there has been a widening of the gap between the educational haves and have-nots and that, in my judgment, the Commonwealth has overseen an extension of those inequalities. We have some 7,000 government schools in Australia and they have suffered dramatically under this government's policies. In fact, we have seen this government shift the priorities away from genuine need, and it has produced this artificial and inflated measure that will see millions of dollars go to those that are already privileged. We argue, and I think the overwhelming majority of Australians share this view, that we have an obligation in this country to ensure that there is a strong public sector, a very high quality public sector. What we have seen is this government's constant denigration of the public sector. We believe that it is a government's responsibility to ensure that every child has access to a decent education in a government school. This is not a view shared by the government. In government Labor will be committed to providing for all Australian kids and their families, and our priorities will be on public education. That goes not just for schools but for universities, the vocational educational system and our TAFE colleges. On the other hand, this government has no commitment to the provision of a strong public sector.
Under this government, we have seen a shift in the amount of money going to government schools: from 43 per cent of total Commonwealth funding in 1996 down to 34 per cent by the year 2004. We have seen proposals by this government to provide $700 million in extra funding for the four years—that is way beyond indexation—to private schools and, in particular, to the wealthier schools within that group. There is no matching increase for the 70 per cent of students in this country that attend government schools. We also see that quite extraordinary measures are being taken in other areas by this government—take, for instance, the enrolment benchmark adjustment and the breathtaking inequality that is implicit in that arrangement. We can see quite clearly a deeply irrational and very unfair measure being taken by this government in trying to impose that. Our amendments will abolish the EBA. 
What is quite clear in all of this is that there is an enormous groundswell within the community. There is enormous awareness now of just how unfair, unjust and divisive the government's policies are. It is to the government's electoral peril that they do not accept the proposals that the Senate has put to them, because these are issues that we will be pursuing. The government have made it clear that they do not at this point intend to accept the Labor Party's amendments and requests from the Senate. We will be seeking that the government be given an opportunity to reconsider their position. There is an opportunity here today for the Senate to say to the government, `Come to your senses on these matters and reconsider the position you have taken,' because we will be recommending to the Senate that these requests be pressed. We will be voting against the government's motion today. While there are a few other things I need to say, I understand that other senators here need to make comment on this matter as well, so I will return to this in a moment.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,21,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-28,"—I want to indicate that the Democrats will be voting against the government's motion today. The Democrats reluctantly supported the ALP's amendment to divert the $57 million or so from category 1 schools to special education funding, and our reluctance stemmed from the failure of the ALP to do more than tinker with the edges of this unfair SES formula. I remind the Senate that most of the Democrats amendments would have produced a much fairer model, and our preferred amendment would have seen a 12-month extension of the current arrangements so that a proper debate could be conducted and so that we could look at not only a fairer model but what is actually required to fund a decent level of education across the board. As an outcome of that review, we would have understood that the $6,000 or so which is currently spent on every student in government schools is hopelessly inadequate. Of course, private schools understand this, and that is why in some cases the fees in such schools are even twice that amount. If you top that up with both federal and state funding and other income to the school, you are looking at many schools spending almost three times as much on their students as we spend on students in government schools. 
However, to get back to the motion of the government today, special education is an area of enormous need. There is far more that the federal government could be doing, and so we support the extra injection of funding. It is a disgrace, for instance, that the strategic assistance per capita grants have been broadbanded into literacy and numeracy funding. It will make it just that much harder to identify from year to year how money is being spent and on what. Special needs encompass far more than literacy and numeracy. No doubt it gives Dr Kemp some pleasure to boast that his government is spending more than ever on literacy and numeracy, but a fair amount of this so-called new money is really just old money being recycled. It is also disgraceful that Dr Kemp's promise to non-government schools that they would be no worse off was not extended to special needs students in government schools. I think that it is simply cheap and miserable of this government to reduce the per capita rates for secondary students from $126 to $102. I see that this amount has been increased to $110, but it is still a very small amount and it is still not enough.
This government still refuses to address the resourcing issues raised by learning disabilities and difficulties. There is no national strategy on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder four years after the National Health and Medical Research Council recommended a federal policy to tackle this very alarming issue. It does not seem to faze Dr Kemp that hundreds of children are being medicated for ADD and ADHD. Medication is supposed to be a last resort, but for most families it is the only resort because testing and multimodal treatment are prohibitively expensive. I would like to see some of this extra $50 million or so go towards formulating an appropriate response to these realities. Under this legislation, non-government special schools will be funded at 70 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost, which, as I said earlier, is just over $6,000. This seems a meaningless, arbitrary figure when you consider how labour and resource intensive it is to deliver quality education to many children with disabilities. Under this legislation, most special schools will be getting funding increases of around $40,000 a year, with the biggest increase being $180,000. 
It seems only fair to support an amendment which will quadruple the per capita amount for special needs students in government schools and double the amount going to non-government schools. However, what bothers me about this legislation is the fact that, although it will be easier for non-government schools to take in students with special needs, there is still no requirement for them to do so, even in return for the extra cash. Parents of children with disabilities say that money is often not the primary issue here. Resources are often cited by non-government schools as an obstacle to taking children with disabilities, but they say schools are often reluctant to take on students with intellectual disabilities in particular because they do not want to complicate things or to sully the institution's reputation for academic prestige.
The Democrats would be very interested to know how many students with disabilities attend the category 1, 2 and 3 schools that are getting so much out of this formula. Not one has come out publicly to say that they will take on more students with special needs. I suspect they are usually shunted off to underresourced government sector schools. I wonder how many parents Dr Kemp spoke to about this issue. One group, Queensland Parents of People with a Disability, say that if Dr Kemp really did consult with the community, are they not part of it—because he did not consult with them. The fact is that for most parents of children with special needs there is no such thing as choice. For all Dr Kemp's rhetoric about choice, these families will not gain much, if anything. Eighty per cent of children with disabilities are educated in the government system. Some non-government schools, I am told, accept special needs children if they already have siblings at the school and their parents are in a position to make a financial contribution. Other parents with strong religious beliefs are unable to place their child in a school that would inculcate these values. In the government system, they are continually under pressure from departments to put their children into underresourced special schools or to withdraw them altogether from schooling.
I am hearing of children who travel far more than they should because education departments will not inject funds to make schools, especially in rural areas, wheelchair accessible, for instance, at least not without a fight for which the parents have no time or energy in most cases. In northern Queensland, one child has been told he can attend school only two hours a week because that is the total time available for him to be assisted by an integration aid. Children with autism spectrum disorder displaying challenging behaviour are not getting the supervision they need or that their classmates need in order for their education not to be disrupted. Many of these children are intellectually quite advanced and are not suited to the curriculum at a special school. I have heard of one 14-year-old who has not attended school in three years because there is no money for a professional to be brought in to manage his behaviour. Another child has had his aid completely removed and is at home full time.
As I travel around speaking with parents of children with disabilities, these stories keep being brought up. It is clear that neither state nor federal governments have addressed this problem with any seriousness. When you contrast the circumstances of such children with the resources available to students in schools which are so generously taken care of by this legislation, we can see pretty stark differences in terms of the priorities of this government. The Democrats will not support the government's motion. We think this is not ideal but it is an amendment which we did support at the time, and we will continue to support it.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-11-28,"—The Greens will not be supporting the government motion. We believe that the government should be redistributing this money to the special needs schools according to the Labor Party formula. I want to look beyond that. The process here is that the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 will go back to the House of Representatives where the government will bounce it back to us again. I am concerned that there be an outcome before Christmas. We are here for another 10 days or so. I am concerned that the Labor Party has already indicated that it is not going to stand in the way of the government getting its way. I am concerned that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, on 4 August said:
We would not try to block the bill. That would simply produce the situation where nobody got any money. So we certainly won't be trying to do that.
I want to be reassured by the Labor Party that it will be adopting the amendments which the Greens have put forward which would allow the funding of schools next year according to the level of funding this year with appropriate indexation. That is what we should be doing to allow breathing space: keeping the current formula while the whole business of funding is reviewed. 
We should use the majority in the Senate in defence of public schools to make sure that the government does not get its way by redistributing millions of dollars to the very wealthiest schools while starving poorer schools across the country. We all know what that means. It means that youngsters, because of the household they are born into, are treated to a deprived or unfair level of education in this country of the free and the equal. That is not what we should be standing for. I do not expect anything different from this government. This government is about the big end of town, giving further wealth to those who are already wealthy. It is about the growing gap between rich and poor.
—Choice!
—It is not about choice. Choice should be about which school you go to, in the knowledge that you are going to get a fair schooling whichever school you enter. It is simply not true for the member opposite to indicate that a person with a low average income has the choice of going to King's, Newington or whatever the private college might be. That is not how it works at all. Many people want to send their children to schools which have a greater income and greater wealth. That is a matter for them to pay for, to do so. To deprive public schools, under the formula that we have before us in this legislation, whereby four times as much will go to a student going into a private school as goes to a student going into a public school, is simply not on as far as the Greens are concerned.
While that argument has been addressed time and time again in here, what concerns me is the outcome we are facing in the next seven days. I am very concerned that the government is going to get its way because the Labor Party is going to allow the government to have its way. That is the problem. I do not accept this view that it can be left to the ballot box. The ballot box put us in here to act on behalf of the constituency that we now represent and not to try to find some electoral favour out of allowing the government to do the wrong thing by that constituency. It is our job to stand up for the constituency that put us here. It is my job as a Green to do that, and it is the Democrats' job and the Labor Party's job. If we work together for the majority of people who voted, for the constituency on this side of the chamber, we will rectify the wrong that is in this legislation. But if the Labor Party does as it has indicated publicly and in the end says, `Oh, well, the government can have its way,' that will actually serve against the interests of the Labor Party constituency.  
Let us make no mistake about this. Let us have this abundantly clear. Whether the government gets away with this or not is up to the Labor Party. The Labor Party has to change tack. At the moment it is simply going through political motions which have the end result of the formula of Minister Kemp being implemented. That does not have to happen. This Senate has equal powers. This Senate is able to say, `Here's a different formula for next year.' This Senate is able to stare the government down as much as it is able to stare us down. This government cannot and will not allow schools to go without funding next year. We know that. But it takes a bit of political gumption to make sure that we stand up for what we believe in, and the Labor Party should have to make the stand as well. I think the electorate is expecting the Labor Party to make sure that it has some points of differentiation from the government in an election year, not by making promises about what it might do further down line but by what it does in this term of office. Here is the opportunity for the Labor Party to show how different it is from the government: that it has not lost equality as a staple part of its philosophy, that it does stand up for the public school system which the majority of Australian children attend, that it is able to use political clout for the right policy when the opportunity arises, that it is not in the Senate to just make idealistic sounding speeches but is actually prepared to use its vote to stand up against the iniquity of this bill. 
I am going to stand with Labor and the Democrats as far as this motion is concerned; that is, reject the government bouncing back to us the amendment which Labor proposed. But is Labor going to stand firm on that? We have amendments coming down the line next. What we are dealing with now is a request to the government in the House of Representatives to change the funding formula. The government has said no. It has come back here to the Senate and has said no. The public needs to understand that the very hard-edge amendments to the legislation are coming next. If we read what is right in front of our faces, the government is going to say no to those amendments when they go to the House of Representatives. That is when we will be put to the test. That is when we have to stand firm. That is when the Labor Party is going to be tested in here. If it stands firm with the Greens and the Democrats the right thing will be done by the education system. If it does not, then the wrong thing will be done and Labor will go to the next election saying, `But if we are in power we will do the right thing.' Labor is in power now in the Senate. We have the numbers to stand up for the public school system. We are tested now. Putting it off to some other day will not help the public school system. I want to make it abundantly clear that, while the issue has been canvassed and we know that the wrong thing is being done by the government, the real test in here in the coming days is going to be the fibre of the opposition in standing up for this important principle in which it believes.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-28,"—The issue before the Senate at the moment is the government's response to the Senate's requests with respect to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. It is quite clear that there are growing numbers of Australians who are deeply distressed and highly offended by what this government is doing and by the policies that this government is presenting with regard to its unequal and divisive funding of elite schools in this country. Therefore, I suggest the attention ought be on the government as to the direction of funding of schools. This is a government bill, after all. Senator Brown made some comments as to what the Labor Party's responsibilities are in this chamber. I do not think it can be seriously and properly argued that the Labor Party does not take its responsibilities extremely seriously. I do not believe it can be reasonably put that Labor senators have not considered this bill very carefully and measured its claims against the realities very thoroughly. 
Senator Brown, I appreciate your interest in these matters, but I am sure you would have noticed, through the Senate estimates processes and the Senate legislation committee processes, just how much attention has been paid to this bill by Labor Party senators. In fact, I put it to you, Senator Brown, that, if it had not been for the activities of the Labor Party on these issues, the public would not know what this government's proposals were really all about. I would suggest to you, Senator Brown, that the public is outraged by what is happening because they now understand, and it is more broadly appreciated, what this government is all about. I must say, Senator Brown, that I did not see you at any of those committees. I understand that you are very busy in other areas, but it is important to appreciate just what work is undertaken. 
Labor bring a different philosophy from that of the Greens and the Democrats to the operations of the Senate. We are an alternative government; we are not purely a Senate party. In that context, we do not claim to run government from the opposition benches in the Senate, and we never have. Money bills are initiated by the government. We respond to them, and we make suggestions and requests to the government to amend its bill. We are deadly serious about that, Senator Brown. It is important to appreciate just how this has developed. The government announced its funding system 18 months before it introduced the bill. It tried to keep the bill under wraps. It is effectively trying to hold Australia's children to ransom. In the few weeks left before funding runs out under the old legislation, the government has suggested that we must pass the bill here and now and as quickly as possible. Frankly, we will not fall into the government's trap.
We say that we do not believe that children should be used as political pawns, as they are by this government. To the government—and this is what this motion will do if we defeat the government's proposition—we say that we want to give it another opportunity to reconsider its position because, frankly, the government's position must be reconsidered. In our judgment, it should accept our requests and amendments. After all, it is a $22 billion bill. It provides funding for all children at schools in this country. It has to be seen in that context. There is no rational reason why the government should reject the request for the amendments to be made through this process.
The government claims that the non-government funding is fair, simple and transparent. We have said, and we will keep saying, that that is simply untrue. It is far from fair. It gives the biggest increases to the richest schools—the ones with the Olympic swimming pools, the dozens of hockey courts, the many ovals, the luxurious gymnasiums and the lavish libraries. Those are the schools that can afford the lavish trips to France, the new ceramic centres and the equestrian centres. Those are the sorts of education communities that this government thinks are entitled to millions more dollars. At the same time, the government is saying to the poorest non-government schools that there is very little extra funding for them in this bill, and next to nothing for government schools, over and above the normal indexation arrangements.
The government also says the system is supposed to be more simple. Under Labor, there were 12 funding categories. Under this, there are 65. Less than 20 per cent of the school system is funded under this new model. If the system is so fair, why is it that 80 per cent are outside of it? That is the fact of the matter. The Catholic education system—65 per cent of the system—is opting out and about 15 per cent of schools will have their funding maintained. What you have, therefore, is a system that does not actually apply to most schools. However, the fact remains that this bill covers the funding arrangements for all schools in the coming four years.
We have pointed to numerous examples of how unfair the system is. It is clearly not objective. The situation in the Australian Capital Territory was covered in the last estimates. There are 38 non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory, and only one, Canberra Boys Grammar School, will get an increase. The rest are funding maintained. It demonstrates that the Australian Capital Territory socially does not mix very well with this model. Canberra's suburbs have developed quite deliberately—quite rightly in my opinion—to be mixed class suburbs. You do not have the concentrations of deprivation in the same way you do in other parts of the country. That is not to say that Canberrans are necessarily significantly better off than people in the rest of the country; it is just that deliberate policies have been taken to spread out social advantage, and people from different backgrounds live close by one another. This model will not pick up the disparities in wealth so, quite clearly, it does not fit with the social circumstances of a place like Canberra. 
We have been told that this is a more transparent model—but it does not really apply in a case such as Canberra. Senator Brown rightly asked what we are going to do about it. We are going to press these requests. We are going to press these amendments. We are also making a few commitments. Senator Brown asked what the differential on this issue is between the parties looking to govern this country. We say that Labor's approach has been spelt out very clearly. We are determined to press these amendments, and we will wait and see what the government's response is. The pressure ought to be on the government. Senator Brown, you ought to be saying to people, `If you want these changes, go to the government. Seek the government's agreement to these changes.' That is where the action is in terms of the initiative in these particular matters.
Mr Kim Beazley outlined Labor's position in the House last night. He said that we want to see a fairer funding system. He said that one of the first acts of a Beazley Labor government will be to redirect the money currently going to the category 1 schools to other areas of greater need. We will abolish the EBA and we will return the $30 million taken from government schools. We are going to reverse the Howard government's bias against government schools and turn around the trend, which is growing so rapidly, of the Commonwealth share of funding going to non-government schools. 
Senator Brown, I accept what you said: people are very angry. I say to Senator Ellison: government members know, too, how angry people are. They too are getting the phone calls and the emails that all our offices have been inundated with. I am sure they are having trouble responding to the correspondence and the emails protesting about this bill. They know that this is very damaging for the government electorally. 
The Labor Party is particularly angry with the government. Senator Brown, I would ask you to think about that for a moment. Where should your anger be directed? It should be directed at the people who initiated this callous, unjust and divisive policy. Attention ought to go back onto the government. For those who are concerned and say that we should stop the bill right here and now, think for a moment of the consequences, and turn to the people who are responsible for the policies that are being pursued. As far as we are concerned, we have an obligation to pursue a mature approach to school funding—one that is suited to our society and to the real needs of our communities. We ought to be funding schools on the basis of real need. We ought to be guaranteeing access for all to a decent, inclusive, excellent public education system. Therefore, we urge the Senate to agree to press these requests and call on the government to reconsider its unfair and discriminatory actions. We ask the government to agree to the 23 amendments that the Senate has passed and to the two requests that have been made. Quite clearly, those amendments have not been considered by this government up to this point. The government must do so.
The government ought to govern for all Australians, not just for the elite and the privileged few. It ought to recognise its responsibilities to make sure that all the children of this country get a fair go—not just those who are already privileged and advantaged.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-11-28,"—I thank Senator Carr, and I do acknowledge that the Labor Party has been fundamental in getting information out to empower this vital debate about education and the direction of education funding in Australia. What I do not accept is the strategy from there on. Senator Carr has said that the opposition will be pursuing these issues at the government's peril and that the opposition is determined to press the amendments. But I do not hear in that sentence that the opposition is determined to accept nothing less than the amendments. The opposition says that I should be saying to people, `If you want these changes, go to the government.' I am not. I am saying, `If you want these changes, go to the opposition,' because the government is philosophically opposed to the majority of Australians who want the public school system to get a fair go. But the opposition is philosophically in favour of the public schools getting a fair go. The opposition has the power to stand up to the government on this matter, and that is where the test comes in. I am saying to the opposition, `You are the elected people to stand in defence of your policy and in defence of funding for public schools. And the time to do it is now.' 
I do not go along for a minute with this manufacturing of anger. Sure, there are going to be many voters out there who will be angry with the government if this legislation goes through. The opposition is therefore tactically able to say at the next election, `We are better on education. Give your votes to us and your anger will be assuaged.' But I wonder if you can dinkum say that to an electorate when the opposition—the opposition which is seeking government—has the power in the Senate to make that stand for education now and fails to do so. I do not want to see education ransomed by the ALP manufacturing, for a political advantage, an angry electorate which then puts it into office. What is first and foremost here is doing the right thing by education, not doing the right thing for a political manoeuvre to help get votes at the next election. This is the education of children, and I think the opposition's best tactic is to stand up for education. I think it will get a lot more votes through doing that than through manufacturing anger and failing to do so.
That said, we are in the position to give the government extra time, as the opposition said, to reconsider its position. But we know that the government is not going to. It has got an incentive to not change its position, because it is being told by Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition—and Mr Lee, the shadow education minister—that the opposition is not going to stand on this matter. That has let the government off the hook. The government knows that it has just got to wait out the Senate. On the eve of Christmas, this legislation will go through. The opposition is going to cave in and the public school system is going to lose out. I do not like the politics of that. I do not think that is politics of gumption, I do not think that is politics of principle, and I do not think that is the politics of equality that this country expects of the Labor Party. 
I do not like doing this but, when the opposition says to me, `Tell people to turn their anger to the government', sure, I think that has been valid to now. That has brought pressure on the government. But in my book it brings even greater pressure on the opposition because it has the power to do something here. I assure the opposition that the Greens are going to push the amendments we have and they have that would reverse this formula to make sure that the public schools get a fair go. The Democrats have firmed up on this in the last month or so and have said that they are also going to pursue—
—Senator Allison, I am being generous in promoting the Democrat point of view here. I feel that some generosity is required, because on this side we need to have the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens standing firm, not saying, `We can't pass these amendments or stand by them because the Senate shouldn't do that.' I might remind the Democrats that Senator Kernot, their former leader, pursued me hotly at the last elections in Tasmania because I would not commit myself to turning my back on Senate powers over money matters. I would not, and at one stage it looked as though I would lose election over it. But I was not going to sign on with the Democrats to a statement that said, `The Senate should forgo its constitutional powers on this matter.' If the people change those constitutional powers I will fall in line. But they have not done so, and so, as a Green, I stand here in defence of the public school system, knowing that those powers are there and knowing that we should be using them.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-28,"—Simply for the record, the government believes that the requests should not be pressed and that the bill we are dealing with that these requests relate to simplifies administrative arrangements for funding for students with disabilities. It removes the current arbitrary differences in funding for primary and secondary students and it removes the inequitable differences in allocations under current arrangements where the most disadvantaged non-government schools receive no additional funds for students with disabilities. The amendments require additional funding, which Labor proposes to obtain by taking out of the general recurrent grants for some non-government schools. The government cannot accept any amendment that will remove funding from schools. There is no cut in funding for students with disabilities in government secondary schools. State governments will receive the same amount of special education funding as they do now. The bill resolves the inequitable differences in allocations under the current arrangements for the most disadvantaged non-government schools that receive no additional funds for students with disabilities. Under the former ERI system, category 12 schools with students with a disability did not get one additional dollar. By providing a flat per capita rate to all schools, this bill will grant an extra $527 for each student in such non-government schools.
The proposal in the legislation for the creation of a list of schools which were excluded from the SES funding arrangements could mean that, in future, other schools, not necessarily category 1 schools, could be added to this list with little or no justification. The opposition cannot stand behind these amendments on the basis that certain schools should be categorised according to a blatantly broken ERI system while others can access the new SES arrangements. The anomaly of the opposition's position is that former category 1 schools such as Mentone Grammar School in Victoria, with an SES score of 110, would have its funding frozen. However, former category 2 schools such as Meriden School in New South Wales, with an SES score of 110, would receive a $3 million increase. The Penbank School, a former category 6 school with an SES of 110, would receive an extra $418 per student in 2004.
We have here a situation where the government has outlined legislation that it believes provides a fairer form of funding. But, importantly, we do have a time problem with the passage of this legislation. I can say that, by pressing these requests, this legislation could be held up. We need to pass this legislation as soon as possible so that agreements can be put in place in relation to funding. The government has received an overwhelming amount of correspondence, communication and lobbying in relation to the passage of this bill—that it be passed. The government maintains its previous position on this, and it believes that the request should not be pressed.
 (Senator Watson)—The question is that the requests for amendments not be pressed.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-28,"—The proposal before the chamber is for us to consider a series of amendments to replace the Senate amendments to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000. These amendments have been carried by the House of Representatives and reflect the negotiations that have taken place between the government and the opposition. I must say that it gives me some pleasure to indicate to the chamber that there are occasions when we can reach agreement with the government on important issues—and this is one such agreement, which is especially important, given the topic that we are considering here. 
The educational wellbeing of indigenous students is something that all of us ought to be very concerned about. The need to improve outcomes for indigenous students is something I would argue could not be treated more seriously by this parliament. The facts of the matter are that indigenous students in this country are not being given the support that they deserve and, as a consequence, we are seeing across a whole range of indicators that indigenous students are doing far worse than other Australian students. To me that is a matter we have all got to face and have a responsibility for as Australians. It is not a situation in which one should seek political advantage. It is a collective responsibility and, as far as I am concerned, not something that ought to be used as political football in debate. We ought not to be playing politics with the future of indigenous students. I do not believe the opposition has—and, may I put on the record, to its credit, neither has the government. 
The amendments agreed to go to the provision of information to the public and to the parliament on matters connected with indigenous education. The issue here has not been the quantum as such—which is another argument entirely—but about accountability. Our concern has been that there has not been sufficient accountability, particularly in the states, for the expenditure of Commonwealth moneys in this regard. During the examination of the bill in the second reading stage, we detailed our concerns about that, in particular the fact that some territories and state authorities have been taking a disproportionate share of moneys, allegedly for administrative purposes. On one occasion up to 48 per cent of Commonwealth money was allegedly for administrative purposes. Frankly, that is an outrage and has to be stopped. 
Our amendments essentially go to the issue of requiring information about the nature of the agreements that have been struck between the Commonwealth government and the educational providers, and we are seeking to have those agreements published. That was the import of what we said to the government. They have acknowledged that and have agreed to those agreements being published in the Gazette. The second amendment requires an annual report to parliament providing information about the outcomes for indigenous students in compulsory and post-compulsory education and training. There was some concern in the government that this could best be done through the annual report on schooling. Clearly, this measure is inadequate because, while the 2000 year data will be available in that forum, the fact remains that the first report under this act will provide details in respect of 2001. Our concern is that the report on schooling has traditionally been very late and the information contained in it inadequate in terms of getting a clear picture. It is of course subject to agreement with the states, which in itself is an interesting process when it comes to accurately reporting on what is occurring within the systems. 
We are seeking to ensure that the appropriations of money are appropriate and are spent appropriately—broken down by sector and state. The opposition has been concerned to ensure that there is meaningful information available to the parliament on the progress of indigenous students relative to other students' progress, that we acknowledge the special needs of indigenous students in that process and that, given our particular responsibilities as part of the reconciliation process, we ensure that members of this parliament do all they can to improve the education and training outcomes for indigenous people. 
We believe there needs to be a process whereby the product of agreements between the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers is available in a manner that will provide that information. I am very concerned that any attempt to allow that to occur simply through the annual national report is fraught with difficulty, given that changes can be made to that report without reference to the Commonwealth parliament. We argue that the parliament and the people of this country need a separate source of information about how well the education and training system is actually meeting the needs of indigenous people. I am very pleased that the government has now been able to come to an agreement on the matter. While I appreciate there will be additional work for the department, I think the long-term product of that process will be an opportunity to discuss issues and to hold people accountable for the spending of moneys in these vital areas. 
I note that other matters dealt with in our original amendments are the subject of agreement for information to be provided through the Senate estimates process. I anticipate that the minister will be able to make a statement on that matter and I look forward to that. The bill as it is amended is, in my judgment, strengthened in a number of quite important ways. It will result in a much clearer picture of the state of play in educational terms for indigenous students. It will enable us as members of this parliament and through us the public at large to see just how well we are doing by indigenous people in regard to the provision of education and training. It will assist us in deciding how to move forward together with the indigenous communities and to ensure that there is a serious contribution to the reconciliation process through actually improving the lives of indigenous people in this country.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-28,"—I can confirm the comments of the opposition in relation to the negotiation that has gone on between the government and the opposition. Can I thank the opposition for the constructive approach it has adopted in relation to this matter. I echo the sentiments of Senator Carr in relation to what I think is generally a feeling across the political spectrum that indigenous education merits serious attention and is a challenge which faces all concerned for the future. The amendments that we have here are, first, providing for the gazettal of details of agreements made with education providers and, second, providing for the tabling of an annual report containing certain financial and performance information. Whilst the subject matter of the amendments does not go necessarily to the programs themselves in relation to indigenous education, they deal with an important aspect of accountability. 
In addition to these amendments, the government will endeavour to provide members with access to draft indigenous education agreements, finalised agreements upon request, and details of where funding has been reduced to an education provider except where the reduction was due to normal parameter changes such as a decrease in enrolments or finalisation of a one-off project. That echoes the statement made by the minister for education, Dr Kemp, in the other place and places on record the government's undertaking in relation to the requests made by the opposition. I commend to the Senate the legislation which is the subject of these amendments. I think there is great merit in these being passed as quickly as possible.

66A-5  Interpretation
		In this Division:

	(a)	if the body is not a State or Territory—a member of the group of people who are responsible for the executive decisions of the body;
	(b)	if the body is not a State or Territory—anyone else who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of the body;
	(c)	in any case—anyone who is responsible for the overall nursing care provided by an aged care service conducted by the body;
	(d)	in any case—anyone who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of an aged care service conducted by the body, whether or not the person is employed by the body.
service day, for an approved provider, means the day when the Secretary gave the provider the notice mentioned in subsection 66-2(1).
This amendment is to do with the appointment of administrators and advisers. It will require the secretary to the department to establish a national panel of people with the necessary experience and background to be administrators or advisers. I am advised by the department that something similar operates on an informal basis. This has certainly been sought widely in the industry as being a worthwhile development. When a provider is required to appoint an administrator or adviser by the department as a result of sanctions, they will be given a list of the approved administrators or advisers to choose from. Under our proposal, they would then have two days to identify a person on the relevant list who is immediately available to act as either an administrator or an adviser and then one further day to appoint that person. Our amendment also attempts to better define the role and powers of administrators and advisers, who currently have no powers under the Aged Care Act. This amendment arises out of our concern about the way departmental and ministerial interventions into substandard nursing homes have been occurring. We have been concerned that the concentration seems to have been on the question of financial sanctions against the provider as a means of bringing their behaviour into line, but that does not necessarily deal immediately with the question of the care of residents at that nursing home. 
Our main concern, as I expressed in the second reading debate last night, is to ensure that, when a problem is notified, residents immediately receive proper care. If the agency or anyone else has found that the residents of a nursing home are at severe risk to their health, then clearly the priority for the minister, the department and the parliament is to ensure that proper care is provided—that they are removed from that risk—by someone in whom the minister and the department have faith to provide that care. That is why we are moving this amendment today.
I am pleased to see that the government are moving amendments to our amendment which seem to be accepting that principle. I am pleased about that. My intention is to get the best possible result, to provide the aged care minister with the power to make proper interventions and to protect residents. It is a job I hope to have one day, so I am very keen to make sure that the minister has those powers and is not left without the wherewithal to protect residents. I am interested to hear what the government have to say about why they are making changes to our amendment. We will come to that debate, but my primary concern is to get the best possible provisions into the Aged Care Act and to empower the minister and the department to protect the residents. While I have no problem with sanctions against providers, I regard it as a secondary issue in the sense that, as it may take some time, one can fight with the provider almost at one's leisure, providing residents are being cared for in the meantime.
We do not think that, under the government's system, there is the power to ensure that an administrator or an adviser is appointed immediately after serious risks are identified—and a range of cases have proven that point in recent years. The current system takes too long to appoint administrators and advisers. Under the existing arrangements, the provider is given 14 days to nominate someone for a position, the secretary has 14 days to approve that nomination and another seven days to inform the provider of the decision, and the provider then has seven days to appoint the person—and that is a best case scenario. If the secretary refuses to approve the nominee, the provider can appeal that decision to the AAT. 
For all that time the residents are left in the care of the provider who has proven to be not providing proper care and to be posing a serious risk to the health of those residents. That is just unacceptable. While there may be questions of process to be followed, we have to ensure that the care of those residents is immediately secured and that their best interests are immediately put at the centre of the system. Under this system we believe residents are left in substandard care while the provider and the department engage in this bureaucratic exchange. I think it is important to note that the current timetable for the appointment of an administrator or an adviser starts only when sanctions are imposed, which may well be some weeks after the serious risks to residents were first identified. In the case of Thames Street, the sanction to appoint an adviser was opposed more than six weeks after the serious risks were found. There may well be special reasons for that, but it again highlights the opposition's concerns.  
Under the current system, once an administrator or adviser has been appointed, they have no formal power to actually ensure that improvements are implemented. They must negotiate any changes in care with the provider, who may have a long record of noncompliance with the standards. Advisers and administrators have indicated to us the difficulties they face in the absence of any real power under the Aged Care Act. We want to make sure they can do their job properly. If we empower them to go in there to ensure the care of the residents, we must make sure they have the tools to do that job properly. Our amendment would effectively force the provider to recognise the right of an administrator to actually manage the day-to-day operations of the facilities. Under the current system it can be a minimum of three weeks before we are able to effectively provide proper care. With our amendment, we are proposing that we bring it down to three days. We think that is a much more acceptable timetable. We accept it might be used only in the most serious of cases, when the need arises, but we do want to make sure that the minister has the power to act quickly and to ensure care quickly.
I notice in the amendments circulated that the government is looking to push out those time frames again. I will be interested to hear what the minister has to say about that. My first reaction is that I am not convinced. I am going to want to be convinced as to why we ought to keep pushing out the time frames. I know there is always a good bureaucratic answer for taking longer—due process, appeal rights and all those sorts of things—but this is a situation where we are dealing with the minister's own department identifying serious risks to the health and care of elderly residents. It seems to me that we have to have the shortest possible timetable to make sure that their standard of care and their health are protected. I will need to be convinced that the government's amendments are not just allowing an unduly lengthy bureaucratic process which puts at risk those residents who may, in fact, have been at risk for some time. By the time you discover the problem and do the review audit, they may have already been at risk for some time. As I say, we want to argue for the shortest possible time frame. I will be interested to hear what the minister has to say when he speaks to his amendments. 
I am pleased that there seems to be some willingness on the government's part to endorse the idea. We have been talking to the Democrats about endorsing this sort of approach. I know it is consistent with the sort of thing they have been talking about in terms of flying squads and a recognition more generally in aged care that we need to have a quicker response aimed particularly at providing care in the small number of nursing homes that are not providing care, not playing the game and not meeting the standards. Obviously the Democrats and the government will speak for themselves, but I just thought I would say that in passing. 
I want to make it perfectly clear—Minister, I do not think you had entered the chamber when I first made these remarks—that, despite the occasional point scoring that goes on on these things, we are actually interested in making sure that we get the best possible result out of this bill. We are concerned to get the shortest possible timetable. I will be interested to hear your remarks. We want to get a bill that allows any minister to be effective in protecting the care of the residents. That is our prime concern. I do not care who owns the amendment, whether it is in the Democrats' name, our name or the government's name; I am just concerned that we get the best possible advice and powers for the minister and that we ensure that the Minister for Family and Community Services and any of her successors can do their job properly in this most important area. I understand there are Democrats and government amendments to our amendment. I am not sure at this stage which ones are being proceeded with, so I will perhaps speak on those amendments when the situation is clearer.
 (Senator Murphy)—The question is that opposition amendment No. 1 be agreed to. Senator Allison, you have amendments (1) to (5). Amendments (3) and (4) are not necessarily in conflict with government amendments (8) and (10), as noted on the running sheet; rather, they are subsumed by them. So do you want to move amendments (1) to (5) or do you want to move (1), (2) and (5) and leave out (3) and (4)?  ",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-28,"—by leave—I move Democrats amendments (1), (2) and (5):
(1)	After subsection 66A-1(2), insert:
	(2A)	Each panel is to include at least one registered medical practitioner.
(2)	After subsection 66A-1(4), insert:
	(4A)	A notice under subsection (4) must include a statement of reasons for the termination of the person's appointment.
 (5)	At the end of section 66A-4, add:
	(4)	If a person appointed under section 66A-3 is a registered medical practitioner, the approved provider must allow the person to provide medical services to ensure that all resident care standards are met.
Our amendments go to changing the ALP's amendment, as has already been demonstrated. There are a number of things we wish to do. One is to include a medical practitioner on the advisory panel. The reason for this is that we believe there is the likelihood that sanctions being imposed on nursing homes will come about as a result of health related matters. In fact, we have already seen that in the Riverside situation. So if issues have been identified such that it is necessary to appoint an administrator or an adviser, we think it is likely that resident health matters have also been overlooked.
In a recent assessment of an aged care facility on which sanctions were imposed, it was noted that all residents had at least one undiagnosed medical condition. We do not accept that the health of residents can be placed at risk under any circumstances, so our amendment includes a medical practitioner or medical practitioners on the administration and adviser panels. That is based on our concern for residents. It is not envisaged that that medical practitioner would treat residents, as the choice of doctor remains that of the individual. However, a medical practitioner will be able to advise and direct appropriate referral where it is clear that the health of residents is affected. The opposition amendment as it now stands does not provide for a statement of reasons for the secretary to terminate a person's appointment to the panel. Democrat amendment No. 2 goes to that question. We think that, in the interests of natural justice and transparent decision making, a full statement of reasons on which the termination is based should be required.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-28,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that I am not clear that I understand what the Democrats are trying to do. My understanding of the current system is that an administrator or a nurse adviser is appointed to the home to provide care and to take over, in part, the role of the provider of making sure care is provided. The panel suggestion is that a group of people are available for that role, but it is not a suggestion that a group of people—a doctor, a nurse and an administrator—will do that. It is one person. While I do not have any trouble with the fact that one, two or others on the panel might well be doctors, the skills that we are generally looking for are either that of an administrator or a nurse adviser. I would be interested in Senator Herron's view on this. It is not as if we would be sending in three people, including a doctor. I do not have any great objection if a qualified doctor is on the list—that is fine—but my understanding of the proposition is different. Adding the doctor does not mean you add a doctor to the team; what you are doing is putting a doctor's name on a list from which one person will be selected. Therefore, I do not think it will meet the objectives that the Democrats have set out for it. If push comes to shove, I would vote for it because I do not think it does any harm, but I do not think it does what Senator Allison thinks it does. I may be wrong on that—I am happy to be corrected if I am—but I would be interested in the minister's view.
I do not think we should leave the debate thinking that, by passing the amendment, we have added another person to the function. What we have done is to put a doctor's name on the list, who may or may not be chosen. Even if, as Senator Allison rightly said, there were severe medical issues, as there often are, about lack of treatment et cetera, I am not sure that you would put the doctor in; I think you would put the administrator in to make sure that proper medical attention was brought in as one of the resources. As I said, I am not really opposing it; I am seeking clarification. I do not think it achieves quite what Senator Allison thinks it will, but it is really up to the government to explain that position. I am interested in what Senator Herron has to say. I do not have any problem with putting the person on. Maybe I misunderstood, but my understanding is that it will not achieve the result that Senator Allison thinks it will achieve.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-28,—I am not sure what Senator Evans thinks I assumed this meant. I said quite clearly that we do not see this as being a medical practitioner coming in and delivering the services but rather for there to be a person on the panel who would be referred to in the event of there being a health related risk associated with the sanctions being imposed. We are not talking about an extra person on the panel to come around to the nursing home to administer it but rather having that expertise there in the event there is the mistreatment or some medical problem associated with the sanction.,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-28,"—I do not think Senator Allison and I quite understand each other. Maybe the minister can provide some advice. As I understand it, the person on the panel has no function. There is a list of names—that is what the panel is—and they are only used if they are appointed as an administrator or a nurse adviser. The doctor obviously will not be appointed as a nurse adviser, so the question is whether they are appointed as an administrator. My understanding of how it works is that they have no role unless they are appointed as the administrator of the nursing home. The panel does not have any other wide consultation role—they either get appointed as the administrator, or they do not. That is where I think we may be at cross-purposes, but I may be wrong. I hope the minister can clarify this, because he does have the advantage of the best legal minds the health department can provide.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-11-28,"—My understanding is that it is an extra person, as the Democrats have said. It is acceptable to us that there is an extra person on the panel. Of course, my understanding also is that seeking medical opinion or management or whatever is the prerogative of the administrator.

Our amendments will amend Senator Evans's proposed amendment, and cover three issues, which seems to satisfy all parties in the Senate. I accept the goodwill of the opposition in this regard. All of us—Democrats, government and opposition—are trying to get the best outcome for the residents. 
The opposition's amendments establish panels of administrators and advisers, reduce the time frames for the nomination and appointment of the above persons, and foreshadow the detail in the regulations of reasonable steps that approved providers must take in respect of disqualified individuals. 
The amendments are in accordance with my second reading speech, which indicated that the government had no problem with the creation of the above panels, which seems to be acceptable to all parties. We also accept the Democrats' amendment to add to the panels. As indicated last night, the opposition's position to allow only three working days for the appointment of either an administrator or an adviser is not practical or beneficial to residents. Senator Evans has referred to this and said that he is open to persuasion. I hope to persuade him that it is not practical.
—No, but I am foreshadowing that. I will explain that. The government proposes that the time frame should be five working days for the provider to nominate an adviser or administrator and three working days for the approved provider to make the appointment after it is approved by the secretary. The opposition reference to `service day' is not consistent with the Aged Care Amendment Bill and it is proposed to replace this term with reference to section 66-5, notice time. In addition, the reference to `regulations' should be changed to a reference to `principles', which is consistent with existing practice for subordinate legislation under the Aged Care Act.
I am also moving that the amendment concerning panels, although located in schedule 1 to the bill, commence 28 days after receiving Royal Assent. This will enable the panels to be established. ",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-28,"—I just want to tease out with the government the reason why they seek to extend the deadlines imposed in our amendments. As I said earlier, the current arrangements are very lengthy, and I think the government found that in Riverside and other cases. Because of the 14-day and seven-day notifications and so on, it took a long time to get to the point they wanted to get to. Our amendments are directed at solving that problem. We came up with a proposition of two-day and one-day because of our concern about the need for urgency in providing care. We were saying, `We have got a 72-hour response versus a three-week response.' The government wants to push that out for eight days. I am the first to admit that there is no magic about my two and one, other than that they were, I thought, the shortest possible time frames we could go for. I do not understand why it now takes three days to appoint somebody. I never understood why it took seven; I do not understand why it takes three. The government, until today, was defending the 14 and seven timetables. They are now proposing five and three, refuting two and one. I just want to understand on what basis that is made, what the logic is. As I said, I am open to be persuaded but, from what the minister has said so far, I still do not understand that rationale. I think it is important that we understand why they can go from 14 to five but not from 14 to two, and why they can go from seven to three but not to one.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-11-28,"—I understand Senator Evans's concern that it appears that action would be taken immediately to revoke the approved provider under the present act so you do need to allow a reasonable time for appointments to be made. All of us would like to see the time shortened but, as I mentioned previously, while any time frame is arbitrary, a period of five working days is considered acceptable. As Senator Evans said, in principle it is much shorter than the current 14 days and longer than the proposal of two working days. Likewise, the one-day time limit for the provider to appoint the adviser or administrator, once approved, is just too short. As the actual appointment of a person to work for a provider will be subject to commercial terms, it will be necessary for providers and advisers to complete agreements or contracts, and they should be given a reasonable time to do this. It is thought that three working days is considered more appropriate. I think the essential and crucial point is that the provider status would be revoked under the present agreement.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-28,"—I wish to indicate that we also thought that 14 days was too long a period in which to provide for the appointment of an administrator. We also thought that Labor's proposal of two days was too short a period. That is based on discussions we have had with various people in the industry. I think that five days is arbitrary, just as 14 is arbitrary. But there may be circumstances in which a panel member is decided upon and then there may be subsequent advice about a conflict of interest, or it may be a whole range of issues which might make turning the situation around in two days quite difficult. It was pointed out to me that, particularly in rural areas, finding an appropriate administrator might be a key difficulty and that would be a problem. I think the fact that a sanction comes to bear if this is not done within a two-day period means that it is incumbent on us to consider even those extraordinary situations where two days would be inadequate.
For that reason, the Democrats will support the government amendments. They are a compromise, and I think they are, at the end of the day, quite a reasonable period. We would all hope that an appointment would be made in a very short time frame—and maybe two days will be the norm; however, there are some circumstances where we could imagine that two days would be unnecessarily tight. As I said, the implications of not meeting that appointment requirement within that time are very severe. For that reason, we think that five days is probably a lot better than 14 and that two would probably be problematic. As I have already indicated, we think that one day is adequate for the next phase to take place. We do not agree with the government's request that it be three working days, because that would add up to eight working days, which is very close to 14. So we think that five and one are appropriate periods of time. ",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-28,"—I am disappointed. I do not think the case has been made out. I know that most of these things are arbitrary, and I accept that. But I think we have to ask whether, on balance, we are more concerned about the administrative processes or whether we are more concerned about the care. It seems to me that we are all more concerned about the care, but I think in the government's proposition we give too much consideration to the needs of the bureaucracy. Senator Allison, that is the point I am trying to make. In his answer the minister made the point about working days, but his key point about the loss of the provider status applies whenever we do it, whatever the time frame. I think that is right. If we are going to do what we are going to do, the end result for the provider is the same: it is the question of how long they have in between time. If that is not right, I would be happy to hear.
The reason Labor initiated these amendments was to ensure that we move much more quickly to provide care. When the department and the agency have said there is a severe risk to the health of the residents, to then have this genteel debate about the needs of the bureaucracy and the needs of administrators takes the urgency out of it. There is often a delay from the time the department and the agency get to hear about the complaint. There is already a huge bureaucratic process going on before the agency actually does that risk assessment. I just do not see the need for us to have a lengthy delay. As Senator Allison quite rightly says, the government's proposal of coming back to eight working days is effectively 10 days time, including the intervening weekend. Again, I think that is too long for us to act on the question of the care of residents. We do know from recent history that there are a number of providers that have been totally recalcitrant. They are not interested in providing care. They are not interested in providing proper standards. They are not interested in playing the game. They are a very small minority but they have proved to be totally recalcitrant, and I am sure that departmental officers would testify to that. It seems to me that we need to move much more quickly.
Unless the minister has more to say on this, I am not convinced as to why we should go for the longer delay. I know the Democrats look like taking the middle road. If that is where the numbers fall, that is where the numbers fall. But I would urge them to think about the length of time involved and to make the priority in this our ability—the minister's and the department's—to get proper care to those residents. Quite frankly, I think the bureaucratic hitches that we have talked about are very unimportant in the scheme of things. The industry has certainly said to the minister and to us, to everybody, that it is prepared to make sure that the panel works, that the big providers, the good providers—and there are a whole range of people of goodwill in the industry—are prepared to put themselves forward to be there to assist in making this work. There is a lot of goodwill about that proposition, so I think that we could get enough people of goodwill on the list to make sure that we can overcome regional issues. I am just not convinced by what the minister has said so far that we should again go to an eight-day time frame which, in effect, will be 10 days. I think the argument for the urgent intervention is far stronger than some of these bureaucratic arguments in favour of a longer time frame.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-28,"—It is a bit unfair of Senator Evans to suggest that we are worrying about bureaucracy and not worrying about the care of residents. That is clearly a nonsense. We are interested in getting a smooth operation so that administration can be properly effected so that residents are protected. It is not going to protect any residents if a suitable panel member cannot be appointed within a particular time frame. Senator Evans calls it `bureaucratic problems', but they may be real problems and I do not think that we can dismiss them as readily as that because the sanctions being imposed, if not complied with within two days, as the ALP have proposed in their amendments, are pretty severe.  
I think Senator Evans would agree that we also do not want to see residents tipped out of nursing homes prematurely. So this is trying to find a way that is reasonable rather than giving in to some sort of bureaucratic fiddling. We are talking here about trying to find a process which works—not one which just appeases some bureaucrats somewhere. So, Senator Evans, we all have the interests of the residents at heart. I remind the Senate that we are talking here about a maximum number of days and that these appointments can be done much more quickly than that too. So it is not necessarily the case that they will go the full term, as it were. ",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-11-28,"—I would like to reinforce what Senator Allison said. I know one could be forgiven for having that view from opposition, but when you are on the government side you welcome and appreciate the efforts of the bureaucracy. As I see it, most mistakes are made when the advice of the bureaucracy is ignored—when in government, that is—because it is their responsibility to make sure that due process is carried out. In this case, if a private provider does not appoint an adviser-administrator after one day, that immediately brings in the sanctions—no `by your leave', thank you very much; it is `good-bye'; it is done—and that means relocation of residents. 
I think it is not unreasonable to lengthen that process to five working days. It is for that reason, with the interests of the people who are being cared for predominantly in mind, that this proposal has been put forward. We have accepted, as I said, pulling it back a bit from 14 days to five days. That seems an acceptable outcome insofar as it does put a pretty severe sanction on the provider. They know that within that one working week they have to appoint an adviser-administrator, or else. But 24 hours, I would suggest to Senator Evans, is very difficult. It would be very difficult to get a tradesman in 24 hours and, in this case, you are asking somebody who is providing care for an aged person to get a suitably qualified adviser or administrator appointed within 24 hours—otherwise, it is `bang' and you are done. I just do not think that is reasonable.

	(4)	For the purposes of this section, an individual who is one of the *key personnel of an applicant made under section 8-2 is taken to be of unsound mind if, and only if, a registered medical practitioner has certified that he or she is mentally incapable of performing his or her duties as one of those key personnel.
	(5)	For the purposes of this section, an individual who is one of the *key personnel of an approved provider is taken to be of unsound mind if, and only if, a registered medical practitioner has certified that he or she is mentally incapable of performing his or her duties as one of those key personnel.
This amendment relates to disqualified individuals and to the definition. Insanity is an archaic concept and, unqualified, is lacking in fairness or balance, in our view. This is the reason for our amendment, which talks about unsound mind. Psychiatric illness may prevent a person from being mentally capable of performing his or her duties as one of the key personnel, and a person's capacity to undertake duties as a result of psychiatric care can only be assessed by a medical practitioner. In our view, it is important that we use the right definitions and the right terminology in respect of someone who is declared `disqualified' for this purpose.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-28,"—As I understand it, the Democrat amendment is more than a question of terminology; it seeks to have a registered medical practitioner make that assessment. I share the concern the Democrats are expressing about the way the government has gone about this issue of dealing with key personnel who are of unsound mind, bankrupt or regarded as undesirable persons. There were a lot of submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the bill which raised concern about how all this would work—concern about discrimination issues and administration issues. Labor has suggested an approach which seeks to put this issue into what apparently are called the principles—I did get advice from the Clerk Assistant that `regulations' was the right word, but I am happy to go with `principles'. Effectively making that a principle would mean that the government would have to consult about the whole mechanism of this provision. If it is put into the principles it would also be a disallowable instrument so that if, following that consultation process, there was concern as to how this was to work, the Senate would have the chance to review it.
The advisers to the government when briefing me on the bill did say they were going to have this consultation process about how all of this was going to work. There is a great deal of concern out there in the industry about that—about the practicalities of it and about the difficulties of it. Our approach was to say no-one wants to argue that people of unsound mind ought to be key personnel in nursing homes. I think even Senator Herron would accept I would not argue that! But nevertheless we have to do that in a fair way and an administratively proper way. We propose as an alternative in our later amendment to provide for it to become a principle and for it therefore to be a disallowable instrument. I am not sure whether in that event there is a need to support the Democrat amendment. I think this is getting into the detail of the problem which has been identified and about which I share concern, but to which I am not sure we are in a position to properly contribute today. I think it does need a consultation process with industry. It does need agreement about how it is all to operate. In a sense, I almost got the feeling that this amendment was the first step down in trying to solve the problem that we have identified. We are looking at an alternative approach which basically says we do not need to get into trying to do it in the Senate here and now.
So my inclination is not to support that amendment, in favour of the alternative approach. But I am interested to hear from the government. I understand they are now looking to amend that, which I assume means they are going to support the general approach. If that is the case, I would be inclined not to support the Democrat amendment unless I heard reasons why we need both approaches. At the moment I would have thought that deals with the whole issue in another way, but I am open to argument on it. 
Amendment agreed to.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-28,"—By way of preface, if the minister is going to vote for these amendments, I think he ought to tell me, and then I won't bother arguing the case. I have no idea. I might point out, Minister, that I think it is helpful for the record if people know why the government is supporting those things. I do make the point that I think it is important for the record that people understand. I do not understand why on earth you supported that and I am sure people would want to know why, and I think it would be useful for you to put that on the record.
—That says a lot for your case!
—It was not my case. It was a Democrat amendment. But from the government's point of view I think people need to know why it is you are voting for or against it. I think we all have a bit of an obligation there and I just do not understand. Maybe when you speak next you might explain it, because I think it is important. I do not understand, and it may well be worth your while. I am not arguing with it; I just do not understand quite why the government adopted that one. I have put the argument for the approach we adopted in formally moving this amendment. I seek leave to move opposition amendments (2) and (3) together.
Leave granted.

This is the device whereby we make this question about unsuitable key personnel a regulation or principle, and therefore make it also a disallowable instrument. I think I made the case for it before. I think it is a useful way of resolving some of the concern. Everyone supports the general principle, but it is a way of us dealing with the administrative issues and dealing with the concern in the industry.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-11-28,"—Senator Evans asked what the government's position was on that. We accepted the Democrats' argument that it defined it a bit better.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-11-28,"—The ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000, which we are dealing with tonight, provides for the administrative framework under which transitional assistance may be given to the automotive industry in relation to the altered tariff regime. The amendments to this regime are, I understand, supported by the industry and provide for necessary improvements which have come to light in the course of setting up the administrative framework for the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, ACIS. The bill is the result of a long and hard fought campaign by industry, supported by the Labor opposition, led by a former shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham, Mr Crean, to provide assistance to this industry. The bill is in broad alignment with the thrust of the ALP's position on tariffs and helping to improve Australian industry competitiveness in an increasingly globalised economy. Labor will not be opposing the legislation; however, we have one amendment, which I will speak about shortly. 
The bill does not provide for the necessary review of the effect that tariff reductions may have on Australia's automotive industry. This Liberal-National government, it seems, is content to leave the industry in the lurch for the next few years. It will reduce certainty to the industry. It could provide much needed certainty by giving the industry an opportunity to put its case prior to 1 January 2005. 
This situation has parallels with the public inquiry into the Liberal-National proposal to sell off one of Australia's most valuable and profitable government enterprises, Telstra. Until the internal dissent between the Liberal and National parties—the National Party, of course, being the doormat of this coalition—was publicly aired recently, and seen to be a threat to the government, which relies on the National Party for its majority, there would have been no Besley inquiry. The coalition would have just gone on full steam ahead with its ideologically driven commitment to privatise the remainder of Telstra, regardless of both the cost to the people in rural and regional Australia and the cost to budget. There is no doubt, even amongst the National Party, the much trampled on junior member of the coalition, that the Besley inquiry and its important findings would not have eventuated without, at least in part, National Party agitation and the concerns expressed by the Labor Party. Surely this parliament will not trust this government to have an inquiry just because it says that it will or it can. The Australian public is rightly suspicious of this government's promise, and the parliament should be too.
The only way to ensure that an independent public inquiry will occur is for it to be included within the provisions of this bill, and that is why the Labor opposition will be moving a second reading amendment to the legislation this evening. Labor is moving the amendment to address what we regard as the unworkable circumstance created by the Liberal-National government. The government has proposed an inquiry into the automotive industry and the possible impact of a tariff reduction some time in 2005. That is too late. The tariff reduction will have already occurred on 1 January 2005. The government position on this has been made very clear by the cabinet from the outset. At the third dot point of a joint statement dated 5 June 1997, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the then minister for industry said, `There will be a review in 2005.'
What we have been saying from the outset of this proposed scheme is that it is inappropriate to have the review so late. Commonsense dictates that the review must occur before the tariff cuts take place. When Labor raised this point in the House of Representatives, the government gave an entirely unsatisfactory response. It said that it did not need an amendment about an inquiry because it might have an inquiry anyway. That is not good enough. There is no certainty in this approach. It is simply a sign of either laziness or incompetent administration by the Liberal-National government. Under such an approach we do not actually know that the government will ever hold an inquiry. Therefore, there is almost no certainty about an inquiry occurring at all. Further, there is no guarantee that parliament would ever receive a report from any inquiry that did occur. 
The government's attitude is simply to refuse to allow the industry and the community in general to offer their opinion on the question of automotive tariffs. Under the current scheme there is no guarantee that the public would ever get a chance to make submissions, that the inquiry would be held publicly in an open and transparent way, or that a report flowing from the inquiry would be released. Similarly, there is no guarantee that the affected communities from this very important, regionally based industry would get a chance to make submissions. I include there state governments, particularly those of South Australia and Victoria. 
This is why Labor thinks that a more reasonable approach is to legislate for a formal inquiry to be incorporated in the bill being debated before the Senate this evening. We will seek to amend the bill to the extent that it requires that an inquiry be held at a time before the tariff changes take place. This will allow all participants in the car industry to be certain they will have the opportunity to put their views to parliament before a decision is made on any subsequent tariff changes. If this does not happen, it is simply not possible to know what is going to follow these transitional arrangements, and, if change does occur, precisely how the transitional arrangements are going to operate beyond the year 2005.
We do not want $2 billion of support to potentially become, after just five years, zero support—and that is exactly what the government are asking parliament to vote for at the moment. That is an unreasonable proposition. The amendment we are proposing is one that the government could accept, but they are being particularly pig-headed. Their negative response to our proposed amendment in the past has been simply a symptom of their `if we didn't write it, then we are not going to accept it' attitude. The government are hoping that everyone will forget that ACIS was not an initiative of the current minister but is an overhang from an initiative announced by the former minister in response to a long, active and ultimately successful campaign by the industry, with the support of the Labor Party.
Simply because the Labor Party are proposing this very reasonable amendment, the government are now saying, `We do not need anything in this bill about an inquiry. The government might have one, we might not, but either way we will tell you about it at the time. The form of it, if we do have one, will be a form that we will decide on when we are good and ready.' This is a dangerous attitude for the government to take. I might also point out that the Labor Party, if we win government at the end of next year, will also be bound by this provision. That is important to note as well.
Let me make this point in closing: when, at the next election, there is a change of government, there will be an inquiry into this issue and it will be a public inquiry. The parliament, and in particular senators in this place, will have the opportunity during this debate to ensure that, irrespective of whether there is a change of government or not, that inquiry takes place for the good of Australia's automotive industry and for the people who work within it.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-28,"—The Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, or ACIS, bills came to the Senate in October last year. On that occasion, the Australian Democrats welcomed the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000 and the ensuing five-year scheme to assist our domestic automotive industry to become more internationally competitive by encouraging production, investment, and research and development. The scheme has come about as a result of at least the last three years of consultation with industry. The timing of the passage of this legislation is particularly welcomed in a global car industry environment of mergers, acquisitions and spectacular losses. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries have indicated their full support for the bill and believe that any refinements that may be necessary can be achieved in the regulations.
Nevertheless, last year I did raise a number of concerns. The main concern was that the government continues to label the proposed new scheme as `transitional'. It is clear that the question will arise as to whether the scheme itself should continue beyond the end of the year 2005. This is particularly important because, to achieve the APEC target of free trade by the year 2010, the tariff wind-down program for the automobile industry initiative must surely continue beyond 2005 and up to 2010. While the government has given a commitment to review the ACIS bills in 2005, there must be pressure expected from the industry to extend the assistance program as a trade-off for further tariff cuts. 
On that matter I understand, as Senator Sherry has already indicated, that the opposition will again move an amendment, the effect of which will be to require that the review commence by 1 July 2003, which will, amongst other things, consider the appropriate rates of customs duty to apply from 1 January 2005. As I said last year, the Australian Democrats could see sense in the approach being proposed by the ALP and we were happy to give support to that amendment. More than one year later, with a new scheme about to commence in a little over a month's time, the important issue now is to seek a commitment from the government that it will in fact undertake a review at an appropriate time to ensure, as Senator Minchin would no doubt put it, that certainty and security are provided to our automotive industry; that the industry, which has been consulted, is satisfied that a review will occur; and that Australian consumers receive the flow-on benefits of a productive, world competitive and viable automotive industry.
Senator Sherry would no doubt agree that, in essence, the reforms are largely the result of the Button plan, and they have been about improving the overall competitiveness of the automotive industry by focusing on the reduction of tariffs, improving productivity, increasing total vehicle sales, increasing exports and increasing our market access in overseas destinations. What is also essential in the reform process is to ensure that the outlook for the industry allows future investment, that it provides home-grown jobs, that research and development initiatives are put in place and supported, and that there is local support for local industry.
I met yesterday with Mr Peter Sturrock of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. It is clear that, while there have been difficulties in adjusting to a tariff wind-down regime, they are supportive of this bill. Industry agreed plans for this matter include support for the tariff reduction regime falling to 10 per cent in 2005; commercial vehicles remaining at the current five per cent duty; the Export Facilitation Scheme ceasing this year; ACIS running from 2001 to 2005, with $2 billion being available to industry to reward investment and research and development; support for the strategy to pursue market access overseas; and, more significantly, a next car plan review being done in 2002 or perhaps 2003 for the post-2005 period.
The question of the review is clearly essential from the point of view of the FCAI. What is in dispute is whether a review should be given as a legislative guarantee, or by regulation or administrative policy. The FCAI have strongly indicated their preference for the latter so as not to disturb the agreed outcome. They are further satisfied that a review at an appropriate time is inevitable, pending further discussions and negotiations between industry and the government of the day. So I am satisfied that a review will inevitably occur at an appropriate time prior to the end of ACIS in 2005.
Given the need for this scheme to commence on 1 January next year, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the opposition's amendment on this second occasion. However, I do foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment calling upon the government to give an undertaking that a review of ACIS will be conducted within a reasonable time frame but not less than 12 months before ACIS ceases in 2005.
It is certainly the Democrats' hope that the passage of the ACIS bill will enable Australian automotive manufacturers to build upon success stories so far, and I think they do need to be put on the record. There are success stories such as the export of 100,000 Toyota Camrys to the Gulf and Middle East region from the Altona plant in Victoria. General Motors-Holden have also identified the Middle East as an export market suitable for expansion and have exported 30,000 Commodores there in the past year alone. Mitsubishi have exported 15,000 vehicles to the USA over the past 12 months, which it claims are worth some half a billion dollars in exports. That provides much needed employment in its two Adelaide plants and of course the many Australian component manufacturers in both South Australia and Victoria. I am told that the decision to proceed with the production of Toyota's new Avalon range in Australia was made partly in anticipation of the introduction of this legislation and that overall it is anticipated that new investment in the order of $4 billion may be realised by 2005 under the scheme. 
The latest range of Australian built cars offer extraordinarily good value for money, and it will hopefully not be too long before the rest of the world realises this and we secure a healthy future for the industry in Australia. I think it is also important that we continue to design and build vehicles suited to Australian conditions. Our vehicles are currently being built to cope with a range of conditions that make them suitable for export to virtually every continent, and our workers are acknowledged as being capable of producing cars with exceptional build quality and value for money. There is no denying that the build quality of Australian vehicles has improved considerably in the past few years and that we are capable of manufacturing some truly world-class vehicles that offer exceptional value for money. Australian technology has been showcased with international exhibitions of our capabilities—concept cars such as aXessaustralia, although I acknowledge the recent announcements about that particular company being taken over by a multinational. The Ecommodore is another example. It is to be hoped that the further development of such concept cars will extend to the production stage. This has been a project that Australians can be very proud of.
It seems far more sensible to me that we go down the path of developing vehicles with the sort of performance consumers need, rather than have the motoring press herald the arrival of 250 or 300 kilowatt V8 supercars that the average motorist will never fully utilise legally. From the Democrats' perspective, car manufacturers are sitting on the answer to fuel efficiency, and it is to be hoped that fuel cell powered, hydrogen powered and other alternatively powered vehicles will be developed, built and exported from Australia around the world. Australian industry should be leading the way in the development of such vehicles. There is no doubt that if clean green cars can be built and sold at the right price, people will choose to buy and drive them. It is to be hoped that this legislation will aid in the birth of such `new age' cars and componentry as part of the Australian manufacturing industry.
The Australian Democrats support the bill and trust that Australian car manufacturers will see the future, grasp the opportunity and develop a worldwide reputation for building innovative, fuel efficient vehicles domestically and, more importantly, for export. Finally, the second reading amendment on sheet 2047 has been circulated in my name and I ask that it be dealt with at the appropriate time. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		""but the Senate calls on the Government to give an undertaking that a review of the ACIS Scheme will be conducted within a reasonable timeframe, but not less than 12 months, before the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme ceases in 2005"".",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2000-11-28,"—Can I briefly respond by thanking the opposition and the Democrats for their support for the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000, which I regret it was necessary to bring on, but we did uncover a technical amendment that needed to be made to ensure the integrity of the scheme and its proper and effective delivery. I regret it because it has meant that we have revived what I think is a quite silly and semantic debate which we had over a year ago where the proposition being advanced by the ALP again tonight was debated and defeated. I think it is really quite silly and churlish to do it all over again on the eve of the scheme coming into effect. We said then that of course we had already committed to a review. To get into a semantic argument about the timing of the review seemed quite silly.  
I think it is critical that the industry has the certainty of knowing that the tariff will remain at 15 per cent for the next five years but that it will drop to 10 per cent in 2005. The government has said from the outset that the basis for taxpayers and the government forgoing revenue of some $2 billion over the next five years to ensure that this industry does invest in the latest technology and R&D is to make sure that it is ready to be as competitive as will be required when the tariff drops to 10 per cent. Others have spoken about the tremendous improvement in the quality of Australian cars, and I add my name to that. But the industry admitted that is clearly a function of the fact that tariffs have dropped, initiated by the opposition when it was in government, and for the industry to have to be more competitive and to produce more competitive and better built automobiles. They have responded to the challenge and done it very well. 
The trouble with where the opposition in particular is coming from is that it leaves open the possibility that somehow that tariff commitment of 10 per cent in 2005 may not happen. I think that is the worst signal to send. The scheme is premised on helping the industry to prepare for that tariff cut in 2005. There will be a question for the government of the day to decide whether or not there is a case for this particular scheme or a variant of it continuing beyond 2005. We have indicated that there should be a review to determine that question, and that will be a matter for the government of the day. What I find extraordinary about the ALP's position is that it is so defeatist and so admitting of the probability that they are not going to be in government that they want to enshrine it in legislation. We are happy to accept their view that we are more than likely to be still in government at that time, but it does seem to me quite defeatist and really quite silly to be putting something like a review into legislation.
But I am very appreciative of the Democrats agreeing that what is necessary is to ensure that there is no hold-up in this scheme coming into effect and that they are prepared to move their proposition as a second reading amendment and not seek to amend the bill itself. I indicate now that the government has no objection to the second reading amendment proposed by Senator Ridgeway.

I apologise to the chamber for our part in that. Perhaps we might make a start and play it by ear as those other amendments are moved. I see the first set on the running sheet are the government amendments. The set of amendments recently circulated on behalf of the government seem to be purely about the start-up date, which I think relates to the supplementary explanatory memoranda. That will still leave us with the problem about a running sheet. I am not sure how we are going to resolve that problem. As the second set of government amendments seem to be purely about changing the operative date, I am sure that will be just one debate and will not add too much confusion. I am sure the minister will move those cognately.

—That will not cause a problem. As the opposition amendments will not be on the running sheet, I am not sure whether I ought to try to jump as we go through or whether the clerks have some capacity to combine them on the running sheet. The government's amendments—
—Relate to clause 2—
—Of schedule 1, whereas my first amendments relate to schedule 1, item 12.
—Yours are on page 9; the government's are on page 1. They relate to the three schedules.
—I think it would be helpful if the government start with theirs and we will pick it up as we go.
—Progress could be reported and we could come back to this matter after we have dealt with something else. This situation is less than satisfactory. Senator Bartlett, do you have some words of wisdom?",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-28,"—This is obviously an issue for the government and the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. As you just said, Madam Chair, this situation is less than satisfactory. That is not a criticism. I recognise that there are circumstances that could lead to any of us bringing things in at the last second—I would not want to criticise others because I am sure at some stage in the future I will be in that situation myself—even though we obviously try to avoid dropping things in at the last minute. As we have said many times before, particularly with respect to social security legislation, it really does present a difficulty if we are unsure about what we are doing and in what order we are doing it. It is technical legislation. It is a technical act. This particular bill, the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Debt Recovery) Bill 2000, deals with some specifically technical matters. I think it would be desirable to move to report progress, but I am not going to do so unless there is some indication that the government is fine with bringing on the next item. I personally think it would be helpful to move to report progress, but I think that would be better for the government or perhaps the opposition to do because they would need to be sure that they could move on to another item. 
As I think all of us have said at different times in this place, it is dangerous to deal with amendments on the run and when we are unsure about the order. As I read things, without anticipating debate and statements people are going to make on this legislation, this is not a situation where everybody knows how everyone is going to vote on everything. It is yet to be unfolded what amendments, if any, will be agreed to. In such a dynamic situation, if you like, it is particularly dangerous to be flying blind. To do so would probably mean that we would stuff it up somewhere along the way and have to come back and fix it up anyway. So it would take more time in the long run. Unless everything has become clear in the last minute, I would suggest that it may be highly desirable to report progress, look at all things and come back clear and fresh at 9.30 in the morning. We could probably sail through it reasonably quickly. It is certainly not the Democrats' intention to take a lot of time on this bill. I have about 35 amendments circulated in my name on behalf of the Democrats, and some of those are in groups. Whilst the amendments are technical, the issues are not overly complex and it should not take a lot of time. It would probably take us twice as long if we dealt with the amendments now, and possibly twice as long again because we would probably stuff it up, because we would have to figure out what we are doing as we go along. That is always undesirable.  
As I have also said in this place many times before, it is important to keep reminding ourselves that, apart from being parliamentarians, we are also legislators. We are making laws. This is a law making process. The laws affect the Australian community, particularly if you are talking about social security laws. This particular bill potentially affects hundreds of thousands of people in the Australian community each year. We want to make sure that we know what we are doing and that the will of the Senate and the parliament prevails. I think the best way to do that would be to be totally clear about what is going on rather than to do it by the seat of our pants. Having said that, I do know that the government has to find other legislation to be brought on. If nothing else, my outlining this situation a little bit more clearly might have provided a bit more time to decide the best way to go. My personal preference would be that we report progress and move on to something else. But, clearly, that is a decision for the chamber as a whole. I would rather take the government's lead on where to go in that regard.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-28,"—I think we are all in the same boat. I recognise that there are always reasons why people end up with late amendments. The government also brought in some late amendments, but we were not planning to circulate them straight away because we did not know whether they would even be required. However, I understand that the opposition amendments were not received by you, Madam Chair, until we received them in the chamber. I think for everybody's sake we should accept Senator Bartlett's suggestion that I should move to report progress.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-11-28,"—The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 2000 has a brief history which I will outline for the record. I will refer to a public hearing and the findings of a Senate committee inquiry into this bill and to additional comments by Labor senators arising out of that bill. I will then briefly refer to the second reading amendment that the opposition has circulated and will speak to in due course.
This bill, in a different form, first came to the House around this time late last year as the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999. At that stage, both the government and the opposition regarded the bill as relatively non-contentious, and there was not major opposition to the passage of the majority of the content of the bill. Some time immediately prior to the bill being introduced into the House, there were some further negotiations—with Senator Alston on behalf of the government, and Mr Smith on behalf of the opposition. In those discussions, the opposition put it to the government that a section of the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 should be deleted and considered in the New Year when the parliament resumed. Labor put it to the government that, on the provision of international communications, the appropriate minister—whether it be the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts or the Minister for Foreign Affairs—should be granted power under the act to appropriate licences or, as we put it, matters of substance worthy of serious and considered deliberation. My understanding was the government was not overly happy at that stage to separate those particular provisions in the bill but agreed to do so in the negotiation process. 
When parliament resumed earlier this year, the matter was referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for consideration of the content of the outstanding matters. Senators Hogg and Schacht are members of that committee on behalf of the opposition, and they attended the hearings and participated in the deliberations. They made a brief additional statement at the conclusion of the report of the committee—which was lengthy; some 20-odd pages—and they made the point, by way of introduction, that the opposition members of the committee agreed with the report of the committee insofar as it goes. There was only one issue on which opposition members could not agree with other members of the committee—those other members being government members—and that was the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
A significant number of submissions were made to the Senate inquiry, and they are listed in Appendix 1. I will not bother to read them. They did raise an issue of some consequence, a matter which the opposition has held to at that time. That question, reduced to basics, was whether it was appropriate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the minister for communications to decide whether a particular international broadcasting service, or an application for an international broadcasting service, was contrary to the national interest in respect of international relations. So the two key areas are: who should have control of this agenda in Australia—the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the minister for communications; secondly—the guiding test, if you like—whether considerations of national interest were paramount in the issuing of a licence, the withdrawal of a licence or attaching conditions to the issuance of a licence.
As I recall the discussions at the committee and the position of the government and the department as given in evidence before the committee—and I understand it is their position now—it is without precedent for a government minister with essentially domestic responsibilities, that is, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, to be involved in consideration of international or foreign affairs matters which are part and parcel of the issuing or withdrawing of licences to broadcast into and out of this country. The government held steadfastly to that position. They were of the view that it was appropriately reserved for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 
The opposition have given this matter some consideration, and we hold to our arguments; that is, it is appropriate for the minister for communications to be the decision maker in this light. I suppose that if a contentious matter came across the desk of the relevant minister, he or she would, as a matter of caution and a matter of courtesy, consult with his or her colleagues as to the desired outcome. But in the government's preferred model, whilst it would be unprofessional not to consult with colleagues on a contentious matter, the government's final decision maker in this matter is the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The opposition is of the view that there should be a two-stage process: firstly, that the minister for communications is required to consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and, secondly, that the final decision is made by the minister for communications. In that context, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs were concerned about a particular international broadcast, he or she could take the initiative and advise the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to take appropriate action.  
We take the view that, in this contentious area—and we only have to examine the amount of involvement the current government has had to have in trade, defence and foreign affairs matters, particularly in the last two years—it is not to be unexpected that any range of foreign governments might take the opportunity, in the course of negotiations, to attempt to put pressure on, or bring about a particular result from, the Minister for Foreign Affairs which does not reflect the broader, long-term national interests of this country. In that respect, the opposition is of the view that that decision, as it relates to broadcasting in and out of this country, is appropriately made by the minister for communications.
It is our view that if decisions in respect of the national interest under the Broadcasting Services Act were the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, it would place the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a better position to handle pressure which might be applied in particular circumstances by foreign governments. That is the rationale for our overall policy approach in this area. This is primarily and substantially a broadcasting matter. It relates to broadcasts in and out of Australia to both commercial and government enterprises. We are of the view that it is appropriate for the government minister of the day to consult with cabinet colleagues when a particularly contentious matter arises for a decision. But because the application relates to broadcasting, it is appropriately within the purview of the minister for communications. In no way do we want this to be portrayed as an attack on the current government or on the carrying out of these sorts of affairs of state by either the current Minister for Foreign Affairs or the current minister for communications. We offer no criticism, at this stage, of the conduct of those portfolios; we simply draw attention to the changing nature of the region and the increasing pressures in trade, defence and diplomatic areas. 
We think it is appropriate, upon mature consideration, for an essentially domestic issue to be reserved for the minister for communications. We will move amendments in due course to give effect to that. They will require that the minister for communications consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that the power for the issuing of licences be given to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
We will also be moving a second reading amendment in due course. That second reading amendment will state that, whilst not declining to give this bill a second reading, the Senate, recognising the key role played by Radio Australia as our public international broadcaster in explaining Australia's national values to the world, and in particular encouraging closer ties with our Asian and South Pacific neighbours, as well as serving the needs of Australians abroad: (1) notes that the Howard government's funding cuts to our national public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, have caused significant adverse funding cuts to Radio Australia; (2) notes that these adverse cuts have only been partially restored by the government's recent decision to provide Radio Australia with an additional $9 million over three years; (3) notes that the Howard government's decision to lease the Cox Peninsula transmitter facility has resulted in a severe diminution of Radio Australia's transmission capacity and ability to reach audiences in Asia; (4) notes that this capacity will only be partially restored even if Radio Australia can successfully negotiate transmission capacity from the Cox Peninsula transmitter facility from the current leaseholders; (5) condemns the Howard government for this reduction in public funding and transmission capacity for Radio Australia; and (6) calls upon the government to maximise Radio Australia's capacity to communicate with our Asian and South Pacific neighbours and for the enhancement of its international broadcasting capacity; (7) expresses its concern that the bill makes the Minister for Foreign Affairs and not the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts responsible for deciding whether an application for an international broadcasting licence or whether an international broadcasting service is contrary to the national interest; and (8) calls upon the government to amend the bill to provide for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to advise the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on whether an application for an international broadcasting service is contrary to the national interest. 
 (Senator Murphy)—Before you proceed further, Senator Bishop, the amendment that I have before me contains only six clauses. Have we got an upgraded model?
—I can advise the chamber that paragraphs (7) and (8) that I referred to have now disappeared off the ledger, so to speak. To clear the record, we are confined to paragraphs (a) to (f)—not paragraphs (1) to (6), as I said. 
—And I assume you will move that amendment before you sit down.
—I will move that amendment shortly, prior to sitting down. Thank you for your assistance.
—And the first three letters are ABC!
—Thank you for yours, too. This amendment really does transverse an issue that has been the subject of some discussion in this chamber and in the House of Representatives for the best part of the last three or four years. It addresses an issue that has been the subject of widespread alarm in the community and it addresses an issue which has been the subject of copious amounts of correspondence—certainly to my office and, I presume, to the offices of other senators, particularly those involved in this debate. It goes to the role of the transmitter facility on Cox Peninsula in Australia and to the desire and the ability of our country to broadcast messages into East Asia, South Asia and across to the Pacific Islands. 
The opposition takes a very simple view on this issue. We take the view that we are a major player in this region. We have a long tradition of arguing for democracy and human rights and for the establishment and maintenance of market based economies. We say, without reservation, that they are positive things. In this area there are lots of regimes known to us which do not subscribe to those sorts of values or to the integrities inherent in those sorts of values to the extent that governments of either major party in this country do. We say that those values are absolutes and are worthy of discussion, are worthy of persuasion and are worthy of articulation in the community of East Asia, South Asia and the Pacific Islands. We say that a well-funded Radio Australia, preferably with access to its own facilities, but, if not with access to its own facilities, with access to sufficient finance to arrange its own facilities, is something that is of critical importance to the future of this country. We have repeatedly said that in the House. I recall that within the last month or so there was a rather lengthy debate in this chamber one Thursday afternoon on the future of Radio Australia.
We have had no cause to revise our criticisms of the government over the last few years on this issue. We think it was a poor step, a retrograde step, and a step taken without adequate planning for the future when the budget of Radio Australia was cut. Again it was a poor step and a step taken without adequate foresight when the Cox facility was sold off to another competitor broadcaster. We think both of those decisions of government were poor and, in due course, if we are elected into government next year, we intend to remedy both of those deficiencies. 
I recall last week at estimates questioning the ABC representatives on the future of Radio Australia and the recently concluded negotiations whereby the ABC was given an extra $9 million or $11 million for three years to try to overcome some of the difficulties that organisation had come into consequent upon, and relating to, the cuts inflicted on its funding by the current government. The representatives of the ABC were trying to avoid the issue but, when pinned down, they made the point that even with the extra $9 million or $11 million over three years they went nowhere close to restoring the funding position they had when the cuts were first visited upon them, that their range of programs had diminished as a consequence and would not be restored to the levels that were extant when the cuts were imposed upon that organisation and that the volume of broadcasting hours, whilst it would be increased—and that was a welcome step—would not again be restored to the levels that were present when those cuts were imposed upon ABC by the current government. 
We do, as I said, take the view that, in this rapidly changing world where there are great pressures being imposed upon this country for access to our markets, where there are indeed great pressures being placed upon this government—and possibly ourselves in the future—to adopt attitudes that are more compliant to the dictates of major powers in this area, it is incumbent upon the Australian government of the day to act responsibly, to have regard to the long-term interests of this country and, in carrying out that obligation which governments freely choose to adopt, to have regard to those earlier features of our system of government that operates in this country. We are strongly of the view that a government should have the ability to send out its message on issues in the region, whether it be on East Timor, on Bougainville, on developments in Vietnam or on developments in the Pacific Islands, in particular Fiji, to neighbouring countries and their citizens. Our government does, and should have, a perspective on those issues. Radio Australia is critical to putting those views out into the wider community of nations that are to the north of our continent. Radio Australia, while certainly not an arm of government—it is an independent agency but is funded by the state—does have that critical role to present the views of this country and the government of the day. Before I sit down, Mr Acting Deputy President, with your indulgence, I move:
At the end of the motion add:
		""but the Senate, recognising the key role played by Radio Australia as our public international broadcaster in explaining Australia's national values to the world, and in particular encouraging closer ties with our Asian and South Pacific neighbours, as well as serving the needs of Australians abroad:
	(a)	notes that the Howard Government's funding cuts to our national public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, have caused significant adverse funding cuts to Radio Australia;
	(b)	notes that these adverse cuts have only been partially restored by the Government's recent decision to provide Radio Australia with an additional $9 million over 3 years;
	(c)	notes that the Howard Government's decision to lease the Cox Peninsula transmitter facility has resulted in a severe diminution of Radio Australia's transmission capacity and ability to reach audiences in Asia;
	(d)	notes that this capacity will only be partially restored even if Radio Australia can successfully negotiate transmission capacity from the Cox Peninsula transmitter facility from the current lease holders;
	(e)	condemns the Howard Government for this reduction in public funding and transmission capacity for Radio Australia; and

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-11-28,"—As we know, the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 2000 is designed to establish a new licence regime for international broadcasting services transmitted from Australia. The bill provides for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to determine whether the granting of an international broadcasting licence is in the national interest. Importantly, the bill provides an exemption for services broadcast by the two national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS. Radio Australia is included in this framework. There has been no regulatory regime for international broadcasts in the past because governments have never seen a need for the introduction of such a regulatory regime. The two international broadcasts from Australia into the region and other parts of the world were both ABC broadcasts, delivered via short-wave radio on Radio Australia and via television on Australian Television International which, of course, has most recently been operated by Channel 7. We know that the government is currently assessing submissions for the granting of a licence to continue the Australia Television service to the Asia-Pacific region and is seeking an editorially independent Australian television presence in the region projecting accurate images and perceptions of Australia. 
To provide this service the government is also considering providing funding assistance for both programming and transmission. I make this point because of the absurdity that the government is considering subsidising a commercial broadcast service into the region when it has cut the same size subsidy from the ABC. Funding cuts forced the ABC to cut back drastically on the funding of all its services, its international broadcasting services included. It is a pity the government was not so generous when the ABC ran the Australia Television service. In accordance with its act and with other legislation, the ABC provided editorially independent news and current affairs, and a general programming service. But of course anything run by ABC or operated by the ABC is, in the eyes of this government, inherently unworthy.
This is not to say that other providers of an Australian television service cannot provide a good service. Imparja Television is just one tenderer. But I do believe that the loss of the ABC operated Australia Television service was a huge loss to Australia and to the region. The government's vicious cuts to the ABC in the 1996-97 budget substantially weakened the ABC's ability to provide the high level and full range of international broadcasting services that it once did. At the time that Mr Mansfield recommended the cessation of the ABC's international broadcasting services, all of them—not that he was asked to recommend whether they should keep going or not but he did recommend that anyway—the government mothballed the state-of-the-art short-wave transmission facility at Cox Peninsula. There has never been an adequate explanation for the closure of that facility. That can only lead us to conclude that it was merely to save the government money. I have heard a couple of amounts of how much it would have cost to keep Cox Peninsula operating: $1.6 million per annum is one figure, the one I have heard most. That $1.6 million per annum would be the cost to have the Cox Peninsula transmitter fully operational again and for Radio Australia to regain its full voice to the region. In some areas of Sydney, of course, $1.6 million would not even buy you a house. For this relatively ridiculous amount of money, the government refused to reopen the Cox Peninsula facility, at least for Radio Australia. They were happy for it to be sold off and to be operated by somebody else, but Radio Australia could not have that facility.
Recently the government announced that it had leased the land and sold the equipment to an international broadcaster unlicensed in Australia. This is partially the reason for this legislation, of course. Having sold this desperately needed equipment to a foreign broadcaster, it had to somehow provide a proper regime under which the sale could be justified and the broadcaster allowed to operate from Australia. The Democrats understand the price the government received from the sale of the Cox Peninsula transmitter—and this is only a rumour, I have to say; nobody has said what the sale amounts to but it is rumoured—to be about $2 million. I noticed that one of the opposition speakers in the other place nominated an amount of $2½ million. I hope it is that little bit more, laughable amount as it is. I recall that the last upgrade to the transmitter was something like $20 million. To sell it for that amount truly has to be the worst case of economic mismanagement of public funds that anybody has ever seen. This figure is even worse if you take into account the depreciation of the asset. Such a valuable asset sold off so cheaply—valuable both in terms of need for having the service into the region and in terms of money!
I would like to comment briefly on the definition of `the national interest' in the bill. The Senate committee, which I was on, heard that it is not possible to define precisely what sort of broadcast would be in the national interest or would be likely to be contrary to the national interest. However, some broadcasting services are more likely to be contrary than others. For example, hostile broadcasters promoting communal violence or terrorism on a foreign state or inciting or promoting or encouraging armed hostilities or the violent overthrow of an established government would likely be viewed as contrary to Australia's national interests. Likewise, broadcasts which demean persons or groups on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual preference, religion, or mental or physical disability would also be likely to be unacceptable. Of course there are issues for the minister to take into consideration, but it would be unlikely that a potential broadcaster would make it clear that this was going to be the content or the intent of its broadcast content. Some content may be less than obvious and much more insidious. 
Thankfully, the government has agreed to amend the bill in accordance with the concerns voiced by the Senate committee and, as Senator Bishop said, that was all members of the Senate committee including the government ones. The minister will now table the reasons given for not providing an international broadcasting licence to an international broadcasting licence aspirant, and the applicant can appeal the decision. To a point at least, this provides some transparency in the process. I am also pleased that ABC and SBS services delivered in accordance with their charters will be exempt from having to apply for an international broadcasting licence. On the issue of the opposition's second reading amendment, I can indicate now that we will be supporting that amendment, particularly because it is so strong on the funding and importance of Radio Australia. I hope that the strong language of support used by the opposition in this motion about Radio Australia means that they will be willing to support my `must carry' amendment which I am going to be moving in the committee stage.
While I am on my feet, I will just say a few things about that amendment. The amendment would mean that an international broadcaster with the capacity to broadcast more than three short-wave signals at once would be required to provide space to the ABC for the purposes of Radio Australia broadcasts. The amendment also provides that the licence holder would be paid an appropriate fee. Of course, we do not want to fall foul of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, so that would cover us for that. The passing of the proposed amendment would ensure that Radio Australia would be broadcast from the Cox Peninsula transmission facility, going at least some way to restoring the service lost following the budget cuts of four years ago. We should not forget, as well, that international broadcasting services covered by this bill may not be Australian services; Australian broadcasters may not provide the content.
In closing, I indicate that the Democrats are supporting this bill because we believe that the provision of an international broadcasting service from Australia into the region should be licensed and should be approved in order that such broadcasts are not contrary to the national interest. The Democrats are concerned that such services used to be provided by the ABC without fear of their ever contravening the national interest and in the knowledge that such services were provided most economically. We continue to be concerned that these services may not deliver the same level or type of content as the past ABC services. That would be a huge loss to Australia, and we continue to urge the government to properly fund the ABC, not just for their domestic service but for their international service, a service that has been acknowledged around the world and particularly in our region as being one of the best in the world, and a service that this government has consistently tried to get rid of.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Campbell, Senator Ian",LP,2000-11-28,"—The amendment moved by Senator Bishop is known in the trade as a pious amendment—in this case, it is incredibly pious. What the amendment is doing is condemning the government for taking a range of decisions based on Radio Australia and particularly the Cox Peninsula. I think it is important to understand that, when cuts to government expenditure had to be made four years ago when the coalition government was elected, the Australian Labor Party did not support one of those cuts. They opposed, tooth and nail, every single cut to government expenditure that has been made by the coalition government. They are in some sort of denial about the deficits they left. The $10 billion deficit that was left in the final financial year by the Keating-Beazley government gained a lot of prominence—we talked about the black hole that was called Beazley's bankcard, and it got a lot of publicity at the time. But what a lot of people do not understand is that the $10 billion in the last year was only one of about five deficits of that order in as many years and that they ran serial deficits of more than $10 billion. 
Why I relate this to Radio Australia and the Cox Peninsula is that it is very easy when you are the opposition to criticise a government that is trying to take a budget out of serial serious deficits—$10 billion a year, year on year on year—which are forcing the Commonwealth to borrow. But it is the taxpayers of today and of tomorrow who have to pay back the interest—and we were paying to the banks, foreign lenders, something like $10 billion a year just in interest, close to the entire defence budget, close to the entire education budget in Australia. This government made a decision that you cannot maintain your independence in the world, you cannot maintain living standards for the citizens of Australia if your fundamental economy is based on borrowing $10 billion every year, if you are basically spending $10 billion a year more than you are earning. So we had to go about making a whole range of cuts. It is easy for an opposition, especially an opposition that has run such a loose economy, that has mismanaged the economy, that has run interest rates that have been up to 30 per cent for small businesses at times, that has had unemployment rates that are high, inflation rates that are high—basically a range of economic policies that have destroyed the lives of so many individuals, such as one million unemployed people. You remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, that at times there were massive interest rates. But for the government to make these cuts it has to look seriously at every angle, every part of Commonwealth expenditure. 
Of course you can say, `You didn't have to cut this, you didn't have to cut that. You didn't really have to make these savings.' But all of us know that if you are trying to make your own household budget balance at the end of the month you have to look at all areas of expenditure. It is the same when you are running a national economy; it is no different. You can always say, `Gee, we would really like that, and we would really like this. We would like to go out to Hungry Jack's again this week. We would like to go to the movies.' Of course you would, but there are some things you just cannot do. Ultimately you have to balance the budget, unless you want to keep running a fiscally irresponsible ship. The people who suffer most when you do that at the national level in Australia are the battlers who are on average weekly earnings. When the interest rates went up to 17 per cent—as they did often under Labor; 30 per cent for many small business—and you went to AGC or a number of secondary lenders in those days, you used to have to pay 30, 31 or 32 per cent effective interest rates on small business lending, development finance and so forth. It is very hard if you are a householder with a mortgage in the suburbs of any of our capital cities, you are raising some children, you have a car in the driveway, you are paying lease payments on your car, and you are paying mortgage payments on your house, when these people opposite spend all the money, live outside their means, act irresponsibly—as they are doing now, quite frankly, because they are irresponsible as an opposition. You cannot say, `We are a new Labor Party, we are going to be economically responsible, we are going to balance the budget', but then, when the government proposes expenditure restraint, take the populist route, which is to say, `Well, we oppose that.'
—You don't spend your surplus now.
—You never had the problem of spending a surplus because you have never had one. 
—That's wrong.
—No, sorry, that is wrong. Senator Schacht is right. They had a couple of surpluses. They were in power 13 years and they had— 
 (Sen-ator Murphy)—Order! Senator Schacht, you have had plenty of practice at interjections and you know they are disorderly. Senator Campbell, you should direct your remarks through the chair.
—Of course, Senator Schacht squeals and squirms because the government that he was a member of were spendthrifts. They were prepared to spend the money of future generations. When they are in opposition they are even more opportunistic than they were in government. They are prepared to oppose every single hard decision this government makes. When it comes to fuel prices, they say, `Cut the excise.' What did they do when they were in power? They brought the excise in and cranked it up. They cranked up taxes. They opposed indirect taxes in one election and then cranked up indirect taxes. They opposed every single measure. When we got rid of wholesale sales taxes, they opposed that. They are opposed to everything. This is the most carping, whining, whingeing, negative opposition that this nation has ever seen. They do not have an alternative policy. They say that they want to balance the budget, but whenever we cut expenditure they oppose it. When the hard times come in relation to international fuel prices, what do they do? They do not say, `We went through this in the Gulf crisis.' What did they do when petrol prices went up in the Gulf crisis? They did not do anything. They did not cut taxes or excises. Do you know what they did shortly after the Gulf crisis? They actually put the excise up. Mr Acting Deputy President, when it comes to Cox Peninsula, when it comes to Radio Australia, I say to the Labor Party that what I would—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. It is a point of relevance. We are talking about the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill but, after listening to Senator Ian Campbell tonight, we would doubt whether that is what we are talking about. We have gone on to budgets, surpluses and a whole range of other things. It would be appreciated if Senator Campbell would come back to the point.
—Order! Senator Ludwig, there is no point of order. You can resume your seat. I am sure Senator Campbell is aware of the fact that we are debating the amendment moved by Senator Bishop and that he is making his contribution along those lines somewhere.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The point I make, because it does irk me, is that this opposition are so populist that whenever there is an expenditure cut they oppose it. What we are trying to do in government is to keep a running tally of all of the opposition's expenditure promises. They have not quite promised to do what they are suggesting on excise yet, but we would like to see what the Labor Party would do about ABC funding. What will you do about fuel taxes? What will you do about roll-back? What are the costs of all these new regulatory regimes you are proposing? Basically the Labor Party's policy in a whole range of areas is to introduce a whole range of new government departments. What are you going to do about IT outsourcing? As Senator Vicki Bourne would know better than others, this is critical; it is an area where we are discussing communicating with the rest of the world, being a part of the information age. What will we see from the Labor Party? They want to roll back the GST. We want to see whether they will roll the wholesale sales tax back onto computers and put the prices of computers back up by 20 per cent again? Will they roll back IT outsourcing, bring it all back in-house again, expand the Australian Public Service and increase taxes again? We want to see what you are actually going to do.
We will oppose this most pious of pious amendments because the Labor Party are not fair dinkum. Why don't we add paragraph (g) saying that the Senate notes that the Australian Labor Party will restore the ABC's funding to 1990 levels? Just have the guts to put in part (g). We have had to slice out a couple of pieces, because obviously the drafting was no good, but let us see for the first time the Australian Labor Party put pen to paper and actually have a policy. Instead of just being negative, carping, whining—the most negative opposition, the most leaderless opposition in Australian history—let us see you have a fresh idea. Don't just criticise; let us see you have a fresh idea. Here is the place to start. I will give you leave to amend your motion tonight to say what the Australian Labor Party's policy is. I think we will be waiting in a vacuum of silence. 
Amendment agreed to.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. 
Bill read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-11-28,"The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 has been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. The minority report by ALP senators outlines areas of potential concern with the provisions of the bill that were raised during the inquiry process. Criticisms of the bill contained in submissions to the inquiry have been noted by Labor senators. Those criticisms relate to the following issues: (a) the bill does not address the issue of existing domain name registries being monopolies; (b) the bill does nothing to ensure competitive pricing; (c) competitive pressures will adequately regulate domain name allocation and naming policy, and consequently there is no need for this legislation; (d) the existence of the bill's safety net measures might undermine the cooperative self-regulatory process; (e) the role of the ACA in managing electronic addressing and the clarity with which the circumstances for invoking the safety net measures are defined.
I will discuss each of these criticisms in turn but, first, a brief description of the bill's provisions and the context of the bill's introduction is warranted. The bill provides safety net mechanisms for the management of electronic addressing through the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. These safety net mechanisms are designed to be invoked in the event that attempts at self-regulation prove ineffective in managing electronic addressing. The government has indicated that it favours industry self-regulation for the management of electronic addressing services, which includes domain name allocation. Consultative processes for the formulation of a self-regulatory regime are presently being undertaken by au Domain Administration or auDA, which is an industry self-regulatory body for the au namespace. It formed two panels to investigate self-regulatory approaches to competition issues and naming policy issues through industry and public consultative processes. However, attempts at industry self-regulation over the last few years have consistently broken down or failed for various reasons. The provisions of this bill are intended to operate in the case of continuing failure of self-regulatory processes.
In response to a question I asked at the public hearing of the committee, Melbourne IT indicated that it has paid auDA $659,000 this financial year, pursuant to an agreement signed on 12 July 2000. auDA has stated that this financial support will enable it to continue to carry out its policy development role, and to continue with the Competition Model Advisory Panel process to introduce competition in the provision of domain names in au. The opposition will continue to observe these processes and their outcomes with interest.
The safety net mechanisms in this bill have the wide support of industry and government. This was evident from the absence of industry objections to the bill when the inquiry was first advertised and the limited number of concerns expressed when the inquiry was subsequently readvertised and its time frame extended. The bill comprises two schedules which implement the safety net mechanisms. The first schedule specifies circumstances in which the ACCC or the ACA can intervene in the management of electronic addressing. The second schedule establishes an alternative mechanism by which the minister can give the ACA responsibility for managing a specified type of electronic addressing in consultation with the ACCC. This mechanism will only be invoked in exceptional circumstances where direct ACA management is the only viable alternative to management by a self-regulatory body. 
I will turn now to criticism (a) of the bill raised during the committee inquiry. The criticism is that this bill does not overcome existing monopolies of domain name registries. The competition panel of auDA is presently working through competition issues so that they will be addressed by the self-regulatory scheme. It was argued that the legislation will not prevent anticompetitive conduct but that its existence could undermine the self-regulatory processes that ultimately aim to overcome such conduct. The effective monopolies of the existing domain name registries need to be addressed. A means by which there can be multiple registries for each of the domain name spaces needs to be established to allow a number of different companies to compete in the market. The wider competition policy in the United States, for example, allows many stakeholders to enter the market as a competitive domain name system. It was suggested to the committee that the US approach indicates that, at this stage, there are no operational threats to Internet domain name addressing which require—or justify—legislative intervention.
Turning to issue (b) identified during the inquiry: the criticism was that the bill does not resolve, nor does it seek to address, the issue of competitive pricing of domain names. There is a close connection between competitive pricing and competition between domain name registries. As I have already mentioned, each second-level domain in Australia is an effective monopoly. The committee was advised that competition in pricing is contingent on there being future competition between registries. According to Melbourne IT, the high price of registering domain names in Australia compared to US prices is a result of the complexity of Australian naming policy which requires a lot of manual administration. Thus, the complexity of the regulatory environment in terms of naming policy is determinative of the price to the extent that it impacts upon the cost of providing the service. Consequently, in the United States, where the system is fully automated and there is virtually no policy except that seven particular swearwords are unavailable, the cost ranges from as little as $5.99 into the hundreds of dollars. In Australia, .com.au retail prices are around $140. It is expected that the issue of competitive pricing will, to a large extent, be addressed by the implementation of a means for introducing competition to the provision of domain name services in Australia. The opposition will watch the development of this aspect of the regulatory scheme with interest.
The third criticism brought to the attention of the inquiry relates to the substance of domain name policies and competition issues. Industry favours the introduction of effective competition into the Australian market over regulatory policy for domain names which reflects that for business names. Ensuring there are multiple issuers of domain names and resultant competitive pressures is, according to industry, the more appropriate regulatory approach for domain names. Any analogy between company registration and domain name registration is considered inappropriate due to the global aspect of domain name policy. Domain name policy is not, however, a matter with which the bill is concerned. It will be an issue that the self-regulatory scheme will address based on the results of the relevant auDA panel investigations. Industry indicated support `for some degree of policy in .com.au' to promote consumer confidence when addressing companies in .com.au.
