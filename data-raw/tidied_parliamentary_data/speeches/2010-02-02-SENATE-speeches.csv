"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-02-02,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the senator moving—That:
Senator Bob Brown may immediately move a motion on the involvement and deployment of Australian troops in Afghanistan; and
the motion have precedence over all other business until determined.
I take this move at the outset of this parliamentary year to be able to have a parliamentary debate on the deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel to Afghanistan. We have had a series of government statements on the matter and, indeed, on the extremely sad 11 occasions when Australian Defence Force personnel have been killed in Afghanistan, we have commemorated their bravery and their service to this nation, but I think the parliament of the nation of Australia, alone amongst the parliaments that have troops represented in Afghanistan, has had no debate and there should be.
It is self-evident that when a nation involves itself in a war—and that is what we have done in Afghanistan—it should not be just a matter for the executive; it should be a matter for the parliament to debate. If this motion is successful, I will move for the Senate to call on the government to begin safely and securely withdrawing Australian combat troops from Afghanistan. The majority of Australians in opinion polls support that point of view, yet there has not been a debate which allows that point of view, which is represented by the Australian Greens, to be aired in this parliament. As one of the four oldest continuous democracies in the world we ought to be fully and amply debating the deployment of our troops overseas, particularly into the war situation that pertains in Afghanistan, and then serially debating their representation of this nation and the impact of events in countries like Afghanistan as they unfold.
We never had an adequate debate on the deployment of Australian troops to Iraq and nor is there a requirement that our parliament debate the deployment of troops to war, but the Greens staunchly advocate that parliament should be involved. This is not just a matter for the executive or for the Prime Minister of the nation. Australia has some 1,550 Defence Force personnel currently in Afghanistan. Their primary commitment is in Oruzgan province in the south, which is very volatile and indeed dangerous. Our troops train the Afghan army. They conduct security operations and combat the Taliban. They construct and restore civilian infrastructure such as schools, waste management facilities and medical facilities.
Besides the 11 Australian Defence Force personnel who have given their lives in the service of this country, there have been many injuries. On an international basis, 1,600 military personnel have been killed since 2001. That includes almost 1,000 Americans. The number killed each year is rapidly climbing: there were 232 killed in 2007, 295 in 2008 and 520 last year. We can expect that this toll will continue to rise.
I have raised in this chamber, with my colleagues, our distress at the corruption which infests Afghanistan’s politics, not least the Karzai government. We had a very short, peremptory debate about the circumstances of the last election and whether or not the current government is legitimate.
The Australian Greens take the strong point of view that we should be giving support to Afghanistan and to the Afghani people so they can have their freedoms and have police back in that country. We ought to be looking at the Canadian precedent, where the Canadian parliament have determined that, by 2011, their troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan. We should at least be debating this issue. We owe it to our troops, we owe it to the nation and we owe it to the Afghani people, and indeed to NATO and other troops who are in Afghanistan, to have a full, mature and informed debate in this parliament. I hope the Senate will agree.",SENATE,<title>AFGHANISTAN</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2010-02-02,"—Let me first, in this debate, touch on a couple of points regarding Australia’s commitment to Afghanistan and in Afghanistan. In today’s world, Australia’s national security interests extend beyond our borders and beyond our region. The Australian government is committed to our efforts in Afghanistan, where we are working alongside 42 international partners, all working under a United Nations mandate. The Australian government has clearly set out the specific goals underlying Australia’s commitment and military involvement in Afghanistan. They are helping to stabilise the country through combined and coordinated military, police and civilian assistance; training sufficient Afghan security forces in Oruzgan province to allow Afghan authorities to take over within a reasonable time frame; and helping to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a training ground and operating base for terrorists.
In response to any call for Australia to withdraw our troops, all I can say is that the job is not yet done. Abandoning it half finished is not my idea of responsible government. We all know how difficult and dangerous this task is—11 Australian soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan—and of course we do not want to be and we have no intention of being in Afghanistan indefinitely. That is why, earlier last year, the government in fact increased our troop commitment to Afghanistan to around 1,550. That increase included more ADF mentors and trainers for the Afghan National Army, with the express intent of increasing the number of Afghan National Army trainees to ultimately boost the security forces. Our efforts will help to bring Oruzgan province closer to the point where the ANA can provide security there.
In terms of Senator Bob Brown’s motion to suspend standing orders to bring on a debate about our involvement in Afghanistan now, I note that after taking the Defence portfolio I made a commitment that as Minister for Defence I would give the parliament regular reports on our progress in this conflict. I have made two such comprehensive statements, on 12 August and 26 November last year. I want to ensure that the Australian parliament and the Australian people are properly informed and able to make considered judgments about our involvement in Afghanistan. Both those statements provided the Senate with an opportunity for debate. I welcome the bipartisan support expressed at the time by the shadow minister for defence, Senator Johnston, and Senator Bob Brown also took the opportunity to respond to the 26 November statement. I intend to continue to provide the Senate with these regular updates and I will welcome debate on the subject throughout the year ahead.
Opportunities for debate are not limited just to these ministerial statements. We have, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, matters of public importance, urgency motions, general business—all of which provide senators with the opportunity to debate important issues. Afghanistan has also, I might say, been canvassed in detail during the Chief of the Defence Force’s opening statements at Senate estimates. Here the CDF, the secretary of defence and other departmental and ADF representatives are ready, willing and available to answer any questions about the issue from senators. There will be a further opportunity at Senate estimates next week. Given the pressure of other business before the Senate at the moment and the many other opportunities to debate our involvement in Afghanistan, the government will not be supporting this suspension motion at this time.",SENATE,<title>AFGHANISTAN</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2010-02-02,"—The reasons and justification for our mission in Afghanistan need no explanation or qualification. The mission and task are in a just and proper cause. In our democracy in Australia, the opposition can achieve very little in terms of practical outcomes, but one thing we can do is help and participate actively in defining what will or will not become national political issues. From an opposition perspective, our continued role in Afghanistan will not, so far as we are concerned, be or become a national political issue. The Minister for Defence has very properly and appropriately informed the Senate of the progress of our mission in Afghanistan on a regular basis. I thank him and commend him for that. I also thank, in this very brief response to Senator Bob Brown’s motion, the very fine men and women of our Australian Defence Force and their continued commitment to our mission. I commend them for the exceptional work that they are doing. It is simply outstanding. We are very proud of them. Accordingly, we see no reason to debate this issue at this time.",SENATE,<title>AFGHANISTAN</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-02,"—I rise to speak briefly on the suspension motion moved by Senator Brown on Afghanistan and commend it to the Senate. I will open with a comment similar to one Senator Brown made last year on the occasion of the second report by the Minister for Defence, which is that the level of disclosure, which we had not seen under the previous government, is appreciated. I also appreciate that the minister did not try to gloss over the fact that this is a bitter conflict with casualties every single day—some of them reported, some of them not—and that we are bringing back dead or injured Australians, whom we have put into harm’s way, on a weekly or monthly basis. But the question is what people do with that information once it is made public or once the disclosures are made during estimates hearings. Where is the debate actually to be held, because it is certainly not held here? This debate has been put into a brief half-hour timeslot this morning because there is really no other time that this issue can be debated. It was not debated properly and a vote was not taken when Australia deployed troops to this conflict all those years ago, and now we find ourselves in a quagmire, in an open-ended commitment entirely contingent on the priorities of our allies, particularly NATO, and our strategy effectively contingent on priorities set in the United States—in Washington and not in Canberra. If it is not an appropriate time for this suspension motion to be debated now, then when will it happen?
Both the Minister for Defence and the shadow spokesperson from the Liberal Party, Senator Johnston, said that they appreciated these reports on our progress. As much as the regular reports are appreciated, it is not progress. We are not making progress in Afghanistan. A part of the problem is that what we hear are updates on a failed security strategy in Afghanistan and a failed electoral strategy. Increasing civilian casualties, which ADF personnel have been involved in, have turned the population in large parts in that country against the occupying troops. The United States and NATO have armed militias, have armed particular warlords and have taken sides in conflicts that have held back this country through colonial occupation for literally centuries. There is no reason to believe that there is going to be any difference this time. The military contingents have different priorities, are not coordinated and lack a common diagnosis and common strategy. This again is something that Australia finds itself caught up in and it is being held hostage to foreign policy decisions taken in foreign capitals.
One of the first things I did when I took my seat in the middle of 2008 was reintroduce a bill the Australian Democrats had had on the
Notice Paper
for many years around the deployment of Australian troops into conflicts. As much as this motion of Senator Brown is concerned with how to extract ourselves from one of these conflicts, the legislation which I sponsored and which the Greens have been promoting talks about how we get into these conflicts in the first place and that these decisions should not be left to the executive. There seems to be consensus from both the major parties that this is a debate that they do not want to have. Perhaps sometimes later this year we will have two hours to debate it, and I am presuming it will be voted down by both parties because the debate itself does not have the level of maturity it does in the nations of even some of our closest allies.
The decision to commit Australian troops to war is the most serious decision that can be made by the political leadership of this country. We saw in the case of Afghanistan, and even worse in the instance of Iraq, that decision taken behind closed doors on the basis of faulty and politicised intelligence. That decision put people into harm’s way and led to the ongoing quagmire we are now held up in today. That decision should have been put to the parliament. It may not have even led to a different outcome, but at least the public would have felt, through their elected representatives, that they had some stake in the debate. What we get instead is the kind of polarisation where we have hundreds of thousands of people—in the case of Iraq and smaller numbers in the case of Afghanistan—marching in protest against the decision. I know very well, because I was involved in the protests, that the community had grave concerns about committing Australian forces to Afghanistan for precisely the reasons that we find ourselves discussing now.
I support this suspension motion so that the debate can occur in a mature fashion. The Greens are not about taking sides or politicising this debate, but we want the facts on the table and we want the community to feel that they have some stake in the debate rather than simply receiving these grim updates every couple of months from the defence minister that really only serve to highlight the fact that we are in a very serious situation in Afghanistan and that there is no end in sight. I also use this opportunity to promote the debate that should be had on the so-called ‘war powers bill’ about committing Australian troops to these conflicts in the first place.",SENATE,<title>AFGHANISTAN</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-02-02,"—I indicate that I support this suspension motion moved by Senator Brown on Afghanistan. The question here is not whether or not you support Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan but whether it is appropriate at this stage to suspend standing orders to debate this important issue, and I believe it is. I agree with Senator Ludlam that there is no more important decision a government can make than putting troops in harm’s way. In a democracy, the best place to debate these issues is right here in the parliament. In the United States—our closest ally—you need an act of congress before troops are committed to war. The Greens are not even asking for that here; they are simply asking for a debate. I do want to pay tribute to the Minister for Defence, though, for his candour and transparency—hitherto, we have not seen that level of candour and transparency about this conflict—and that is a good thing. The opposition has also commended the minister for that.
Today the issue is whether we should debate this issue now. I believe we should. I am concerned about the comments made by independent observers such as Peter Galbraith from the United Nations about the Afghan elections and the flawed process there. I think that is important in the context of such a debate. I think we ought to have this debate in this place, in this context and we should do that today.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-02,"—We resume debate on the
Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2009. It makes a set of amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, in this case to allow interception, copying, recording and disclosure of electronic communications in the name of protecting computer networks from malicious access and building confidence in the online world. I should say at the outset that the Greens will be supporting this bill for the intentions as set out by the government. It also allows specified government organisations, whether they be law enforcement, national security, defence and international relations related organisations, to intercept communications and undertake disciplinary actions to ensure that computer networks are appropriately used. I think that as our computer networks are already ubiquitous in certain fields, such as those named, the networks are also becoming much more ubiquitous in a household sense in that we are relying on them more and more as an essential service, whether it be for banking, paying the bills, education and so on. It is entirely appropriate that the government move regularly to assess the state of protection of these networks from hazards such as viruses and so on, or indeed the operation of espionage or hackers or criminal organisations, whatever it may be that threatens the networks.
The committee was unable to hold a hearing into the bill, but I should acknowledge at this point that it was improved through consultation. Quite a number of the recommendations that came through from stakeholders post the release of an August exposure draft were taken up by the government, and I would just like to put my appreciation on record that some of those recommendations were acknowledged and made their way into the final bill. It would have been really useful for the committee to have held a hearing, but unfortunately that was not the case.
This bill initially was listed by the government in noncontroversial and the Greens would have been very happy to keep it there. But there are a number of outstanding issues that were raised in submissions by the Privacy Commissioner, by online advocate Electronic Frontiers Australia, and by the Australian Law Reform Commission. So three organisations with a lot of information and a lot of expertise to share on matters like this recommended what they called ‘minor amendments’ to the bill to clarify the definition of what constitutes ‘network protection duties’ in the first place, what constitutes ‘disciplinary actions’, and to tighten requirements to destroy copies of intercepted communications. We let the government know at the time that we would be very happy to leave this bill in noncontroversial last year and we could have passed it quite quickly if the government had been prepared to move those last minor amendments that were required to make the bill just as good as it could be. The issues were thoughtfully raised and they could easily have been addressed through minor amendments. Unfortunately the government passed up that opportunity so we had it requested to be removed from noncontroversial and now we find ourselves here today, and I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to give effect to those points that I have just raised. I will speak briefly to the intention of the amendments now and then we will move through the debate.
The Attorney-General claims that network protection duties vary for each network and therefore cannot be defined. Now the purpose of this bill is to define network protection duties and give them effect, so we believe that it is appropriate that some parameters should be set. They should not be exclusive or exhaustive but some guidance should be set on the scope and nature of the activities that we mean by network protection duties to remove any remaining ambiguity. We do not want to be prescriptive but we do want to guide the discretion of a judge in future to ensure that persons whose role is not to protect the network are not permitted to intercept communications, and that is a fairly clear distinction that we want to draw.
Persons who are authorised to intercept communications also should not be doing it for other purposes, whether through curiosity or malice for that matter. They should be only able to intercept those communications in the instance of protection of the network. This has very real relevance for all of us because these networks are so important for everything from online banking to doing the shopping, to getting the news and so on that people operating those networks, whether the Parliament House network or intranets for large or small corporations, the people we entrust to monitor and safeguard that traffic, basically have their role clearly defined and delineated. It is as much for the benefit of network operators as anything else to remove that ambiguity.
The Privacy Commissioner was supportive of clarifying what ‘network protection activities’ actually means in the bill and in that submission asked what measures are covered by the operation, protection or maintenance of the network and when an interception is reasonably necessary. So the Greens have moved an amendment, which we will get to in the committee stage, to give effect to that.
On the destruction of intercepted materials—and I would have thought that this would be the simplest one for the government to come along with—the Attorney-General has stated:
... imposing an obligation to destroy copies of lawfully intercepted information is unenforceable.
The Australian Law Reform Commission submission on that issue—and they have done quite a recent review and a very thorough inquiry into privacy issues—was that there was:
... no reason why copies of information obtained from a stored communication warrant must be destroyed, but that copies of information obtained from an interception warrant are not ... The covert nature of interception and access to communications requires the safeguard that the intercepted or accessed information is destroyed as soon as it is no longer required.
That is not complex or ambiguous and I would argue that it is entirely enforceable, just as it would be with the way we expect law enforcement operators to handle paper material that they might have seized from a filing cabinet.
We are supportive of the committee’s proposal for a review and we also support the opposition’s call for the government to make clear that disciplinary action only applies to activities that pose a risk to network security. In closing, the Australian Greens will be supporting the bill. We commend our amendments to the Senate.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-02-02,"—I stand to speak on the
Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2009
before the chamber. I note that this particular bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee on 17 September 2009 and reported on 16 November 2009. I note that the committee received seven submissions and we have delivered our report noting that the primary objective of the bill is to protect the privacy of individuals who use the Australian telecommunications system. The act makes it an offence to intercept communications or to access stored communications other than in accordance with the provisions of the act and specifies the circumstances in which it is lawful to intercept or access communications or authorise the disclosure of telecommunications data. The report also notes that protecting information and computer infrastructure from disruption or malicious access by a criminal element seeking to gain financial or other benefits is therefore a growing priority for the government and computer network owners.
The key issue before the chamber is getting the balance right between preserving individual privacy rights and network protection requirements. Senator Ludlam has spoken in support of the bill, subject to the amendments that he has flagged. The Liberal senators, including Senator Mary Jo Fisher and I, made our views reasonably clear in the Senate committee report, where we supported the passing of the bill and made a couple of recommendations. I want to indicate, as our shadow Attorney will indicate, our support for the bill.
I also want to highlight that our additional comments in that report confirm that we will be watching and noting the government’s response to the concerns that we have expressed. Senator Ludlam has indicated that some of the fears and concerns that we expressed in our additional comments he also confirms as concerns. In particular, that applies to the definition of network protection and disciplinary purposes. Exactly what does that mean? The bill does not provide sufficient clarity as to what actions would be considered necessary to effectively undertake network protection duties and, further, how intercepted information may be used for disciplinary purposes. That is certainly a concern that the Liberal senators on the committee had at the time. We will be watching carefully to see how this legislation is acted out on the ground, in its practical operation.
The Law Council highlighted some important concerns about proposed section 63E and the potential for law enforcement agencies to bypass warrant arrangements to obtain information by using voluntary disclosure provisions—that is, basically obtaining the information via a voluntary approach, whether it be ‘wink, wink, nudge, nudge, give us the information’ or by other means. We do not know exactly how that is going to work, but I know that the shadow Attorney has expressed an understanding of it and a confidence that the bill will achieve the objectives without undue concern.
We have noted that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner suggested that additional guidance be provided to help organisations train authorised persons in what actions are lawfully enabled under the proposed exemption. The issue of what exactly is disciplinary action and how broadly it can be defined needs to be noted. It will be considered and watched in future months and years, whether it be through Senate estimates or by other arrangements. So those recommendations have been made and certainly the coalition will be supporting the bill.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the secretariat for their support in the preparation of this report. It was done in a short amount of time. In particular, at this juncture I want to highlight the work of Peter Hallahan, the secretary of the committee, and thank him for his contribution. As deputy chair, I have enjoyed working with Peter Hallahan, who has very recently retired. I know that other members of the committee would likewise note and acknowledge his work. There will be a special event to commend Mr Hallahan for his years of service. I take this opportunity to put on the record that he has completed 28.9 years of service with the Department of the Senate, of which 24.4 years were spent in committees. All that started on 15 December 1980. I understand that before that he worked with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
During those 28.9 years, and specifically the 24.4 years in committees, he worked with the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the Standing Committee on Social Welfare, the Select Committee on Television Equalisation, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, the Select Committee on Superannuation, the Standing Committee on Economics, the Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy and the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. He spent a further four years, from November 2004, with the economics committee, and then from February 2008 he worked with the legal and constitutional affairs legislation and references committees, where I had particular contact with Mr Peter Hallahan. I want to place on record, on behalf of coalition members—and, I am sure, all members of the committee—our sincere thanks for his service to not just our committee but also the Senate and the parliament. I commend him on his work and wish him and his family well for the months and years ahead.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION AND ACCESS) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-02-02,"—I can indicate my broad support for the
Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2009. Technology and the ways we communicate are constantly changing, and it is important to have legislation to keep up to date with this. The widespread use of mobile phones and portable internet devices has changed the way we communicate forever. It is important that we have clear and appropriate frameworks in place to protect both network owners and operators as well as network users. I appreciate the importance of this bill, particularly as the current framework has expired. Organisations need to have the right to protect their networks and internal communications, but, on the other hand, employees and network users also have a right to privacy.
I am concerned that at this stage the bill does not include a clearer definition of what activities are covered under the term ‘network protection duties’. This term determines whether someone is able to access and intercept another person’s communication under the amendment. I believe that this definition, in its current form, is not strong enough to protect network users. Private communications should only be accessed by a third party when it is vital to network protection or in the case of professional misconduct.
In this line, I indicate my support for the amendments moved by the Greens. I believe these amendments are important because they help to keep the bill true to its intentions. Firstly, these amendments clarify the definition of ‘network protection duties’ to include automatic monitoring for network malfunctions, malicious content and viruses. This clarification is important because it separates standard network protection from the direct monitoring of individual communications. Secondly, the amendments seek to clarify the definition of ‘appropriate use’. It is important that this area of the legislation is clear so that both network owner-operators and users are aware of their responsibilities and rights. Finally, the amendments ensure that copies made of information seized under the act will be destroyed along with the originals.
I think these amendments go a long way to making this legislation fairer for both owner-operators and network users. I do have concerns about the possible abuse of the term ‘network protection duties’, but I would like to indicate my support for this bill. My preference is that it have the additional safeguards as proposed by the Greens.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION AND ACCESS) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-02-02,"—I rise to speak on the
Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2009. The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 currently includes special exemptions that enable interception and security agencies, as well as certain government departments, to access communications on their own computer network for network protection activities. However, these provisions are not permanent; rather, they were intended to operate on an interim basis while a comprehensive solution covering both the public and private sectors was developed. These provisions ceased to have effect after 12 December 2009.
The bill will enable all owners and operators of computer networks to undertake activities to operate, maintain and protect their networks. This will enable Commonwealth agencies, security authorities and eligible state authorities to ensure that their computer networks are appropriately used by employees, officeholders or contractors of the agency or authority, and it will limit to network protection purposes the secondary use and disclosure of information obtained through network protection activities. Secondly, the bill will enable the undertaking of disciplinary action against an employee, officeholder or contractor of a Commonwealth agency, security authority or eligible state authority who has been given access to a network. Thirdly, the bill covers the reporting to the relevant authorities of illegal behaviour that attracts a minimum three-year imprisonment penalty threshold, and will require the destruction of records obtained in undertaking network protection activities when the information is no longer required for those purposes. The 2008 legislation, which was passed with coalition support last year, implemented some interim measures in contemplation of the presentation of this bill. The amendments are largely technical in nature but involve intrusive powers.
The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The committee reported on 16 November with a recommendation that the bill be passed. There was one substantive reservation by the Liberal senators on the committee: that the proposed section 63E be amended to provide that the section not apply where an agency has requested the disclosure of the information. The proposed section 63E provides that a person responsible for a network may voluntarily communicate lawfully intercepted information to an agency where that person reasonably suspects that the information is relevant to the commission of an offence. Concern had been expressed that agencies might be able to circumvent the warrant provisions of the act by suggesting voluntary disclosure. The coalition has sought advice on this point and we are satisfied that section 7 of the act would make such an attempt unlawful. There is much to recommend the view that the provision should nevertheless be amended out of an abundance of caution. However, section 7 governs the entirety of this act, creating the presumption that the interception and further communication of material is unlawful, subject only to specific authorisation. It would, I think, be ungainly to reiterate that point in disparate provisions every time the act is amended. Accordingly, the coalition supports the bill in its current form.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION AND ACCESS) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-02-02,"—The
Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2009
recognises the important role technology plays in the way we store and exchange information. The passage of this bill will help secure sensitive information from criminal access, protecting Australians from criminal activity and ensuring the integrity of vital infrastructure. For the first time, all Australians will be able to undertake certain activities designed to protect their computer network without breaching the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. This is an important step forward which matches the growth in sophisticated attacks with the capacity to defend a network at the earliest possible point. However, network protection activities will only be lawful if they are conducted in accordance with the act.
Network protection activities will also need to comply with the provisions and privacy protections set out in this bill. Under the bill, network protection activities cannot be undertaken without reason, nor can the information obtained through these activities be used for any purpose. Rather, the proposed network protection regime maintains the integrity of the interception regime by balancing the need to protect networks from malicious attack with clear limitations on the circumstances in which the access, use and disclosure of information will be permitted. The bill also includes several amendments that will improve the effective operation of the act, ensuring it continues to be clear and relevant. The network protection regime responds to a new and very real threat.
The bill has been considered by both the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. I thank both committees for their work on the matters raised. The Attorney has responded to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, as requested, to clarify several aspects of the bill. The majority of the legal and constitutional affairs committee has recommended that the bill be passed and that the provisions be reviewed five years after their commencement. Given the broader operation of the interception regime for the purpose of protecting computer networks, the government supports this recommendation and will conduct an administrative review of the network protection regime five years after its commencement.
I would also emphasise, as the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee noted in its report, that the feedback on the bill has been positive. There is agreement that network owners and operators should be able to protect their networks. There is also agreement that the current capacity of designated government agencies to use network protection information for disciplinary purposes should be retained. This bill is a measured response to a growing problem that will enable network protection activities to take place within the broader framework established by the act. By ensuring that network owners can undertake legitimate activities aimed at securing their networks and the information they contain, this bill will build Australians’ confidence in, and use of, the online world. In conclusion, I would like to thank those senators who made contributions to the second reading debate.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-02-02,"—I commence the new year with a sense of deja vu, because in speaking to this theNational Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2009 [2010]
my mind goes back to 2008 when I addressed remarks to a very similar bill which was introduced as a private senator’s bill by Senator Troeth and Senator Humphries called the Independent Review of Terrorism Laws Bill. They introduced that bill in the Senate after its original sponsor, the member for Kooyong, Mr Georgiou, was gagged by the government in the House of Representatives in seeking to debate the bill in the other place. Indeed, Mr Georgiou had barely uttered the words ‘on a bipartisan basis’ when the Leader of the House, the member for Grayndler, Mr Albanese, moved the gag. So had the Rudd government in 2008 set its face against the opposition’s proposal to establish an independent review of terrorism laws.
Lo and behold, some year and a half later the government has come to the opposition’s point of view and is proceeding with this legislation, which we will support on a bipartisan basis. The Senate was able to be convinced, because the bill was passed in this place, of the value of that legislation and, with the cooperation of the Greens, it was passed in the teeth of opposition from the government at the time. Naturally, the government maintained its negative stance when the first reading of the bill was moved in the House of Representatives on 24 November 2008 and it proceeded no further. So here we are, some 15 months after that debate, nearly two years after Mr Georgiou introduced his bill, the
Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Laws Bill 2008, debating the government’s own legislation. I use that expression loosely because it can be hardly said to reflect the government’s own preferences.
The bill comes with a series of amendments, which the opposition will support. These amendments make this bill resemble Mr Georgiou’s bill in almost every respect, much more so than the initial edition of the government’s bill. It is almost two years since Mr Albanese marshalled the numbers to quash Mr Georgiou’s initiative, and quietly the government has adopted Mr Georgiou’s policy as its own.
The key difference between the government’s original bill and the regime proposed by the coalition is the notion of independence. In keeping with the approach of the Rudd government, the bill in its initial form required that the monitor be subject to the direction of the executive, personified by the Prime Minister. Any ad hoc inquiry would have been subject to prime ministerial approval. Any report deriving from it would be both secret, there having been in the initial bill no provision for tabling, and subject to executive micromanagement. Those provisions, I am pleased to say, following the recommendations of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, have now been abandoned by the government. The government’s amendments address the coalition’s concerns raised in the committee and restore independence, which is central to the concept of this office. The opposition will, therefore, be supporting the amendments and, with the carriage of amendments, will be supporting this bill, which, for all practical purposes, is our own.
As I said in November 2008 in my remarks on the bill introduced by Senators Troeth and Humphries, the principle behind this bill is a protective principle. It is to add to the armoury of parliamentary surveillance another mechanism designed to ensure that the counterterrorism laws, which were amended so as to expand the executive and policing powers of the state in extraordinary times by introducing into our laws exceptional measures, are not allowed to become ordinary measures by the effluxion of time. The government and the parliament were of the view that some traditional protection should be reviewed and the policing functions of the state should be extended through such devices as preventative detention orders and control orders, which were controversial at the time, in the service of the fundamental obligation of governments and parliaments—that is, to protect the public interest.
Those of us who remember those debates also remember that the government which introduced them, the Howard government, made it clear at the time that these were extraordinary measures. This bill introduces an Office of the Independent Monitor, who, we expect, will bring an objective and detached mind to the question of both the functionality of the laws and the necessity for their continuance. This can only be beneficial and it has proven to be beneficial in other jurisdictions.
Mr Georgiou’s bill, on which the government’s bill belatedly is based, was itself inspired by the provisions of the United Kingdom, which created an office of independent reviewer of terrorism laws. In 2008, I travelled to London to meet with the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Laws, Lord Carlile, with whom I had extensive discussion about the operation of the laws in that jurisdiction. Lord Carlile stressed to me that his independence and his power to conduct inquiries on his own initiative were central to his ability to discharge his functions and to maintain the objectivity required to perform those functions. Then last year, when Lord Carlile visited Australia, he once again met with me, along with Mr Georgiou and Senator Troeth, and we had further conversations which further informed the opposition’s attitude to this legislation.
My own discussions with both Lord Carlile and British national security agencies confirmed in my mind the belief that those agencies strongly supported the apparatus of an independent reviewer of terrorism laws but were also strongly of the view that such an officer would be merely a bureaucrat unless he were genuinely independent of the executive government. That is the fundamental difference between the bill as presented in its initial form and the bill in the form in which it will be amended following the urging of Liberal senators and of the opposition generally. With those amendments, which will entrench the independence of the office, the coalition is confident that the success in the United Kingdom in Lord Carlile’s office can be replicated in Australia. Subject to the amendments, the opposition therefore supports the bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION MONITOR BILL 2009 [2010]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-02,"—I rise with a similar sense of deja vu. The Greens were very strongly supportive of the bill Senator Brandis has just been describing, the
Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Laws Bill 2008,
which was debated in this place at the end of 2008—well over a year ago. It has taken this long for the government to bring forward its model, which is described as the
National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2009 [2010].
I was working for Senator Rachel Siewert at the time that the main tranche of antiterrorism legislation was passed through the Senate at the end of 2005. Senator Brandis made a number of points on the way through about how the bill was debated—it was not really a debate; it was a guillotine undertaken in a hothouse environment where to speak out against the way that these laws might operate in practice was to be considered pro-terrorist. That, in fact, was one of the worst abuses, to my mind and my recollection, of the Howard government’s control of both houses of parliament. Essentially, the Senate was used as a sausage factory to ram this package of legislation through with consequences that we are still exploring, even to this day.
For all that I enjoyed Senator Brandis’s recollections about the reasons and the purpose of such an office, I just have to shake my head and ask: why on earth was such an office not included when these bills were passed in the first place, against practice in other countries that we would probably consider to be our peers, and against the recommendations of many people? But the Howard government knew better, and so the laws were passed. And still every word of them remains on the statute books to this day because of the very slow progress of the current government in unpicking some of the terrible precedents and terrible things that were put on Australian statute books at the time. We have no office of the terrorism reviewer precisely because the Howard government did not put one there. So now, five year later, we are beginning to unpick some of the damage that was done to the rule of law and to the fabric of statutes relating to terrorism and criminal activity, and violent crime more generally, in Australia. It should have been established at the time.
The UK, one of the countries that I suppose we might compare ourselves to in these sorts of matters, did include such a review mechanism when antiterrorism laws were passed there. Australia under the Howard government did not follow this model. Since that time, such an office has been recommended by the Security Legislation Review Committee chaired by the Hon. Simon Sheller QC—that was a report in June 2006—and by the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security in December 2006 and again in 2007, and in the government’s response to various reviews that was issued on 23 December 2008—an acknowledgement that such an office would be extremely valuable.
The Senate has contributed substantively towards this office through the October 2008 Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the private senator’s bill that Senator Brandis alluded to before. The passage of that bill in November 2008 was then killed by the government in the House of Representatives. It has taken them more than a year to come up with an equivalent. My party and I contributed to the work of the legal and constitutional affairs committee. In that case we took good evidence. We passed several amendments to the bill on the way through the Senate and sent a much improved bill to the House of Representatives that, if the Senate had prevailed, would have been passed on the spot. Of course, the government knew better.
Participants in that legal and constitutional affairs committee inquiry into the Anti-Terrorism Laws Reform Bill that I introduced into this place last year also called for the speedy establishment of this independent review mechanism to run in parallel with efforts to repeal some of the worst components of the terror laws. We have national security and intelligence agencies here working full time with these terrorism laws, with huge staffs and massive escalating budgets, and we have nobody in this case on the government’s payroll working in an independent capacity to assess whether these laws are necessary, whether they are proportionate or whether they are actually making any difference whatsoever, within the boundaries of the fact that there is a very broad suite of legislation that has many different effects and ramifications.
Some of these laws are so extreme and so redundant or otherwise inappropriate or offensive to the rule of law in this country that they should simply be repealed and not even be subjected to the dignity of a review. That was the subject of the private senator’s bill that I introduced last year and that then went through the committee process with, I must say, good work by the committee secretariat, including Peter Hallahan—who really will be missed, as Senator Barnett indicated earlier in a previous debate—but also with valuable contributions from government senators and from coalition senators into those measures that we introduced.
The laws, including things like those that allowed the Haneef scandal to unfold, relating to excessive dead time, undue surveillance and invasion of privacy, and the laws relating to sedition and matters such as reckless possession of a thing are also amongst the laws that quite simply should be abolished and not necessarily even be subject to a review.
Finally, the Senate contributed through the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee’s inquiry into this bill that we are debating today. That has resulted in the government taking on some of the advice from legal experts and organisations through a number of amendments. We appreciate at least that limited form of acknowledgement that they did not have it all in the bag in the first cut of that bill. Through that process that I am describing, through exhaustive and substantive work of numerous committees over a long period of time, and experts within and outside the parliamentary process, it is pretty obvious that there is widespread support for the independent review mechanism of these laws to come into existence—and not before time.
This office does have the potential to play an extremely important role in scrutinising the very large body of legislation relating to terrorism to ascertain whether they are necessary and whether they are proportionate and are actually meeting the stated objective of protecting Australians from violence and terrorist violence. Given the complexity of the laws and their far-reaching consequences, it is an extraordinary indication of the priority that the government sees this office holding that the function can be realistically achieved through one time position, supported by two staff, with very sketchy reporting obligations—I will be speaking more about that in the committee debate—and for the ability of the executive, who really should be the ones coming under the scrutiny of an office like this, to sanitise those reports well before they become public, if indeed they ever do become public.
While we are supportive of the office, and have been for a long period of time—and I hope that support is on the record—I have some very clear concerns about the model that the government is putting forward today; about the ability of this reviewer to actually undertake the functions that would be required of him or her. So we will be putting forward a number of amendments arising from recommendations of experts in the field, people who have been working on these issues for many years and following these debates very closely.

(Senator Hutchins)—Order, Senators! Senator Ludlam, if you would like to continue, I am sure the senators are listening. I am anyway.
—I doubt that, but I will carry on anyhow. Firstly, on the issue of staffing, the reviewer is to conduct an analysis of an enormous array of very complex terror legislation, review them every time they are used, or when the Prime Minister requests, or on the reviewer’s own motion. The staffing arrangement is not just modest, it is woeful—and I suspect deliberately so. Chair, I am just wondering whether
Hansard
has any idea what I am saying.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I know there are just 20 seconds left but Senator Ludlam should be heard. I cannot hear him from two seats in front.
—I ask my colleagues on the left, where most of the noise is coming from, to just quieten it down a bit while Senator Ludlam continues his remarks.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-02,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Chris Evans.

Does the minister agree with Labor’s key business adviser, Dick Warburton, that given the failure at Copenhagen there should be ‘a delay in whatever we do until we have a clear picture’? Given the fiasco of the Copenhagen conference and calls for the CPRS to be abandoned, why is the government again forcing the parliament to deal with its flawed legislation to inflict a massive new tax on all Australians?

",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-02-02,"—I do not think it would be fair to characterise the Copenhagen conference as ‘failed’. Clearly, the outcomes of the conference were substantial, if not all that this government sought to achieve out of it. We think international engagement on serious responses to climate change remains a huge priority both for the world and for this country. At the release of the long-awaited opposition’s policy today Mr Abbott could not answer questions about the detail—he looked to be shuffling around when asked about it. Quite frankly, it looked a fairly inadequate and pathetic response, but I am sure Senator Wong will have something to say about that at some stage in the debate.
In relation to the specifics of Senator Abetz’s question, as I recall, the figures for those who attended the conference were made available at the time and were reported widely in the press. I do not have that information—

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—I do not have it with me at the moment because, as I said, it is on the public record. I am happy to assist the senator and either refer him to the press reports or check with the Prime Minister’s office. Certainly, I know those figures were reported widely. I am happy to assist the senator if he missed them and get those from the Prime Minister’s office and make them available to him at the first opportunity.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-02-02,"—I obviously do not agree with Mr Garnaut’s characterisation of the outcome. I think there were outcomes that were worthwhile and which will help take it forward. As I said, the details about who was attending the conference were released. My understanding from a brief that has just been handed to me is that there were 68 federal government delegates and the total size of the Australian delegation to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the parties in Copenhagen was 98. So 68 were federal government delegates and the total Australian delegation was 98. I will see if I have the rest of the information that Senator Abetz requested and provide it to him.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-02-02,"—Obviously, there were a whole series of questions in there. I do not think it will come as any surprise to Senator Abetz that I do not agree with him. I do not agree with him about much. In some ways I regard him as the definition of ‘failure’. This is just another opportunity for the opposition to apply its new tactic, which is to oppose everything and try to ‘dirty up the government’, as described by the leader, rather than seriously deal with policy. I remind the opposition that at the last election they were absolutely committed to taking urgent action on climate change and were absolutely committed to a trading scheme. Under their previous leader they were absolutely committed to it. It seems they have had another policy adopted in the last day, but they have no credibility on this issue whatsoever.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,answer

Honourable senators interjecting—
—Senator Evans, please resume your seat. Senator Evans is entitled to be heard in silence on both sides. The time for debating the issue is at the end of question time. Senator Evans.
—This government is serious about taking action on climate change and is not coming up with temporary little stunts like we saw today from Mr Abbott. What we are trying to do is put in place a market based mechanism that allows us to seriously tackle the issue of climate change by putting a price on carbon and assuring that we get a market mechanism that seeks to address the enormous pollution that we emit and the impact that is having on the environment. We have decided to again seek to get the parliament to pass this very important piece of legislation. We will again give the Liberal-National Party an opportunity to honour their election commitment to the Australian people and support the emissions trading scheme. It has been the Liberal-National Party’s policy at the last election and during this term of parliament—
—Mr President, on a point of order: sessional orders require that the minister be directly relevant to the question that was asked. The question asked was, ‘By how much will electricity prices rise?’ The minister has now had 1¼ minutes out of his two minutes to start getting relevant to that matter, and I would invite you, Mr President, to draw his attention and be directly relevant to the question asked.
—Mr President, on the point of order: the minister has been answering the question. It is unfortunate that we now find another frivolous point of order being taken so early in the parliamentary year. The minister has been dealing with the question, dealing with the climate change issue that is embodied within the question and dealing with the substantive matter very well, might I say.
—Order! I draw the minister’s attention to the question. There are 47 seconds remaining to answer the question.
—Clearly, the impact of our ETS is a relevant consideration when the parliament passes the legislation. That is why we introduced it again. We want to pass the legislation. We have had two attempts in this parliament to introduce that legislation, and you have had the opportunity to debate that legislation. On some occasions you have supported it and on others you have not. The key point is that what this government did is guarantee that families would be no worse off and that we would provide compensation because we were keen on making the polluters pay. Our program was directed at making the polluters pay.
—Mr President, on a point of order: once again, sessional orders require the answer to be directly relevant to the question asked. The minister now has eight seconds left in which to advise the Senate by how much electricity prices will rise under the emissions trading scheme. I would invite you, Mr President, to indicate to the minister that if he is unable to answer the question by being directly relevant he should resume his seat.
—I cannot instruct the minister how to answer the question, as you know. I do say that repeatedly in this chamber, as you are aware. I invite the minister, in the eight seconds remaining, to address the question that has been asked by Senator Birmingham. You have eight seconds remaining.
—All the costings for the government’s legislation are on the record and have been debated twice in this parliament. I can take him through them if he wants me to.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-02-02,"—We made clear, on the basis of Treasury modelling, what the costs of our proposed ETS were. We also introduced a compensation package designed to protect households from those costs. It was designed to make sure that polluters pay—something absolutely absent in the Liberal Party’s policy released today.
We all know there are pressures on the state electricity commissions in terms of the cost of energy, but in terms of the costs attributed to the ETS proposal by this government the modelling has been done and the modelling has been made public. It has been included as part of the legislation and the debate around that legislation in this parliament—legislation that you were going to support until very recently and legislation you took to the Australian people at the last election and which you have now reneged on. We provide compensation to families and make the polluters pay.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-02-02,"—Senator Birmingham seeks to debate legislation which has twice been rejected by this parliament because of the failure of the Liberal Party to support it and to support their own election commitments. This government has made clear that you will get another opportunity to debate that legislation. We will go through the committee stage and you can make those arguments if you want. We have released the modelling the Treasury did that indicated the costs that would be faced by consumers and we also produced a package that provided full compensation for them. We wanted to make the polluters pay for the pollution they cause and the damage they do to the environment, and to protect Australian working families from the impact of the scheme. That is what we undertook to do, that is what we are still trying to do, and I would like you to think seriously about honouring your election commitment. I am asking the Liberal Party to honour their electoral commitment and to support an ETS for the nation’s future.

Leave granted.
The further information read as follows—

Senator Heffernan asked at 2.26pm on 26 November 2009:

Is the Minister aware that Energy Australia, a company owned by the New South Wales Labor government, has decided to close its productivity testing and compliance division, known as Testing and Certification Australia. Is the Minister also aware that this is the only facility in Australia that can test and certify electronic medical devices to the appropriate international standards?
I am aware that EnergyAustralia has announced plans to close some of the services offered by its subsidiary, Testing and Certification Australia. I am not aware if EnergyAustralia has made a final decision about the extent of any closure of Testing and Certification Australia's services. I am aware that Testing and Certification Australia has over time offered a broad range of testing services including having accreditation to test medical electrical devices to the AS3200 and IEC60601 series safety standards. A number of other facilities in Australia are accredited to test devices against other standards.

With regard to the national importance of such a facility, has the minister or, if he has not, his department had any discussions with the New South Wales Labor government on what can be done to ensure that Australia does not lose this important testing and certification capacity?

Neither I nor my department have had any discussions with the New South Wales government relating to Testing and Certification Australia.
Staff from the National Measurement Institute within my department have had some discussions with Energy Australia about the high voltage and high current services that Testing and Certification Australia currently offers from its facility at Lane Cove.

Will the Minister undertake to investigate this matter to ensure, in the national interest, that medical biotech industry is not placed at a distinct competitive disadvantage.

I have asked my department to investigate this matter further, to ascertain the impact on the medical biotech industry.
—I was asked today a question by Senator Troeth about enrolments and about the actual physical exclusion of a student from a school. I have yet to get information on that. But, with regard to the NAPLAN participation rate questions that went to whether a student is actually enrolled in a school and excluded from any testing: the NAPLAN participation rates are reported for each school on the website so that it is clear how many students participated in the testing. Any attempt to exclude students from the testing will be apparent from this data. That is the information that has been provided to me by the education department. Students are exempted from NAPLAN tests if they have severe intellectual or functional disabilities or if they are from a non-English-speaking background and have been learning English in Australia for less than one year. Exempt students are not included in the calculation of the school average. All Australian governments have committed to promoting increased participation of such students in the national assessment process. The national protocols for the administration of the NAPLAN test outline the agreed policies and practices for providing students with special support, adjustments and accommodation. I trust that assists the senator.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Testing and Certification Australia</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,13,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-02-02,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by Senators Abetz and Birmingham today relating to climate change.
Over a period of time that has stretched not just days and weeks but indeed months—some would even say years—but particularly during the second half of last year, the government’s emissions trading scheme was exposed. It was exposed to the Australian people and exposed by the Australian people. It was exposed as being too costly and too complex for what Australia needs to do to take responsible action when it comes to climate change and how we address environmental issues. It was exposed as having numerous flaws. It was exposed—writ large, of course—by the time this chamber took a vote last year to defeat for a second time the government’s emissions trading scheme. By that stage, everyone across Australia increasingly understood that the government’s ETS was costly and complex, would cost jobs, would cost the Australian economy and would do all of those things for little or no environmental benefit. These are the reasons that Australia has been turning ever so strongly against the government’s ETS. I have seen it in my electorate office, as I know all of my coalition colleagues—and I am sure all senators—have seen it: the strength of opinion and the strength of opposition to this ETS and to the impact it would have on Australia.

As if there was not enough doubt already, as if there was not enough scepticism in the Australian community, along came the Copenhagen summit. Along came Copenhagen, and the scepticism and doubt that existed about the merits of the government’s ETS at that stage were exposed once and for all. It was seen to be the flawed scheme that so many had been saying it was. It became quite apparent that Australia was unreasonably getting ahead of the rest of the world and that Australia and Australian families and small businesses were going to end up paying a very, very high price, thanks to this government’s desire to introduce a very costly and complex scheme ahead of any form of sensible global action.
Of course, the Copenhagen summit saw the Prime Minister head off to Copenhagen like some medieval king who took his entire court with him. Senator Evans today gave some numbers of people the government had in Copenhagen. Reports suggest that up to 114 registrations were made for Australian delegates at Copenhagen. The minister provided figures showing fewer than that—perhaps some people did not end up going. Whatever the case may be, we had dozens upon dozens upon dozens upon dozens of Australian government, state government, local government and you-name-it hangers-on going to Copenhagen for the talkfest that it ended up being. What did it produce? It produced a flimsy three-page, non-binding accord. By my reckoning there were more than 30—probably 35—people there from the Australian delegation for every page of that accord. It took 35 people to write one page of that accord, and that is all Australia got for it.
As time has gone on, we have seen that the claims the government has made about the cost of its ETS are flawed. It claimed that electricity prices would go up by 12 per cent, yet the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has recommended increases of between 21 and 25 per cent—double, or more than double, what the government says the price rise from its ETS would be for electricity. In Victoria there are reports that a Victorian energy company has asked the Australian Energy Regulator to permit it to increase costs that could see Victorian bills rise by 400 per cent in four years. Australian families and small businesses cannot afford the ongoing cost of the price rises that Labor’s ETS will impose on them. Instead, the coalition has today released a clear alternative, an alternative that will allow Australia to achieve a five per cent emissions reduction target, but to do so on a no-regrets basis—
—You don’t believe that!
—to do so on win-win basis, Senator Ludwig—a win-win basis where we can achieve real environmental outcomes, improve the efficiency of our soils, improve the efficiency of our farms, improve the efficiency of our electricity generators, get some real benefit for Australia for the long term and focus on the five per cent reduction target, rather than taxing 100 per cent of emissions as the government proposes to do and in the process pushing costs up for every Australian family and every Australian small business.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,14,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2010-02-02,"—It must be a cruel world over there in the Liberal Party for Senator Birmingham to have to make that sort of speech when only a couple of months ago he was an enthusiastic supporter of the government’s emissions trading scheme. In fact, he had been a supporter of emissions trading throughout his political career in this place. I am sure he was one of the proud supporters of the position that the previous government—John Howard’s government—took to the election. Let no-one forget that the Liberal Party went to the last election with a policy for an emissions trading scheme. That was a policy supported by those opposite right up until a number of months ago—a policy, a position, legislation that was negotiated to agreement with the Liberal Party. It was ready to be voted on after being negotiated with the Liberal Party, and Senator Birmingham was one of those senators who was enthusiastically going to support that legislation through the parliament.
Nonetheless, his preferred leader was rolled by a single vote, even though I think there were some votes missing or some votes filled out incorrectly. I think some people in the Liberal Party could not even find their way to actually vote for either of the two candidates—it is pretty hard task for some of them. But there we go, by one vote the leadership changed. Now Senator Birmingham finds himself on the front bench of the Liberal Party and has to do these cruel things. I guess that is a reflection of the cruelty of their leadership in this place, that they would make Senator Birmingham come in here and make a speech like that—a speech which he does not believe in, which about half of the Liberal Party do not believe in. What was really surprising was that I thought when the first speaker got up in this debate, after their lead questions in question time today, he would be promoting their scheme. As 4½ minutes went by I was wondering whether he would ever actually get to their policy at all. Then, with 30 seconds to spare, Senator Birmingham brought himself to acknowledge that today they announced a policy. But was there any detail of that policy? Did he try to sell it? No, because he knows it is a hollow policy, it is an absolute con job. It puts no cap on pollution. What it says is that you can continue to pollute as much as you like and we will get the taxpayer to pay by implementing regulation. There will be no market based solution but, simply, the taxpayer will pay for the costs of pollution on which we will put no tax.
I know Senator Birmingham is a little bit embarrassed about this whole thing, and I am not surprised that he is now leaving the chamber. I think we will be here at some point in time when the wiser heads in the Liberal Party have gone back to the policy that they know was the correct policy in the first place. They did know at one point in time that the cost of failing to act was to be far greater than the cost of acting. They also knew that the best way to control emissions was by putting a cost on pollution—making the polluters pay and then using that money to drive technological change and to subsidise the community for the extra costs that would be applied through making those substantial steps. That is what it was going to be: charge the polluters and subsidise the community. They have thrown that out. They knew at one point in time that that was the best way to achieve reductions in emissions—they knew that.
One of the other really disturbing and, I think, sad things about our legislation going down late last year was the behaviour of the Australian Greens. The Australian Greens, who say that they want to do something about climate change, stood shoulder to shoulder with the sceptics and the deniers on that side of the chamber and voted to do nothing about saving the environment. They voted to do nothing about reducing emissions in this country. They stood shoulder to shoulder in support of the deniers and the sceptics, and they ought to be condemned too. The Australian people ought not to be sucked in or fooled by the Australian Greens. When they say that they want to do something about the environment, that they stand for doing something for the environment, let no-one forget that in this place they had an opportunity to support this government in doing something about climate change but they voted to do nothing. They stood shoulder to shoulder with the deniers and the sceptics and voted to do nothing about climate change and our environment—and the Australian people ought not forget that. They will stand equally condemned as the Liberal Party.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,14,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-02,"—It is great to be back here and to see that the Labor Party feels that the most important thing before our nation right now—more important than the Haitian earthquake, more important than that we have some tremors once more on financial markets and that shares are starting to question whether China is closing down its credit, more important than any of that—is Labor’s ETS. That is the most important thing for the Labor Party. Let us make sure that we understand the Labor Party’s Maslow hierarchy of needs, what is most important in their lives. No. 1 is the Labor Party’s ETS. That is the most important thing.
They did such a great job at Copenhagen. Copenhagen was such a roaring success! Every night I turned on I could see the snow falling, I could see the canals freezing over and I felt like ringing up and saying: ‘Ease up guys. You’re going too hard. Pull back a bit on the reins. You’re too good at it.’ What did we achieve out of all of this? Imagine where Australia would be right now if that ridiculous policy had actually got through. We would be sitting out there as the most peculiar political object in the world, as an economic basket case brought into place by the Labor Party.
Let us go through some of the Labor Party hyperbole. First of all, they laud the process—‘This is a market based scheme.’ They are dead right; it is a market based scheme. It was designed to put up the price of goods so that you cannot afford them. That is what this was designed to do and that is what it would do to the pensioners of Australia. That is what it would do to the working families of Australia and that is what it would do to the farmers of Australia. You moralise about them putting up their prices but then you say, ‘No, tarry a while, because we will give you some of your own money back.’ This is supposed to be logical. So they take the money from you and then they give it back. That is not even market based; that is confusion, except to the point where you make people’s lives miserable, where you make the price of air conditioning out of the reach of the pensioner, where the transport price on food makes it out of the reach of the people who probably do not earn the wages we do. You start putting these imposts on their lives because of your pride and overwhelming desire by the Prime Minister and Minister Wong to be the omnipotent force. They know better than all of us; they know better than all the people who rang this building. They know better than everybody. If only people knew how smart they were, they would realise how blessed we are to have them! This is the sort of Labor Party we have.
I am going to quote your famous prime minister who always said, ‘If you do not understand a tax, do not vote for it.’ I say back to the Australian people quite clearly that: if you do not understand it, do not vote for it. Unfortunately, that would mean half the Labor Party cannot vote for it either because no-one understands it. It is worse than Kafka’s
Castle. It is noodle nation. It is everything bound up into an environmental economic train wreck. That is what we are about to get. And then Paul Keating said, ‘If you did understand it, you would never vote for it.’ That, of course, is chapter 2.
I want to add another addendum to the wisdom of Paul Keating and this is it: ‘I’m glad you brought it back because I want to do you slowly.’ I want to do you slowly. I want you sitting over there every day talking about the ETS. I want it being broadcast that what you want to deliver to the Australian working family, to the Australian public, is a massive new tax, because that is all it is. That is your benevolence to them. I can see you all barging out of the chamber because you do not want to be here. You want to be a million miles away from this and the polling is saying the same. The voters are waking up to it because all of a sudden they have realised that this massive new tax is money in your pocket and a cost to them—a cost to working families, a cost to pensioners, a cost to everybody. The trouble is that in the long term people cannot afford it.
You want to talk about the coalition policy. It is quite clear. I will give it to you quite succinctly—$3.2 billion. For the greatest moral issue of our time I think we can afford $3.2 billion. Our policy is succinct and understandable; yours is just a complete and utter cluster. That is what we are going to do to you over the next few weeks. I hope you keep it here for as long as possible because I am going to really enjoy these next couple of weeks.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,14,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-02-02,"—It is good to be back, of course—back into the zone where you can stand up and say what you want to advance. From the contributions so far today we have heard that some people on that side of the chamber forget nothing, they learn nothing, they change nothing and they come to this debate as they came to it last year—with ignorance, with prejudice. Their solution is one of fearmongering and cost imposition.
One also has to say by way of introduction that there is a significant degree of inconsistency in the approach of the opposition. A little less than three years ago, then under the leadership of Mr Howard, the Liberal and National coalition committed to an emissions trading scheme and they maintained that commitment under successive leaders—Mr Howard, Dr Nelson and Mr Turnbull. Then, all of a sudden, because things were going so badly and they had to change their leadership and their approach, they changed their policy from that which they had had for the best part of three or four years and that which they had communicated to the Australian people to the position recently put by Senator Joyce—a nothing position which goes nowhere, a position which advocates no change and requires no significant change and a position which has no costings.
Climate change, global warming, and the need for action was an absolute priority last year, is a priority this year and will be a priority for this government for the foreseeable future. We know that climate change and global warming is having all sorts of harmful effects across this continent and around the world. We say there needs to be change. We say there needs to be action, and there needs to be an agreed position worked out at an international level to introduce and bring that change. That will have benefits for everyone in this country: the working families, farmers, small business, large companies, ordinary consumers. We need change that is going to assist them and bring benefits short-term and long-term into their lives. That was what we went to Copenhagen for. To a large degree, that was what was achieved at that conference.
We know—as outlined in today’s press—that a number of important steps were achieved and taken at Copenhagen. I will tell you what those steps were, because they are not a bad foundation for going forward across the world on an agreed basis to bring a solution to this issue of climate change and an emissions trading scheme around the world. What happened? For the first time, leaders agreed to hold any increase in global temperatures to at or below two degrees centigrade. For the first time, leaders of all nations—developed and developing nations—agreed to take action to deliver on that central core objective. For the first time, leaders agreed to a framework for national and international monitoring of what developed and developing .countries will do on this issue going into the future. Again, for the first time, leaders agreed on the need for considerable financial support for emissions reduction and adaptation in developing countries. Not a bad set of achievements achieved by hard negotiation and clear-sighted vision some weeks ago in Copenhagen. Not a bad set of achievements and not a bad set of foundations on which you can build an ETS in this country going forward. We know where we are going and we know what the costs are going to be. As I say, overall, a pretty neat set of achievements.
What is the government’s position? The government’s position is quite clear. It was outlined by Senator Wong in the press today; it has been outlined repeatedly by the Prime Minister in a set of interviews given today. Let us be clear. We do not say that climate change is easy. We do not say a climate change solution or addressing the problem of climate change is easy. We do not say it is going to be quick. But we do say that there is a way forward. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-02,"—If ever you want to see a political party run scared over an issue, have a look at the Labor Party over the Emissions Trading Scheme, the so-called Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The speakers in this debate from the Labor Party do not even believe what they are saying. We happen to know that many Labor senators would dearly love to have had the courage to vote with us the last time it came before the Senate. The last thing they want to do is have to sit through another debate in the Senate on the same piece of legislation that most of them do not agree with.
The only thing that Copenhagen achieved—apart from proving what we on this side of the chamber had all been saying for months—is that it showed that Senator Wong and Mr Rudd and 114 other various bureaucrats and hangers-on had a lovely little holiday in Copenhagen for two or three weeks visiting the mermaid and having a jolly good time around the halls of some six-star hotels. It achieved absolutely nothing, as we predicted it would in the debate in this Senate in December.
What is worse for the Labor Party is that their policy is now in tatters—it is an absolute shambles; people are dropping off it as quickly as they can. To make matters worse for the Labor Party, today we had the next Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, releasing a practical, down-to-earth, direct action policy which will reduce carbon emissions by five per cent. It will cost the Australian people $3.2 billion over the next four years as opposed to Mr Rudd’s ETS—his big tax on everything—of $40.6 billion over the same period. Compare that! I will re-emphasise it. Our scheme, to get a five per cent reduction—$3.2 billion in four years. The Labor Party’s scheme to get a five per cent reduction in the same period—$40.6 billion.
Not only am I excited about the Emissions Reduction Fund, which we will talk about at length when we have a lot more time, but I am very excited that the other elements of our policy released by Mr Abbott today are great for those of us who live in Northern Australia. There is a lot of sunshine up my way. Under our policy, there will be $1,000 on top of what is now made available—a grant by the government for solar power and solar hot water. The solar towns and schools program—an initiative of the Howard government—is being enhanced under Mr Abbott’s policy. The significant tidal movements we have up in the north-west of Australia, particularly along the Kimberley coast—that tidal energy that has been spoken about for years—will now get a $50 million fund to fully investigate the initiative of tidal renewable energy and geothermal energy.
There is a $5 million fund, to be matched by the industry sector, to allow the testing of algae energy. I am pleased to say that is being pioneered at James Cook University in Townsville. This fund will be set up to confirm and ensure that that algal energy process does reduce CO2 emissions and does not impact on food production.
Our policy released by Mr Abbott today has 31 pages of detail and the Labor Party’s ETS policy that was released before the last election had three lines of detail—three lines of detail as opposed to 30 pages of detail. I re-emphasise in concluding that our policy will reduce emissions by five per cent by 2020 at a cost of $3.2 billion over the next four years and the Labor Party’s proposal, the carbon emissions trading scheme, will also reduce emissions by five per cent by 2020 but at a cost of $40.6 billion over the next four years.

The Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee report
Australia’s judicial system and the role of judges
was a unanimous report. I want to thank my fellow committee members, Senators Crossin, Feeney, Fisher, Ludlam and Trood and the participating members—our shadow Attorney, Senator George Brandis, and Senator Bill Heffernan—for their participation in this committee. The inquiry commenced in February last year and we reported in December just last year.
It was a lengthy inquiry. It was one of the most enjoyable and informative inquiries that I have been involved with in my time here since 2002. I very much appreciated the opportunity to learn more about the merit of the national judicial system that we have here in this country, the role of judges and their important place in our Constitution. In particular I want to draw to the attention of the Senate and the public the fact that we had 44 submissions and we had hearings in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Canberra. It was a lengthy inquiry but worthy of very important consideration.
The terms of reference were reasonably broad. They looked at the procedures for appointment and method of termination of judges, the term of appointment and the merit of full-time, part-time and other arrangements, jurisdictional issues, the interface between the federal and state judicial systems, and in particular the judicial complaints handling system. It is the latter point in particular that had a lot of interest in terms of the submissions and in the presentations made at the hearings we had.
The judicial complaints handling system is certainly something that is in need of reform. I am not going to great length other than to say that some of the key recommendations were set out in the report. In fact there were 16 and I just want to highlight some of the recommendations in the report. I know that the government is giving this serious consideration and I appreciate that on behalf of the committee members and the committee participants. At this juncture I do want to thank the secretariat, Peter Hallahan and his team, Toni Dawes, who has just recently resigned from the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, and I thank her for her support, and Cassimah Mackay and the team at the secretariat.
We have recommended that the High Court of Australia adopt a written complaint handling policy and make it publicly available. It will be interesting to hear the response to that at the Senate estimates next week when we have the opportunity to address them on that matter. We have recommended that all Federal Courts publish quarterly complaint handling summary status reports, and we have made recommendations about the appointment of federal judicial officers. We support a nationally consistent compulsory retirement age for judicial officers and encourage each jurisdiction to implement it within the next four years. The committee has recommended that at the next Commonwealth referendum section 72 of the Constitution should be amended in relation to the compulsory retirement age for judges. Currently it is 70 years, and the committee is of the view that it should increase perhaps to 72 years or thereabouts, essentially to provide that the federal judicial officers are appointed until an age fixed by the parliament. This would provide some flexibility, and I think there is a lot of common sense in that recommendation. Again, I hope the government and all members of parliament support such an approach.
We made recommendations in respect of the merit of short- and long-term part-time working arrangements. We had issues in Tasmania, for example, which were quite precarious and controversial, where the Attorney made appointments down there which were certainly against the best interests of the public in Tasmania. There were other examples put to the committee so we have made recommendations there.
Probably the main recommendation out of this report is in favour of the establishment of a federal judicial commission modelled on the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. It would include three functions in particular: it would include a complaints handling system; it would assist the courts to achieve consistency in sentencing; and it would provide a service for the judicial education of our judges wherever they may be around the country. In that regard, I notice that the Tasmanian Attorney-General has accepted our second proposition. They have just announced in the last seven days a better and more consistent approach to providing sentencing and assisting judges in the judging and sentencing arrangements.
The committee felt strongly that the current avenues of complaint are seriously inadequate. They need to be improved and upgraded. We have quoted in the report Sir Anthony Mason, who said:
… the constitutional procedure does not address cases of misconduct or incapacity which are incapable of justifying removal. A judge may be guilty of delay, discourtesy, gender bias or of less serious misconduct which does not justify removal but could merit an expression of disapproval, a caution or counselling by a head of jurisdiction.
We go further to say that there should be an independent national judicial commission that would be established and ensure that that process was not only done fairly and properly but would be seen to be done fairly and properly, and we give further evidence in that regard.
We had an informal tour of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. On behalf of the committee, I want to put on record our thanks to Mr Ernest Schmatt PSM, Chief Executive of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, for his tremendous support and encouragement and the informative review he provided to members of the committee and the secretariat with respect to what is happening in New South Wales. That commission was established in 1986 and is regarded highly not only in Australia but around the world. It is an excellent system that operates well in New South Wales. I commend him and the New South Wales commission. It is that prototype that we are recommending at the national level.
There has been a lot of media on this topic, and on our report in particular, since the December release of the report. I know that even today in the
Australian Financial Review
there is a call for a national judiciary which is supported by New South Wales Chief Justice Jim Spigelman. I notice that the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, called critics of the reform process short-sighted and said that ‘the government would consider unilateral action if necessary to ensure the reforms came to fruition’. We have recommended that the functions currently fulfilled by the National Judicial College of Australia be incorporated into a new judicial commission and that legislation be introduced into the federal parliament to establish a national judicial commission.
On that note, I commend the report to the Senate. I think there is a lot of merit in it. The feedback since the report was released has been very positive. Of course budgetary constraints are very important, but I note that in New South Wales there is $5.1 million for the Judicial Commission per year. One-third of all the judicial officers in Australia operate in the New South Wales courts. So I think in terms of cost benefit, the benefits will flow as a result of the establishment of the commission. I commend the report to the Senate and look forward to receiving feedback from the government in due course.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-02,"—I want to add some remarks to the chair’s comments on item 4 of documents presented out of sitting, which was the second report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. The committee undertook, in parallel with the inquiry into the judicial system and the role of judges, an inquiry into access to justice. It was held under the broad framework of looking at a review of all the work that has been done on this in Australia, through various committees inside and outside of parliament, over the last 10 or 15 years. It came to the very strong conclusion that committees have long been making recommendations about access to justice—specifically the asymmetries in people’s ability to access justice—and that most of the recommendations from the various committees, going back 10 or 15 years, still remain unaddressed to this day.
I am really proud of the work that the committee undertook, under Senator Barnett as chair but with solid contributions from all parties and everybody who got involved in this inquiry. I particularly mention the helpful assistance received from the committee secretariat, including Mr Peter Hallahan, who is probably going to be mentioned a number of times today, who really went beyond the call of duty. A lot of witnesses appeared before this committee to basically tell us, ‘This needs to be the last time we turn up. We’ve been telling parliamentary committees for 10 years that access to justice in this country is, in some senses, broken.’ People were using words like ‘crisis’ or ‘beyond crisis’.
What we are specifically referring to, really, is the difficulties that are faced by the community legal sector in representing people who find themselves caught up in the judicial system for one reason or another. That applies right across the board, whether it be family law, environmental law or any other kind of matter. There is an enormous hierarchy in this country when it comes to access to justice. Unfortunately, in some cases, through structural inequalities in our justice system, the kind of justice that you can access comes down to the size of your cheque book.
We established the inquiry in February of last year. We spent six months on this project. We took 68 submissions and held four public hearings. We reported late last year, with 31 recommendations that were unanimous right across the parliament. I think many of them will be very familiar to the government or to people who have been following this debate for a while because they are indeed recommendations that committees have been making for a long period of time. What we looked at were the longstanding gaps in our legal system and the fact that if people who seek legal help need to draw on Legal Aid or access the community legal sector, sometimes that help simply is not there. We do not even have a clear idea of the unmet need.
What we do know is that Aboriginal people, and particularly Aboriginal women, are singled out as the people least able to access justice under the Australian system. This is for a variety of reasons, whether it be the complexity of the legal system, a lack of resources—which is obviously the big one—remoteness, in some cases, or language barriers. People speaking English as a second or third language have been dragged into the court system for things that are simply incomprehensible. Right before the committee reported, we saw in the press reports of a kid who was detained for being in possession of a stolen Freddo frog. He was an Aboriginal kid in regional Western Australia. That very strongly underlined exactly the findings of the committee that Aboriginal people are viciously overrepresented in our legal system and that there are very important structural reasons for that.
Many of our recommendations go directly to the urgent resourcing of Legal Aid and the community legal sector more broadly. I think these recommendations are very well timed. They need to go into the government’s budget considerations for budget round 2010. What we need to see in this area in the forthcoming Commonwealth budget is structural funding underpinning the health of the legal system so that people actually can access justice. Everybody who presented before us was grateful that the Attorney-General had put a bandaid on a badly leaking and bleeding system. They were glad that there was some interim funding there to allow the community legal sector to survive, but everybody acknowledged that that is not the way to go forward. We need structural, ongoing funding to remove the gross inequities, distortions and asymmetries in our legal system in Australia.
As I said, the recommendations that were made were unanimous. There is actually very little in the report that I disagree with, because of the collaborative approach that was taken by everybody who participated in this inquiry, but there were a number of points that we felt were very important to make in addition, without undermining the work that the committee has done unanimously. The first recommendation we made was that the current purchaser-provider funding arrangement be abolished, because that is one of the things that has led to the structural asymmetry and people in community legal centres being simply unable to fund the retention of solicitors, researchers or people to run the basic operations at CLCs. The further you get from the big cities, the harder it gets to run these operations and the harder it is to retain staff.
Another recommendation we made was that there should be a right to legal representation. Without a bill of rights, and without these things spelt out in our Constitution, the right to legal representation in Australia is highly ambiguous. What we are finding with the skyrocketing number of self-represented litigants in our court system is that it is a disaster for many of those people, and it also unnecessarily ties up the courts with matters that should not have been referred to court or could have been dealt with more rapidly if people had adequate representation in the court system.
In one of the hearings we held in Sydney a matter was raised around the Migration Act 1958 which absolutely stood out as an urgent piece of law reform for us. Ms Skye Rose, project manager, and John Corker, president, of the National Pro Bono Resource Centre gave evidence to the .committee in Sydney last September about these provisions. Sections 468E and 468F require lawyers to provide a certificate stipulating that there are reasonable prospects of success in the matter, which enables cost orders to be made against lawyers in unsuccessful cases. I do not know whether there is anything else in any statute in Australia that requires that kind of undertaking from lawyers. And obviously it has a really chilling effect on people’s ability to access representation—some of the most vulnerable and marginalised people who are finding their way into the court system. So one of the recommendations we made was that that should simply be repealed without further debate.
There is another things that I think would have been a helpful recommendation to get into the majority report. You will notice that many of the recommendations we made signal the need for urgent research in different areas of law reform. We proposed that a legal resources research centre be established—as did a number of submitters and witnesses—that would basically wrap some of these different proposals for far-reaching law and policy research to be undertaken under one roof. We thought it was quite a good proposal. There is a model in the UK, the UK Legal Service Research Centre, which provides us with a reasonable template for the sort of thing we are talking about in Australia. It could undertake qualitative and quantitative research, along with some of the theoretical analysis that simply is not done in Australia at the moment, apart from in an ad hoc way when a committee visits some of these particular issues. So we believe that compiling all that data and getting all that research under one roof would make the government’s job easier and would certainly provide some of the research clout that we simply do not have in Australia at the moment.
In closing, I would again like to thank the Chair, and the Deputy Chair, Senator Crossin, for the collaborative way in which they undertook this work; Chiara Lawry, who was working in my office at the time, who did an enormous amount of work in preparing the materials for us and reading through the submissions; and the committee secretariat and staff. There is a really urgent call to action in this report. While we are standing here in this parliament, many hundreds of people are sitting in Australian jails who probably should not be there, and many hundreds of people are forced through tortuous processes in various courts around the country who do not necessarily need to be there. And we are not just discovering this now; it has been a matter of record since well before I got here.
I hope the government will read this report and undertake to implement the recommendations that come from right across the board from all parties and most urgently make sure that in the budget considerations this year we help some of the people who are struggling, under enormous pressure, to represent people through the court system. Ultimately, any one of us at any given time could find ourselves in these situations. But, of course, we in this chamber do not live under the conditions of people who find themselves entangled in the court system with no resources and no backup whatsoever. I very much commend this report to the Senate, and I look forward to seeing on budget night that we begin to address some of the longstanding concerns that have been raised.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-02-02,"—I rise as shadow Attorney-General to make a few observations in relation to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee entitled
Australia’s judicial system and the role of judges. In doing so, I commend in particular the work of Senator Barnett, who, as I know better than most, has been pursuing this matter with great tenacity and deep knowledge for a very long time—since he has been a senator—and the fruit of his pursuit of this issue is largely now embodied in this report. I have not yet had the opportunity to read the report in full but, having examined the recommendations and some of the discussion in this report. it seems to me that this will become one of the most important reports that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee has produced for a very long time—and I think Senator Barnett can take considerable credit for the outcome.
The opposition, as it finalises its policies in relation to the area of the reform of the judiciary going into the 2010 election, will look very, very carefully at the recommendations contained in this report. I just want to make some particular observations on one matter, and that is the question of judicial exchange, the relationships between the federal and state judiciaries and the question of the development of a national judiciary. I do that particularly informed by the fact that, last night in Sydney, the Chief Justice of New South Wales, Justice Spigelman, gave a very important speech in which he called for the creation of a nationally integrated judiciary. That is an issue that was addressed by the committee, and the committee was influenced in particular by an important paper given by the current Chief Justice of Australia, Chief Justice French, when he was a member of the Federal Court, at the 2004 Colloquium of the Judicial Conference of Australia. The paper was called ‘Judicial exchange: the courts’. The committee was very attracted to Justice French’s suggestion that there should be regular exchange between state and federal judicial officers, at equivalent or near to equivalent levels, so that they might hold, in effect, reciprocal temporary commissions in one another’s courts so that the objective of fostering a more unified national outlook among judges sitting on both the federal and state jurisdictions would be furthered. That would most particularly occur in the process of exchange between state supreme courts and the Federal Court.
In the paper which so influenced the committee, Chief Justice French—or Justice French, as His Honour was then—called for:
… a comprehensive system of horizontal and vertical judicial exchanges throughout Australia with a view to advancing:
1. Individual judicial performance.
2. The performance of the courts as institutions.
3. Allocation of national judicial resources to areas of local need including the need for specific expertise.
4. The attractiveness of judicial appointments in all jurisdictions.
5. Consistent Australia-wide approaches to the administration of justice while maintaining healthy institutional pluralism.
6. National collegiality between Australian judges.
I pause to say that the cause of the development of collegiality between Australian judges has itself been much advanced by the work of Chief Justice French and others through the Judicial Conference of Australia. But I want to make the point—particularly in view of what Chief Justice Spigelman said in Sydney last night—that there is a big difference between a system of judicial exchanges, which for various reasons rehearsed by Justice French in his paper in 2005 and for other reasons as well has a lot to commend it, and the development of an integrated national judiciary. They are two quite different things. A system of judicial exchanges may be a pathway to the ultimate development of an integrated national judiciary, but it is not the same thing.
The committee, I think very appropriately, expressed caution about the desirability of a national judiciary. At page 56 of the report the committee says it is ‘cautious about what can be achieved through a national judiciary’. I think the parliament should be very slow to embrace calls for an integrated national judiciary. The Australian judicial system reflects the federal nature of our polity. The fact that there are state and territory supreme courts with particular jurisdictions, which are quite separate from although often overlapping with the jurisdiction of the federal courts under chapter 3 of the Constitution, is an important feature of our system. May I say on behalf of the opposition, and in this we share the view of the committee, that I would be very slow and sorry to see the autonomy of state supreme courts and territory supreme courts eroded by the integration of those courts into a uniform national judiciary, which would inevitably be dominated by the federal judicial system, by Commonwealth courts.
So, while welcoming and being rather attracted to the idea of greater harmonisation and further fostering of judicial collegiality through intercourt exchanges and joint commissions, the opposition does not support the idea of a single, integrated, national judiciary. It is a profoundly antifederal proposal. It would be dominated by the Commonwealth and also I suspect by New South Wales, whose Supreme Court is, in terms of the throughput of cases, the busiest and most powerful court in the land, if not in terms of where it lies in the tier of appellate structures then certainly in terms of the volume of work that that court commands. So the idea that Chief Justice Spigelman suggested in his speech last night is not one that recommends itself to the federal opposition.
Having said that, in the areas of judicial exchanges, judicial complaints handling procedures, which is another matter that this report addresses, recruitment to the judiciary and the protocols which ought to govern that, which is another important area that this report addresses, there are many very useful and thoughtful recommendations in the report. It is a bipartisan report and the opposition will consider them carefully. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

—As you know from Senator Ludlum’s contribution, I chaired the
Access to justice
report, which was commissioned in February last year and reported in December last year. It was a lengthy report and it was an honour to chair that committee with Senator Crossin as the Deputy Chair, Senator Feeney, Senator Fisher, Senator Ludlam, who has spoken in the chamber, and Senator Trood. It is a unanimous report with additional comments from the Australian Greens. I just wanted to thank those other members of the committee and also at this stage to thank the secretariat for their work, not just Peter Hallahan but also Monika Sheppard. She has done a powerful amount of work with respect to the preparation of this report and she has been very diligent throughout the committee process. As I indicated, it is a lengthy report. We had hearings in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra and received 71 submissions. I want to thank all of those who presented to our inquiry.
Just briefly: basically, we do need a re-examination of the access to justice issues. That is what the report did. I think it pushed the envelope. It reviewed the earlier reports of March and June 1997, July 1998 and June 2004, so we went back a fair way to get a comprehensive look at the importance of access to justice in our nation. We discovered and confirmed that there are many members of our community who do not the have access to justice that they should. There are many impediments to accessing justice and potential means of improving that access to justice. We did criticise the overall levels of funding and we accepted that the legal aid system was not adequately funded and needed further reform. We have made 31 recommendations in total. I want to refer to a few of them. In particular, I want to highlight those promoting the pro bono work of the legal profession. I want to thank on record those in the legal profession involved in pro bono work. The work that is undertaken is tremendous. Many people probably are not aware of the extent of it. The report highlights this. I place on record on behalf of the committee—and, indeed, those in this chamber—our thanks for the work that they do.
We made recommendations with respect to encouraging small- and medium-sized legal firms to further participate in the provision of pro bono legal work. Likewise, we recommended the federal, state and territory governments create and fund a specific disbursement fund for pro bono matters, with eligibility criteria designed to promote the provision of pro bono legal services by the private legal profession. Senator Mary Jo Fisher, who is not in the chamber at the moment but who participated, was particularly keen to recommend that incentives be considered to encourage lawyers to practise in rural, regional and remote areas. I and other members of the committee strongly support that. We are keen for the government to respond to the report as soon as possible and we have indicated that we hope it will do so by March 2010, but hopefully it will be sooner.
With respect to Tasmania and the number of Tasmanians refused legal aid—and this is set out in the report—I made comments in July last year; my understanding is that the figures have not changed. Specifically, 200 Tasmanians—or 10 per cent of all applications for legal aid—are refused each year due to lack of funding. This figure was based on advice from Norman Raeburn, Chair of National Legal Aid, who confirmed the above evidence in answering a question from me in a Senate committee hearing in Melbourne in July last year. Mr Raeburn said that the Legal Aid Commission of Tasmania was the only one in Australia that refuses aid on the basis of a lack of money. The commission confirmed this in a letter to an applicant, where it said, ‘You passed all our tests but we do not have enough money today to help you.’ This is unsatisfactory. This is inadequate. That type of approach has been brought to the government’s attention, and they need to deal with it—and fast.
The Legal Aid Commission of Tasmania advises the federal Attorney-General of how many of these cases are refused every quarter. Interesting, Mr Raeburn indicated that other states, including Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland, perhaps were in a similar position through lack of funds. I do not know exactly what the government will do in response, but they should definitely provide a response—and quickly. I am not going to go through all of the recommendations in light of the time but I do want to put on record that the committee has received a letter from John Corker, Executive Director of the National Pro Bono Resource Centre and note a media release by that centre on 9 December 2009. I just want to place on record that we note that correspondence and its contents. It expresses the view that the centre was misquoted and a recommendation of the committee was based on that misquote. The committee notes the suggestion at the end of the letter:
It is suggested that the correct interpretation of our evidence would lead to a recommendation as follows:
2.87 The Committee recommends that state/territory governments and legal professional associations throughout Australia take such steps as are necessary to: …
Ensure that all classes of practising certificate authorize the holder to undertake pro bono legal work, including those issued to government employees;
It concludes:
Otherwise may I congratulate you, fellow committee members and staff on an excellent report.
Yours sincerely
John Corker
Executive Director
I note that correspondence. It is taken into account. I think we are at one in terms of our objective: to support pro bono work wherever possible. In conclusion, I just wanted to also note while we are talking about access to justice and legal fees that, with respect to the Rudd Labor government, there seems to be record spending on legal fees. This is a point that has been noted recently, including by the shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis. Legal fees may be worse than first thought; according to a new report, spending on lawyers on 2007-08 rose $100 million to $510 million and then to $555 million in 2008-09. That is despite Mr Rudd’s pre-election promises to cut spending by $15 million per year after the first budget. He promised to cut funding by $ 15 million and that spending would go down. But what has happened? It has actually gone up by almost three times that. Instead of $15 million less, it is $45 million more—three times more than what he had predicted. That is just another broken promise by the Rudd Labor government. Shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, pointed out:
Not only will the Rudd Government break its election promise, but its own review has found the election promise was not a sensible commitment in the first place.
That is from the
Australian Financial Review
of 12 January. Labor’s spending on legal fees is just another broken election promise. This is one of the concerns that I—and I know others on this side of the chamber—have with respect to the waste and mismanagement of our economy and specifically of the Attorney-General’s portfolio. That approach and behaviour should stop. In conclusion, the report is worthwhile and contains many recommendations. It is nearly 170 pages in length and it is worthy of consideration. I look forward to the government’s response. I thank the Senate.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-02-02,"—I would also like to make a few observations on the
Access to Justice
report.Unlike the other report under consideration—into the judicial system—which is about structures, access to justice is, in the end, about resources; it is about money. There are two observations I want to make following Senator Barnett’s contribution. First of all, anyone who works in the Australian legal system knows that the legal aid system is in the worst crisis it has ever been in right now—right now. And, as answers that were given to me in Senate estimates last year revealed, there has been a reduction in Commonwealth funding through the state and territory legal aid commissions, through which the Commonwealth supports the provision of state and territory legal aid. At the same time—and this is really the point that Senator Barnett was trying to illuminate—there has been a blow-out in the Commonwealth expenditure on the acquisition of Commonwealth legal services by the Commonwealth government and Commonwealth agencies. It seems to me that if ever you wanted an example of a grievous resource misallocation it is that the people who are most needful of access to justice are having Commonwealth support for legal aid withdrawn at the same time as the Commonwealth’s expenditure on its own procurement of legal services through the Commonwealth government and its agencies is expanding at an extravagant rate. The priorities are all wrong.
As a person who practised at the bar for 14 years and practised at various times at all levels, including early in my career in the magistrates court, I feel very strongly about the issue of access to justice. It is a fundamental right. When you have a system access to which and outcomes from which depend importantly on the capacity to be represented by those trained in the law and trained in the system, access to justice for lawyers is what access to doctors is for the health sector. It is a disgrace that the resource allocation and the priorities of the Rudd government, as this report highlights, have devalued access to justice. It is not even a social justice issue; it is a functional issue. If people cannot be represented by competent professionals, then they cannot avail themselves of justice through the courts. It is as simple as that.
Let me illustrate my concerns with an anecdote. Last year I was visited by some people—I will not say who they were, it was a private conversation, but people representing the legal aid sector—and they explained to me the crisis that has befallen access to justice in this country at the moment. I said, ‘What, in terms of the increase in the allocation of Commonwealth funding, would it take to fix the system?’ This particular gentleman said to me: ‘An extra $180 million per annum would probably fix it, but it would be a close run thing. If you invested an extra $250 million per annum in the system then we could restore a reasonable level of Commonwealth funding to facilitate access to justice.’ I paused and I looked at this particular gentleman, and I said to him, ‘Do you realise that the Commonwealth government has just announced that it is going to spend 12 times that much money on pink installation batts?’ That is why I say it is a resource allocation issue.
—Priority!
—It is a priority issue, as Senator Barnett rightly says. Every time we hear a number with a billion after it being committed by the Rudd Labor government on expenditures which are not always wise and not always economically efficient, just think that a quarter of that, a quarter of a billion dollars—what for this extravagant government seems almost like small change—is what it would take to fix legal aid in this country. So why don’t they do it? Not only do they not do it, while they commit resources extravagantly and wastefully elsewhere, they defund the state and territory legal aid commissions and they extravagantly waste money on the Commonwealth procurement of legal services themselves. It is an appalling misallocation resources for which the government must take responsibility.
Finally, I am glad that Senator Barnett raised the pro bono contribution of the private legal profession, which is seldom acknowledged. People, I think, particularly Labor politicians, tend to delight in the caricature of lawyers as greedy, mercenary individuals with no social conscience. I am sure there are such people in the legal profession, but most members of the legal profession I know, including the big commercial law firms, by the way, take the pro bono obligation very, very seriously. There are a lot of the most successful and wealthiest lawyers in this country who devote a substantial proportion of their professional time to pro bono work. It is time that that was acknowledged, and I am glad this report does so. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-02-02,"—I present the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee,
Independent arbitration of public interest immunity claims, together with the
Hansard
record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I would like to place on record that I found this a very interesting inquiry. It explored some important concepts which, at first blush, have a certain appeal. The idea around this is basically to have an independent arbiter to determine whether public interest immunity claims which government use to prevent tabling of documents or to resist orders of a parliament, usually an upper house, is a valid process for this place to consider. Indeed, some parliaments have this enacted—in Victoria, in New South Wales and, most recently, in the Australian Capital Territory. It does have an instant appeal because you think it is going to provide increased transparency which will mean that governments will not be able to hide behind what may or may not be spurious claims to withhold information from the transparency of the parliament. Having said that, it was the committee’s view—I note there are some other comments—and my view that the process of an opposition seeking to obtain documents from a government and a government claiming public interest immunity grounds for failing to release the documents is part of the combative cut and thrust of the parliamentary process, and indeed to allow an independent party to assess the validity or veracity of the claims of government may indeed ultimately compromise the operation of the executive. That came out through the process.
We discovered that in some jurisdictions where this process is enacted, and indeed under the proposal put before this chamber for the committee to consider, the independent arbiter who was appointed would not be able to look at the documents in question. So he just has to assess whether the government is telling the truth or not. An opposition can do that just as effectively. That was in the proposal for us to consider
Another aspect of it is that there is simply no meaningful penalty which this place, the Senate, could place on a minister in the other house who fail to comply, short of suspending a member of the government or the executive from this place for a period of time, which is what they have done in Victoria. It really makes it, I would guess, a toothless tiger.
I note in the dissenting report of the Greens—I am sure Senator Ludlam will have some comments on this—and Senator Xenophon, who joined the Greens’ dissenting report, they proposed amendments to amend some of the notable flaws in the proposal which was examined. Once again, I feel that the parliamentary process and the role and responsibility of this place, and the combative nature of politics, ensure a workable executive resolution. They ensure that public interest is served and that, where governments have been exposed as being deficient in providing adequate transparency the parliamentary system, they are held to account.
Other concerns raised were whether there was legal authority for the parliament to delegate certain powers. There was certainly some conflicting information given because Sir Laurence Street, who, I understand, acts as the arbiter on many occasions in New South Wales, considers that he has delegated powers from the New South Wales Legislative Council; whereas, we were advised that it is specifically prohibited for the parliament to delegate powers. So there is an opportunity for a legal dispute. Frankly, I am not sure that our courts or our esteemed legal minds should be determining what is appropriate with the Senate dealing with the executive. I think that can be best resolved through the parliamentary process itself.
There is also the potential for misuse. We heard anecdotal evidence. Indeed, there was a reference toThe Hollowmen—it was described as ‘apocryphal evidence’—that cabinet documents are not able to be subject to this procedure and process. There was some suggestion that simply placing a pile of documents in a wheelbarrow and wheeling it through the cabinet room prevented them from being disclosed in this manner. Other suggestions were that, if in the event documents which were key to the function of government and perhaps commercial-in-confidence may be requested under this process but were of such sensitivity, some of the public servants may indeed be encouraged to provide only verbal advice rather than written advice. Once again the committee considered this an inappropriate avenue for this parliament and the independent advice of the Public Service to take.
In short, as I said before, at first blush, at first glance, at first consideration, while there is an appeal attached to having an independent arbiter, I feel that the proposal that was put for the committee to consider is flawed. I acknowledge that there are some steps and recommendations from the Greens and Senator Xenophon about how that can be improved, but I do believe that on balance it offers a number of potential consequences which are not worth this parliament taking. Clearly, others have a different view. But in the balance of considering that a government needs to be allowed to get on and govern, and an executive needs to have the right balance between accountability and transparency but also confidentiality, it is the committee’s recommendation that this proposal not proceed.
In concluding my remarks, this is my final inquiry as chair of the committee. I thank all of those who participated on the committee. I found it a very interesting inquiry and would also like to thank Stephen Palethorpe and the secretariat for their assistance, and all the witnesses who provided their time and their expertise. Many of them are very highly credentialled and whilst many of them were very supportive of the proposal they outlined a number of flaws in it. Indeed, some of those have been identified by the Greens and Senator Xenophon.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,25,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-02,"—I was certainly interested to hear those comments and I thank Senator Bernardi for chairing that inquiry. I found it very interesting as well, possibly for some slightly different reasons. I want to provide a bit of context as to how this inquiry came about in the first place.
A couple of months ago—actually, probably nearly a year ago—Senator Minchin came to us and wanted to know whether we were interested in supporting a motion in the Senate that would prevent any debate on legislation related to the National Broadband Network roll-out until the government had handed over the documents involved in the $4½ billion request for proposals for the original NBN. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, had effectively crashed that tender and announced, with the Prime Minister, a project effectively 10 times the scale and that there would be no public release of the documents that had led to that decision being made. Senator Minchin’s contention—which after a bit of thinking we agreed with—was that it was in the public interest for those documents to be tabled, inasmuch as that was possible for the government, so that the parliament—and through us, the community—could make a decision as to the thinking and the decision making behind one of the largest public infrastructure proposals, if not the largest, that this country has ever seen.
Minister Conroy said, ‘I can’t give you those documents and I don’t need to provide any reasons as to why I can’t. They are commercial-in-confidence and you can’t have them.’ At that point you have a classic deadlock between the legislature and the executive. The executive, through Minister Conroy, was saying, ‘You can’t have these documents. I don’t have to provide you with a statement of reasons as to why, and there is just not a great deal that you can do about it.’
As a result, the cross benches, with the support of the government at the time, proposed this inquiry into what happens when the legislature and the executive are deadlocked in this way. It is a problem that has come up time and time again. That is why Senator Bernardi was sketching earlier that there have been some approaches in Victoria and New South Wales—and most recently in the ACT—to try to break this deadlock.
The current case might be about the NBN documents, and that matter is still unresolved. We have to take Minister Conroy’s word for it because the government is under no compulsion to hand over those documents. This proposal, and what the Finance and Public Administration Committee was required to look into, was a method for breaking this deadlock and other deadlocks like it which occur not often, but often enough to be a recurring theme: that the executive is able to basically able to say, ‘You can’t have that material and you just have to trust us as to why not.’
What Senator Bernardi did not mention was that every single witness who appeared before the committee on our one day of hearings, and every submission, was supportive of just such an instrument of the Senate and the executive agreeing that an independent arbitrator should be able to make the decisions as to whether—on sight of the documents or not—it is in the public interest for the material to be made public or not. Every witness was supportive—with the exception of officers from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who had no opinions at all about anything. We heard from some of the best minds in the country—people intimately involved at a Commonwealth level or at a state level in Victoria and New South Wales with the way this sort of instrument has been operating elsewhere—and every one of them was supportive. They went to the trouble of pointing out the flaws in the draft motion which the Greens and Senator Xenophon have acknowledged in our dissenting comments. But they went one step further, none of which was picked up in the majority report of the committee, which was to provide the solution and amendments to the motion to actually make the system work.
Professor Anne Twomey, whose thoughtful comments were cited throughout the majority report as reasons to not proceed, and her evidence was leaned on very heavily in the draft that we received from the major parties, said that there were some problems; they were resolvable and reconcilable. I asked her, ‘Are you in favour on balance of an instrument like this operating?’ She said: ‘Well, yes. On balance I think it is a good idea. Despite all my complaints about the New South Wales system I think overall, in principle, it is a good idea. It has just not operated terribly well in New South Wales but I think it could operate better in the Senate.’ That quote did not make it into the final copy of the committee’s report because the major parties basically have agreed that in the matter of these kinds of deadlocks they would simply rather back down.
I would be fascinated to see Senator Minchin’s take on this when we come back, probably in a week or two, to debate NBN legislation that is actually not prepared to press the point and get the minister to hand over the documents to somebody independent, an umpire, that allows the Senate to then stand back and say, ‘Well, as it turns out the minister was right. It is not in the public interest for those materials, or part of those materials, to be released, so in that case we will back off. But at least it has been to an independent set of eyes and we are not having to trust Minister Conroy on this.’ As I recall, it is a matter of $4½ billion which has now been magnified 10-fold.
Every other witness had something similar to say. They made contributions on the problems and some of the issues that might arise if such a motion were to be carried and then they proposed solutions. For anybody who is interested in that, those solutions are now a matter of record because we have summarised them in the dissenting report. The chair, presumably with the collusion of the Labor Party members of the committee, could not be bothered to do just that—to show what the solutions are.
The majority report problematised the proposal that we put without making the obvious next step of improving the model. It is left to the cross benches to do that. I am very happy to do so but I have to shake my head at the failure of the opposition at least to take this opportunity to hold the government and the executive to account. Here is a golden opportunity right now to work constructively with the cross benches and government senators and government members to solve a longstanding issue of what happens when the legislature and the executive are deadlocked in this way.
We have learned enough from Victoria and New South Wales—both from what those systems have in common and from what they have in contrast to the Senate—to be able to propose a model that will actually be quite a good fit for current Senate practice and custom and to resolve the issues that the majority report identifies but then neglects to solve. One of the issues that was raised was hypothetical executive hostility: ‘The government won’t like it, so we won’t bother proceeding down this track.’ That is an extraordinary abdication of our responsibility as members of Senate committees—and I have seen them work much more collaboratively than this one did. We should go on the front foot and say, ‘Executive hostility is not an excuse to not proceed with this kind of instrument, because here is a way, actually, of breaking this kind of deadlock.’ Ironically enough, the majority report notes:
... the committee’s view is that more accountability benefits will be achieved when the Senate and the executive work together to develop mutually agreeable strategies for resolution of public interest immunity claims ...
And then they voted down and rejected an entirely workable strategy for doing exactly that. Hand these decisions over to somebody independent and we will abide by the judgements of that person in the form of an independent arbitrator.
There are a number of other proposals that the Australian Greens and Senator Xenophon have put forward in this dissenting report which would go, I think, quite a long way to easing the concerns that were raised by witnesses and the concerns that were raised quite justifiably by Senator Bernardi just then, who sat down before taking the obvious next step of proposing what the solutions would be. We have a pretty cut and dried example here of the major parties being at the behest of the executive—and for what reason the opposition takes this view I have absolutely no idea. I can understand the government taking this view but certainly not the opposition. If it falls to the cross-benchers to be the genuine opposition in this case then I am happy to step into that role. But this is an unnecessary squandering of a perfectly good opportunity to make some real progress on this issue.
To give you one example of the things Senator Bernardi said: ‘There is nothing in this motion that says that the arbitrator should be given copies of the documents in question.’ Granted. Understood. Let us change that in the motion. Let us not just sit down without proposing that as an obvious amendment to the motion so that we can move forward. I am really disappointed that this is the way the major parties have chosen to engage with this. I certainly will not give up. This is a long-running issue that has quite a bit of precedent behind it and no doubt much ahead of it. I think eventually we will—through some circumstances perhaps a bit more enlightened than what we are having to sit through today—resolve this issue in a manner that allows the Senate to do what it has obviously been designed to do. People who drafted the Constitution wanted this house to be able to hold the executive to account in exactly these kinds of matters. That is what we are here to do.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,25,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-02-02,"—I endorse the remarks of my colleague Senator Ludlam. I signed off, along with the Australian Greens, with respect to this dissenting report. I must say that Senator Bernardi is known for his plain speaking on a whole range of issues. But on this one I must say that his handling and his justification for this particular approach, the approach of the committee, and effectively the approach of the opposition and the government in terms of public interest immunity claims are very disappointing. The fact is that the excuses given by the committee in its majority report not to act are just woefully inadequate. I think Senator Ludlam made reference to the committee saying, ‘We don’t want to cause hostility with the executive arm of government.’ That is just laughable. The role of the Senate, the house of review, is to appropriately and thoroughly scrutinise what the executive arm of government is doing. That is what we are meant to be doing. We are meant to be a watchdog for Australians in terms of the executive arm of government. When you consider what the committee has come up with, that is an abdication of the Senate’s responsibility in order to do what we are meant to be doing.
We need to also consider the context of why this committee reference occurred in the first place. Senator Ludlam has amply set that out in terms of the NBN and the fact that Senator Minchin, I believe quite appropriately, was pursuing further details from the government in relation to this. The fact that the government is not prepared to look at reform in relation to this area—and neither, it seems, is the opposition, despite the fact that this goes against its very interests in terms of what the opposition is trying to achieve in this context of the NBN documents—I think is something that will not be without consequences. I believe the government will regret taking the position it has in the context of further debates, in the context of the NBN, and in the context of the Telstra legislation.
The fact is that the expert witnesses before this committee made it clear that the proposal could be improved on, the proposal could be made workable, the proposal could be very effective. Associate Professor Twomey argued that the Senate had a greater chance of developing a cooperative model than New South Wales and Victoria because:
I think the Senate does show cooperation and has not taken things to an extreme, and that is probably one of the virtues of the Senate ... If, for example, the Senate does not receive the documents that it wants and it is unhappy about it, the strongest action it seems to have taken in the past is things like extending question time or making it difficult for governments to get their bills through on time. But it has not gone to the extent of suspending ministers and the like.
Associate Professor Twomey made it clear that there is a way forward; that the Senate, because of the way that the Senate functions in order for the Senate to do its business, relies on a process of cooperation and relies on a cooperative model; and that this would work.
The former Clerk, Harry Evans, was also confident that the requisite cooperation between the executive and the Senate could be achieved and discussed the incentives with the executive to cooperate with the proposed scheme. Harry Evans made the point:
I suppose the incentive for the executive government to agree to this sort of proposal is that it will avoid those constantly recurring cases in the future, which end up with the government being accused of engaging in a cover-up and the public not knowing whether it is a cover-up or whether it is not.
That, to me, is the key to this. This is about transparency. This is about multibillion-dollar contracts that affect every taxpayer. I see Senator Joyce is in the chamber as the shadow finance spokesperson. I have not had a chance to publicly congratulate him on his elevation. Senator Joyce has been consistently calling for the need for transparency to ensure that taxpayers get value for money in terms of deals that are done, that the process of spending is transparent and that we are not left with an unnecessary debt.
How are we supposed to do our job properly if public interest immunity is being used as a shield, as a cover, for decisions of government that could cost taxpayers many billions of dollars without the checks and balances that a process of independent arbitration of such claims can lead to? That is why with my colleagues the Australian Greens—and I am very grateful for the work that Senator Ludlam has done on this—I support a number of practical recommendations: that the information commissioner, should the Freedom of Information Reform Bill be passed, be required to report annually to the Senate on the veracity of government claims of public interest immunity, which implies that the commissioner has a role to look behind those claims of public interest immunity; that an independent arbitrator be appointed where there are disputed claims; that the Auditor-General provide independent advice if a claim involves commercial-in-confidence matters; that the President of the Senate may issue guidelines to the independent arbitrator setting out the manner in which the arbitrator’s discretion ought to be exercised; and, finally, that there be a scheme for resolving these disputes of public interest immunity with respect to Senate orders for documents.
These are practical measures. These are things that can work. We have heard from the expert witnesses that these matters are practical and can be implemented. Instead, the committee—the government and the opposition—in the majority report, in a hand-wringing exercise extraordinaire, is saying, ‘We can’t change things; we’ll leave things as they are.’ I think there are consequences for taking such a blinkered approach to such an important issue. If the government and the opposition think that is the end of it, then they ought to think twice, particularly in the context of the NBN legislation that will be coming up shortly. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-02-02,"—I present the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee,
Independent arbitration of public interest immunity claims, together with the
Hansard
record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I would like to place on record that I found this a very interesting inquiry. It explored some important concepts which, at first blush, have a certain appeal. The idea around this is basically to have an independent arbiter to determine whether public interest immunity claims which government use to prevent tabling of documents or to resist orders of a parliament, usually an upper house, is a valid process for this place to consider. Indeed, some parliaments have this enacted—in Victoria, in New South Wales and, most recently, in the Australian Capital Territory. It does have an instant appeal because you think it is going to provide increased transparency which will mean that governments will not be able to hide behind what may or may not be spurious claims to withhold information from the transparency of the parliament. Having said that, it was the committee’s view—I note there are some other comments—and my view that the process of an opposition seeking to obtain documents from a government and a government claiming public interest immunity grounds for failing to release the documents is part of the combative cut and thrust of the parliamentary process, and indeed to allow an independent party to assess the validity or veracity of the claims of government may indeed ultimately compromise the operation of the executive. That came out through the process.
We discovered that in some jurisdictions where this process is enacted, and indeed under the proposal put before this chamber for the committee to consider, the independent arbiter who was appointed would not be able to look at the documents in question. So he just has to assess whether the government is telling the truth or not. An opposition can do that just as effectively. That was in the proposal for us to consider
Another aspect of it is that there is simply no meaningful penalty which this place, the Senate, could place on a minister in the other house who fail to comply, short of suspending a member of the government or the executive from this place for a period of time, which is what they have done in Victoria. It really makes it, I would guess, a toothless tiger.
I note in the dissenting report of the Greens—I am sure Senator Ludlam will have some comments on this—and Senator Xenophon, who joined the Greens’ dissenting report, they proposed amendments to amend some of the notable flaws in the proposal which was examined. Once again, I feel that the parliamentary process and the role and responsibility of this place, and the combative nature of politics, ensure a workable executive resolution. They ensure that public interest is served and that, where governments have been exposed as being deficient in providing adequate transparency the parliamentary system, they are held to account.
Other concerns raised were whether there was legal authority for the parliament to delegate certain powers. There was certainly some conflicting information given because Sir Laurence Street, who, I understand, acts as the arbiter on many occasions in New South Wales, considers that he has delegated powers from the New South Wales Legislative Council; whereas, we were advised that it is specifically prohibited for the parliament to delegate powers. So there is an opportunity for a legal dispute. Frankly, I am not sure that our courts or our esteemed legal minds should be determining what is appropriate with the Senate dealing with the executive. I think that can be best resolved through the parliamentary process itself.
There is also the potential for misuse. We heard anecdotal evidence. Indeed, there was a reference toThe Hollowmen—it was described as ‘apocryphal evidence’—that cabinet documents are not able to be subject to this procedure and process. There was some suggestion that simply placing a pile of documents in a wheelbarrow and wheeling it through the cabinet room prevented them from being disclosed in this manner. Other suggestions were that, if in the event documents which were key to the function of government and perhaps commercial-in-confidence may be requested under this process but were of such sensitivity, some of the public servants may indeed be encouraged to provide only verbal advice rather than written advice. Once again the committee considered this an inappropriate avenue for this parliament and the independent advice of the Public Service to take.
In short, as I said before, at first blush, at first glance, at first consideration, while there is an appeal attached to having an independent arbiter, I feel that the proposal that was put for the committee to consider is flawed. I acknowledge that there are some steps and recommendations from the Greens and Senator Xenophon about how that can be improved, but I do believe that on balance it offers a number of potential consequences which are not worth this parliament taking. Clearly, others have a different view. But in the balance of considering that a government needs to be allowed to get on and govern, and an executive needs to have the right balance between accountability and transparency but also confidentiality, it is the committee’s recommendation that this proposal not proceed.
In concluding my remarks, this is my final inquiry as chair of the committee. I thank all of those who participated on the committee. I found it a very interesting inquiry and would also like to thank Stephen Palethorpe and the secretariat for their assistance, and all the witnesses who provided their time and their expertise. Many of them are very highly credentialled and whilst many of them were very supportive of the proposal they outlined a number of flaws in it. Indeed, some of those have been identified by the Greens and Senator Xenophon.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,25,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-02,"—I was certainly interested to hear those comments and I thank Senator Bernardi for chairing that inquiry. I found it very interesting as well, possibly for some slightly different reasons. I want to provide a bit of context as to how this inquiry came about in the first place.
A couple of months ago—actually, probably nearly a year ago—Senator Minchin came to us and wanted to know whether we were interested in supporting a motion in the Senate that would prevent any debate on legislation related to the National Broadband Network roll-out until the government had handed over the documents involved in the $4½ billion request for proposals for the original NBN. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, had effectively crashed that tender and announced, with the Prime Minister, a project effectively 10 times the scale and that there would be no public release of the documents that had led to that decision being made. Senator Minchin’s contention—which after a bit of thinking we agreed with—was that it was in the public interest for those documents to be tabled, inasmuch as that was possible for the government, so that the parliament—and through us, the community—could make a decision as to the thinking and the decision making behind one of the largest public infrastructure proposals, if not the largest, that this country has ever seen.
Minister Conroy said, ‘I can’t give you those documents and I don’t need to provide any reasons as to why I can’t. They are commercial-in-confidence and you can’t have them.’ At that point you have a classic deadlock between the legislature and the executive. The executive, through Minister Conroy, was saying, ‘You can’t have these documents. I don’t have to provide you with a statement of reasons as to why, and there is just not a great deal that you can do about it.’
As a result, the cross benches, with the support of the government at the time, proposed this inquiry into what happens when the legislature and the executive are deadlocked in this way. It is a problem that has come up time and time again. That is why Senator Bernardi was sketching earlier that there have been some approaches in Victoria and New South Wales—and most recently in the ACT—to try to break this deadlock.
The current case might be about the NBN documents, and that matter is still unresolved. We have to take Minister Conroy’s word for it because the government is under no compulsion to hand over those documents. This proposal, and what the Finance and Public Administration Committee was required to look into, was a method for breaking this deadlock and other deadlocks like it which occur not often, but often enough to be a recurring theme: that the executive is able to basically able to say, ‘You can’t have that material and you just have to trust us as to why not.’
What Senator Bernardi did not mention was that every single witness who appeared before the committee on our one day of hearings, and every submission, was supportive of just such an instrument of the Senate and the executive agreeing that an independent arbitrator should be able to make the decisions as to whether—on sight of the documents or not—it is in the public interest for the material to be made public or not. Every witness was supportive—with the exception of officers from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who had no opinions at all about anything. We heard from some of the best minds in the country—people intimately involved at a Commonwealth level or at a state level in Victoria and New South Wales with the way this sort of instrument has been operating elsewhere—and every one of them was supportive. They went to the trouble of pointing out the flaws in the draft motion which the Greens and Senator Xenophon have acknowledged in our dissenting comments. But they went one step further, none of which was picked up in the majority report of the committee, which was to provide the solution and amendments to the motion to actually make the system work.
Professor Anne Twomey, whose thoughtful comments were cited throughout the majority report as reasons to not proceed, and her evidence was leaned on very heavily in the draft that we received from the major parties, said that there were some problems; they were resolvable and reconcilable. I asked her, ‘Are you in favour on balance of an instrument like this operating?’ She said: ‘Well, yes. On balance I think it is a good idea. Despite all my complaints about the New South Wales system I think overall, in principle, it is a good idea. It has just not operated terribly well in New South Wales but I think it could operate better in the Senate.’ That quote did not make it into the final copy of the committee’s report because the major parties basically have agreed that in the matter of these kinds of deadlocks they would simply rather back down.
I would be fascinated to see Senator Minchin’s take on this when we come back, probably in a week or two, to debate NBN legislation that is actually not prepared to press the point and get the minister to hand over the documents to somebody independent, an umpire, that allows the Senate to then stand back and say, ‘Well, as it turns out the minister was right. It is not in the public interest for those materials, or part of those materials, to be released, so in that case we will back off. But at least it has been to an independent set of eyes and we are not having to trust Minister Conroy on this.’ As I recall, it is a matter of $4½ billion which has now been magnified 10-fold.
Every other witness had something similar to say. They made contributions on the problems and some of the issues that might arise if such a motion were to be carried and then they proposed solutions. For anybody who is interested in that, those solutions are now a matter of record because we have summarised them in the dissenting report. The chair, presumably with the collusion of the Labor Party members of the committee, could not be bothered to do just that—to show what the solutions are.
The majority report problematised the proposal that we put without making the obvious next step of improving the model. It is left to the cross benches to do that. I am very happy to do so but I have to shake my head at the failure of the opposition at least to take this opportunity to hold the government and the executive to account. Here is a golden opportunity right now to work constructively with the cross benches and government senators and government members to solve a longstanding issue of what happens when the legislature and the executive are deadlocked in this way.
We have learned enough from Victoria and New South Wales—both from what those systems have in common and from what they have in contrast to the Senate—to be able to propose a model that will actually be quite a good fit for current Senate practice and custom and to resolve the issues that the majority report identifies but then neglects to solve. One of the issues that was raised was hypothetical executive hostility: ‘The government won’t like it, so we won’t bother proceeding down this track.’ That is an extraordinary abdication of our responsibility as members of Senate committees—and I have seen them work much more collaboratively than this one did. We should go on the front foot and say, ‘Executive hostility is not an excuse to not proceed with this kind of instrument, because here is a way, actually, of breaking this kind of deadlock.’ Ironically enough, the majority report notes:
... the committee’s view is that more accountability benefits will be achieved when the Senate and the executive work together to develop mutually agreeable strategies for resolution of public interest immunity claims ...
And then they voted down and rejected an entirely workable strategy for doing exactly that. Hand these decisions over to somebody independent and we will abide by the judgements of that person in the form of an independent arbitrator.
There are a number of other proposals that the Australian Greens and Senator Xenophon have put forward in this dissenting report which would go, I think, quite a long way to easing the concerns that were raised by witnesses and the concerns that were raised quite justifiably by Senator Bernardi just then, who sat down before taking the obvious next step of proposing what the solutions would be. We have a pretty cut and dried example here of the major parties being at the behest of the executive—and for what reason the opposition takes this view I have absolutely no idea. I can understand the government taking this view but certainly not the opposition. If it falls to the cross-benchers to be the genuine opposition in this case then I am happy to step into that role. But this is an unnecessary squandering of a perfectly good opportunity to make some real progress on this issue.
To give you one example of the things Senator Bernardi said: ‘There is nothing in this motion that says that the arbitrator should be given copies of the documents in question.’ Granted. Understood. Let us change that in the motion. Let us not just sit down without proposing that as an obvious amendment to the motion so that we can move forward.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-02,"—I rise today in support of the
Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009. It is very important, with things such as the Foreign Investment Review Board and foreign acquisitions and takeovers, that we consider wanting not only our nation to be a vessel for the wealth of other nations but our involvement in our nation’s wealth to remain paramount among our concerns. We only have one country to live in and we have a responsibility not only to those who are part of Australia now but to those who will be part of Australia into the future—our children and grandchildren. We have a responsibility to hand over to them a legacy of wealth that they can use to support the desires and requirements of their lives. It is extremely important that we are prudent and have good oversight into exactly how the wealth of this nation is invested in by other countries.
The bill updates the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, the legislation which provides the basis for the Treasurer to rule on investments in Australian businesses and assets by foreign companies to ensure that they are in our national interest. Importantly, the bill explicitly requires foreign investors to notify the government when the types of acquisitions, investments or arrangements could deliver influence or control over an Australian company. The most significant aspect is that this requirement applies both now and in the future. This is mainly due to the fact that since the act came into force there have been a number of changes in financial structures, making them considerably more complex.
The current act does not adequately cover all modern investment arrangements. Lately, we have seen the more opaque way that investment has been carried out in our nation. We need more clarity in how we deal with this. By way of explanation, I will take a moment to outline how the foreign investment process works. Submissions are made by potential investments to the Foreign Investment Review Board, a non-statutory body which was established in 1976—it must have been by the coalition government—to advise the Treasurer on the government’s foreign investment policy and its administration. Its role is to examine the proposals and then make recommendations to the Treasurer. To the best of my knowledge, in the past generally the recommendation the Treasurer gets is one to approve. It might be to approve with conditions, but generally it is one to approve—and that is a debate for another day.
I thought it would be useful to provide some statistics from the Foreign Investment Review Board—FIRB, as it is known—to outline the significance of this growing investment sector. In its most recent annual report, which details activities in 2007-08, FIRB received and considered more than 8,500 requests—an increase of 22 per cent on the previous year. Nearly 8,000 investment proposals worth nearly $200 billion were approved in 2007-08. Of these, nearly 80 per cent were subject to conditions in one form or another, major or minor. The majority of these considerations were real estate projects rather than mining or other major propositions. Of those approved, most were in the mineral exploration and development sector. The value of these approvals was $64.3 billion—double the value of approvals in 2006-07, which is a sure sign of the strong desires by foreign investors to invest in our mining sector as they see it as having a great capacity for future wealth. The real estate sector ranked second, with a value of $45.5 billion—more than double the value of approvals in 2006-07. Services was the next most valuable, at $35.7 billion—an increase of one-fifth. Manufacturing approvals had a value of $31.3 billion—again, double that of the previous year.
The final decision on the fate of each proposal ultimately lies with the Treasurer. An important point I wish to make in supporting this bill is that it does not alter the role of the Treasurer in this regard. If the Treasurer decides the deal is going forward, the deal is going forward; if the Treasurer decides the deal is to stop, the deal is to stop. Another important point is that this bill contains no changes to the national interest test. While neither the act nor this bill defines this concept, the Foreign Investment Review Board understands it to mean that the government determines that it is contrary to the national interest by having regard to widely held community concerns of Australians. We have seen those concerns clearly ventilated in recent times. This allows for interpretation by the government of the day as it deems appropriate. It is important for us to acknowledge once more—and this has been elucidated in statements by people such as Peter Costello—that the Foreign Investment Review Board is almost exclusively in favour, maybe in favour with conditions, but in favour, of approvals.
The most recent example of the Treasurer exercising his right to amend an application was the case of China Minmetals Nonferrous Metals Company, known as Minmetals. This application was to purchase 100 per cent of OZ Minerals. But the section of OZ Minerals pertaining to Prominent Hill, which is in South Australia near Woomera, was prohibited. However, this did not stop Minmetals being allowed to purchase other significant mineral assets, the major one being what was formerly Century Zinc and now the second-largest open-cut zinc mine in the world. That is now owned by Minmetals, and of course we have to recognise that Minmetals is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Chinese government. That in itself raises concerns among the public and those concerns should be acknowledged in this chamber.
In order to help further safeguard our national interest this bill broadens the definition of what has to be reported to the government by potential foreign investors. It amends four definitions in the act: ‘aggregate substantial interest’, ‘potential voting power’, ‘substantial interest’ and ‘voting power’. The current meaning of ‘aggregate substantial interest’ is 40 per cent or more of the voting power of the issued shares. The bill redefines it as two or more persons taken together holding at least 40 per cent of the voting power, potential voting power, issued shares or rights to issued shares. This potential voting power refers to the number of votes that could be cast if it is assumed that a future right is exercised. ‘Substantial interest’ is currently defined as 15 per cent or more of the voting power of the issued shares. The bill changes this definition to holding at least 15 per cent or more, or one or more of the potential voting power, issued shares or rights to issued shares. ‘Voting power’ is currently defined as the maximum number of votes that can be cast at a general meeting. It has been clarified to explicitly include potential voting power. So the concept of assessment has been broadened.
The coalition believes that foreign investment in Australia is in Australia’s national interest. It provides the capital that is needed for a range of projects; it generates local wealth and creates jobs. We acknowledge that there has been a large involvement of foreign investment in the development of our nation. Our history and the wealth of this nation have been developed by foreign investment. In order to illustrate this point I will share with you a few examples of foreign investment by Japanese investors. We know that the development of the coalfields in Central Queensland was greatly assisted by investment from Japanese companies. Kestrel mine, for instance, 40 kilometres north-east of Emerald in Central Queensland, is an underground project which supplies world markets with up to 4.2 million tonnes of coking and thermal coal each year. Japanese trading house Mitsui holds a 20 per cent share in this mine. Blair Athol mine, 20 kilometres north-west of Claremont in Central Queensland, supplies Asia and Europe with 12 million tonnes of thermal coal each year. J-Power Australia Pty Ltd holds eight per cent and Japan Coal Development in Australia holds 3.4 per cent.
But we must acknowledge that at the start of this investment, especially by the Japanese, they were in joint ownership agreements, with Australian investors owning the majority. Those requirements have changed and there are concerns now, especially in what state owned enterprises might do with 100 per cent ownership of mines. This is a concern that is held and it is a concern no doubt the Foreign Investment Review Board looks at when considering investments. Hail Creek mine is located 90 kilometres south-west of Mackay in Central Queensland and supplies Asia and Europe with eight million tonnes of hard coking coal each year. Nippon Steel Australia Pty Ltd holds eight per cent, Marubeni Coal Pty Ltd holds 6.67 per cent and Sumisho Coal Development holds 3.33 per cent.
The mining leases that these coalmines are part of are paid substantially to state governments, especially to the governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. The royalty income that flows from them goes a long way to propping up the finances of some of these state governments. We have to acknowledge, though, that sometimes there is a clash of interests when we see the mining interests and the interests that are held below the ground and the interests of those who hold the land above. That is evident in such places as the Liverpool Plains, especially around Breeza, at the moment. We are seeing it once more in areas such as around Toowoomba. These are the sorts of interests we also expect the Foreign Investment Review Board to have a mind to—the interests of the Australian people as represented by Australian farmers and Australian food producers. We want to make sure that those people are not unduly compromised by the development that is brought on board by foreign interests—or, in some instances, by domestic interests.
We have a problem at the moment because the finances of the state governments are so parlous that they have an insatiable desire to sell mining leases. They cannot manage the books and they are doing everything they possibly can to bring in money from wherever they can find it. Their idea, which we are seeing more and more among Labor governments at a state level, is that, if it is not nailed down, they are going to sell it because they have basically run out of money. In Queensland we are seeing a peculiar juxtaposition of lauded environmental credentials with commercial considerations, as the Queensland government so earnestly tells people what they can do above the ground while having no hesitation about selling anything below the ground. The reason for that is they make hundreds of millions of dollars from selling what is below the ground, and this is a situation that is leading to some of the concerns. For instance, there is their overnight moratorium on any further drilling for water in North Queensland for the rural sector. However, they have no problem with selling mining rights up there, they have no problem with selling anything that is under the ground and they have got no problem with going around Toowoomba and selling every mining lease they can find.
These are concerns which I hope that, in a true, open and frank discussion in the future, the Foreign Investment Review Board may look at. This legislation is certainly heading in the right direction, but there are certainly issues that need to be clarified, resolved and improved, and, with that purpose in mind, the coalition will be supporting this legislation.",SENATE,<title>FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-02-02,"—There is no question that foreign investment is crucial to Australia. It boosts economic growth, it can ensure competitive industries, it creates jobs and it can increase exports. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the stock of foreign investment in Australia as at 31 December 2007 totalled $1.6 trillion. However, it remains crucial that these investments be monitored, that, in the context of foreign investment approval, there be appropriate regulations and, above all, that they be in the national interest and never at the expense of our local industries in the short or long term.
As at 31 December 2008, the United States and the United Kingdom where the largest foreign investors in Australia with 24.8 per cent and 24.3 per cent respectively. Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore were ranked third, fourth and fifth while China was ranked 15th. But China’s interest in Australia is growing, and I welcome the fact that Australia and China have a strong and positive bilateral relationship of mutual benefit to both countries. In 2006, China’s investment in Australia was around $3.5 billion. In the financial year to June 2009, investment applications from China rose to $10 billion and by the end of this financial year they are forecast to hit around $30 billion. Indeed, Treasurer Wayne Swan has previously noted that since November 2007 he has approved Chinese investment applications at an average of one every nine days.
Under the current Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, determinations are assessed by the Foreign Investment Review Board according to a national interest test which is designed to have:
… regard to the widely held community concerns of Australians.
During the recent Senate Economics Committee inquiry into foreign investment by state owned entities, Mr Patrick Colmer from the Foreign Investment and Trade Policy Division of Treasury was asked when a foreign investment might be considered bad for Australia. Interestingly, Mr Colmer advised the committee:
If you look back at the cases that we have rejected, you can see that we have not rejected outright very many at all.
He went on to say:
In fact our best information is that 16 cases have been rejected since 1990. That is out of something in the order of, on average, about 500 business cases a year.
The national interest test conducted by the Foreign Investment Review Board currently follows six principles, based on whether:
An investor’s operations are independent from the relevant foreign government …
An investor is subject to and adheres to the law and observes common standards of business behaviour …
An investment may hinder competition will lead to undue concentration or control an industry or sectors concerned …
An investment may impact on Australian government revenue or other policies …
An investment may impact on Australia’s national security …
An investment may impact on the operations and directions of an Australian business, as well as its contribution to the Australian economy and broader community.
According to the explanatory memorandum for this bill:
… foreign investors—
will be required—
to notify the Government where there is a possibility that the type of arrangement being used will deliver influence or control over an Australian company, either currently or at some time in the future.
This compulsory requirement will be applied in tandem with the Foreign Investment Review Board’s current assessment, but certainly places extraordinary trust in the foreign investor to comply with this mandatory reporting provision and assumes that the investor would be willing to give insight into their future business plans. Although I do agree with Senator Joyce that this is a step in the right direction, I believe that it ought to go much further. Given this, the current assessment test by the Foreign Investment Review Board needs to be tightened to further ensure that any and all foreign investment is in Australia’s national interest. To deal with these concerns, I move the following amendment in my own name and that of Senator Ludlam:
At the end of the motion, add:

               

but the Senate calls on the Government to bring forward the changes to law and policy necessary to ensure that:

           

(a)
 

foreign governments cannot use corporate vehicles they control to purchase strategic assets within Australia;

           

(b)
 

for non-state-owned entities, a ‘related entity’ test is applied, so that different entities under the same ultimate majority control are treated as one entity in assessing whether an acquisition will result in more than 10 percent of control of any strategic asset market in Australia;

           

(c)
 

the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), in considering decisions on foreign ownership, is required to assess whether Australia has reciprocal rights of investment in the proposer’s country;

           

(d)
 

effective laws are in place to prevent creeping acquisitions by foreign, state-owned entities of Australian businesses and assets;

           

(e)
 

the FIRB provides clear criteria of what the ‘national interest’ test is;

            

(f)
 

abbreviated versions of FIRB advice to the Minister are tabled in both Houses of the Parliament;

           

(g)
 

clear definitions are advanced of ‘community interest’ and ‘common standards of business behaviour’, and major investment proposals are subjected to rigorous public scrutiny to ensure that they meet genuine common standards of business behaviour; and

           

(h)
 

the human rights records of the country of state-owned entities seeking to invest in Australia be a key factor during consideration by the FIRB, and that all foreign non-state-owned entities be subject to consideration of their other investment activities and whether these conflict with Australia’s ethical positions.
As I mentioned earlier, Australia welcomes foreign investment for the benefits it offers in boosting economic growth, ensuring competitive industries, creating jobs and increasing exports. But it cannot and must not be at the expense of our ability to remain competitive in the national and international marketplace and it cannot and must not enable another nation to have indirect control over Australia’s independence, governance, ethics or values.
The Foreign Investment Review Board should, as part of its considerations for any investment proposal by a foreign entity, acknowledge its possible consequences, which go far beyond a simple monetary investment, including ethical considerations, and its impact on consumers as well as its broader political ramifications. It is important, for instance, that foreign governments are not able to use corporate vehicles they control to purchase strategic assets in Australia.
Investment may come in many forms, and one may be from state owned entities, such as those from China—there are a number of state owned entities from China that are seeking to invest here in Australia. The implications of this on a political level must be considered and the question must be asked: do we know the outcome when a dispute arises with an entity that is majority state owned by another nation?
When there is a dispute between two corporate entities, the matter is normally taken to court or to a system of arbitration and a ruling made that is abided to by both parties. However, when a dispute about a corporate matter involves another nation’s government, matters such as bilateral trade agreements and broad diplomatic relations come into play. Commercial considerations can be subsumed by purely political considerations, with potentially adverse consequences for consumers and also for the national interest.
In early 2009 aluminium maker Chinalco sought approval to buy a $27.69 billion stake in Rio Tinto’s strategic mineral assets. Had this purchase gone through, it would have increased the stake of Chinalco, a Chinese government state owned enterprise, in Australia’s second largest resource company from 11 to 18 per cent and would have given the Chinese government-owned company two board seats. There was very real concern about the impact that this could have had on the price of one of our strategic assets. I said then and I still believe this now—and I note that Senator Joyce and I did some advertisements in the media opposing this deal—that it does not make sense for an arm of the Chinese government to be in a position to control and set the prices of Australian resources. Furthermore, the reverse question has to be asked: would the Chinese government allow an Australian company to have such a stake in one of its key strategic assets?
Investment offshore is as vital to Australian companies as it is to foreign investors seeking to enter the Australian market. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian investment abroad was worth $884 billion at the end of 2007. So the case of reciprocity must be raised. We allow into Australia foreign investors whose governments deny our investments, and that does seem unfair. A country’s human rights record should also be taken into account when deciding whether or not we allow investment from a particular nation. In this regard I note the evidence to the Senate committee by Ian Melrose, the Australian businessman whose company funded the ads in relation to the Chinalco deal. As some of my colleagues might be aware, this is the same man who has also funded ad campaigns on important human rights issues such as East Timor and a whole range of other issues. He is a champion of human rights in this country. He expressed a real concern that a country’s human rights record should be taken into account in the context of decisions made with respect to foreign investment, particularly where it involves a state owned enterprise. China’s approach to human rights, for example, is in stark contrast to Australia’s stance and, as such, should surely be a factor of consideration when deciding whether to allow the government of China, through its state owned entities, to take over an Australian company, particularly its strategic assets. These questions, among others, as I have detailed in the second reading amendment that I have moved with my colleague Senator Ludlam, should all be included in assessments conducted by the Foreign Investment Review Board of all business cases. That is why I believe that more reform is needed and that is why I urge my colleagues to support this second reading amendment.
I also seek, in the second reading amendment that I have moved with Senator Ludlam, that the Foreign Investment Review Board be charged with monitoring a country’s interest in specific sectors to ensure that we do not have creeping acquisitions, which would negatively impact on Australia’s economy and Australian companies and jobs. In addition, I think it is imperative that the Minister for Trade be required to table the advice that the minister receives from the Foreign Investment Review Board in both houses of parliament on a regular basis. Given the number of investment applications that come before the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Treasurer each year and the number which are approved, which is in the majority, I believe it is in the national interest to see where the Foreign Investment Review Board is coming from in its decisions and to find out where the foreign investment is coming from and in which industries and sectors it is in.
I welcome the amendments proposed by the government in this bill. Again, I agree with Senator Joyce that they are a step in the right direction towards ensuring greater scrutiny of foreign investment cases. But I believe the government can do and ought to do better given the considerations in relation to the national interest. I believe the national interest test itself needs to be further defined and strengthened to ensure Australia’s industries, jobs and economy remain strong, independent and Australian.",SENATE,<title>FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-02,"—I rise briefly to add some comments to those of my colleague Senator Xenophon and indicate that the Greens support the second reading amendment that Senator Xenophon has moved and which we have signed on to. It is basically the logical consequence of the additional comments of the dissenting report that I submitted last year with Senators Joyce and Xenophon on exactly the issues that we have been discussing this afternoon. Essentially, our support for the
Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009
is conditional on many of these really serious issues being addressed. The system in Australia of how we evaluate foreign investment by state owned entities and by sovereign wealth funds should not just be up for some tweaking. It really needs some serious review in terms of the way that we manage the assets that we have here and also our relationships with the various entities that might seek to take up an interest, controlling or otherwise, in some of the strategic resources that we have in Australia. There seems to have been bipartisan consensus for such a long period of time that we do not make anything here. We chop things down, dig things up and then we buy the value added products back from overseas. We really do need to take a very close look in that case. If that is to be the economic strategy that the major parties will pursue over such a long period of time, then we had better pay very close attention to the ownership and the kinds of relationships that we have with companies or government entities that would seek to take ownership of those same resources.
One example that Senator Milne brought to my attention this morning, when we were discussing this, was China’s approach to rare earths. These are, for example, strategic minerals which are enormously important for the future of the renewable energy sector or for batteries for electric vehicles. These fields are going to be huge in the 21st century. They involve strategic resources. I do not know if I would say Australia has an abundance of them, but we do have assets in these kinds of mineral reserves. We have no real filters in place to prevent them from being snapped up, whereas the Chinese government takes a completely different view of the ownership of or access to those kinds of resources. That is the sort of thing, on the one hand, that is lacking in Australia and that I think our dissenting report went some way towards addressing, but I think my colleagues have covered that in a fair bit of detail.
What I really want to go to is the issue of the human rights obligations of the entities with which we have commercial relationships here in Australia. The policy document that came out of Treasury on the government’s approach to foreign investment just says:
The Government’s approach to foreign investment policy is to encourage foreign investment consistent with community interests.
So there is something there in which presumably there would be a degree of community interest. So if a particular investment was inconsistent with community interests then that investment would be blocked. But of course there is no consideration given by the Foreign Investment Review Board to the human rights record of the nation or the entity that is seeking to invest in Australia.
For the purposes of assessing it against human rights standards, I figure that the second principle under the FIRB guidelines—that the investor is subject to and adheres to the law and observes common standards of business behaviour—would seem to be the obvious benchmark against which to judge that kind of performance. It does not mention human rights—it needs to—but there is something there obviously. It became quite evident during Senate committee hearings that the sorts of checks and balances that are implied in this principle are really insufficient to block investment by institutions that operate in partnership with some of the world’s worst human rights abusers.
Senators by now would be familiar with the fact that I have an interest in the case of Burma. I recently visited the Thai-Burma border and was left, in no uncertain terms, with a sense of how the exiled community and campaigners working on the border view trade with the Burma regime—that in any instance it is a lifeline to the vicious and unlawful regime that needs to be cut off. We need to use all opportunities possible to strangle the financial resources that are propping up that brutal dictatorship. That is just one example that I would like to draw the chamber’s attention to. I have done a little bit of investigation. I put those questions at an estimates hearing, at which I believe Senator Sherry was present, to help us get some answers from the officers at the table, or to at least get an idea that the answers were certainly not going to be forthcoming, because it is simply not something that they are asked to consider.
At the time that the dissenting report was published, there was consideration of the $505 million deal that would deliver the state owned China Nonferrous Metals Mining (Group) Co. Ltd a 51 per cent stake in the Australian company Lynas Corporation, which owns the Mount Weld rare-earth mine near Laverton in WA. This brings together the two concerns that I was raising. It is thought to contain one of the world’s largest supplies of high-grade rare earth. This is the same entity that also operates the largest nickel mine in Burma. They could not do that without active partnership with the Burmese military regime. That entity is seeking further acquisitions in Burma. Obviously they have no problems at all in collaborating with that regime, as the Chinese government does in a number of ways. This particular entity is seeking to take a controlling stake in a rare-earth project in Western Australia. This is an outfit that also has mining operations in countries including North Korea, Iran, Zambia, Mongolia and Thailand, in joint partnership with the authorities of those nations. So it is not that it is only investing in Burma, but that is obviously a very major interest that it has.
I put the question to the General Manager of the Foreign Investment and Trade Policy Division, Mr Patrick Colmer, during an estimates committee hearing. His answer was really interesting. He said:
The position, as I understand it from the basis of the information that we have, is that the Chinese company is operating in Burma. That in itself does not tell us anything except that it is operating in Burma. The fact that a company may be operating in Burma-I believe we have an embassy in Burma.
At that point he was becoming a little bit flustered, I think. He said:
It does not seem, of itself, to be a relevant consideration. If there is information about its operations in Burma or anywhere else that are relevant to the way that it operates in Australia, then that would be something that we may be interested in.
But, effectively, regarding its offshore operations, we do not care. We would not even ask the question. If you put the question to the officers at the table they could legitimately say: ‘I have no idea what these people get up to. We’re only interested in their acquisition of assets in Australia.’ But the fact that these people are effectively collaborating with a regime of violent and organised criminals is of no effective interest to the Foreign Investment Review Board, even though it has the principle that it adheres to the law and observes common standards of business behaviour. That is a rather warped understanding, in my view, of what common standards of business behaviour should include.
In his submission to the committee—he is going to get two mentions in the same debate—the businessman and human rights activist Ian Melrose, who was referred to by Senator Xenophon just now, refers to China’s human rights record. He said:
This is not a Government we should allow to own Australian strategic mining resources which will be for the benefit, not ours.
That is partly for the reasons that I outlined at the outset—that they take a much more strategic view of control of their resources than Australia does, in my view. He also argues—and I think this argument is absolutely spot-on:
... politicians and businessmen who say you should not mix human rights with trade are cowards and opportunists.
I realise this is not something that we will solve in this debate in the Senate, because this is a long-running issue, but we need to take a very good look at some of the people we are partnering with in this country. The fact is that there is $50 million worth of trade between Burma and Australia every year, which makes up an important fraction of the revenue stream of that regime. All of this is slipping under the radar.
I believe that we have just missed a quite important opportunity to put some of those filters in place. Whether that is FIRB or whether the government believes that
those filters or safety nets should occur somewhere else or in some other institution is fine—we would be interested in that—but as it stands we are effectively blind to the operation of some of these entities and their behaviour overseas. I believe that does all of us a disservice in the Australian business community, where we expect high standards of ethics and corporate practice, and it certainly does a disservice to the people struggling under these regimes who have spent, as in the case of the Burmese people, decades trying to get out from underneath what is effectively a hostile occupation by a brutal dictatorship. I believe that anything at all that we can do in a trade and investment sense to help their cause is worth trying.",SENATE,<title>FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-02-02,"—I would like to thank the senators who have contributed to this debate on the
Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009. The bill itself and the issues it goes to are relatively straightforward. I did not detect any opposition to the proposals contained in the bill, but the debate, as frequently occurs, particularly in the Senate, touched on issues beyond that contained in the bill. That is fair enough. Foreign investment is a legitimate issue of public interest, and therefore there are a range of matters that I will come to in more detail in responding to the second reading amendment—at least some of the areas that Senator Xenophon and Senator Ludlam touched on in their contributions. I have to congratulate Senator Joyce today. There has been a remarkable transformation since he became the shadow finance minister. I thought Senator Joyce was a paragon of restraint compared to some of the commentary from him we have heard in the past. I thought that was a generally welcomed contribution by Senator Joyce.
The bill implements the Treasurer’s announcements in February 2009 that the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act would be updated to reflect the more frequent use of complex investment instruments such as convertible notes and warrants. These types of arrangements have a solid commercial basis, but they were not in existence, they were not even envisaged, when the act was originally drafted. The bill clarifies that under the act the government can examine in the national interest any investment proposal that could deliver substantial influence or control now or in the future of an Australian company valued over the threshold. The bill applies from the date of the announcement—that is, 12 February 2009—to provide maximum certainty around the act’s application while providing flexible and sensible transition provisions. It is consistent with Australia’s international obligations by keeping to the act’s original policy intention.
The Australian foreign investment regime has stood the test of time, helping to deliver significant benefits to the Australian economy. Foreign investment is important for economic growth, competitiveness and jobs in the Australian economy. Access Economics has estimated that 14 per cent of all Australian jobs are attributable to foreign direct investment. Foreign investment also drives innovations, skills development, transfer, technology adoption and competition. The government is committed to a regulatory regime that does get the balance right, protecting the national interest while ensuring that Australia is a competitive destination for foreign investment. Reforms to the regulatory regime implemented in September specifically addressed the issue of balance. The foreign investment framework must keep pace with changes and trends if it is to remain effective. This means providing a strong national interest test but applying a light touch to foreign investments that do not have national significance.
The bill clarifies that the government can screen investments that involve complex financial arrangements in the same way as traditional shares or voting power. As I said earlier, the bill has received bipartisan support from Senator Joyce, who is the shadow finance minister, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, and bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, with several members speaking in support of the bill, including the shadow Treasurer.
Supporting this bill will improve and safeguard the integrity of foreign investment screening. This is one important part of an effective foreign investment approach that is well established and familiar to international investors. It may not be particularly well known, but on delegation from the Treasurer, as Assistant Treasurer, I do receive the recommendations from the Foreign Investment Review Board for a considerable number of proposed investments into Australia. Amongst all of the issues that I need to consider in providing the ministerial and government approval, it is to me a matter of great pride that Australia is an attractive destination for foreign investment. Australia is a medium-sized economy and, on a world scale, a relatively small population. It is a resource rich economy, and we have historically had to rely on foreign capital to develop our resource base. So to those who argue no foreign investment, that would mean that a significant part of our resource base and other sectors of the Australian economy would simply go undeveloped. In the case of resources they would stay in the ground.
Foreign investment supports around one in four Australian workers in the mining industry, and foreign investment contributes almost half of all value-add in the industry. So in my various public comments from time to time on the issue of foreign investment I have been a strong supporter of foreign investment, provided the various criteria that are set down—the national interest and the other criteria—are met. I know the government and the Treasurer, Mr Swan, are strong supporters of foreign investment into Australia because it is needed. It is needed to assist in the economic development of the country.
There are some aspects of the debate that are a little unfortunate. There has been in some of the public commentary an overfocus on a country like China. It reminds me of the debate that occurred around the foreign investment that was coming from Japan in the sixties and seventies. And there are some unfortunate aspects to the debate. I do not have the figures in front of me, but as a matter of fact the largest source of foreign investment into Australia is from the European Union. I think the second-largest source is from the US. I think the third-largest source is from Japan. I am not sure that China is in the top five or six, but I do not have the figures here in front of me.
It is important to put into perspective that China is, very obviously, a significantly major rising economic power contributor to the world economy. As a consequence of that, it is only natural and reasonable that, given they are I think the most significant surplus saver in terms of capital saving countries in the world, they would seek to invest a proportion of their savings overseas. It is generally a good thing that they have such confidence in the strength of the Australian economy, in the future of the Australian economy and in our general corporate regulatory legal regime. Australia, for a whole range of reasons, is able to attract foreign investment so necessary to develop the country and one of those countries of course is China.
I will not read all of the proposals contained in the second reading amendment prepared and spoken to by Senator Xenophon and Senator Ludlam, but, in summation, the amendment largely reflects the minority report of the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into foreign investment by state owned entities. That is reasonable. While the government is not going to support the amendment, the proponents of the amendment have consistency in the sense that they reflect concerns expressed in that report. I will not go to all of the provisions; I do not have sufficient time to do that; but I do want to go to some of the points made in the amendment—which, as I say, the government will not be supporting. The amendment provides that a foreign government shall not use any corporate vehicle which they control to purchase strategic assets within Australia. Further, for a non-state owned entity, a related entity test will be applied so that different corporate entities with the same ultimate majority controlling influence represented by equity debt or other mechanisms will be deemed as one entity for assessment as to whether it will result in more than 10 per cent of control of any strategic asset market in Australia.
We do not support that aspect of the amendment. The government is committed to a case-by-case examination of all foreign investment proposals. That approach ensures Australia can maximise investment flows while protecting our national interest. The government does recognise that sovereign wealth funds and other SOEs are increasingly part of the global financial system and notes that Australia has its own sovereign wealth fund—our Future Fund. Reflecting this trend, the government supports the efforts of the International Monetary Fund and the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds to develop a set of voluntary best-practice principles to maintain the free flow of cross-border investment. Last time I looked, the chair of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds was our own Mr Murray, who is the chair of the Future Fund. The government applies a rigorous national interest test to all SOE investments. This is designed to examine whether SOE investments are transparent and commercial in manner.
Another part of the amendment concerns the Foreign Investment Review Board being required to consider whether Australia has reciprocal rights of investment in the proposer’s country. Again, the government does not consider it appropriate to penalise foreign investors for the investment policies of their home country government. This would be inconsistent with Australia’s international obligations, including to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Trade Organisation and Australia’s free trade agreement commitments. The role of the act is to provide for the screening of incoming investment. It has no role in outward investment—and I would argue it should not. Assessment of the national interest could include such considerations, but, in general, reciprocity is not a useful guide to Australia’s national interest. However, the government will continue to advocate for foreign governments that have restrictive investment policies to liberalise their regimes for the benefit of Australian investors. I know that in the negotiations my colleague Simon Crean, the Minister for Trade, participates in—and he is a very rigorous advocate of Australia’s interests—he raises this issue, and I know that in some cases there are responses and changes occur.
The issue of creeping acquisitions of Australian businesses and assets owned by state owned entities is raised. I point out that there are a separate set of laws that cover what are known as creeping acquisitions of Australian companies and businesses. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act allows the government to review any increase in ownership beyond 15 per cent of an Australian company or business valued above $231 million. For investments by SOEs and other entities with links to foreign governments, the foreign investment policy allows the government to review any direct investments in Australian companies or businesses regardless of the value of the company or the business.
I will make a peripheral but important point: in terms of governments that own, part or whole, entities which seek to invest in Australia, we are not just dealing with countries such as China or sovereign wealth funds et cetera. There are a range of investments that I am certainly aware of, given my responsibility as Assistant Treasurer, from a range of European and US financial institutions that now—as a consequence of the financial crisis, I would have to say—do have a substantial government stake for a range of reasons concerned with the financial crisis. It has to be given consideration when those entities which in the past were fully private are now owned or partly owned by governments. They are given the same examination by FIRB and ultimately, if they come to my or the Treasurer’s attention, they are given the same consideration as the more commonly understood government enterprises that have part or whole ownership, such as sovereign wealth funds or any of the state owned enterprises that exist. Singapore is another example—it has extensive government investments through subsidiaries of its provident fund, I think. A very complex set of issues may need to be considered.
The amendment calls for clear criteria of what the national interest test is and for abbreviated versions of the FIRB advice to the minister to be tabled in both houses of parliament. It also calls for the government to define what is meant by ‘community interest’ and ‘common standards of business behaviour’. I point out that in February 2008 the government published guidelines that explain the factors we consider when evaluating the national interest implications of foreign government related investments. Specifically, the government looks for evidence of a commercial basis for the investment. It considers the commercial and legal conduct of the investor—that is, do they adhere to the law and do they abide by common standards of business behaviour? The government also considers competition issues, the impact of the investment on Australia’s revenue base, national security of course, and the impact of the investment on the Australian company, our economy and the broader community.
The government does take seriously the commercial-in-confidence nature of the investment proposals that it receives. You have to take it very seriously because if the information you are receiving became public knowledge it would have—in some cases at least—a significant impact on markets and the value of particular entities that are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, for example. Certainly in exercising my powers in this area I am very mindful of the commerciality and the need for very strict confidence. In exercising my responsibilities as the Assistant Treasurer there are many areas where commercial-in-confidence is important but this would have to be one of the most sensitive areas for maintaining commercial confidentiality.
Another paragraph of the amendment relates to human rights. The government considers that it is not appropriate to hold investors accountable for actions taken by the home country government except in limited circumstances where Australia maintains formal sanctions against that country. However, if there is evidence that the investor itself has breached human rights or undertaken other unethical behaviour, such actions will be considered when determining if the investment would be contrary to Australia’s national interest, and that has always been the case. I do not think that is generally well known, but that has always been the case.
I thank senators for their contribution. The government does not support the amendment. I do appreciate the contribution of those senators who have spoken in favour of the amendment. Foreign investment is an important issue. It is a sensitive issue, but I advocate that the amendments in this legislation are important. In general we should welcome foreign investment in this country. It is very important for our economic development. Particularly in Australia, which is so resource rich, the reality is that the development of our economy and the value adding and the jobs that result from so many of these resources would not occur without foreign investment. Australia would be much the poorer if we did not receive that investment.",SENATE,<title>FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-02,"—The coalition will not be supporting the second reading amendment that has been moved in relation to the
Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009. To be quite honest, there are issues with it which I am personally favourably inclined towards, but in this new wonderful world being in shadow cabinet means that my decision is not the decision that matters. There is a wider aspect to this. There are other areas which have been brought to light, especially in regard to the free trade agreements that have to be considered. So, although there are sections of it which I am fundamentally sympathetic to and I acknowledge the work done by Senators Xenophon and Ludlam in putting it together, I will be completely truthful with you and say that, on the wider aspect of the decision by the coalition, this amendment will not be supported.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Xenophon’s and Senator Ludlam’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-02,"—Thanks, Mr Acting Deputy President; I appreciate that. When this debate was interrupted earlier, I was discussing the fact that the Greens certainly support the model that has been put forward. In fact, it is the model for a national terrorism legislation reviewer that we have been proposing for quite some time—and it is now five years overdue, so we are glad to at least see the
National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2009 [2010]
turn up. But I am perplexed as to why the government thinks that a part-time reviewer working with two staff out of the Prime Minister’s office, with really sketchy reporting obligations and not much of a budget to speak of, is going to be sufficient to undertake the vast amount of work that is going to be required of this office.
The reviewer is going to have to conduct a very broad ranging analysis of an array of complex and sensitive terrorism laws, and perhaps review them every time they are used, when the Prime Minister requests it or when the reviewer chooses to on his or her own motion. The staffing arrangement, two staffers to support one part-time officer, is essentially going to cripple the office at the outset. I think that is the real risk here. It certainly speaks volumes about the government’s actual priorities for this office. They will be able to say: ‘Tick. That was an election commitment—there is something that obviously should have been instituted in the first place—but, by the way, we’re not going to resource it, so good luck to that office!’ As the demands on the monitor increase, obviously so too should the resources, and that is something we will be tracking very closely as the work of this office unfolds.
Independence was an issue that was raised by coalition senators and by us during the committee inquiries as we investigated various iterations of this bill. The government has at least seen the sense in highlighting the independence of the office: the word ‘independent’ is now in the title of the office. So that is something, because the independence of the office is vital if the exercise is to actually increase public confidence and balance terrorism laws. That is why we argued that the title should at least acknowledge that. We would have preferred the title ‘independent reviewer of terrorism laws’, but the government has not gone along with that.
The independence of the office needs to be not just in a name but also in the way that it operates. We believe there is merit in the office existing outside the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. We expressed concern at the evidence provided by PM&C in the Senate inquiry that they already had specific staff in mind for the monitor’s office. So there is a process of hand-picking going on. No disrespect is intended to either the reviewer or the staff that the officers may have had in mind at the time, but we would prefer to see a process where the office can function with genuine independence in mind. We do not have any confidence at the moment in the quality or the quantity of independence of the office simply because of its placement within PM&C and the fact that is where the staff will be drawn from. We would rather have seen a much more broad-ranging process to recruit suitably qualified staff for this important office.
I am also very pleased that the government has recognised the need for Australia’s human rights obligations to be part of the reviewer’s mandate. For me, this is the biggest move we have seen so far on the part of the government, and I am very happy to acknowledge that at least it will now be an intrinsic part of the reviewer’s work to benchmark terror laws against Australia’s human rights obligations. We still have a couple of amendments to tighten up the wording and to make sure that it is absolutely implicit because, really, that is one of the primary functions of the office, in my view.
This exercise is about human rights and about achieving a better balance within the anti-terror laws between security and protection of civil and political rights, which in fact these laws really should be intended to protect. The Australian Greens have consistently sought to link the efforts of the review mechanism to Australia’s human rights obligations under the various treaties and conventions we have signed over a long period of time. One of the things that we will attempt to amend, and that I hope we see opposition and government support for, is that the Human Rights Commissioner should be able to make references to the monitor in addition to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. We recognise the value of having a parliamentary joint committee being able to refer matters to the terror laws reviewer or monitor, and the Human Rights Commissioner should be able to do exactly the same.
One of the key issues that has been left undone and, as far as I am concerned, one where we will be able to make the most improvements to the bill as it sits before us will be around the reporting obligations of the monitor. One of the worst things we could be left with is an office, with barely enough resources to do the job, that reports to the Prime Minister and then some time down the track, at the Prime Minister’s discretion, sanitised reports may or may not make their way into the public domain. We know at the outset that this could be done in a much better way.
The Prime Minister can currently determine the order in which the reviewer attends to the workload, and that again goes to the independence of the office. The officer needs to be able to set his or her own priorities and not necessarily be hijacked by the political imperatives that come from the Prime Minister’s office. Even with the best intentions in the world, unless it is a much larger office, we think the monitor needs to be able to set his or her own priorities.
The only reporting obligation that the monitor will have—and the minister, during committee stage, may correct me on this—will be a heavily edited annual report. That may well be all that we see: an annual report that will come after being sanitised by the executive, by the government—and that surely is not the intention. That is not what was designed here and it is not what the public needs from this office. We believe that the monitor should be required to table a report and the government be required to provide the response within a period of 12 months. If the monitor has undertaken a particular piece of work, that should then be reported to parliament with national security sensitive matters removed by the monitor himself.

(Senator Barnett)—Order! There is quite a bit of background noise and it is making it hard to hear properly, so I will just ask senators to bear that in mind.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I appreciate that. A large number of the amendments that we will propose further down the track in this debate go to the reporting obligations of the officer so that the public knows what the monitor is doing and also knows that he or she has been free from executive interference. We have enough agencies on massive budgets working behind closed doors on the issue of counterterrorism and national security. What we do not have yet is an officer with relative freedom to report as he or she sees fit on the operation of these laws.
In the broader context of how counterterrorism work and the process of law reform are going on in Australia, we are still waiting for a counterterrorism white paper. We have seen substantial proposals for law reform come from the Attorneys-General’s national security legislation discussion paper but there is an absence of a white paper that gives us the strategic direction and some insight into where the government is actually heading on counterterrorism law reform in Australia. We do not have the white paper, but we have been asked to accept a hefty national security legislation discussion paper which, in a way, was quite sketchy—it dealt with some issues and left some others completely unsaid. We believe, in essence, that the monitor should have occurred first. That is something this parliament could have dealt with at the end of 2008 with the private senator’s bill that Senator Brandis spoke of before. Then we should have seen a white paper, so that we would actually know where the government is heading, and then the proposals for law reform that can be properly informed in public debate. Instead, it is happening completely backwards, in the reverse of that order.
I will speak in much greater length during the committee stage about the Greens amendments, but I would firstly acknowledge, as Senator Brandis did, that the government has moved on this. It has accepted some of the recommendations of the committee, and that is always welcome. I have been involved already, in my brief time here, in enough committee work to know that really valuable cross-party work is done and it is always appreciated when the government has the courage to admit that it did not have all the right ideas and was not right 100 per cent of the time. There has been some movement, as I said, particularly in the area of human rights and the way that this agency or office will review human rights obligations. But there is still some work to do, and I intend to work with both the major parties and the cross-benches to make sure we get the very best out of this office that we can.
Because terrorism involves such horrific crimes, as a representative of a party of which one of the pillars is nonviolence, I have a very strong belief that we should do everything that we can to protect Australians and people overseas from crimes of terror. That should not be at the expense of providing for the human rights obligations that we are signatory to and the rights that we hold so dear. Counterterrorism laws are effectively designed to protect, in essence, our way of life, so we have been very concerned for a long period of time that those rights have been eroded by the operation of these laws that still rest, even today, on the statute books. We do not believe that there necessarily has to be that trade-off with the operation of really draconian and restrictive counterterrorism laws. We believe that some of these should simply be repealed without even the dignity of a review by the National Security Monitor. But most of all I look forward to improving this bill as it goes on its way through the chamber, so that we can get the office up and running with some proper resourcing and some really transparent reporting obligations.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION MONITOR BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2010-02-02,"—One of the many profound consequences of the terrible terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 was the need for governments around the world to assess their capacity to deal with this new and frightening threat of international terrorism. One of the needs, in many cases, was for the introduction of domestic legislation to try and deal with the new challenge that appeared. That meant in Australia, as elsewhere, quite a large amount of legislation which tried to provide a balance between the protection of rights that we treasure and civil liberties that we have taken for granted and the need for public and national security.
There is always a risk when governments act in a new area like this—particularly when they introduce quite wide-ranging legislation—that well-established civil rights, ones that citizens have enjoyed for a long period of time and take for granted, might be compromised. So governments have to strike a balance. They have to strike a balance between individuals’ rights—at least in a democracy they do—and the provision of national security, which is increasingly demanding. It is not an easy balance to strike. Terrorism is a profound challenge to this society and many others. It ought not to be underestimated. It requires governments to take measures which might not in the past have been acceptable to either the government or its citizens. But the Australian public, like other publics, are entitled to expect that a government will do all it can to provide for their personal security and the national security. That is what I think that much of the legislation which has been introduced in Australia does. It seeks to provide that level of security, that level of confidence, that we can meet the kinds of challenges with which we might be confronted. There is plenty of evidence in relation to the success we have had in meeting many of these challenges. That said, it seems to me that governments need to be cautious about the way they act in this area. They need to be careful about stripping away civil rights that are part of the fabric of our democracy and are the foundation of our freedom.
It is in that context that I particularly welcome this piece of legislation, the
National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2009 [2010], because it seems to me that this is a piece of legislation which has as its central purpose the creation of a safeguard, an independent reviewer, to ensure that Australia’s counterterrorism legislation is effective but also contains appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of individuals in this society. This is not a new idea. It is an idea which has been in practice in the United Kingdom for quite a number of years. The independent reviewer of terrorism laws is an office that has been in place in the United Kingdom for quite some period of time. By all accounts, it has been a successful innovation in the protection of interests. The work of the office is widely acclaimed. So we have a precedent which is being applied in this legislation. However, there are some important differences between this legislation and the United Kingdom legislation. Regrettably, some of those differences, in my view, make the office that is proposed under this legislation likely to be rather less effective than the office in the United Kingdom.
I want to look at some of the shortcomings of the bill, as I see them, in the short time that is available to me. Before I do, I wish to acknowledge the considerable debt that I think all Australians have, in relation to the protection of their civil liberties, to Mr Petro Georgiou, the honourable member for Kooyong in the other place. Mr Georgiou has a long and distinguished record of supporting human rights in Australia. It was Mr Georgiou, not the supposedly human rights oriented Rudd government, who first proposed that there be an independent reviewer.
—Where did you get the idea the Rudd government was human rights oriented?
—I have never been under any illusions about that point, Senator Brandis, but I think the government is probably under that misunderstanding. But Mr Georgiou was concerned about these things many years ago, long before the government actually thought this was an issue worth taking up. Indeed, when Mr Georgiou introduced his private member’s bill, the
Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Laws Bill 2008, alluded to by Senator Brandis in his remarks earlier in the day, the government, with what might be seen as astonishing hypocrisy, refused to support the measure. Now, in a way which is all too typical of how the Rudd government operates, it has introduced its own bill and, regrettably—showing little grace—it has failed to acknowledge the considerable debt that it ought to acknowledge to Mr Georgiou for having introduced his private member’s bill. That said, I suppose one should be grateful that we are actually moving forward on this piece of legislation. I hope it will be—and it can be—an important innovation in the security field.
This legislation avoids some of the weaknesses of the United Kingdom legislation. It has been observed in the United Kingdom, for example, that the absence of a detailed listing of the functions and powers of the reviewer has been a shortcoming, and that has caused some difficulties. That has been avoided in this piece of legislation, and I know that you will be very familiar with this, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett, having sat—I think I am right in saying—on the Senate committee that examined this particular bill. The bill also proposes sanctions, which are not available in the United Kingdom legislation, for those who fail to assist the monitor, and that seems to me to be an important difference between the two pieces of legislation. So there are some innovations here, some changes, some amendments which I think will strengthen the Australian legislation and make it more effective in achieving the purposes it is designed to achieve.
Regrettably, however, the Australian legislation fails to emulate some of the good examples of the United Kingdom legislation, and, I might say, some of the particular examples which were evident in Mr Georgiou’s legislation which was before the parliament. I noticed, and other speakers in this debate have made this point, that the government has introduced amendments, and to some extent that accommodates some of the concerns that the Senate committee that examined the bill noted in its report and some of the concerns that I have in the legislation. But regrettably, it does not go far enough in addressing those concerns, and Senator Ludlam has mentioned some of these matters in his own remarks earlier.
The most notable weakness is undoubtedly the failure to ensure that the monitor is a person of unimpeachable independence. This seems to me to be an elementary proposition in a piece of legislation of this kind. Instead of creating an independent monitor, the bill creates a position that seemingly will be located within the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, apparently administered in large measure by the staff, and Senator Ludlam referred to the fact that there was an issue of resources here, which remains unclear, notwithstanding the government’s amendments to its own legislation. Witnesses before the Senate, as you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, criticised this aspect of the bill most consistently and made the point that this was the single most obvious weakness in the bill. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre made the point that there should be a new independent office completely separate from government, and that seems to me a rather important and sensible point. How can one be confident about the impartiality of this office if it is located within an existing executive portfolio? Surely it is an elementary principle that in setting up an institution to monitor government activity that the institution is itself independent of the government that it is supposed to keep honest. This particular piece of legislation fails this test. To my mind it represents a very large flaw and weakness in the legislation, which has not been corrected by the amendments which the government has proposed.
There is also a weakness in the reporting methods. I noticed that Senator Ludlam has also alluded to this matter. In fact the reporting methods contained within the bill are, to my mind, astonishingly convoluted. It is almost as though the government was determined, absolutely committed, to ensuring that the monitor was unable, or was intended to be frustrated in his responsibilities, to report the findings of his inquiries. This particular provision, which seems on the best of it to require a report by the monitor to the Prime Minister and subsequently the Prime Minister rather than the monitor reporting to the parliament, seems to me to be completely convoluted and completely unnecessary. The reporting requirements are also weakened by the fact that the monitor under the bill would seem only to be able to report to the parliament on an annual basis rather than when he is apprised of things which require attention within the legislation. Why this restriction would be placed defies explanation from my perspective and it is clearly a weakness in the legislation.
Creatively, I thought, the Senate proposed a solution to this problem by suggesting that there could perhaps be two versions of any report, one which was an unedited version for the Prime Minister’s eyes only, and a second edited version which might remove the sensitive material, which might then be placed before the parliament. Sadly, the government in its amendments has decided that this is a bad idea and it has refused to accept this particular proposal.
There are other shortcomings in this bill, some of which the government has addressed, others, sadly, it has not addressed. The narrow scope of the monitor’s role is something that Mr Georgiou has made a point of noting and I think also needs to be recognised. There is a limitation on the range of activities the monitor can undertake and that seems, again, an effort to try and constrain his particular activities.
There is also a restraint, an unnecessary limitation, in relation to the laws that are applied in the matter. The bill requires the monitor to give particular emphasis to the provisions of legislation that have been applied during the financial year or the immediately preceding financial year. So it would seem—and the explanatory memorandum makes this brutally clear, one could say—that the monitor’s powers only extend to those laws which have been used and applied in the previous 12 months. So that would seem to be a restriction on the legislation as well.
There was a suggestion in relation to international agreements. The legislation now suggests that in performing his obligations, undertaking his tasks, the monitor should have regard to Australia’s international obligations in relation to various treaties and protocols. This may be a worthy objective. I think the idea is worthy that Australia should comply with those international obligations to which it has become a party, but there is also a danger here that it might actually neuter, almost completely, the government’s power to legislate in an area of national security. As well, it might impose enormous demands on the responsibilities of the monitor’s office.
The government has already said in response to other proposed amendments to the bill that it does not favour them because it thinks they will place too much emphasis and too many demands on the resources of the monitor. The obvious solution to that is to make sure that the monitor has the resources that he or she needs to undertake his or her responsibilities. I guess we will see whether that actually occurs. I would not be too hopeful, I regret to say.
There is a point to be made here, which is that some international instruments do not yet apply to Australia’s domestic law. They have not been ratified into domestic law. Surely a second issue that deserves some recognition is the fact that the monitor is examining the implications of Australia’s national security legislation. His focus ought to be on the impact of this legislation on the quantum of legislation which applies in Australia. He should not be spending his time examining whether or not we are fulfilling our international obligations, which could be done elsewhere within the system.
With those reservations, I welcome this piece of legislation. I think it adds a necessary level of guardianship over the protection of Australia’s rights in this new area of legislation. It is likely to be an area of legislation which will increase rather than diminish over time. It is likely to be an area of legislation which will be controversial in the years ahead. Of course, it deals with a vitally important subject, which is the security of the nation.
In this context I think I should just reiterate and recognise the particular debt that we owe Mr Georgiou for having put this matter on the national agenda and taken the initiative in relation to the issue, which nobody else chose to do. Finally—and I am grateful for this—the government has seen the wisdom of the private member’s bill that Mr Georgiou put on the agenda and has adopted, at least in part, some of the ideas that are contained within that legislation. This would be a better piece of legislation were some of the other proposals for amendments in the Senate report to be accepted and were the government prepared to release the limitations with which it seeks to bind up the power of the monitor. I hope that before too long it might reconsider the way it is proceeding in relation to this matter.
In the final few moments that remain for me to speak, I take up Senator Ludlam’s point that we are still waiting for the counterterrorism white paper. The last time I asked about the counterterrorism white paper and the progress that was being made, I got a serve from the Attorney-General. He said that they would deliberate on the matter and that in due course it would be revealed. That, I think, was at least six months ago. International terrorism is a clear and present danger. It is arguably the single most important threat to this nation’s security and it is an issue which this government, regrettably, has failed to attend to with the diligence and concern which it deserves. We are all waiting for the counterterrorism white paper. Given the time that it is taking to produce, I hope it will be a damn good paper which will address the concerns which we all have about our security in relation to this important area.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION MONITOR BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-02-02,"—I rise to speak in favour of the
National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2009 [2010], a form of which was originally introduced by the member for Kooyong in the other place. I thank him, as other senators have done, for his unceasing vigilance in these matters. I am very glad that this matter has come to a degree of conclusion. That private member’s bill was subsequently reintroduced in the Senate by me and Senator Humphries as a private senator’s bill in June 2008, after the government had gagged debate in the House. That bill passed the Senate but went no further. I am nevertheless very pleased that part of the foundation of that bill has been incorporated into this bill.
This bill seeks to appoint a national security legislation monitor, who will assist ministers in ensuring that Australia’s counterterrorism legislation and national security legislation is, firstly, effective in deterring and preventing terrorism and terrorism related activities which threaten Australia’s security. As well, the monitor will ensure that legislation is effective in responding to terrorism and terrorism related activity, that it is consistent with Australia’s international obligations, including human rights obligations, and also that it contains appropriate safeguards for protecting the rights of individuals. After the events of 2001, a range of antiterrorism laws were introduced to combat the threat that terrorists posed. The need for such legislation was further strengthened by the subsequent terrorist acts in Bali and Madrid and the ongoing threat of al-Qaeda.
During that time there has been much public discussion of the impact of such legislation on the civil liberties of Australian citizens. Concern was focused on the invasion of privacy of innocent people and the diversion of government resources away from more realistic threats. This argument was given force by the cases of David Hicks, Jack Thomas and, particularly, Dr Mohamed Haneef. There were also a range of reviews, including the 2005 Sheller review and those by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, in 2006, and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in 2008, all of which looked at the application of these laws, and all reported back with conclusions consistent with the aims of this bill. Additionally, the UNHCR also commented that some of Australia’s counterterrorism legislation appeared to be incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The concerns of this group focused around the vagueness of definitions of a ‘terrorist act’ and the ‘exception circumstances’ in the Crimes Act, as well as the reversal of the burden of proof and the expanded powers of ASIO.
The simple fact is that the government must balance the needs of a free, democratic society with the necessary actions to ensure its security. It is appropriate to have a mechanism that determines the effectiveness of counterterrorism measures and, more importantly, whether such measures impinge on human rights—that is, how to ensure the legislation fulfils the needs of our democratic society and our national security.
The opposition, under the very diligent guidance of Senator Brandis, had a number of concerns relating to how this bill would work in practice, as well as who could refer matters to the monitor and the vagueness of the definitions of the powers of the monitor. I understand that the government and the coalition have come to an agreement on these amendments and they have been incorporated in the legislation. Some of those concerns have been addressed, some of them have not, and those developments have been outlined in a very erudite manner by my colleague Senator Trood.
Nevertheless, I would like to thank Senator Ludlum for his cooperation on earlier versions of this bill. I think it is an important piece of legislation that will improve the effectiveness of our counterterrorism measures, will protect human rights and will instil a sense of confidence amongst the public in parliament’s counterterrorism efforts. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2010-02-02,"—I want to use this first adjournment of the year to thank the now departed Secretary of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, Dr Jacqueline Dewar. This is a contribution I wanted to make last year but, as you would well recall, we were tied up in the latter part of the year dealing with the CPRS legislation and we were not given the opportunity to make this contribution on my part and on behalf of the committee—and, of course, Senator Parry is here this evening.

18:52:13
Dr Dewar is taking leave to join her husband, David, in Maroochydore and is taking with her a son and daughter. She is going up to that great socialist republic of Queensland! I have been the chairman of this committee since 2007. Along with the rest of the committee, I believe we have had the distinct honour of working with a most gifted and dedicated servant of the parliament.
The committee conducted what must be the penultimate parliamentary inquiry into the impact of serious and organised crime on Australian society last year. I do not believe the issue was given the attention it deserved until Dr Dewar and her professional team invigorated the committee and focused it. I never quite realised the extent and penetration of crime in Australia. I am not sure that many of the committee members did, but we were educated. Of course, some members of the committee are well aware of it. We did get the underbelly exposure that was vital for us to make the deliberations and conclusions we did. I put this down to Dr Dewar’s perseverance and good-natured approach to any obstacle. More important for us was the high regard in which she has been and remains held by the law enforcement community. Through that standing, the committee was able to secure extraordinary cooperation and assistance from these agencies. Few servants of this parliament can, I believe, feel that their legislative efforts to fight the baddies in society have been significant.
We have two bills before us tomorrow that will seriously affect the efforts and activities of organised crime in our country. We on the committee are very proud of the crusade we embarked upon and the unique outcome we expect shortly. This has been due overwhelmingly to the professional, erudite and honest endeavours of Dr Jacqueline Dewar. We all wish her well on the next part of her journey. This one here lasted many years.
