Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (09:04):  As I was saying, the Leader of the Opposition noted in his budget reply on 10 May that there is 'nothing wrong with this country that a change of government can't fix'. Today my message is to Australian industry: only the coalition has the economic credentials to help business survive and prosper. The coalition is committed to lower taxes to help attract investment in critical infrastructure, develop our position as a regional financial services hub and strengthen our economy. This tax increase will damage Australia's reputation. Some international investors feel tricked into directing their funds to Australia. The 7.5 per cent rate is less than two years old, and it will now double after investors have locked in decade-long contracts. As Peter Mitchell, the CEO of Asia Pacific Real Estate Association, said, 'The Australian government's withholding tax announcement has seriously undermined global confidence in Australia as a stable investment destination.'


We must not pass this tax increase. If we want Australia's reputation to be as a regional financial services hub, if we want crucial long-term infrastructure to be built and if we want new hotels, new hospitals and new roads, we must offer hope, reward and opportunity, not more taxes. And we must vote against this bill today.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (09:05):  Once again we stand in this House discussing a piece of legislation that has an on-again off-again approach by the government to policy development. As I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012, I think it is important to recognise the constant uncertainty that has been created by constant changes in tax policy and many other policies that this government seems to foist on the Australian public and the Australian business community.


The bill's explanatory memorandum states that the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Act 2008 to increase the tax rate from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent on fund payments in relation to income years on or after 1 July 2012. It is instructive to note that it was only some three or four years ago that the rate was reduced to 7½ per cent, and at the time we as the coalition expressed concerns. Today we see a bill reintroduced to backtrack on that original reduction. The last time this bill was referred to committee to be reviewed we raised a number of concerns about its implementation which were largely due to the retrospective nature of the changes. However, thankfully, some of that appears to have been addressed within the bill's current form. However, retrospectivity aside, we remain concerned that billions of dollars of infrastructure investments already made, in addition to future investments, could potentially be put at risk as an implication of these changes.


An analysis conducted by the Allen Consulting Group for the Property Council showed that the proposed increase in the final withholding tax revenue from MITs would have a profound adverse affect on the economy without raising the expected revenue. It is instructive to note comments from Martin Codina of the Financial Services Council. He raises the concern that people have made investment decisions based on a tax rate of 7½ per cent and now the increase to 15 per cent is going to create increased uncertainty for those people in their investment-making decision. In addition, what does it say to investors about the Australian system when these things are constantly changed? Andrew Cannane, General Manager for Corporate Clients at the Trust Company, said in a recent interview:


We don't foresee there being the same amount of take up in MIT structures as there was. And ultimately, the net loser for that will be Australia. It will result in less foreign direct investment.


We all recognise in this House that we as a nation require foreign capital to build and grow our economy. Some 50 per cent of our financing and our loan books are funded from offshore funds. Andrew Cannane goes on to say that, in the calendar year 2011, foreign direct investment into Australian property rose some 50 per cent to $7.7 billion. He estimates that well over $5 billion of that would have been into managed investment trusts. He said:


The big concern for investors is the inconsistency. The 7.5 per cent rate has only been in place for two years and it's already changed.


To return to the Allen Consulting Group report, it noted that there was a billion-dollar drop in investment as a result of the increased tax. A net tax revenue for the period 2012-16 would be estimated at some $35 million due to decreased recipients, which is less than half the $75 million predicted by Treasurer. It also found that by 2015-16 the increased tax would reduce government direct inputs by $580 million and cost more than 4,600 jobs a year.


In addition to these concerns, the uncertainty this government has shown in dealing with the rate of the MIT withholding tax raises the issue of perceived sovereign risk. How will our relationship with our international business associates fare with the continued massive uncertainty caused by this government? The dissenting report by the coalition members of the economics committee stated:


The doubling of the withholding tax rate would also reduce Australia’s international competitiveness and reputation as an attractive and certain destination to invest in.


This is only made worse in light of other recent tax increases in the form of a carbon tax and a minerals resource rent tax. I am sure it is well and good that the Treasurer speaks about the $500 billion of investment in the pipeline, but the important part in that discussion is that it is pipeline investment. It has not been committed to works on the ground. It is work that is potentially planned yet has not come to fruition. This constant shifting of the goal posts, new taxes et cetera only makes it less certain that companies will proceed with those projected investments. What is the consequence to this country if that $500 billion of proposed pipeline investment turns out to be $250 billion or less? Attracting more foreign investment is important to achieve stronger economic growth leading to increased government revenue without the need for governments to hike taxes or introduce new taxes, like the carbon tax.


The carbon tax is only five days away and is the mother ship of the Labor-Greens government's poisonous policies. Yesterday I asked in question time about the fate of 800 workers at the local abattoir within my electorate. The plan there is to shut down the operations for up to 10 days to avoid going over the 25,000 tonne carbon tax threshold. The reason they even have to consider doing this to their loyal workers and their families is that they cannot afford to lose their competitiveness against other countries, like the USA, for example. We will certainly be in a league of our own once the carbon tax comes to town. What this example tells us is that this is a government that is not up to the job of protecting our future wealth, or economy for that matter. This bill, as I touched on earlier, has been outlined in a previous bill which was then excised from the bill by the government only to be reintroduced and debated once again here today. It is important for everybody's confidence in our economy that this ad hoc and piecemeal approach—to double the tax on managed investment trusts, but generally in relation to many legislative items over the term of this government—be reduced and that we have a more streamlined process so that people see a consistency and so that they can make long-term business and investment decisions and be confident that those decisions are going to allow them to grow and build their businesses and not be penalised due to increased tax rates and no ability to plan for that. Our focus should be on encouraging further investment from our foreign counterparts through internationally competitive taxation arrangements so that we can grow our economy more strongly and not just talk fluff about how great this economy is, when in reality the people of this country have had enough.


I support the comments from the member for North Sydney, who said yesterday in his contribution to this debate, 'Do not create uncertainty.' Uncertainty is the death knell of business. We need business certainty in all areas, whether it is taxation or regulation, because that allows businesses to make those long-term decisions to create wealth for the future of this country. It is our business community—it is ordinary Australians—that are the ones that go out and create the wealth for this country. It is not governments, of whatever persuasion. Governments do not create anything. More often than not they put roadblocks in the way of people's vision for what they would like to do for their lives and the future of this country.


So I call on this government to create, or seek to create, an atmosphere of trust so that people can trust this government and the direction it is going. But ultimately examples like this bill reduce that trust and create uncertainty. It is the consistent, coherent economic strategies that were employed under the Howard-Costello government that allowed our country to grow and prosper. I think this government has ably demonstrated that it is not able to produce and stick to a coherent economic strategy, and for the future of this country one is desperately, desperately needed. As the member for Ryan quite adequately pointed out in her contribution, it is really only a coalition government that can restore hope, reward and opportunity to all Australians for the future of this country.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (09:17):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012. This bill is the next stage in what has been an inglorious saga of prevarication and changing position by this government over many years. As I cast around for a term which would most accurately describe what has happened, I was reminded of my experiences as an eight-year-old boy with one of those electronics starter kits that you were given—in my case by an engineer father hoping to encourage his son in the same direction. Sadly, I turned out to be a great disappointment and became a lawyer, but I do remember one thing from this particular set. There was an exercise in building what was described, as I recollect, as a 'multivibrator flip-flop'. A multivibrator flip-flop is apparently some kind of electric circuit—that is as much as I recollect. But it struck me as really quite an appropriate term for what we have seen from the Treasurer in his conduct of withholding tax rates. This has really been a multivibrator flip-flop exercise, Madam Deputy Speaker. You would recollect, I am sure, the glowing terms in which the Treasurer announced to the world in 2008 the policy approach that he was going to take in this area. He had this to say. His words rang out through the chamber:


Our nation has the potential to be a financial services hub in the Asia Pacific Region—the fastest growing region in the world. To support this ambition, the Budget begins the process of significantly reducing the withholding tax, by reducing the current interim rate of 30 per cent to a final rate of 7.5 per cent for most nonresident investors.


We then had in the budget announcement in May of this year the announcement, to the great surprise of the financial services industry, that the rate was to increase from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. This came with very little warning. It emerged out of the need of the Treasurer and the government to desperately cast around for revenue to plug the massive hole that they had created through sustained fiscal mismanagement over several years and to deliver, for political reasons, on the promise of having a surplus for the 2012-13 year. With very little foreshadowing and very little announcement, it was disclosed that a decision had been taken to increase this rate—the reduction of which had been foreshadowed and announced so proudly only a few years before. With no notice, the financial services sector was told that the rate was going to increase from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent.


That in itself was unsettling and disturbing enough, but last week we had a truly remarkable development, because last week the parliament was considering the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill. The bill included within schedule 4 a set of provisions under which the rate was to move from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That is to say that the bill was, it appeared, intended to give effect to the announcement made by the Treasurer in the budget speech only a few weeks before. We had the extraordinary saga of the Assistant Treasurer coming into this place and moving an amendment to remove the provision in the bill which was intended to give effect to the announcement which had been made only a few weeks before. This was a truly mystifying development, and no light was cast on the mystery by any explanation from the Assistant Treasurer. He sat mute at the table, giving no enlightenment to the chamber at all as to why the government was now reversing a policy which it had announced only a month before—a policy which in turn reversed the policy which the government had announced with such fanfare in 2008. So at that point observers were, to say the least, puzzled—the rate had gone from 30 to 7.5, and it was then announced it was going to go from 7.5 to 15, and the government then moved an amendment on its own bill to reduce the rate from 15 back to 7.5.


But the flip-flop activities of the Treasurer and the Gillard government in this area have not ceased, because in the bill the House is now considering the flip-flop continues. We are now told that indeed the rate will increase from 7.5 to 15 per cent, and we find in schedule 1 of the bill a set of provisions which is identical in every regard to the provisions which were contained in another bill put before the House last week and were then excised by the government in its own amendment. The word 'curious' does not begin to describe what is going on here. I reiterate that the only term that I can find that I think best describes the conduct of the Treasurer and the Gillard government on this front is the term that I have dredged up from my own memory as a small boy, playing with an electronic starter kit: the multivibrator flip-flop.


It is easy to castigate this government for its flip-flopping, but let us turn to the serious consequences of this kind of conduct. Let us turn to what it actually means for business confidence—not just in Australia but, very importantly, business confidence on the part of international investors who are considering putting money into an Australian investment. Let us recollect that international capital is highly mobile. Let us recollect that Australia is competing to attract investment capital against many other destinations. Let us recollect that Australia is a nation which, every year, imports capital—and, were we not to do that, we would leave investment opportunities not taken up and we would find ourselves less prosperous than we would otherwise be. So the question of creating a climate of confidence, in which international investment can be attracted, is a question of first importance for any responsible Australian government as it considers its economic policy. Unfortunately, we have had a government through this sorry saga over the last few years—including the extraordinary mismanagement of the last few weeks—which has done a remarkable amount to erode investor confidence, including the confidence of foreign investors.


What foreign investors now understand to be the position of the Australian government is that high-minded sentiments expressed one year can be abandoned in a great hurry the next year to fill a short-term budget hole. We have a government which is desperately casting around to try and find extra sources of money to deal with the fact that it has engaged in profligate, irresponsible, uncontrolled spending year after year, a government which is prepared to trash policy commitments it had made only a few short years prior and a government which is prepared to demonstrate extraordinary political incompetence and mismanagement in the basic task of giving effect to the legislative changes it has announced. It is just an extraordinary piece of mismanagement, and it leaves foreign investors wondering whether any policy commitment by this government is one that will be honoured for any period of time at all, because the risk that they must face and that they must factor into any investment decision they are contemplating is that for short-term domestic exigencies, because of the desperate need to manage short-term financial pressures, a policy setting which had supposedly been a substantial and reliable commitment of the government is just abandoned without any warning whatsoever.


One of the things that business requires more than anything else is certainty. What is important for business and for investors is to understand the ground rules as they are contemplating making investments in Australia. Businesses manage their affairs over a significant time frame; businesses engage in long-term planning. Major investment decisions require a long lead time and need to go through internal approval processes. Many businesses will be planning not just for next year with an operating plan but will have a forward plan which may extend two, three, four, five or even 10 years out. As they go through that planning process, businesses will assess the investment conditions that they face, and they are much more likely to come to a favourable investment decision in respect of an investment in Australia or anywhere else if they have confidence about the certainty of the regulatory environment into which they are proposing to make an investment.


The term 'sovereign risk' gets used extensively, but it is not exaggeration to say that capricious, short-term, random changes in significant tax parameters, inconsistent with the previously stated policy of the government, erode investor confidence and erode perceptions of a stable, well-managed jurisdiction that is not characterised by sovereign risk. Australia does have a good international reputation, built up over many decades of careful custody and careful stewardship. Australia does have a good international reputation as a jurisdiction where the rule of law prevails and which welcomes foreign investment. It is of the highest importance that we preserve, maintain and strengthen that reputation, particularly in view of the fact that we are a nation which is an importer of capital and has more investment opportunities than can be funded domestically—and, if we do not attract foreign capital, we will be less prosperous as a nation than if we do attract foreign capital. Against that backdrop, the House ought rightly be alarmed at the consistent inconsistency which has been displayed by this government when it comes to the treatment of the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts. This has been an extremely unfortunate episode and a demonstration of extremely poor management. It sends a very bad signal to international investors, and everybody in Australia who is concerned about our international investment reputation and concerned about sound economic management ought to be very troubled at the way the government has managed this particular episode.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (09:30):  It is just a few weeks since the budget was brought down and on the night of the budget we saw the government announcing the doubling of the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts to 15 per cent for foreign investors. Run forward a few weeks and here we are. The measure was listed for debate last week with an increase in the tax from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. It was listed for debate in the House as part of an omnibus group of bills. When the government came to speak they stood and withdrew that part of the omnibus set of bills which related to this increase in the final withholding tax.


We thought, 'This is a good sign; the government have had second thoughts about the stupidity of their decision to double this tax in such a difficult international investment climate. They have suddenly realised not only the impact in the short term but also what this will do our reputation as a reliable place for foreign investment.' But, no, within a space of 24 or 48 hours we were told that they were going to reintroduce this measure. We assumed that there would have to be some changes, that they had had second thoughts and they would have tidied up this legislation.


But what did we see? When the legislation was reintroduced, we saw that there was not one word changed in the whole thing. It is exactly the same as the stupidity that we saw on budget night, with the announcement of the doubling of the withholding tax. This of course confused everyone, including the business sector. But then we had the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, in the other place, admit that the government were effectively being dictated to by the Greens. So the legislation is announced, it is introduced, it is withdrawn and it is reintroduced, and then we find out that there is some motive for all this flip-flopping and this embarrassing approach by this government.


The Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 has become in many ways a classic symbol of the incompetence and chaos that we are seeing on the other side of the chamber in the way in which they are managing so many issues. The political management of this government is in chaos, and it has been for months. This is very much at the crisis of confidence that is now characterising the seven million households in Australia and the crisis of confidence that is running across the business sector outside of the resources sector. Even within the resources sector we are seeing so many Australian companies have now got their sights set on Africa.


I worked in that industry for several years and I have lots of contacts in the resources sector. I was in Perth three weeks ago to see a lot of these people and to get an update on what was happening with investments et cetera. Half of the people that I went to see were not available because they were in Africa. Three hundred Australian mining companies are now in Africa.


In Perth I met with one of the large investment funds from the US who have been there for four years. They are very active in placing investments from the United States into our mining sector. This fellow was ropeable. I met him at the airport. He was on his way back to the United States to have four meetings across the United States with a series of investors in his $5 billion investment fund. He was at pains to single me out and to list the litany of sovereign risk issues that have so damaged the reputation of Australia as a safe investment and the 40 per cent increase in the cost of mining projects. He was beside himself that he had to go back and at every one of these meetings across the United States say to each and every one of these important investors in his investment fund that they now needed to focus on Africa.


So with potentially still several years left in the mining boom, still with a pipeline of a quarter of a trillion dollars that has not gone to FID—or final investment decision—here we have an investor, who has invested time and has lived in Perth to place these investments for the last four years, who has had to go back to the United States and had to tell people to go to Africa, that investments now from that fund will go to Africa. This is what it has come to. This government is even undermining the mining boom. It takes a lot of skill, a lot of great ability, to take what are rivers of gold and compromise them so comprehensively as this government has done. In the last few years of this mining boom every mine that we could have achieved, which would have given us another 50 years of prosperity, will now be something that goes to Africa in the main. Again, by this decision, this government sent shock waves around the world not because of the size of the decision but because of the way in which it has added to that litany of sovereign risk issues that we have now confronted. If passed, this tax increase—with no grandfathering provision, which effectively makes this a retrospective piece of legislation—will do untold damage to our reputation as a stable and reliable jurisdiction to invest in.


The night after the budget I rang contacts in the United States—Australians who are trying to place investments here in Australia—and they were beside themselves. They said that all directors over there look at are the headlines. They do not have time, with so many destinations for possible investment, to understand the nuances. All they see are the headlines. They have seen the headlines about prime ministers coming and going as though we have a revolving door. They have seen attacks on former prime ministers by their own side that make their hair rise. They have seen headlines on carbon tax, on mining taxes and on the reregulation of the labour market, which has compromised the cost structure of doing business in the mining sector here.


They have seen the way in which this government panicked in an extreme fashion with the live cattle exports, closing off 40 per cent of the protein going to our biggest neighbour. We can almost throw a stone over to Indonesia; it houses 300 million people on our doorstep, is a big part of our future and is growing very strongly. And what do we do? Three nights after a television program we send them an email—it did not even go via the ambassador, who heard of it in the car on the radio—telling them, 'By the way, 40 per cent of the protein coming into your country is being stopped indefinitely as of now.' What a way to handle our relationship. What total humiliation of a neighbour.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Can I draw the member for Goldstein back to the bill before the House. I think he has ranged off widely this time.




Mr ROBB:
  I have not ranged widely. What I am saying is this adds to—



Government members interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  They can all laugh on the other side. This is just politics to them. This is simple and pure politics. It has nothing to do with our reputation as investors. So keep laughing! It is the way in which they deal with the serious issues in this country. This issue of the doubling of the withholding tax adds to this litany of sovereign risk issues which I have been seeking to draw attention to. Greg Hyland, the Shanghai based Regional Director for Asia Pacific Capital Markets with Jones Lang LaSalle, said recently:


People like investing in Australia because it has certainty, and when that environment changes people sit back and reassess the situation.


Obviously, when you double taxes, it's not attractive for investors. It undermines Australia as a safe haven to invest.


This sovereign risk in Australia has been monumentally enhanced by this government, and all for $260 million. Those opposite are going to sacrifice billions of dollars of investment for the sake of trying to meet a target surplus which they will never meet. They know that. They are not going to get there but, in order to try to demonstrate, that they will go to any lengths and sacrifice the integrity of our reputation as a safe investment haven.


This is so perplexing, and it totally contradicts budget night 2008. On that budget night former Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen, the member for McMahon, announced a progressive reduction in the withholding tax from 30 per cent to its current rate of 7.5 per cent. It is a matter which was widely regarded and supported. It was part of Labor's plan to develop Australia as a financial hub for Asia and the Pacific:


The government had acted to 'dramatically improve the competitiveness of the Australian managed funds industry', Bowen said.


The move, he added, would provide a 'significant boost to Australia's ability to compete globally' and would support the aim of growing assets under our management from the current $1.7 trillion to $2.5 trillion by 2015.


How things have changed in just four short years! Now we have a situation in which the sound principles and objectives that the then minister espoused have evaporated with this bill. More so, the Assistant Treasurer has the gall to attack us for defending Labor's original policy of 7.5 per cent. He is there attacking us for defending Labor's policy, which was widely heralded and widely admired and which has promoted significant investment in this country.


There is a requirement for MITs to have an in-country office. Several major retirement funds are in the process of developing those offices, and what do we do in the middle of it? Just as people become comfortable and encouraged by this provision the government pulls the rug out. Not only that, but it does not even grandfather the provision so that they are now stuck with investments that have been made at 7½ per cent which may well not have stacked up at 15 per cent. These are multimillion-dollar and in some cases billion-dollar investments.


The Assistant Treasurer claims that we have used flawed modelling from the Allen Consulting Group. Give me a break! Talk about flawed modelling. This government would have to have the worst record of any government for unreliable forecasts. The UBS forecasts miners will pay $4.78 billion over the next four years against Treasury's estimate of $13.4 billion. Look at the budget forecast—it went from $12 billion to $44 billion after making several jumps along the way over 18 months. How can people reliably assess or make investment decisions—or any decisions, for that matter—with the record this government has?


This government will stoop to any level to distract and to play politics. This is an act of base politics. Clearly, they have done a deal with the Greens. Something will come up in the Senate, and we will have more confusion. This bill will be amended again in the Senate—you can see it coming. The Assistant Treasurer will stand up and defend the bills, knowing full well that they have done some deal with the Greens. It will confuse the investment market once again, and who knows what strings are attached? Who knows what other pieces of legislation will come into this place that we know nothing about and which are part of this grubby deal that the Assistant Treasurer is going to seek to put through with the Greens in the other place? 


This government is a walking sovereign risk. This bill is part of that. The legislation should stay as it was. (Time expired)

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (09:45):  I would like to thank all of those members who have contributed constructively to this debate. The Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Act 2008 to increase the managed investment trust final withholding tax rate to 15 per cent. This will apply to distributions made in relation to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2012.


Schedule 1 to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 makes consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1953 to give effect to these changes. The new rate of 15 per cent withholding tax for managed investment trusts is still competitive with rates applying in other countries, and will bring us into line with or better than the US, Canada, Hong Kong and the UK. It is consistent with our original 2007 election commitment, and it is half of the 30 per cent rate that applied under the previous government.


When Labor came to office and reduced the 30 per cent tax rate, we heard howls of protest from the coalition. Peter Costello called it 'a tax cut for foreigners'. The member for Pearce was heard to ask: 'Why would you want to favour foreign investments and make them pay less than Australian companies?' But now the coalition is opposing this fiscally responsible approach that will continue to attract investment while also getting a fair return for Australian taxpayers.


You might find this strange, given that it is half the rate that was in place when those opposite were in government, but the coalition are addicted to their reckless negativity. They just cannot pass up on an opportunity to say no. Of course, if the coalition are genuinely opposed to the 15 per cent withholding tax rate, they should commit to reversing it in office. I see the shadow Treasurer is in the chamber, and I am sure he would be happy to stand up and to commit to reversing it in office. If he does that, he should also come clean about which payments and which frontline services he will rip away in order to fund this tax cut. If they are not prepared to set out exactly how they will fund this then the Australian people would be entitled to be sceptical and to take the view that the opposition's $70 billion black hole will only be getting larger and larger.


This government has taken the responsible decisions to bring the budget back to surplus on time and as promised. This responsible savings measure better balances the need for Australia to be an attractive destination for foreign investment by ensuring that Australia receives a fair return on profits to be made in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The question is that the bill be now read a second time. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with the resolution agreed to yesterday the division is deferred until the conclusion of discussion of a matter of public importance.

The bill's explanatory memorandum states that the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Act 2008 to increase the tax rate from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent on fund payments in relation to income years on or after 1 July 2012. It is instructive to note that it was only some three or four years ago that the rate was reduced to 7½ per cent, and at the time we as the coalition expressed concerns. Today we see a bill reintroduced to backtrack on that original reduction. The last time this bill was referred to committee to be reviewed we raised a number of concerns about its implementation which were largely due to the retrospective nature of the changes. However, thankfully, some of that appears to have been addressed within the bill's current form. However, retrospectivity aside, we remain concerned that billions of dollars of infrastructure investments already made, in addition to future investments, could potentially be put at risk as an implication of these changes.


An analysis conducted by the Allen Consulting Group for the Property Council showed that the proposed increase in the final withholding tax revenue from MITs would have a profound adverse affect on the economy without raising the expected revenue. It is instructive to note comments from Martin Codina of the Financial Services Council. He raises the concern that people have made investment decisions based on a tax rate of 7½ per cent and now the increase to 15 per cent is going to create increased uncertainty for those people in their investment-making decision. In addition, what does it say to investors about the Australian system when these things are constantly changed? Andrew Cannane, General Manager for Corporate Clients at the Trust Company, said in a recent interview:


We don't foresee there being the same amount of take up in MIT structures as there was. And ultimately, the net loser for that will be Australia. It will result in less foreign direct investment.


We all recognise in this House that we as a nation require foreign capital to build and grow our economy. Some 50 per cent of our financing and our loan books are funded from offshore funds. Andrew Cannane goes on to say that, in the calendar year 2011, foreign direct investment into Australian property rose some 50 per cent to $7.7 billion. He estimates that well over $5 billion of that would have been into managed investment trusts. He said:


The big concern for investors is the inconsistency. The 7.5 per cent rate has only been in place for two years and it's already changed.


To return to the Allen Consulting Group report, it noted that there was a billion-dollar drop in investment as a result of the increased tax. A net tax revenue for the period 2012-16 would be estimated at some $35 million due to decreased recipients, which is less than half the $75 million predicted by Treasurer. It also found that by 2015-16 the increased tax would reduce government direct inputs by $580 million and cost more than 4,600 jobs a year.


In addition to these concerns, the uncertainty this government has shown in dealing with the rate of the MIT withholding tax raises the issue of perceived sovereign risk. How will our relationship with our international business associates fare with the continued massive uncertainty caused by this government? The dissenting report by the coalition members of the economics committee stated:


The doubling of the withholding tax rate would also reduce Australia’s international competitiveness and reputation as an attractive and certain destination to invest in.


This is only made worse in light of other recent tax increases in the form of a carbon tax and a minerals resource rent tax. I am sure it is well and good that the Treasurer speaks about the $500 billion of investment in the pipeline, but the important part in that discussion is that it is pipeline investment. It has not been committed to works on the ground. It is work that is potentially planned yet has not come to fruition. This constant shifting of the goal posts, new taxes et cetera only makes it less certain that companies will proceed with those projected investments. What is the consequence to this country if that $500 billion of proposed pipeline investment turns out to be $250 billion or less? Attracting more foreign investment is important to achieve stronger economic growth leading to increased government revenue without the need for governments to hike taxes or introduce new taxes, like the carbon tax.


The carbon tax is only five days away and is the mother ship of the Labor-Greens government's poisonous policies. Yesterday I asked in question time about the fate of 800 workers at the local abattoir within my electorate. The plan there is to shut down the operations for up to 10 days to avoid going over the 25,000 tonne carbon tax threshold. The reason they even have to consider doing this to their loyal workers and their families is that they cannot afford to lose their competitiveness against other countries, like the USA, for example. We will certainly be in a league of our own once the carbon tax comes to town. What this example tells us is that this is a government that is not up to the job of protecting our future wealth, or economy for that matter. This bill, as I touched on earlier, has been outlined in a previous bill which was then excised from the bill by the government only to be reintroduced and debated once again here today. It is important for everybody's confidence in our economy that this ad hoc and piecemeal approach—to double the tax on managed investment trusts, but generally in relation to many legislative items over the term of this government—be reduced and that we have a more streamlined process so that people see a consistency and so that they can make long-term business and investment decisions and be confident that those decisions are going to allow them to grow and build their businesses and not be penalised due to increased tax rates and no ability to plan for that. Our focus should be on encouraging further investment from our foreign counterparts through internationally competitive taxation arrangements so that we can grow our economy more strongly and not just talk fluff about how great this economy is, when in reality the people of this country have had enough.


I support the comments from the member for North Sydney, who said yesterday in his contribution to this debate, 'Do not create uncertainty.' Uncertainty is the death knell of business. We need business certainty in all areas, whether it is taxation or regulation, because that allows businesses to make those long-term decisions to create wealth for the future of this country. It is our business community—it is ordinary Australians—that are the ones that go out and create the wealth for this country. It is not governments, of whatever persuasion. Governments do not create anything. More often than not they put roadblocks in the way of people's vision for what they would like to do for their lives and the future of this country.


So I call on this government to create, or seek to create, an atmosphere of trust so that people can trust this government and the direction it is going. But ultimately examples like this bill reduce that trust and create uncertainty. It is the consistent, coherent economic strategies that were employed under the Howard-Costello government that allowed our country to grow and prosper. I think this government has ably demonstrated that it is not able to produce and stick to a coherent economic strategy, and for the future of this country one is desperately, desperately needed. As the member for Ryan quite adequately pointed out in her contribution, it is really only a coalition government that can restore hope, reward and opportunity to all Australians for the future of this country.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (09:17):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012. This bill is the next stage in what has been an inglorious saga of prevarication and changing position by this government over many years. As I cast around for a term which would most accurately describe what has happened, I was reminded of my experiences as an eight-year-old boy with one of those electronics starter kits that you were given—in my case by an engineer father hoping to encourage his son in the same direction. Sadly, I turned out to be a great disappointment and became a lawyer, but I do remember one thing from this particular set. There was an exercise in building what was described, as I recollect, as a 'multivibrator flip-flop'. A multivibrator flip-flop is apparently some kind of electric circuit—that is as much as I recollect. But it struck me as really quite an appropriate term for what we have seen from the Treasurer in his conduct of withholding tax rates. This has really been a multivibrator flip-flop exercise, Madam Deputy Speaker. You would recollect, I am sure, the glowing terms in which the Treasurer announced to the world in 2008 the policy approach that he was going to take in this area. He had this to say. His words rang out through the chamber:


Our nation has the potential to be a financial services hub in the Asia Pacific Region—the fastest growing region in the world. To support this ambition, the Budget begins the process of significantly reducing the withholding tax, by reducing the current interim rate of 30 per cent to a final rate of 7.5 per cent for most nonresident investors.


We then had in the budget announcement in May of this year the announcement, to the great surprise of the financial services industry, that the rate was to increase from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. This came with very little warning. It emerged out of the need of the Treasurer and the government to desperately cast around for revenue to plug the massive hole that they had created through sustained fiscal mismanagement over several years and to deliver, for political reasons, on the promise of having a surplus for the 2012-13 year. With very little foreshadowing and very little announcement, it was disclosed that a decision had been taken to increase this rate—the reduction of which had been foreshadowed and announced so proudly only a few years before. With no notice, the financial services sector was told that the rate was going to increase from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent.


That in itself was unsettling and disturbing enough, but last week we had a truly remarkable development, because last week the parliament was considering the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill. The bill included within schedule 4 a set of provisions under which the rate was to move from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That is to say that the bill was, it appeared, intended to give effect to the announcement made by the Treasurer in the budget speech only a few weeks before. We had the extraordinary saga of the Assistant Treasurer coming into this place and moving an amendment to remove the provision in the bill which was intended to give effect to the announcement which had been made only a few weeks before. This was a truly mystifying development, and no light was cast on the mystery by any explanation from the Assistant Treasurer. He sat mute at the table, giving no enlightenment to the chamber at all as to why the government was now reversing a policy which it had announced only a month before—a policy which in turn reversed the policy which the government had announced with such fanfare in 2008. So at that point observers were, to say the least, puzzled—the rate had gone from 30 to 7.5, and it was then announced it was going to go from 7.5 to 15, and the government then moved an amendment on its own bill to reduce the rate from 15 back to 7.5.


But the flip-flop activities of the Treasurer and the Gillard government in this area have not ceased, because in the bill the House is now considering the flip-flop continues. We are now told that indeed the rate will increase from 7.5 to 15 per cent, and we find in schedule 1 of the bill a set of provisions which is identical in every regard to the provisions which were contained in another bill put before the House last week and were then excised by the government in its own amendment. The word 'curious' does not begin to describe what is going on here. I reiterate that the only term that I can find that I think best describes the conduct of the Treasurer and the Gillard government on this front is the term that I have dredged up from my own memory as a small boy, playing with an electronic starter kit: the multivibrator flip-flop.


It is easy to castigate this government for its flip-flopping, but let us turn to the serious consequences of this kind of conduct. Let us turn to what it actually means for business confidence—not just in Australia but, very importantly, business confidence on the part of international investors who are considering putting money into an Australian investment. Let us recollect that international capital is highly mobile. Let us recollect that Australia is competing to attract investment capital against many other destinations. Let us recollect that Australia is a nation which, every year, imports capital—and, were we not to do that, we would leave investment opportunities not taken up and we would find ourselves less prosperous than we would otherwise be. So the question of creating a climate of confidence, in which international investment can be attracted, is a question of first importance for any responsible Australian government as it considers its economic policy. Unfortunately, we have had a government through this sorry saga over the last few years—including the extraordinary mismanagement of the last few weeks—which has done a remarkable amount to erode investor confidence, including the confidence of foreign investors.


What foreign investors now understand to be the position of the Australian government is that high-minded sentiments expressed one year can be abandoned in a great hurry the next year to fill a short-term budget hole. We have a government which is desperately casting around to try and find extra sources of money to deal with the fact that it has engaged in profligate, irresponsible, uncontrolled spending year after year, a government which is prepared to trash policy commitments it had made only a few short years prior and a government which is prepared to demonstrate extraordinary political incompetence and mismanagement in the basic task of giving effect to the legislative changes it has announced. It is just an extraordinary piece of mismanagement, and it leaves foreign investors wondering whether any policy commitment by this government is one that will be honoured for any period of time at all, because the risk that they must face and that they must factor into any investment decision they are contemplating is that for short-term domestic exigencies, because of the desperate need to manage short-term financial pressures, a policy setting which had supposedly been a substantial and reliable commitment of the government is just abandoned without any warning whatsoever.


One of the things that business requires more than anything else is certainty. What is important for business and for investors is to understand the ground rules as they are contemplating making investments in Australia. Businesses manage their affairs over a significant time frame; businesses engage in long-term planning. Major investment decisions require a long lead time and need to go through internal approval processes. Many businesses will be planning not just for next year with an operating plan but will have a forward plan which may extend two, three, four, five or even 10 years out. As they go through that planning process, businesses will assess the investment conditions that they face, and they are much more likely to come to a favourable investment decision in respect of an investment in Australia or anywhere else if they have confidence about the certainty of the regulatory environment into which they are proposing to make an investment.


The term 'sovereign risk' gets used extensively, but it is not exaggeration to say that capricious, short-term, random changes in significant tax parameters, inconsistent with the previously stated policy of the government, erode investor confidence and erode perceptions of a stable, well-managed jurisdiction that is not characterised by sovereign risk. Australia does have a good international reputation, built up over many decades of careful custody and careful stewardship. Australia does have a good international reputation as a jurisdiction where the rule of law prevails and which welcomes foreign investment. It is of the highest importance that we preserve, maintain and strengthen that reputation, particularly in view of the fact that we are a nation which is an importer of capital and has more investment opportunities than can be funded domestically—and, if we do not attract foreign capital, we will be less prosperous as a nation than if we do attract foreign capital. Against that backdrop, the House ought rightly be alarmed at the consistent inconsistency which has been displayed by this government when it comes to the treatment of the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts. This has been an extremely unfortunate episode and a demonstration of extremely poor management. It sends a very bad signal to international investors, and everybody in Australia who is concerned about our international investment reputation and concerned about sound economic management ought to be very troubled at the way the government has managed this particular episode.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (09:30):  It is just a few weeks since the budget was brought down and on the night of the budget we saw the government announcing the doubling of the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts to 15 per cent for foreign investors. Run forward a few weeks and here we are. The measure was listed for debate last week with an increase in the tax from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. It was listed for debate in the House as part of an omnibus group of bills. When the government came to speak they stood and withdrew that part of the omnibus set of bills which related to this increase in the final withholding tax.


We thought, 'This is a good sign; the government have had second thoughts about the stupidity of their decision to double this tax in such a difficult international investment climate. They have suddenly realised not only the impact in the short term but also what this will do our reputation as a reliable place for foreign investment.' But, no, within a space of 24 or 48 hours we were told that they were going to reintroduce this measure. We assumed that there would have to be some changes, that they had had second thoughts and they would have tidied up this legislation.


But what did we see? When the legislation was reintroduced, we saw that there was not one word changed in the whole thing. It is exactly the same as the stupidity that we saw on budget night, with the announcement of the doubling of the withholding tax. This of course confused everyone, including the business sector. But then we had the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, in the other place, admit that the government were effectively being dictated to by the Greens. So the legislation is announced, it is introduced, it is withdrawn and it is reintroduced, and then we find out that there is some motive for all this flip-flopping and this embarrassing approach by this government.


The Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 has become in many ways a classic symbol of the incompetence and chaos that we are seeing on the other side of the chamber in the way in which they are managing so many issues. The political management of this government is in chaos, and it has been for months. This is very much at the crisis of confidence that is now characterising the seven million households in Australia and the crisis of confidence that is running across the business sector outside of the resources sector. Even within the resources sector we are seeing so many Australian companies have now got their sights set on Africa.


I worked in that industry for several years and I have lots of contacts in the resources sector. I was in Perth three weeks ago to see a lot of these people and to get an update on what was happening with investments et cetera. Half of the people that I went to see were not available because they were in Africa. Three hundred Australian mining companies are now in Africa.


In Perth I met with one of the large investment funds from the US who have been there for four years. They are very active in placing investments from the United States into our mining sector. This fellow was ropeable. I met him at the airport. He was on his way back to the United States to have four meetings across the United States with a series of investors in his $5 billion investment fund. He was at pains to single me out and to list the litany of sovereign risk issues that have so damaged the reputation of Australia as a safe investment and the 40 per cent increase in the cost of mining projects. He was beside himself that he had to go back and at every one of these meetings across the United States say to each and every one of these important investors in his investment fund that they now needed to focus on Africa.


So with potentially still several years left in the mining boom, still with a pipeline of a quarter of a trillion dollars that has not gone to FID—or final investment decision—here we have an investor, who has invested time and has lived in Perth to place these investments for the last four years, who has had to go back to the United States and had to tell people to go to Africa, that investments now from that fund will go to Africa. This is what it has come to. This government is even undermining the mining boom. It takes a lot of skill, a lot of great ability, to take what are rivers of gold and compromise them so comprehensively as this government has done. In the last few years of this mining boom every mine that we could have achieved, which would have given us another 50 years of prosperity, will now be something that goes to Africa in the main. Again, by this decision, this government sent shock waves around the world not because of the size of the decision but because of the way in which it has added to that litany of sovereign risk issues that we have now confronted. If passed, this tax increase—with no grandfathering provision, which effectively makes this a retrospective piece of legislation—will do untold damage to our reputation as a stable and reliable jurisdiction to invest in.


The night after the budget I rang contacts in the United States—Australians who are trying to place investments here in Australia—and they were beside themselves. They said that all directors over there look at are the headlines. They do not have time, with so many destinations for possible investment, to understand the nuances. All they see are the headlines. They have seen the headlines about prime ministers coming and going as though we have a revolving door. They have seen attacks on former prime ministers by their own side that make their hair rise. They have seen headlines on carbon tax, on mining taxes and on the reregulation of the labour market, which has compromised the cost structure of doing business in the mining sector here.


They have seen the way in which this government panicked in an extreme fashion with the live cattle exports, closing off 40 per cent of the protein going to our biggest neighbour. We can almost throw a stone over to Indonesia; it houses 300 million people on our doorstep, is a big part of our future and is growing very strongly. And what do we do? Three nights after a television program we send them an email—it did not even go via the ambassador, who heard of it in the car on the radio—telling them, 'By the way, 40 per cent of the protein coming into your country is being stopped indefinitely as of now.' What a way to handle our relationship. What total humiliation of a neighbour.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Can I draw the member for Goldstein back to the bill before the House. I think he has ranged off widely this time.




Mr ROBB:
  I have not ranged widely. What I am saying is this adds to—



Government members interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  They can all laugh on the other side. This is just politics to them. This is simple and pure politics. It has nothing to do with our reputation as investors. So keep laughing! It is the way in which they deal with the serious issues in this country. This issue of the doubling of the withholding tax adds to this litany of sovereign risk issues which I have been seeking to draw attention to. Greg Hyland, the Shanghai based Regional Director for Asia Pacific Capital Markets with Jones Lang LaSalle, said recently:


People like investing in Australia because it has certainty, and when that environment changes people sit back and reassess the situation.


Obviously, when you double taxes, it's not attractive for investors. It undermines Australia as a safe haven to invest.


This sovereign risk in Australia has been monumentally enhanced by this government, and all for $260 million. Those opposite are going to sacrifice billions of dollars of investment for the sake of trying to meet a target surplus which they will never meet. They know that. They are not going to get there but, in order to try to demonstrate, that they will go to any lengths and sacrifice the integrity of our reputation as a safe investment haven.


This is so perplexing, and it totally contradicts budget night 2008. On that budget night former Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen, the member for McMahon, announced a progressive reduction in the withholding tax from 30 per cent to its current rate of 7.5 per cent. It is a matter which was widely regarded and supported. It was part of Labor's plan to develop Australia as a financial hub for Asia and the Pacific:


The government had acted to 'dramatically improve the competitiveness of the Australian managed funds industry', Bowen said.


The move, he added, would provide a 'significant boost to Australia's ability to compete globally' and would support the aim of growing assets under our management from the current $1.7 trillion to $2.5 trillion by 2015.


How things have changed in just four short years! Now we have a situation in which the sound principles and objectives that the then minister espoused have evaporated with this bill. More so, the Assistant Treasurer has the gall to attack us for defending Labor's original policy of 7.5 per cent. He is there attacking us for defending Labor's policy, which was widely heralded and widely admired and which has promoted significant investment in this country.


There is a requirement for MITs to have an in-country office. Several major retirement funds are in the process of developing those offices, and what do we do in the middle of it? Just as people become comfortable and encouraged by this provision the government pulls the rug out. Not only that, but it does not even grandfather the provision so that they are now stuck with investments that have been made at 7½ per cent which may well not have stacked up at 15 per cent. These are multimillion-dollar and in some cases billion-dollar investments.


The Assistant Treasurer claims that we have used flawed modelling from the Allen Consulting Group. Give me a break! Talk about flawed modelling. This government would have to have the worst record of any government for unreliable forecasts. The UBS forecasts miners will pay $4.78 billion over the next four years against Treasury's estimate of $13.4 billion. Look at the budget forecast—it went from $12 billion to $44 billion after making several jumps along the way over 18 months. How can people reliably assess or make investment decisions—or any decisions, for that matter—with the record this government has?


This government will stoop to any level to distract and to play politics. This is an act of base politics. Clearly, they have done a deal with the Greens. Something will come up in the Senate, and we will have more confusion. This bill will be amended again in the Senate—you can see it coming. The Assistant Treasurer will stand up and defend the bills, knowing full well that they have done some deal with the Greens. It will confuse the investment market once again, and who knows what strings are attached? Who knows what other pieces of legislation will come into this place that we know nothing about and which are part of this grubby deal that the Assistant Treasurer is going to seek to put through with the Greens in the other place? 


This government is a walking sovereign risk. This bill is part of that. The legislation should stay as it was. (Time expired)

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (09:45):  I would like to thank all of those members who have contributed constructively to this debate. The Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Act 2008 to increase the managed investment trust final withholding tax rate to 15 per cent. This will apply to distributions made in relation to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2012.


Schedule 1 to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 makes consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1953 to give effect to these changes. The new rate of 15 per cent withholding tax for managed investment trusts is still competitive with rates applying in other countries, and will bring us into line with or better than the US, Canada, Hong Kong and the UK. It is consistent with our original 2007 election commitment, and it is half of the 30 per cent rate that applied under the previous government.


When Labor came to office and reduced the 30 per cent tax rate, we heard howls of protest from the coalition. Peter Costello called it 'a tax cut for foreigners'. The member for Pearce was heard to ask: 'Why would you want to favour foreign investments and make them pay less than Australian companies?' But now the coalition is opposing this fiscally responsible approach that will continue to attract investment while also getting a fair return for Australian taxpayers.


You might find this strange, given that it is half the rate that was in place when those opposite were in government, but the coalition are addicted to their reckless negativity. They just cannot pass up on an opportunity to say no. Of course, if the coalition are genuinely opposed to the 15 per cent withholding tax rate, they should commit to reversing it in office. I see the shadow Treasurer is in the chamber, and I am sure he would be happy to stand up and to commit to reversing it in office. If he does that, he should also come clean about which payments and which frontline services he will rip away in order to fund this tax cut. If they are not prepared to set out exactly how they will fund this then the Australian people would be entitled to be sceptical and to take the view that the opposition's $70 billion black hole will only be getting larger and larger.


This government has taken the responsible decisions to bring the budget back to surplus on time and as promised. This responsible savings measure better balances the need for Australia to be an attractive destination for foreign investment by ensuring that Australia receives a fair return on profits to be made in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Dunkley) (15:15):  The small business community have been completely ignored by this Gillard government but are at the pointy end of the carbon tax.

If it were not bad enough for small business to be recording a 48 per cent increase in small business insolvencies over the last 12 months and a 95 per cent reduction in small business start-ups, an attack on enterprise, 14½ thousand employing small businesses now not employing Australians right across our continent—a reduction in the share of private sector workforce engaged by small business—the government comes up with a cunning plan, a plan that has no greater adverse impact on any sector of the economy than the small business community, and that is the carbon tax.


This was the carbon tax that small business was promised it would not have to face. Remember those infamous words: 'There shall be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? Those were the words of the Prime Minister seeking re-election. Yet, just a few short years later, here we are, facing the world's largest carbon tax and also facing a further attack on the small business community that this government just seem not to care about.


You heard today the confused message of the government. They were saying how wrong it was for the coalition to highlight that small businesses will be faced with higher costs, how their input costs will go up, how the cost of refrigerants will go through the roof, how the cost of their inputs will also go up and how the cost of fuel and other crucial components of a small business doing its business will go up under Labor's carbon tax. We were told: 'No, no; that is wrong. You are just frightening people.' Yet, when it suited, when it was convenient for the government to come at exactly the same topic from another angle and say, 'Oh but there is compensation to account for these cost increases'—arising from the carbon tax that they have just gone on saying that small business was not going to face—we get a completely contradictory story from the government.


Little wonder then that the small business community is completely bewildered by what the government is up to. Many took the government at its word that small businesses would not have to plan for a carbon tax. Yet here they are, confronted with the world's largest carbon tax. Small business heard week after week about the carve-outs, and the compensation that everyone was going to get, and how this would be such a soft landing of a carbon tax, only to find now that the only people to miss out on any direct support whatsoever are the small business community. They have not got any of the hush money that is being dished out to Alcoa. They have not got any of the bailouts—the 'Let's hope that the economic and employment consequences of the carbon tax can be pushed further away from its introduction date'—payments.




Mr Perrett:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The term 'hush money' was mentioned yesterday and it was found to be not appropriate language. I ask that it be withdrawn.



Mr Billson interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Dunkley does not have the call. The withdrawal of wording is often within the context. The member for Dunkley will be able to continue.




Mr BILLSON:
  Thank you, Sir. All the small business community—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  'Sir'? I think I might ask you to withdraw that!




Mr BILLSON:
  I am perpetually deferential! All the small business community have got is haranguing from this government—no direct assistance; just this verbal abuse that, if they dare put up their prices, they will have the full weight of the ACCC coming down on them and yet, at the same time, households are being told, 'Well, there might be price increases but we have compensated you for that.'


There has been no modelling done by this government on any impact of the carbon tax on any small business type or size, on any goods or services that they provide, on any different business structure, on any supply chain, where the carbon tax builds and builds and builds at every step along the way.


Think of an ice-creamery in Hervey Bay. There they have to face a range of impacts. Let us talk about the dairy. The simple milking of the cows is going to have a carbon tax impact—an energy-intensive hot-water requirement to maintain hygiene. The freight costs will then get moved on. You then go beyond the dairy itself, once the cows have been milked, to process the milk—energy-intensive; perishable goods; refrigerant everywhere. It then may go on to an ice-cream manufacturer—same all over again: embedded energy costs of the earlier stages plus their own refrigerant, their own energy costs, their own transport costs, their own impact on packaging. It will build and it will build.


Because the ice-creamery that Mr Neville and I might run at Hervey Bay is a small one, we cannot buy directly from the manufacturer; it would probably go off to a midpoint, not directly from the producer of the ice-cream but a wholesaler, and then maybe on to someone else, and finally we might get that input. The world's largest carbon tax has built at every stage of that production process—has accumulated, has compounded. Hopefully there is a margin on top for the business so that they can stay afloat to go and employ people.


Then we face the consumers, who have heard the government go around saying, 'Only the top few hundred emitters will be paying the carbon tax.' No, that is wrong; we will all be paying the carbon tax. We will all be paying the carbon tax, and every small business will be hurt by the carbon tax. And where will their compensation come from? Well, there is none. There is no compensation whatsoever.


So what has the coalition had to do? The coalition has had to go out there and do the government's work for it, to explain that there are impacts in the supply chain and in the energy costs that are going to affect small business. It has been the coalition that has had to provide the small businesses with the assistance to communicate the very essence of the government's scheme—that these cost impacts will work their way through the system, that somehow people will only buy half an ice-cream rather than a full ice-cream, and the costs will be passed on but the consumer is being compensated.


Has the government bothered to explain that to anybody? Has the government sought to assure small businesses that the very design of its carbon tax is intended to push up their costs, is intended to have an impact on the supply chain, is intended to make refrigeration more expensive, and is intended to then be passed on, as the Prime Minister ultimately conceded in her contribution today? No, it has not done that at all. The government has gone out there trying to create a completely false impression of who is paying for the carbon tax and what it actually means for consumers. So we have had to do the government's work for it. It has done the ads, where the carbon tax dare not speak its name and there is a household assistance love just falling from the sky—apparently for no other reason than the benevolence of the government. You have then had no assistance from the Marcel Marceau of small-business ministers—never utters a word about the impact on a key area of our constituency. So the coalition has had to do it. The coalition has had to provide small businesses throughout Australia with an easily understandable, accurate, reliable and dependable explanation about the government's carbon tax.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Dunkley has used his props sufficiently.




Mr BILLSON:
  Oh, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have not even waved the grocery document around yet, or the dry cleaning one.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Yes, yes. The member for Dunkley can put away his props.




Mr BILLSON:
  There are more, and I would like to thank the government—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Dunkley.




Mr BILLSON:
  for highlighting the availability of these very useful information documents.


The government has not done any modelling on the impact on small business. It has not provided any advice about how small business and its consumers will feel the pain of the carbon tax. It has then gone around accusing the opposition of making false claims, when we are actually providing the only reliable, accurate and dependable information that is out there. We then had the Assistant Treasurer having a go at me and the Leader of the Opposition, saying that these documents were misleading. That only lasted about an hour. When he came into this place he was very smart not to repeat that claim, because he knows it is not right. These documents are accurate and reliable, and they communicate the reality of the carbon tax impact on small business.


When we come to false claims, where do you start? Can you get past, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? That is a whopper of a false claim, and it is lucky that the ACCC does not have a crack at prime ministerial statements. But it goes further than that. We have seen the Prime Minister assure, in her words, 'small business families and tradies' that there will be no impact on fuel, yet we know from the Australasian Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association that that is not true either. They said that is simply not correct.


There might have been a few freebie permits given for refining, but that is it. It is all the way through the movement of that fuel—its storage, its production and its distribution to the petrol sellers around the place. With the cost of running a service station, ACAPMA itemise every step along the way post the refinery process, where the carbon tax is going to push up the cost of production and put upward pressure on fuel. That is another false and misleading claim by the Prime Minister.


Then there was another one. Remember when the Prime Minister was in Brisbane and she said, 'I am sure most businesses will do the right thing, but if anyone dares put up their prices by more than one per cent they will be price gouging and we will send the ACCC after them'? People stopped and thought, 'Gee, that's interesting. Maybe the government has done some modelling that they have locked away along with the modelling for the taxation review that no-one can get a look at. Maybe it's just tucked away in a secret file.' So we ask the question: where did this claim come from? Where is the evidence to back it up? Where is the data, the analysis, to support what amounted to a prime ministerial decree on price movements arising from the carbon tax? Do you know where it is? It is not anywhere. It is not in here, in the dispatch box; I had a look and I could not find it in there. I have asked the small business minister to produce some in consideration in detail. There has been none. We have asked time and time again: where is the detail to substantiate that claim? The answer? There is none. There is no detail to substantiate what is the most blatant verbal haranguing the Prime Minister could give the small business community—accusing them with no analysis of what the cap would be on price movements.


What is worse, she did not even accurately reflect the law. In Australia we have no law that mandates a cap on price movements and no requirement for people to disclose exactly why they have arrived at the price they have. If you do not like the price, you can go somewhere else. If you have decided that you want to structure your business from certain price points, you can do that. That is why we live in this market economy. Does the Prime Minister get that? No. The centralised view is that everything comes out of Canberra. She must think you have to approve it or something, but that is not the case.


The law actually says that small businesses, when they are making representations, cannot be false and misleading. What the Prime Minister did was falsely and in a misleading way incorrectly characterise the law to frighten and intimidate small business so that she can run around, saying, 'See, there is no impact. We were right with our wildly conservatively understated estimate of the price impact of the carbon tax. Look at that.' What is the consequence of that? What is the effect for small business in an already difficult trading environment, with wafer-thin margins, no sloppy profits to be found, costs going up everywhere and their own energy costs, all of which we have seen in government reports in which they have been understated over and over again?


Rent is going up, gas is up and electricity is up. They have never run a business and, since I have been the shadow minister, we have our fourth small business minister that we are going to have educate about what a small business is. I am happy to keep working at that but please help me. It is an enormous task because there is no early evidence that I have been successful in letting the minister know what the impact is on small business. Have a look at some of these documents. We are doing the government's work for them, communicating the very essence of the scheme, as they describe it, and then they accuse the coalition of doing the wrong thing. You should be doing that, Minister. That is what the shadow small business minister and the opposition leader would not have to do if the government were fair dinkum and had half an interest in the plight of small business in this economy.


It goes further. The Assistant Treasurer, after not repeating his unsubstantiated claim in the media today about the nature of these documents, has scurried off, but he has made a contribution elsewhere. I raised the impact of the carbon tax and what it would mean for Westfield Penrith. There is now a carbon tax escalation clause in the lease of their tenants, so you have tenants faced with having carbon tax escalation factors affecting their leases, their direct energy costs, and we could have a long conversation—and I hope we get the chance—about the impact of energy costs in off-peak rates. I have had small businesses say to me, 'We have had to structure our business because we are a heavy energy user and we do the bulk of our heavy energy use during the night because the tariff is lower.' We have heard this right around the country, and they will get an enormous increase in their costs.


When we talked about Penrith, and the member for—wherever the election is.




Mr Morrison:
  Lindsay.




Mr BILLSON:
  Thank you; the member for Lindsay.




Mr Morrison:
  Apparently it's near Darwin!




Mr BILLSON:
  Apparently it's south of Adelaide—a bit like the earlier question when we were talking about Whyalla.


The Assistant Treasurer said, 'The cost increase in electricity from the carbon tax would be only 0.2 per cent of overall expenditure of a typical small business, based on Treasury modelling.' What is this 'typical business'? We have not been able to find one. You might have noticed that we have visited quite a few lately, and we are trying to work out what this typical business is that has been subject to the invisible Treasury modelling that has not been released; it has probably been taken by Captain Emad on his travels. We do not know where that is, so we are saying, 'If that is the basis of your claim, produce some facts so that the small business community can actually see what's going on'.


What has not been produced is the evidence that the government has appreciated that its carbon tax will push up the price of electricity, gas, refrigeration, rents, produce and supplier costs. It builds, it compounds, it increases all the way through—and the small business men and women will have to face the customers who have had a diet of nonsense from the government about how only the top few hundred will be paying this tax and explain to them, 'No that is not right; we are all paying this tax'. That is why these publications are so important. I commend them to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, if you would like some of them to be circulated in your own electorate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, no.




Mr BILLSON:
  What is happening here is that the small business community know they have no friend in the government. They are not sure anyone in the government could recognise a small business. They have seen no evidence that the plight of small business, a crucial contributor to our economy and our communities, has featured at all in the government's consideration around the carbon tax. This carbon tax hurts no-one more than the small business community and the government should be condemned for their indifference. (Time expired)

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (15:30):  The member for Dunkley sometimes thinks that the faster you talk and the more words you use in 15 minutes somehow provides a compelling case in advance of his particular resolution entitled: 'The adverse effect of the carbon tax on small business'. I listened closely to the member for Dunkley, but at no point did he really outline the case that there was a significant impost upon small business. In fact, this government has been very focused to ensure that small business was impacted in a very negligible way by pricing carbon. The last thing we will do is be lectured to by the opposition who, when in government, imposed the GST upon the small business community. The last thing I really need is a lecture from the member for Dunkley on how to look after small business, given the efforts by the Howard government to turn every small business in this country into an unpaid tax collector. So I need not have any lectures from those opposite. Even when I go around the country and speak to small businesses and ask them about government regulation, the first thing out of their mouths about the concerns they have in relation to government was the imposition of the GST and its impact upon small business. So I hardly need any lectures from the member for Dunkley or the Leader of the Opposition in relation to how we look after small business in this country.


With that in mind, this government wants to ensure that the small business community would not have any imposts placed upon them in relation to pricing carbon in the context of this very important reform. As the Prime Minister and others have said, it is important that we bring about this reform for this country so that we do reduce carbon and see some structural change in our economy, because we are a high carbon emitter. That is important. At one point in time every Liberal leader and Labor leader supported a market based approach to pricing carbon. Indeed, Prime Minister Howard supported a market based approach to pricing carbon. Malcolm Turnbull and Brendan Nelson did. And, of course, Tony Abbott, the current Leader of the Opposition, did at one point support a market based approach to pricing carbon when it suited him, and when it suited him to do otherwise he chose to wage one of the most reckless and negative scare campaigns this country has ever seen upon Australians and, in particular, on the small business community. I find that rather offensive and very unfortunate.


But I do believe that the small business community are very sensible, hard-working Australians and when the facts reveal themselves from 1 July they will realise that the myths and the untruths told by the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Dunkley and others will be exposed and the truth will reveal itself. We do this important reform knowing it is difficult but knowing it is essential, and we do this knowing that we are in a very good economic situation. It is important to make that point because we wanted to ensure that small business are able to cope with these changes, negligible as they are, upon them. Just remember this: no reporting on carbon; no requirements to report to government; no tax to be paid; no tax to be collected; and, indeed, in relation to the CPI, a 0.7 per cent impact. For that reason, there are some follow-through on costs, but they are relatively negligible. They are about one-quarter of the costs associated with the GST. We are not even taking into account, of course, all those other imposts that were applied by the Howard government on the small business community.


Can I remind the House that we do have a very good economic conditions? We are returning the budget to surplus—that is very important—to provide confidence both here and overseas about the state of our economy. We are one of the very few developed nations that can even make that point about returning the budget to surplus. We have relatively low unemployment, around five per cent, and an increasing participation rate in our economy. We have very good economic growth and the lowest official cash rate that we have seen at any time under the Howard government. We have seen a reduction in the official cash rate in the last couple months of 75 basis points. What does that mean for small business? That means it provides them with greater opportunities to access loans, because interest rates are falling. And, of course, we have seen contained inflation. To see lower unemployment and contained inflation in this way is truly remarkable in the context of other developed nations around the world who are confronted with double-digit unemployment, inflation and some very serious challenges to their economies.


What we also did in order to ensure we provided support for small business arising out of the budget is that we announced a number of initiatives that we believe small businesses will embrace and indeed are embracing. Firstly, we introduced the instant asset tax write-off, which allows for assets purchased up to $6,500 and instant depreciation of 100 per cent after the first year. This has been well received by small business, really providing opportunities for cash flow. Indeed, I should add that because the depreciation is paid in the first year it reduces depreciation schedules, which will ensure far less paperwork for small businesses. That is very important for those microbusinesses where they are doing most of their own bookwork and they do not want to have to fill out forms unnecessarily.


The other thing we are doing is introducing the loss carry-back scheme. This is a scheme that has been very well received by incorporated businesses, 90 per cent of which are small businesses. This will allow for businesses to reclaim tax they have paid up to two years earlier when they make a loss or reinvest in their company—perhaps to substantially upgrade their equipment or to reduce energy consumption. This is a very important initiative. It not only provides opportunities for about 110,000 companies, particularly small businesses, to invest and innovate but also creates confidence in the small business sector to invest, and that is important for our economy and for the small business community generally.


I would also like to say that, for two-thirds of small businesses, we have seen the trebling of the tax-free threshold to $18,200—remembering that two-thirds of small businesses are not incorporated and they too, therefore, will benefit from that initiative. This is literally taking one million Australians out of the tax system. This is something that is remarkable, and no other government would be trying this on at this time—certainly amongst the developed nations—because they would not be able to do it. But good economic handling and good fiscal management have created the environment for the Reserve Bank to apply monetary policy. We are seeing some very good arrangements and a very good economic environment in which small business can thrive.


That is not to say there are not challenges. Those challenges, of course, include the high Australian dollar, and it is for that reason that we have had these initiatives targeting small business in sectors of our economy that are not doing as well as, of course, the mining sector. This is, I think, a very important thing to note. I should also add that there is also the instant asset tax write-off for vehicles, under which businesses can receive a write-off of up to the first $5,000 of a company vehicle. These initiatives combined provide great opportunities for small businesses in Australia.


I heard a lot of bluster from the member for Dunkley, but the facts are these: there are no direct taxes that apply to small business. The misinformation that is being spread by the member for Dunkley and others is, of course, untrue. In relation to energy costs the Treasury, of course, have done their modelling and the average energy cost of a small business is two per cent of overall costs, and there will be a 10 per cent increase on that two per cent—0.2 per cent of overall costs to a small business. Of course we would expect those modest or negligible prices to be able to be passed on to the consumers. Why? Because we have managed through this effort to make sure that pensioners, parents and students are provided with cash payments, and we have also ensured that from 1 July workers will receive tax cuts, and in most cases they are ongoing. So I think it is really important to note that the government has taken account of the small business situation to ensure that they are not having to report to government, that they are not having to apply or collect a tax and that they will be compensated for the modest cost that will be passed on because they will be able to increase, very modestly, those prices.


The 0.7 per cent CPI increase that was shown by the modelling done by Treasury has now been affirmed by many, many other bodies, including other governments. We saw when the Western Australian government handed down its budget that it too confirmed that there would be a 0.7 per cent increase to CPI. We have seen that now with other governments, confirming the Treasury's modelling that that is indeed the increase to inflation. That is, as I say, very manageable, given the economic circumstances that we are in.


That has not, of course, stopped the opposition trying to scare people in, I think, a very irresponsible way. There is no doubt in my mind when I look at some of the indicators insofar as consumer confidence and business confidence are concerned that, whilst—I think legitimately—some concerns have arisen as a result of what is happening in Europe and the United States, the efforts by the opposition to effectively spread untruths throughout the community have had a big impact upon consumer confidence. I think that is an irresponsible act by the opposition. It is irresponsible, I think, to trash your own country's economy. It is irresponsible to say things that are not true and to suggest that things will happen when they will not happen. To suggest for a moment that a community can be used as a prop—that Whyalla can be used by the Leader of the Opposition as a prop so he can say that they will be wiped off the map—is an irresponsible act by the Leader of the Opposition, and it goes to the character of the Leader of the Opposition. To suggest that a country town that is growing economically and, as the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government said in question time, is growing in population will be wiped off the map is an irresponsible, reckless and destructively negative thing to say in relation to that very important community, as is the case with his references to other communities throughout this country. It says more about the Leader of the Opposition than it does about anything else that he is willing to do that.


But he is not alone in his efforts to misrepresent the facts as they stand. The member for Dunkley has been making a case that there have been 18,000 regulations created to hurt small business. Not only is this number ridiculous—an outrageous exaggeration of new regulation in order to, I guess, scare people—but the fact is that they are counting a multitude of regulations that have no impact on small business at all. Indeed, nearly 40 per cent of the number quoted refer to tariff concession orders and airworthiness directives. These are the things that the member for Dunkley puts in his media statements to suggest that somehow we are further regulating small business—a complete and utter mistruth and myth that is seeking to scare small business. These are some of the other regulations that the member for Dunkley has also included in the 18,000. For example, he says that an instrument that implements the ban on big banks engaging in anticompetitive price signalling, with a clear consequent benefit for small business, is one of the regulations which are an awful thing being introduced by the government. Indeed, he also says that Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 125 amends measurement regulations so that point-of-sale systems and other measuring instruments may be patent approved for use of trade. If a system is approved once, it is approved for all potential users. This is a clear efficiency to business. However, the member is putting them in with the 18,000 regulations. This is all about the scare campaign waged by the Leader of the Opposition. He should hang his head in shame. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-06-26,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (15:45):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance because it is indeed a very important matter. The future of small business is a very important matter not only for the entire country but also particularly for regional Australia, which does not have the large employers that the city has. So many of the jobs in the regions are generated by small business.


I believe the minister is a decent man but, unfortunately, I do not believe he understands small business. I do not think he goes and talks to the people on the street, on the high street, in the shopping centres and in the factories who are making it happen. These are the people who work 100 hours a week, who have mortgaged their houses to run a small business, who employ people and who worry day and night whether their business will survive. What is the assistance they get from this government? They get a massive new tax.


Small business has been caught in a bind for some time, with increasing costs and flat and falling revenues. What is the government's answer to that? It is a massive new tax. I was stunned, in fact, when the government proposed a carbon tax that was supported by the member for Lyne and the member for New England—two members who represent regional seats, who represent areas highly dependent on small business and who should know better. The reality is, because of this government every power point has been turned into another department of the tax office. Every time a small business uses power it is effectively paying the carbon tax. It is an untruth to try to claim that only the 500 largest companies pay this tax; every small business in this country pays this tax. Every small business is being hindered in its efforts to create employment by this tax. Every small business is being made less competitive by this tax, and this government, the member for Lyne and the member for New England should hang their heads in shame.


When I go around my electorate I hear people who are very worried. They worry whether their business is going to be able to continue. They tell me they are just hanging on. They tell me they need to get rid of this government. Consumer confidence is low and business confidence is low, and what assistance do they get? They get a great big new tax.


I was talking to Russell Greenwood, a butcher in my electorate. He is hardworking—works seven days a week—employs people and pays his way, and what does he get from this government? He gets a new tax. When I visited Russell he said: 'I've been speaking to a lot of small businesses in this town and, I suppose, as far down as Wollongong and further along the eastern seaboard, and everyone feels the same way. The carbon tax is just going put more and more costs on small business and, besides that, by and large big ones as well. It will end up and turn out really hurting people, so as far as I'm concerned it's going to put people out of jobs. It's going to put a strain on businesses—as if the costs of running a small business aren't bad enough already. I think that the backbone of this country is small business, and if this carbon tax goes ahead, well, it's going to crucify and close a lot of stores which are already closing. People are finding it very hard out there in this economy, and I think it's just going to get worse and worse if this carbon tax goes ahead.' I think Russell has pretty much summarised the thoughts of many small businesspeople.


I talked to the owner of another business, who asked not to be named, and they said: 'The increase in the cost of doing business is killing us. We're reducing our opening hours. We're trying to cut costs. The introduction of the carbon tax will probably be the final straw for us. We have no choice but to lay off staff. At the moment we are looking to cut seven jobs from our business.' How is that helping Australians? We know this carbon tax will not work. We know our emissions will rise and that the pain of small business will also rise.


The government is trying to claim that only 500 companies will pay the tax, but we heard in question time today that refrigerant R404A is going to be hit by a massive carbon tax that will increase the cost of the gas from $92.88 per kilo to $377.71 per kilo. That is a massive increase. Faircloth & Reynolds, an air-conditioning business in Coffs Harbour, which is in my electorate, has six vans and employs a combination of experienced operators and apprentices. Dave Reynolds told me that it will cost an extra $4,000 to stock each van. That is an extra cost being put on this business by this government. The government says only 500 companies will pay that, but that is about as credible as the claim, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'




Mr John Cobb:
  There will be no government either.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Absolutely, the member for Calare. Small businesses are already attempting to cut costs.



Government members interjecting—




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Those on the other side might well laugh at the plight of small business, but those businesses are not looking as forward to the introduction of this tax on 1 July as those opposite are, I can tell you they are not. They do not want to be driven out of business by the government's incompetence. The thing about the Labor Party is it just does not get small business. It just does not get how hard it is to make a profit because probably none of them over there have ever made a profit. They have only ever had a union salary which comes in every fortnight, no questions asked—not like the people who are in small business who have to struggle to make it pay. They have to do a job, get paid for it and make a profit, and what do those opposite do to help? They tax them with the carbon tax. They try to tell us that it is not going to affect the cost of petrol, but who is going to believe that? Who believes that there will be no energy used in the production, distribution and retailing of petrol? Who believes that?




Mr John Cobb:
  Or the diesel used to transport it.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Or the diesel used to transport it. What we are going to see is a rise in the cost of petrol and a rise in the cost of diesel because of the carbon tax imposed by this government.


Transport industries are doing it tough. I was talking to Graeme Nicholson, from Nicholson & Page Transport in Maclean, who told me that the additional cost of the carbon tax will hit his small trucking operation hard. He said: 'It might be all right for road freight companies with the benefit of large, diversified logistics and storage operations but for smaller operators solely focused on long-haul transport the impact on their bottom line would be significant.' These operators are also facing an increase in the road user charge from this government. This government does not have a clue about the impact of this tax and the impact of increased costs on small business.


We need to encourage small business. I heard the minister talk about a range of government measures allegedly to assist small business. The best thing this government could do is not to implement this tax. The best thing this government could do is to call an election and hand over to someone who can run the economy—hand over to the opposition, because we could restore business confidence. We could restore consumer confidence, because they are concerned about your competence. One of the biggest factors in the economy at the moment is that the Australian people do not believe this government has the capacity to make the correct decisions on behalf of Australia. That is being reflected right throughout the economy.


We see people in small business doing their very best to keep their costs down. We see this government doing their very best to push costs up. On 1 July in my electorate we will see electricity prices increase by almost 20 per cent, half of which is due to this government's carbon tax. We have to encourage small business. We have to assist small business in what it does best—that is, employing people and creating wealth, particularly in the regions where small business is so important. The thing we must not do is restrict small business and retard its ability to employ people. This government has proven time and time again that it does not understand small business. If it is not more red tape, it is more taxes. If it is not more taxes, it is more bad decision making. This is just a prime example of that.


The Independents should hang their heads in shame at the fact they are supporting this government to implement this tax that is going to be so damaging in regional and rural Australia. In fact, on the weekend we are going to have a preselection in Lyne, and the people of Lyne will see a National Party candidate appointed. From this weekend on the people of Lyne will have a pretty clear choice—they will have a choice between a candidate who will pledge to repeal this tax, pledge to take the pressure off small business, and the member for Lyne who is keen to introduce this tax that is going to increase over time. This tax is going to put more and more impost on small business and is going to be jacked up to $350 a tonne, by the government's own modelling, by 2050.


The government and the Independents have no shame. They are going to crucify small business. It is about time this government handed over to the coalition to manage the economy strongly, get small business confidence up, get confidence in regional Australia up, so that small business can get on with its job of employing people.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (15:54):  I am very pleased to rise today to speak on this matter, because as everyone in this House knows, whether they admit it or not, for many months there has been a shameful scare campaign on the carbon price led by the Leader of the Opposition. We have a Leader of the Opposition who has been running around the country making false and misleading statements about the impact of the carbon price. We have a Leader of the Opposition, and many of his colleagues in the opposition as well, talking down the economy. We heard a bit more of that from the member for Cowper, undercutting business certainty, making false claims, making dishonest claims. We have heard that Whyalla is going to be a ghost town. We have heard the coal industry is going to die. We have heard that price rises will be unimaginable. These are claims that are hollow, they are false, they do a grave disservice to our nation, and they are not befitting of the leader of a major political party.


Just now the member for Cowper mentioned Wollongong. I was in Wollongong on Friday, as it happens, addressing a business forum and addressing a forum of councils. I have addressed business forums right around the country and what I have found repeatedly is that when we lay out the facts—when we actually dispel the fog of misinformation that has been created by this opposition who have no interest in telling the truth about the carbon price, have no interest in explaining what the actual modest price impacts are going to be—and the facts are put before businesspeople in this country, usually there is an acceptance and an understanding. Indeed, from many businesspeople in this country who understand that the future of this country lies in our developing a low-carbon economy there is support for the carbon price.


This Leader of the Opposition has been caught out writing to small businesses, again trying to conscript small businesses to his scare campaign. The Leader of the Opposition has been caught out writing to small businesses around the country trying to scare them about the impact of the carbon price, trying to give them the green light to jack up prices. He has written to butchers, he has written to bakers and next, no doubt, he will be writing to candlestick makers. That is because no part of this economy is safe from this opposition. Even the 1,900 jobs that regrettably will be lost from the Fairfax media organisation have been attributed by this opposition—specifically by Senator Brandis in the other place—to, wait for it, the carbon price. The loss of 1,900 jobs that, it has been said, are going from the Fairfax media organisation has been attributed to the carbon price as well, and that is the kind of nonsense that the opposition has been going on with for many months, and no doubt they will continue to go on with it for months to come.


It is not the first time that the Leader of the Opposition has tried to enlist butchers in his scare campaign. His conscription of a butcher last year was when he visited a butcher's shop in Sydney. Then the butcher told the Sydney Morning Herald—and I will use this as an example of the misinformation that we have had—that his electricity bill was around $22,000 per year and the revenue of his business was around $2.1 million per year. Some pretty simple arithmetic tells you that that means that electricity represents around one per cent of the turnover of that particular butcher's business, and the electricity cost increase from the carbon price would represent around 0.1 per cent of turnover. This is the nub of this claim: to pass on that cost increase—the primary cost increase that is the increase in electricity cost of 10per cent, because every other cost from the carbon price is far, far lower, so I am just dealing with the major cost increase of 10 per cent—the butcher would have to increase the price of an $11 packet of mince by approximately 1c . That is right: he would have to increase the price of an $11 packet of mincemeat by approximately 1c. But of course that does not stop this Leader of the Opposition running around trying to scare pensioners, scare small businesses, scare anyone in the community that he can get hold of. That is why it is to be expected, given his conduct over the last several months, that the Leader of the Opposition is encouraging small businesses to increase their prices and put signs in their windows, authorised by the member for Dunkley, blaming the carbon price. The Leader of the Opposition should know full well that if businesses make false claims they run the risk of breaching the competition law and could expose themselves to a $1.1 million fine. The member for Dunkley should be very careful holding up his misleading piece of paper.


The opposition leader does not care; the member for Dunkley does not care. They do not care about small business. They do not care about potentially exposing butchers, potentially exposing bakers, potentially exposing even candlestick makers or any other small business that they can conscript to their campaign. They do not care about potentially exposing them to large fines if they act as suggested in the Leader of the Opposition's letter. All the Leader of the Opposition wants to do and the member for Dunkley wants to do is use small business as a political pawn, to co-opt small businesses into playing a role in the misinformation campaign that the opposition is determined to conduct.


The fact is that small business will not even pay the carbon price. A range of large polluters is going to be paying the carbon price and the list of those polluters was finalised on 15 June. There may yet be some other businesses that, by the development of their business, become liable to pay the carbon price but the list as it stands is around 294 entities, firms and councils. For small business, which will not be paying the carbon price, the government has put in place a large range of measures to support small businesses and to help them grow and prosper.


There may be some increases to electricity prices. We have never hidden that but they will be modest. I say 'may' because it depends on the use that is made by businesses of electricity, the choices that they make.



Mr Billson interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  We are talking about small business. The member for Dunkley seems to have forgotten that. If businesses invest in energy efficiency and reduce their energy costs then they could be better off overall with lower energy bills because they choose to invest in energy efficiency. Businesses around the country are increasingly understanding that an investment in energy efficiency will save money in the long term—again, not something the member for Dunkley wishes to understand.


Of course there is concern about electricity costs in the community. That concern arises from the fact that we have had very steep rises in electricity costs over the last few years. But we have, regrettably, a Leader of the Opposition and colleagues with him in the opposition, including the member for Dunkley, who wish to hysterically attribute all manner of ills to the carbon price, a carbon price that has not even started yet.


I want to put the electricity price impact of the carbon price in context. There will be inserts in bills in most states that will explain this to consumers and might, in fact, dispel some of the nonsense we have had from the opposition. According to Treasury analysis, of every $100 that is to be spent on household electricity bills in the next financial year 2012-13, $51 will pay for the poles, wires and transmission towers; $20 will pay for the wholesale cost of generating electricity; $20 will go to retail costs, consumer service and programs for energy efficiency and renewables; and $9 will go to the carbon price. That is why it is so important to put in context what these price rises mean and that is why it is so important that the debate in this place should be based on actual facts.


We have had from the Leader of the Opposition and those with him nothing but misinformation about the impact on small business, nothing but misinformation about the impact on the economy generally. In five days we will have a carbon price in this country and we will be well on the way to a measured, carefully crafted transition to a low-carbon economy. It is a policy that will help the Australian economy adapt to change and to grow while leaving a cleaner and more prosperous future for our children and for their children. It is a policy that we on this side of the House are very proud of. It will be looked back on as a watershed in Australian economic history when we set this country on the path to the low-carbon economy that our people deserve. It is a plan which is central to Australia's economic competitiveness. In decades to come, low-pollution technologies will be crucial. (Time expired)

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:05):  I rise to speak on this most important matter of public importance. I find it incredibly ironic that Labor's Minister for Small Business is also the Minister for Homelessness. That says it all for me as to where their heads are at when it comes to this. The best thing is that when you lose the lot, when they force you out with this carbon tax, when they force you out that with all the regulations, you only have to keep the one phone number. You will only have to ring the one minister. He will still look after you all the way through.


The minister stood there and said to us it is only going to affect small business in a negligible way. Look out the window, mate. He says we are in good economic condition. Can you look out the window and see that small business is hurting. Can you walk through the shopping centres and see the shops that are closed. Can you walk through the industrial estates and see the sheds that are shut, the fences that are locked, the 'for lease' signs up in those places. You will see that there are sections of our economy, sections of my community, sections of this country which are doing it very tough.


The minister stood there and said that the cash rate is incredibly low. He said it is lower than in the Howard years. Who is paying the cash rate? I looked up my mortgage this morning. My mortgage rate is nowhere near the cash rate. I spoke to five small businesses in relation to their overdrafts and their loans. Not one of them was paying the cash rate, not one. The interest rates on all their loans were lower in the Howard years for their business loans than they are now. The banks are not even lending to small businesses at the moment. It is high risk lending.


I have a good friend who made his pile when Pardon won the cup. He started his business soon after I came to Townsville. He was a boilermaker by trade but he started a transport business. He has since retired. He said to me the other day: 'You know, the way this government is at the moment, I couldn't do what I did again. There's no way in the world that I could start a business, make it run—especially in transport with trucks and cranes. I couldn't make it run. I couldn't get a small business up today, because nobody would lend me the money to start off with. It's too dear. It's too hard. There's too many forms all the way through.'


The parliamentary secretary stood there and said the Leader of the Opposition goes to butcher shops. I was at my butcher's on Friday. He has been told by his power supplier of a 22 per cent power rise. It used to be $80 to fix a refrigerator that was broken and needed to be re-gassed. It is now up to nearly $300 because of the carbon tax on refrigeration. The parliamentary secretary stands there and says it is not going to hurt—that it is not going to hurt because it does not matter; it is a negligible effect because you will not pay it. What is the point of the carbon tax if it is not to drive up electricity prices, if it is not to make other forms of energy more competitive? It has to hurt; otherwise, why would you change? Otherwise, why is this government throwing money at people all over the place? The parliamentary secretary stood there and said that small business will not even pay it. He did it with a straight face, which I thought was admirable!


He said the big polluters pay it. Of course the big polluters are charged, but they pass it on. All business charges it on to the end user. Remember those people you are throwing the money out the window at? They are the ones who will pay it. They are the ones who will go into the ice-creamery at Hervey Bay and ask for a half scoop of ice-cream. A half scoop of ice-cream at Hervey Bay! Who has ever heard of it?


Every business in my electorate pays rates and has the rubbish collected in Townsville. My council, the Townsville City Council, have been named as one of those councils that will be exposed to the carbon tax. I am writing to the council to ask them to write to both state and federal governments about their liability. The state government forced the twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa to amalgamate. I want to find out whether, if they were still separate councils, they would be liable for the carbon tax. If so, what compensation can they expect from both levels of government; if not, why not? The Townsville City Council have used Treasury's modelling alone, which says there will be $3.5 million to $5 million a year on the dump alone, and that is before the council turn on a light, start a car, start a truck, fill a hole in a road, start a bus, turn on a streetlight, mow a lawn or turn a sprinkler on along the Strand. It is before any of that, and that is all subject to electricity and all going to cost. Every bit of it will attract the carbon tax and every bit of it will have to be paid for. The Townsville City Council are receiving no compensation, so what will the council have to do? They will have to either withdraw services or increase rates, but the council with their new mayor, Jenny Hill, have said that they want a freeze on residential rates. Does that promise extend to the commercial rates paid by small business in Townsville? I think not.


Council charges are just one area where small businesses will cop it in this toxic carbon tax. Everywhere the small business men turn they will be faced with the increased charges and costs due to the carbon tax. Michael Burge owns a grocery store in Townsville. He is quoted in the Townsville Bulletin as saying:


'It's concerning from a business perspective because we know this decision will carry added costs for us that we will have to pass on to the consumer.'


'It's not just a blanket tax on store owners, it will be felt through all levels of business.'


'All our suppliers have a power bill and will be forced to pass on any input costs associated with the carbon tax on to us as well.'


Christina Hughes was quoted as saying:


'The Government pretends they're going to change the environment with this tax. It's not going to do anything but throw out the future of young families.'


I want to tell you a story of Michael, a young man who started his own business in Townsville as a refrigeration mechanic just 12 months ago. The cost of the carbon tax on HC gases raises re-gassing costs from $80 to $250. He has been building a business for the last 12 months, but he knows those customers he has held will be shocked. They will have to check on prices. There will be people out there who will do stuff for nothing. He says that, due to the raised costs, he will invariably be faced with delays in payment and a rise in bad debts, and these affect his cash flow. He has just bought his first house and his wife is pregnant with their first baby. What does he do? What does he say? He said to me, 'I'll see if I can hold on till we can get rid of this lot.' All he is hoping for is that he can get rid of this government.


Mark Bogiatsis is a third-generation drycleaner in Townsville. G N Dry Cleaners have spent over $5 million in becoming more efficient with water, electricity and chemicals. He has specifically invested $900,000 on lowering his emissions and reducing his carbon footprint. But, hey—he gets $6½ thousand back! He knows that he is expecting a $24,000 rise in power alone this year. His accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, still cannot tell him what his exposure to the carbon tax is, and it is only five days away. He does not know. Apart from power he does not know the cost of chemicals, the cost of transport, the cost of uniforms, the cost of all this stuff that goes into his small business. PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the biggest accountancy firms in the world, cannot tell him what his exposure to this carbon tax is.


He employs hard workers, often immigrants and first-generation Australians. He knows he will have to cover costs, but he also knows that others in the industry will undercut him to stay in business. There have already been cases. 'If you start a downward spiral, it will be hard to stop it,' he says. 'My father said they have survived fire, famine, flood and Labor governments; but, mate, this is such a bad tax and will not do anything for anyone.'


I want to tell you about a steel fabricator in Townsville. They have been told that their suppliers of steel and gas will raise costs by at least 10 per cent. They spend $80,000 on electricity and are expecting a rise of at least 20 per cent, or $16,000. They have an annual turnover in excess of $20 million. They are expecting an overall hit to their bottom line of $2 million at 10 per cent—and that, my friends, is ridiculous.


There is a painter down the road with 160 tonnes of Vietnamese steel in his yard meant to build Queensland cyclone shelters. He missed a job on price. He said to me: 'If we miss it on price now, how much more competitive are we going to be when the carbon tax comes in? How much more competitive can we possibly be?' I said to him: 'Don't come to me with problems; come to me with solutions. If you could do anything to your business, what would you do to it?' He said, 'You want to know for real?' I said yes. He said: 'I'd change my name to Holden. That way—if I changed my name to Holden, Ford, Toyota, OneSteel, BlueScope or Alcoa—I would get compensation, but I am a small business in Townsville and I get nothing.'


The AWU and the marginal seats of Labor get all the compensation. You have Wayne Hanson of the AWU, not Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, who said that Whyalla would be wiped off the map. And hey presto—hundreds of millions of dollars for the steel industry went straight in there. Fantastic! Paul Howes said 'Not one job will be lost because of the carbon tax.' Hey presto—$300 million went straight to the Illawarra. It was money for Alcoa in a Labor marginal seat. How much for small business in Townsville? Absolutely nothing.


To have a government sit there and tell us we are tilting at windmills and everything is just ridiculous. This government know what they are doing here. This is not about saving the planet; this is about saving their own political hide—and they should be condemned for it.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:15):  Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I am just a bit speechless after listening to the member for Herbert on the Armageddon that will prevail as a result of the carbon price. What nonsense! If they were not competitive now, then they are never going to be competitive. What nonsense! We have seen those opposite run scare campaigns in recent weeks on regional Australia. We have seen those opposite run scare campaigns, as we heard today from the member for Herbert, on Fairfax. They have avoided scare campaigns on pannacotta, but I think that is probably next week's job. We have seen today those opposite run scare campaigns on homeless cats and dogs. So, it was only a matter of time before we saw them running a scare campaign on small business.


This government is committed to helping small business be part of a move to a clean energy future and part of a clean energy future for Australia. I want to set some facts straights because the amount of nonsense that has been floating around this afternoon in this chamber is breathtaking and it makes me speechless. The carbon price mechanism is not a tax on households and small businesses. Fact—small businesses do not pay a carbon price. Fact—small businesses do not have to fill in a single form as part of the carbon price reform. The member for Herbert, I think you were in small business before you came into this chamber, as were a number of your colleagues.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The member for Canberra will keep her remarks through the chair.




Ms BRODTMANN:
  Mr Deputy Speaker. Those opposite will recall the amount of form-filling any small business had to do in 2000 when the GST came in which made us realise that, basically, the GST was extraordinary. Every month we had to fill out a form about how much we had made and then pay tax to the ATO. There are no forms for small business attached to this carbon price.


Fact—the carbon price is paid by fewer than 500 of our largest emitters for each tonne of pollution they produce. Some of these emitters, as we have always acknowledged, will pass on their costs. The Treasury modelling shows that the average price impact across the economy is only 0.7 per cent. It is true that small businesses will largely experience this price impact through higher energy costs. There are three important issues in relation to this. The cost increases for small businesses are modest, these costs can be passed through to consumers, and the government will provide support to small businesses—and I will outline those later in my speech.


Data provided to the government by the Council of Small Business Australia—and I saw Peter Strong this morning at a business breakfast-lunch—shows that the electricity cost of a typical small retail business makes up less than two per cent of total costs. On the basis of the Treasury modelling the cost increase of the carbon price will therefore be only 0.2 per cent of overall expenditure of the typical small business, not the Armageddon predicted by the member for Herbert. In addition, New South Wales electricity distributors have provided data to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal that the typical small business uses around 10 megawatts of electricity each year. When we apply the Treasury modelling electricity price impact to the IPART usage data, we find that carbon price would increase the typical small business power bill by around $5 per week. That is hardly the Armageddon that the member for Herbert is predicting. That works out to be about $20 a month and about $240 a year.


This modest cost increase can be passed through to consumers. That is why the government are providing assistance to households in the form of tax cuts, and increases to the pension, to family tax benefits and other payments. It is because costs are passed through the consumers. Nine out of 10 households, as we have said many, many times, will receive some assistance. We are also protecting consumers and small businesses by investing in an ACCC hotline so that if they are being overcharged they can get in touch with the ACCC hotline and report it.


The government are strongly committed to assistance and support to small business. We have introduced an increase in the small business instant asset write-off to $6,500. This provides an immediate income tax deduction for small businesses for the cost of depreciating assets. There is no limit to the number of items that can be written off in a financial year. To compare what will happen under this instant asset write-off process, if you buy a new $3,000 computer for business use after 1 July 2012, you will be able to write off its entire cost at tax time. Under the old arrangements you would only be able to write off $450 in the first year. Together these new tax breaks for small businesses are worth more than $3.7 billion over the next four years. That is significant savings for small business and significant cash in small business bank accounts as a result of this asset write-off. In addition, we have introduced a range of other small measures. This asset write-off is a particularly valuable policy initiative because it can help in many ways, as I said with the computer purchase, but also it gives an impetus for small businesses to invest in energy efficiency that can reduce electricity bills.


The whole community would be better served by the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite, including the member for Herbert, by telling the truth for a change. Come Sunday morning, rest assured, I will be able to go down to my local newsagent and buy my obligatory rocky road and the newsagent will still be open. I will be able to go to my local IGA, my local milk bar, and buy my milk and the shop will still be open. There will not be an Armageddon, a locked up and barren streetscape. The shops will be open, they will be vibrant and they will be operating. The world will not come to an end.


I just want to talk about some of the experiences that I have when I wander around and talk to small businesses in the community. I do not get the Armageddon that is painted by the member for Herbert—quite the contrary, actually. Recently I did a business walkaround. I do them regularly, once a week when we are not sitting. I went into the butcher in Garran. His business is going very, very well and the issues he raised with me were local government issues. He was very grateful for a development that was taking place down the road. I know that some residents in the area have problems with that development, but he was grateful because it was bringing more people into his business. I also went to the baker in the Garran shops. They have their own set of challenges in terms of competing with supermarkets, but they are challenges that they were facing. Unfortunately, there were not any candlestick makers at the Garran shops, but I will keep my eyes open and next time I will go and try to hunt down a candlestick maker in Canberra and have a chat with them.


In Canberra we have nearly 15,000 small businesses in my electorate alone. Recently I also went to the Torrens shops. At the Torrens shops the issues that were raised with me were lighting and the facilities around the shops. Every business there suggested that business was steady—again, not the Armageddon painted by the member for Herbert.


This morning, as I mentioned before, I saw Peter Strong from COSBOA and I chatted with a number of small business leaders here in Canberra. The issues that they raised with me were government procurement and the difficulty of small businesses actually getting access to government procurement. There was not one conversation, not one mention of the carbon price.


There is a lot more that Labor is doing in supporting small business. We can mention the instant asset write-off of $6½ thousand. We have also extended the Small Business Advisory Services, established a Small Business Commissioner, and established the Superannuation Clearing House. We have standardised business registrations, saving businesses $1,000. Labor has introduced a number of measures to help, support and provide assistance to small business. Come 1 July, there will not be the Armageddon that the member for Herbert predicts. I can assure the member for Herbert of that.


What small businesses in Canberra do have to worry about is a repeat of the experiences of 1996. Remember 1996 here in Canberra when 15,000 Public Service jobs were lost? Those opposite are predicting between 12,000 and 20,000 Public Service job losses, although the number keeps going up. If you want to see an adverse impact on small business in Canberra, that is what you get. (Time expired)

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (16:25):  I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this issue which is certainly a matter of public importance. This is a discussion on both the impact of the carbon tax on small business and also on the approach that this government takes towards economic policy. In August 1986 President Ronald Reagan was quoted as saying to a White House Conference on Small Business:


Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.


This has great currency with our own government today, who will in six days time have imposed the world's largest and most far-reaching carbon tax.


Small business is struggling. Last year the Australian Bureau of Statistics released some data on the health of the small business sector across the country. The research found that 31,528 small business operators across the nation shut their doors between the 2007 and 2010 elections. The average number of closures per electorate was 210. Coming in at more than double this was my electorate of Bennelong, with 453. This equates to 3.2 businesses closing their doors each and every week, or nearly one every two days, costing our local community up to 1,800 jobs under three years of Rudd and Gillard. Forty-five per cent of these businesses were in the retail sector, 22 per cent in wholesale, and 15 per cent in manufacturing. To top it off, this survey period concluded just about the time that our Prime Minister looked down the camera lens and made her solid affirmation to the Australian people: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'


Yet with the gap in our two-speed economy becoming ever greater, there is still some slight movement from those small businesses left gasping for air. I can just hear the shouts from the ministerial corridors, 'The body still moves. Better slap another tax on it!' The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Index of Expected Economic Performance recently reported eight consecutive quarters of decline until finally detecting a slight increase last month. ACCI Director, Greg Evans, commented:


The Survey clearly shows that trading conditions remain challenging for Australian businesses in non-mining related sectors, with small businesses reporting the worst performance.


Small business can expect further headwinds in coming months following the escalating economic and political turmoil in Europe, the possibility of a slowdown in China and the damaging economic impact of the carbon tax.


All we are left to ask is: could there be any worse time for the introduction of a carbon tax?


Small business will be hit the worst because they must pay for the tax at every single step in their production cycle. The fish-and-chip shop owner will pay the carbon tax from the minute the trawler fills up its diesel tanks to go out to sea, through the machinery that processes and cleans the fish, the refrigeration costs that are set to skyrocket, right through to the delivery to the shop and the lights that need to flash outside the front door to attract passers-by. The butcher, the baker and the local fruit and veg store will all be whacked with higher charges that compound throughout the cycle from paddock to plate. The retailers that struggle so much against cheap online sales that are not subject to the GST or the carbon tax, will now have to struggle even further.


Small businesses operate on very slim margins in a highly competitive environment and do not have the same ability to pass higher charges on to their customers. Local businesses in my Bennelong electorate have told me of discussions with their accountants to calculate the extra costs they will be forced to pay. Lyn Bridle, Director of the Epping Floral Centre, said to me:


We are very worried about the costs of the carbon tax—both on our fridges that use a lot of power to keep flowers fresh and also on the extra charges that growers will pass onto us. We fear that the customer will not accept a price hike and therefore we will be forced to absorb these extra costs. This will make it even harder to maintain a profitable local business in the current economic climate.


Discretionary retail sales have already slowed. The introduction of a carbon tax will increase our costs which will further hamper our ability to create employment opportunities.


The Labor Party tries to portray itself as the party that protects jobs. It astounds me that they have not yet learnt that creating business conditions that act like a python squeeze on small business will deny them the opportunity to create jobs in the first place. Last time I checked it is pretty hard to protect something that does not exist.


There is no compensation to small business to try to defray these new cost burdens. Of course, this government did promise them a one per cent tax cut but now even that has been taken away. The government has been very keen to promote that compensation is being paid to households. The Oxford Dictionary defines compensation as:


something, typically money, awarded to someone in recognition of loss, suffering, or injury …


So the government's own policies and their own marketing recognise that they are causing loss, suffering or injury to the people they are elected to represent and protect. Of course, this is done under the guise of an environmental initiative, yet the government's own modelling shows that Australian carbon emissions will continue to go the same way as the carbon tax—up and up and up. Yet if insult and injury is not enough, the government policy still expects to see the occasional breath in the small business body. As President Reagan predicted, they yell out with fervour, 'Quick, regulate it!'


New figures have confirmed that Bennelong businesses and community organisations are dealing more with red tape than ever before. Since the start of 2008, this Labor government has added over 18,000 new regulations. That equates to 11 new regulations every day for 4½ years. We all remember the government's 2007 election promise of 'one in, one out', meaning that any new regulation would be offset by the repeal of another. Instead only 86 regulations have been repealed. That is one for every 210 new regulations introduced. Red tape chokes the life out of local businesses and community groups. The Productivity Commission has estimated that the rewards for Australia to cut red tape would be worth up to $12 billion a year. We can only hope that these kinds of savings can one day be brought about by a future government lest this government needs to start subsidising it.


We, on this side of the House, stand united in our support of small businesses and in support of creating the strongest possible operating environment for businesses to be profitable, to grow, to employ new staff, to create wealth in the community and, finally, to allow people to be able to afford to do something to help our environment. These results will come from positive proactive policies. In my own electorate I have launched the Bennelong Village Businesses campaign. This campaign is designed to support local businesses and to promote the great benefits of advice, service and quality dispensed by local business owners passionate and knowledgeable about their wares. The campaign aims to develop collaboration to establish our villages as a vital and valuable component of our local communities and to increase foot traffic to the villages. We champion small business in the face of this government that taxes where there is life, regulates if life may still exist and then subsidises when business dies.


The unfairness to small businesses is that there is no compensation for the damage done through this tax and overregulation while life exists. When they close their doors for the last time, there will be nothing left to subsidise. Compensation is paid in a legal context when a damages claim is determined through an action that is judged to have intentionally caused damage, the quantum of which can be reliably demonstrated. The term in the budget papers this year to describe the damages claim that will come from the live cattle export industry was referred to as an 'unquantifiable liability'. This government is an unquantifiable liability for small business through this most comprehensive tax that will impact every one of us. This government is an unquantifiable liability for all Australians.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (16:34):  What a strange political environment we find ourselves in. We all, for example, agree that we need to do something about paid parental leave in this country. We all agree that we need to do something about managing the resources boom so we slow down the fast lane and speed up the slow lane. We all agree that we need to do something about the tragedy that we see unfolding before us with respect to boat people. We all agree that we need to do something about climate change. I really want to underscore that last point because everyone knows that Tony Abbott is committed to the same greenhouse gas reductions as we are on this side.


The strange thing is that we cannot agree on how we do all of these things. Of course, I could have cited many more examples. We cannot agree on paid parental leave. We cannot agree on the resources boom. We cannot agree, sadly, on refugees and we certainly cannot agree on climate change. But it is even worse than that because, in my view, the Leader of the Opposition does not want to agree. He identifies a problem, he says he is on board to fix it but, by virtue of his opportunism, he does not want to fix it. He does not want it to go away. Every time there is a boat and every time there is an opportunity to blame an industry downturn, for example, on carbon, he takes that opportunity. He sees opportunism in the plight of others and that is a real tragedy.


Take the aluminium industry, an industry in Australia being dramatically adversely affected by two things in particular: the high value of the Australian dollar and a plummeting of aluminium prices on world markets. I think the price has plummeted by 60 per cent since 2008. You do not have to be a genius to work out, when you add the appreciation of the dollar, that it is a pretty hefty blow on the aluminium industry. To make it worse, when the aluminium industry is affected by these things he seeks to capitalise on the demise of the industry and, of course, the job losses. And there was no greater example than with Norsk Hydro's plant at Kurri Kurri in my electorate. The bad news for the Leader of the Opposition is that my electorate understand that Norsk Hydro has been struggling for a long, long time and losing money for a long, long time—and we have not had a carbon price, if the opposition have not noticed. Hydro would be closing whether we were having a carbon price or we were not having a carbon price. This is the crime of the Leader of the Opposition: he wants to mislead and then capitalise. He is doing it again this week with Alcoa. 


Alcoa have indicated to the government that with some assistance they might survive the onslaught of the Australian dollar and low aluminium prices. What is making the Alcoa deal critical is the willingness of the Victorian government to talk turkey on electricity contract prices. We can help Alcoa, having been asked, if the Victorian government joins with us on power prices. Hydro is a completely different situation. Both the Minister for Industry and Innovation, who is also Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, and I have been to Hydro management on a number of occasions and, very early in the piece, we said, 'What can we do as a government to help?' In my case I said, 'Do you want me to take your plight to ministers to see what assistance might be available—co-investment, for example?' I was very quickly and plainly told: 'Thank you very much'—they are very courteous people, the Norwegians—'you could throw hundreds of millions of dollars at us tomorrow, it's not going to change our business model. It's not going to suddenly reduce the value of the Australian dollar. It's not going to suddenly increase global aluminium prices.'


They said, and these are my words, not theirs: 'You're not going to make our plant bigger and therefore give it bigger scale'—as we know, around the world there are huge plants opening and economies of scale are important—'and you're not going to overnight modernise our plant. We've been here a long time, it's relatively old technology, even though the company has invested significantly in recent years to try to remain competitive.' I repeat, those last sentences were my words, not theirs, but they made it very clear both to the industry minister and to me that there was nothing we could do to help. Yet the opposition leader comes in here this week and rails against the government for having the audacity to help Alcoa but not help Norsk Hydro. I am sure, because they are a courteous lot, that Hydro will not be coming out and criticising the opposition leader—but, gee, I bet they feel like it.


People like the member for Paterson have been running around the Hunter saying it is all about politics and the marginality of seats. My political margin in Hunter is 12½ per cent or thereabouts. The Alcoa plant is located in the electorate of Corio, the electorate of the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Richard Marles. The last time I checked, his margin was 13 per cent. How dare the opposition leader and his follower suggest that this is a political decision, that we would determine the fate of hundreds of people and an industry in our country based on the marginality of seats. It would be offensive if I was on 12 and Richard Marles was on two, but it is even more offensive when it is not even factually correct in terms of our political margins. How dare they! The opposition leader, who has been making a fool of himself running around the country with his scare campaign, would be much better served by, for example, getting behind our jobs market on 18 July in the Hunter, where we will match employers with prospective employees, most of whom will be coming from the now mothballed Hydro plant. They are the sorts of positive things the opposition leader could be doing, rather than carping on and on about the carbon price and, in doing so, talking the economy down, not up.


We have an unemployment rate in the Hunter of about 3.9 per cent. HunterNet, the networking organisation that represents manufacturers, has informed us that right now there are about 1,000 manufacturing jobs in the Hunter waiting to be filled. We have a more diverse economy than ever before, a very low unemployment rate and huge investment prospects, with money flowing into the mining industry in particular, so we are well placed to absorb those jobs. It is very disappointing that Norsk Hydro found it necessary to take this decision; indeed, it is disappointing that in their view there was nothing the government could do to assist, but we certainly offered. As a community we will get on with it. I will be talking up my local economy and the prospects for those who have lost their jobs, not talking it down, like the member for Paterson is inclined to do, following the lead of his parliamentary leader, of course. I will be out there helping people make a transition into another job, not doing what the member for Paterson in particular is trying to do: to scare them into believing that their working life is over, as an opportunity to blame the current Labor government.


I should say something about the specifics of this matter of public importance. I have said in this place many times before that there are three important things a government should do as a priority for small business. The first is to grow the economy, which we are doing, unlike the rest of the modern world. The second is to keep the price of money or interest rates low, and we are doing that better than anyone else in the world. The third thing is to get out of the way. Red tape is the biggest fear for small business and this government is working hard to keep small business red tape to a minimum.


I have been here 16 years and I remember doing something—not unlike those on the other side are doing—with respect to the GST, saying it was going to 'kill' this person and 'kill' that person. I have matured and learnt from my mistakes. We all know now that a consumption tax in this country was necessary, but that does not mean that at the time I did not have some real fears about how the GST would impact on small business. And guess what? Small business still tell me on a daily basis that the GST is killing them because they remain unpaid tax collectors. They will remain unpaid tax collectors, and they are making a fantastic contribution to the Australian economy in doing so. But let us not kid ourselves that, as necessary as a consumption tax was in this country, there is not some pain for small business.


With respect to the carbon price, we are putting in place offsets, of course—in particular, tax breaks for the small business community. Hypocrisy is alive and well on the other side of the House. (Time expired)

 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:24):  I move:


That the amendments be agreed to.


The government supports the amendments that were moved by both the opposition and the Australian Greens. The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee report on the National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 commented that a waiting period before former politicians and senior staffers become eligible for public appointment would be appropriate. A waiting period would be consistent with other Australian government policies such as the Lobbying Code of Conduct, which provides that former ministers and parliamentary secretaries may not engage in lobbying activities relating to any matter with which they had official dealings within 18 months of leaving office and a 12-month waiting period for former political staff agency heads, senior public servants and others.


The Australian Greens have advised that their proposed amendment works in conjunction with the opposition's amendment. This amendment strengthens the statement of reasons that must be tabled in parliament by the executive if any person, other than a former politician or senior staff member, is recommended for appointment by the Prime Minister or a minister, as the case requires. This is consistent with the government's commitment to strengthen the independence and integrity of the ABC and SBS boards and to facilitate greater transparency and parliamentary scrutiny of the selection and appointment of candidates to the boards.

Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (21:30):  I rise this evening to talk about an area of government policy that is causing great distress and anxiety to the people of my electorate and that is the world's biggest carbon tax. I received an email this Monday from a constituent, Barry, living in Benalla in north-east Victoria. Barry wrote to me and said:


I am an early retiree. After working all my life in a stressful occupation I retired at 56. I am totally dependent on my superannuation of approximately $36,000 for my wife and myself. I'm not old enough yet to get the Commonwealth seniors card—


which is 65 years—


consequently I am in a tax-free position. I have not structured my stories to enable me to get the dole or any other such benefit. I received not one cent of stimulus money a few years ago and now we are to miss out on any carbon tax compensation. It seems unfair that we have to be in the two per cent of families earning up to $150,000 that won't get any assistance. (Swan claims 98 per cent will get it.) Is there some method that I'm not aware of that will enable us to get the compensation? I have paid my share of taxes for over 40 years that I was working full-time.


Well, unfortunately for Barry, this ill-conceived, cobbled-together desperate price that the Prime Minister paid to the Greens in order to retain her job—all she had to do was throw them a few carrots after all—gave us the world's biggest carbon tax. Now we have constituents in my electorate like Barry. He is 62, so he does not get the seniors card for another three years and, because he does not have a seniors card, he is not entitled to get government assistance under the carbon tax. Because Barry only makes $36,000 a year to support himself and his wife, he does not get taxed and therefore will not be supported for tax cuts. So, Barry, in my electorate, in Benalla, will be paying higher energy bills, higher grocery bills and higher council rates. Yet those on the other side refuse to acknowledge that when times are tough, when the cost of living is going up, there will be people who cannot afford it and who will suffer even more because of this government's poor judgment and this Prime Minister's poor judgment and vanity. Not only will people like Barry be affected but also jobs in my electorate will be affected.


We have seen statistics that have come out recently from the ABS which show that, since the carbon tax was mooted, we have lost one manufacturing job every 15 minutes. I see good businesses in my electorate that have gone to great effort to remain competitive, to restructure, and are going to be hit with the carbon tax. A leading business, D&R Henderson in Benalla, is an absolute pillar of the Benalla community and an important employer of 200 staff manufacturing particle board and operating a sawmill. This is what the company has had to say:


All the financial benefit we gained from our restructure is going to be taken away from us by the impact of the carbon tax. It's going to cost us millions of dollars. When the tax kicks in in July everyone knows the cost of living will go up and the cost of deliveries will go up. Business has never seen it worse than it is now. We are competing with businesses in Asia that don't have a carbon tax. The way the government is behaving is like a soap opera. It makes us think: why bother when they, the government, just want to clobber us over the head.


Well, that question is being asked by businesses right across the country. I have an abattoir in my electorate and they have said: 'The business runs on tight margins, margins that cannot afford to have to pay an extra one or two million a year.' The abattoir, Norvic, is in Wodonga and they are exporters and employers of locals and they will be hit. Does the government care? Absolutely not.



We have seen other businesses, wineries, saying that they are going to stop growing grapes because the carbon tax is the last straw. What more does this government need— (Time expired)

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (16:00):  Anyone who has picked up a copy of the Gold Coast Bulletin this week would have seen a number of articles relating to an excellent proposal to create a dive wreck site or artificial reef off the city by way of two decommissioned naval ships. As I am extremely passionate about boosting tourism on the southern Gold Coast, I think that this proposal is a great opportunity to create a unique international tourism destination for the region and demonstrate, once and for all, that the Gold Coast is more than the northern glitter strip, with its glitterati, its larger-than-life theme parks and its seemingly endless nightclubs. It is truly time to stop obsessing over high-rises and bronzed bikini babes and take a whole-of-Gold-Coast approach to tourism and to promoting our city.


Businesses on the southern Gold Coast are fed up with Surfers Paradise being treated like the jewel in the crown. The owner of Coolangatta based Snorkel Safari Gold Coast, Mr Tony Hunt, has said that he feels like the southern Gold Coast is at times treated like a separate state to Queensland. Mr Hunt, who also runs a whale-watching operation, has been advocating for a dive site near Kirra for the past five years, so this is not a new concept to the city.


The southern Gold Coast has the right ingredients for a successful diving operation. We have Coolangatta airport, where visitors can arrive safely with their diving gear, and we have surrounding headlands that offer great vantage points for watching divers. We also have the right ocean currents, temperature and conditions for diving. We have experienced dive operators that can take the stress out of diving. What is needed for us is the 'wow' factor, and that 'wow' factor comes from a wreck's hull looming in the distance. All of that is within our reach now and we really must be focused on doing whatever we can to make this a reality, so I call on all levels of government—federal government, state government and local government—as well as our local tourism bodies and our local tour operators to work together to make this happen in the best interests of the Gold Coast.


There is no denying that the Gold Coast is a popular tourist destination. A recent report by Tourism Research Australia labelled the Gold Coast one of the largest tourism regions in Australia by tourism expenditure. In the year to March 2012, TRA calculated that the Gold Coast attracted 3.3 million domestic overnight visitors, who spent a total of $2.5 billion.


I am certainly committed to revitalising the southern end of the Gold Coast. We have all the ingredients there; we have a strong base. It is not and should not be the forgotten part of the Gold Coast. We need to all work together and bring all of the tourism operators and all of the stakeholders together so that we can have a whole-of-Gold-Coast approach to tourism. That is what is missing. The dive wreck is certainly a key to securing the tourism future of the southern Gold Coast.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (16:30):  In this, the third report by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network on the rollout of the National Broadband Network, there are some very important criticisms made of the NBN Co. by the whole committee, not simply by the coalition members, which go to the whole function of the committee and indeed the accountability of the NBN Co. for this massive public investment. The recommendations complain about the failure of the NBN to respond to questions, whether it is questions on notice or questions in committee hearings.


Recommendation 2, for example, calls on the government to include meaningful, consistent KPIs and statistics, such as homes passed, homes connected and services in operation. These are meaningful terms that people can understand, as opposed to the rather bizarre concept that the NBN Co. has invented—I have never seen it anywhere else in the world of telecommunications—where it boasts not of the number of households that have been passed but of the number of households that are contained within areas in which construction has commenced, as though that has any relevance. The fact that you are living in a house which is part of an area of 20,000 households and that the NBN has put a shovel in the ground somewhere in that area does not bring you better broadband services. It does not do anything for you, in fact. It is obviously just a device to get over what has been an extraordinary failure in delivery.


I think it is important to run through some of the NBN's scorecard as at June this year. Let us take the most important metrics. In their corporate plan, the NBN estimated that by 30 June 2012—in other words, by the end of this month—there would be 145,000 households passed with the fibre optic cable. As of May, 18,200 premises were passed; so not even 15 per cent has been achieved.


They also estimated in their corporate plan, which was published just at the end of 2010, that by the end of this month 172,000 households would be passed in greenfields areas—that is, in new housing developments, as opposed to the brownfields areas, which of course are built-up areas. They said, 'We'll have passed 172,000 households in greenfields areas by the end of June 2012.' By the end of December 2011, which is the latest number we have, they had passed a massive 951 households. That is an extraordinary failure, barely five per cent of what they had forecast.


They forecast that by the end of this month there would be 1,000 households with active connections to the fixed wireless service. This is the service that will go into the four per cent of the country which will not be getting the fibre-to-the-premises service or the satellite service. They said, 'One thousand will be connected by fixed wireless as at the end of June.' As at the end of May, they had active connections to 52 households. There is a bit of a pattern here—it is another five per cent achievement. The total number of active connections that they forecast, therefore, by 30 June 2012 was 151,000 active connections, and as of May the active connections are in fact 11,000. Of those 11,000, 7,300 are on the interim satellite service. So in terms of the whole purpose, the whole thrust and the object of the NBN Co., which is the fibre-to-the-premises rollout, supported by the fixed wireless roll-out, it is a colossal failure. When you move out to 30 June 2013, they had estimated in their corporate plan that there would be 805,000 households to be passed in the brownfields areas, and it now appears from their latest publication that there will be only 236,000 households passed.


This is a colossal failure, and the government really provides very little in the way of explanation other than to say that it took some time to finalise the negotiations with Telstra. What they overlook is that the negotiations with Telstra included, from the very outset, an arrangement that the NBN Co.—before all the precedent conditions were satisfied—could have access to Telstra's infrastructure, and they have had access to that for just under a year. So, as an excuse, the Telstra contractual negotiations are very, very thin.


In the industry, there is general amazement at the slowness of the NBN Co.'s rollout. There is general amazement and disappointment at what appears to be much less than competent management on the part of the NBN Co. But I may say that it goes further than that. While you can attribute much of this delay to poor management on the part of the NBN Co—and that is certainly what people in the industry and in the civil engineering world are saying—there is also this problem: the universal experience around the world has been that building fibre-to-the-premises networks is inordinately slow and expensive. Even in Singapore, where they are building a fibre-to-the-premises network—or seeking to do so—it has taken much longer, cost a lot more and resulted in some pretty acrimonious litigation between the various parties in that tiny country, with all of the advantages of density that it offers in terms of a rollout of this kind.


If you want to compare a statistic or a metric between Australia and the United States, Telstra's experience with its small fibre-to-the-premises rollout in South Brisbane, where it has more houses connected just in that little suburb of Brisbane than the NBN Co. has all over Australia, is, as they have told us, that once the fibre is bought to the premises it is still taking one man-day—that is to say, generally it takes two technicians half a day—to cut over the services over to the fibre from the copper, and they have not been able to get that time down. That is obviously very expensive given labour costs. Interestingly, the experience of Verizon, which has done a similar fibre-to-the-premises rollout in America—which they have now stopped because they simply could not make it pay—is that it has taken exactly the same time, one technician-day, to achieve that cut-over. This goes to a key recommendation in the coalition members' and senators' dissenting report here. What we have urged them to do is to investigate ways of speeding up the rollout by using existing infrastructure where possible and deploying different architecture, such as fibre to the node, where appropriate, because the one thing we know—and again this is global experience—is that you can achieve very high speeds using fibre to the node. You do not need to go very far: TransACT is doing it here in Canberra. They are getting 60 megabits per second down and 10 megabits per second up on fibre-to-the-node architecture using VDSL for the last copper piece. They are doing it right here. In the UK they are delivering 80 megabits per second download speed. So in terms of functionality and outcome it is much more than adequate, certainly more than people are likely to pay for. But the government refuses to investigate that, refuses to look at that, in a pig-headed way that is having the consequence of depriving Australians of upgraded broadband services. 


The approach we would take and will take if the Australian people return us to government, and the approach we would urge the government to take, is to target the underserved areas first. Don't overbuild areas that are already well served with broadband. This is one of the most extraordinary aspects to the NBN Co., and I look at the member for Chifley over here, who has complained bitterly about areas in his electorate that are not in the three-year rollout, areas which have got little better than dial-up. He quite rightly cannot understand any more than I can why the NBN Co. is not addressing those areas. If his constituents vote for the coalition and a coalition government is returned with the support of a new coalition member for Chifley, he will be able to console himself in his defeat with the thought that they will get their services upgraded more quickly. In his electorate these areas are not getting upgraded and yet here in Canberra in the suburb of Crace, where TransACT has installed fibre to the premises, the best architecture you can get, the NBN Co. is going to overbuild it. In Ballarat, where TransACT, for example, has an HFC network and again is delivering very high speeds, 100 megabits per second, the NBN Co. is going to overbuild that to deliver people—wait for it: 100 megabits per second. The same is true in my electorate. They are going to overbuild areas well served by HFC in my own electorate with their fibre-optic cable and yet neglect areas that are poorly served. 


The approach that the government should be taking—if the NBN Co. were run in a businesslike way, in a sensible way as opposed to this ideological obsession with fibre to the premises—is to target the areas that are poorly served first. It would then ensure that those areas receive infrastructure upgrades as a priority. It would use a mix of technologies so that the rollout were cheaper, faster and as a consequence more affordable, bearing in mind that income or lack of it is the biggest obstacle to broadband usage. If it did that, we would see the object of the NBN Co., which we all understand to be giving all Australians access to very fast broadband at an affordable price—that should be the object—achieved much sooner. It is very cold comfort indeed for Australians who have been waiting to have their broadband services upgraded to be told by the NBN, 'Oh, we will get to you sometime in the next decade or perhaps the decade after it,' and then, as they lament the leisurely timetable in the NBN's corporate plan, discover that even on the basis of that timetable, which is slow enough, the NBN is barely able to reach 10 per cent of its targets. In some cases, as I have noted earlier, it is only achieving about five per cent of its target. This is an incompetently managed company, owned by and directed by an incompetent government. It is a lose-lose-lose situation. Australians will be waiting much longer than they need to to get better broadband. Taxpayers will pay much more than they ought to to achieve this broadband upgrade. At the end of the day, as a consequence of this gigantic overinvestment, the services will be more expensive and therefore less affordable.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:45):  Perhaps I can clarify for Mr Turnbull, the member for Wentworth. I am pleased to advise the House that, under the three-year construction timetable announced by the government back in March, those areas that I have been championing for some time to drag out of the broadband dark ages—particularly Woodcroft and Doonside, which have been held up—will get the NBN. They are delighted that they have been included in the schedule and, late next year, residents in those areas will start to be connected to the NBN. That is terrific news for them.

Proceedings suspended from

Mr HUSIC:
  Just before the break I was indicating to the House that it was my great pleasure to inform members that, following a very active campaign, we were successful in seeing communities that had previously been black spots included in the NBN construction timetable, and that by next year residents in Woodcroft and Doonside would be connected. Some residents were overjoyed to hear that—some of them had not even experienced YouTube—because some suburbs in Western Sydney that were dependent on a dial-up connection are looking forward to the prospect of having superfast broadband. In cooperation with Telstra, we have seen some neighbourhoods in these suburbs be able to connect to the HFC network; others are benefiting from an investment in the ADSL network in the area through the rollout of what is called Top Hat, which will install extra cabinets in existing areas where ADSL is provided. People will now be able to access much faster broadband speeds.


I convened two community forums in the Woodcroft area. The first forum, in December last year, attracted over 100 residents and this was followed up by another forum I held in April, which was attended by a similar number of people. We were able to tell those people that, through a combination of work between Telstra and NBN Co., these suburbs would get access. I am correcting the record, because the member for Wentworth has suggested that these suburbs would still be without a connection under the NBN plans, when in fact that is not the case. The other thing I would point out, which should be taken into consideration by every member of the coalition, is the concern of residents that if the coalition gets in they will be denied access to superfast broadband, because the coalition is failing to support this technology. That is a very real concern for my constituents.


I have a simple challenge for those opposite. We saw last week the Leader of the House highlight the complaints of the member for Mitchell that the NBN was not coming out to his electorate. Mr Hawke was carrying on with the standard, rote lines that those opposite use to rail against the NBN but was then complaining, as those opposite do—as was the member for Wide Bay earlier—that the NBN has not gone to their neck of the woods. My simple challenge for any coalition member who feels that the NBN is a waste of money—to use the coalition's words, not the words of the general public or of most people in Australia—is that they should say to their electorate: 'On your behalf, I have determined that I will write to Senator Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and I will ask that our area be opted out of the rollout,' because there are certainly a lot of other suburbs in this country that would love to see the broadband network rolled out to their area. If those opposite do not recognise the enormous value that this technology is providing to this country, even at the moment, they should opt out. IBM, for example, in commissioned work entitled A Snapshot of Australia’s Digital Future to 2050,predicts that there is, through ICT, superfast broadband and other online applications, a value of up to $131 billion to our economy. That research was just provided in the last two weeks. If those opposite do not see the value of it, they should opt out and tell their constituents that they are turning their back on this equipment, on this infrastructure, on this technology. Have the courage to not say one thing here and then another thing in your own electorates. That is the simple challenge I extend to those opposite. I am absolutely confident that not one of them will write that letter to Minister Conroy, because they know what we know—and what Essential research found—and that is that even their own supporters, the people who vote for the coalition, support the NBN.


I have spoken about the value to the economy and the communities, but I am particularly pleased about what this does from an employment perspective—with nearly 20,000 jobs created as a result of the rollout of the NBN. While there are some jobs that will be created, there will be a period of transition for Telstra, which has operated its copper network for quite a number of decades—I cannot say 'countless' because we can count how many decades they have had it for. As the copper network is decommissioned, there will be changes to the workforce within Telstra. To provide for that situation there was a negotiation between NBN Co. and Telstra. Through the binding definitive agreements, the government agreed to provide $100 million to Telstra under a retraining funding deed to help retain and redeploy those Telstra employees who would be affected by the reforms to the structure of the industry—chiefly, structural separation. That RFD will conclude in 2019.


Over that period of eight years Telstra have to do a number of things. In particular, they need to ensure that, for example, under the deed, they support the availability of an appropriately trained workforce and that they establish a retraining arrangement with the staff who would otherwise face a redundancy as a consequence of the rollout of the NBN. This is detailed in the report. I commend the secretariat for this element of the report, because I think it faithfully reproduces exactly—following the appearance by Telstra back in April at the committee hearing—the nature of the questions from the committee as well as Telstra's responses, which I think were detailed as far as possible given that the actual binding definitive agreements came into effect in March and there was time required to negotiate the actual RFD. The deed operates by identifying an automatically eligible work group or employees who would be eligible for retraining—particularly those who work on the copper and HFC network and the direct field support workforce that conducts copper and HFC field based support, including workforce management, workforce and resource planning and construction program management, along with a number of other areas. Those employees who may face redundancy will be retrained.


This is particularly important to me because I have been concerned, knowing the composition of that workforce. It is an older workforce—on average, they are about 45 years of age—and, for them to face redundancy now, given the specialised skills set that they possess, it would be difficult for them to find work elsewhere. So, given the nature of the copper network versus a fibre network, it is important to be able to retrain them, using their existing skills base to lever off into new skills sets. Certainly that is why I feel this RFD is critical, and I am grateful to the committee chair in agreeing to have this component looked at as part of the joint committee's work and that we look at those workforce planning issues, particularly as it affects this section of the workforce. There are just over 6,000 employees in that automatically eligible workforce category who will be considered for retraining. Registered training organisations will be used, and Telstra itself has those capabilities. They will be able to identify the training needs under a training plan. Courses would be developed and a training methodology and target set for retraining. Telstra is also engaging in consultation with relevant stakeholders such as the unions that are involved with, or have coverage within, Telstra. Under the RFD, the training plan has to use 70 per cent of the funds for accredited training delivered by a registered training organisation, and they must be registered with a state or training authority.


Also I was keen to see that this training be spread out between urban and regional areas, and it was pleasing to see that Telstra indicated that it has a long history of delivering training to all geographic locations nationally. Its training is, to use its terminology, delivered as part of the business-as-usual training plan, and resources for that retraining will be planned on an annual and quarterly basis.


The initial training plans have been submitted to the department. They were supposed to be delivered by 30 April this year. In its appearance, Telstra had said that it was in the process of consulting employees, unions and governments on the first draft of that training plan. We look forward to talking with them further and gauging where they are at in the development of the training plan and how they will take the first steps to implement that plan.


We had also been interested to know how long it would take between the RFD coming into effect and it becoming operational, because there were redundancies that were taking place for employees that potentially would fall under the scope of the automatically identified or eligible work group. Telstra had indicated that they did not believe that there would be a great or significant impact at this stage, because the bulk of their business continues to rely upon the copper network. It is heartening to see to that they will also ensure that they pick up those employees in the meantime, and that they will receive retraining and potential redeployment to ensure that they remain within Telstra and within the sector, because my overwhelming concern is that we have major skills shortages within the sector—I have detailed that in the House previously—and the challenge, if we are to maximise the benefit out of the NBN, is to deal with those skills shortages.


These are the types of issues that I am proud to say will be picked up by a special group that has been formed within the government—the Labor Digital Economy Group. It will be looking at these types of issues, plus ways to maximise the value of the rollout of the NBN within our digital economy. As I indicated earlier, the estimates for that would range—if you take, for example, Google's commissioned work—from $70 billion worth of value to the economy through to, potentially, by 2050, according to IBM, $1 trillion worth of value to our economy, through the application of technology, the internet and the improved productivity that flows from businesses and governments and communities effectively digitising the way that they operate. That enables them to be in much greater touch with communities and customers, and enhances the way that they work.


Certainly, there is a lot that we can look forward to. I am looking forward to the Labor Digital Economy Group engaging with the ICT sector and picking up on issues such as skills shortages, and issues such as to how to get more businesses to embrace the online world and improve the way that they work. That group will, I think, form an important bridge between the sector and government.


Finally, I would like to pick up on a point that the member for Wentworth raised. He indicated—and I suspect others are going to try to indicate that, for instance, the NBN Co. has not met the targets it has set—that there has been no adequate reason as to why that would be the case. In actual fact, he is wrong. The report itself does deal with the ACCC's decision to increase the number of points of interconnect from 14 to over 121, and I draw the House's attention to paragraphs 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14, where it is clearly stated that major regulatory changes or positions by the regulator that had not been foreseen, and could not have been reasonably foreseen, have altered the way in which the corporate plan has to be shaped. Obviously those opposite continue their campaign to denigrate the NBN. I heard the member for Wentworth say that there is general amazement within the industry about NBN. If anything, there is general amazement about the position of those opposite. Most people in the sector cannot fathom how those opposite would say that the NBN would not in one swift move, in one powerful move, address something that they had tried 19 times to address but were simply unable to. If they say the NBN is not worth doing, why did they try 19 times to devise a plan that simply did not work? Their supporters support the NBN. The industry supports the NBN. Everyone knows the value of this technology to our nation. (Time expired)

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (17:15):  I am pleased, as a member of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, to speak in this debate in the House today and to make some comments about the recommendations ,but also some reflections as a rural and regional member of this parliament. Given the serious and urgent issues about broadband, wireless and mobiles or any sort of communication in rural and regional Australia, I think those experiences from the electorate of Farrer should be reflected in the context of today's debate.


The member for Chifley talked about this side of the House attacking NBN Co., making negative comments and denigrating the process. What I would say is that I am actually tired of making excuses for NBN Co. There can always be reasons why things do not get done on time, presented on time or provided in a thorough enough manner, but what the government seems to be doing over and over is just making excuse after excuse for this incredibly well-resourced company, which is moving towards using $50 billion of public taxpayers' funding.


I know the issues are that it is off balance sheet, it is an investment, it will provide a return and so on. It is rationalised away that it is not really government spending to the level that you might think. But it will not provide a return unless people pay for the NBN—what they believe the NBN is worth and what the NBN actually charges them as householders. We continually receive information that indicates that those costs are going to be quite high. Why would you, as a householder, pay $100, $120 or $150 a month for something that you are already getting for quite a bit less than that? Sure, there might be a few more bells and whistles; but, if you do not want those bells and whistles, why should you pay more? There is just so much lose, lose, lose in this for the constituents that I represent.


The opposition spokesperson for communications, the member for Wentworth, put it very well in his remarks a little while ago when he said that, under a coalition, we would not target areas that already have fast broadband. It seems like a no-brainer but it is one that the government and NBN Co. cannot get right. We would target underserved areas first. We would not overbuild high-speed networks that already have high fibre cable—




Mr Perrett:
  High fibre?




Mr Mitchell:
  High fibre? Healthy!




Ms LEY:
  Fibre optic cable. I am happy for the government to correct my momentary lapse there, but that will not save them from the real criticism of NBN Co. and its lack of activity in regional areas.


I will just go back to my seat of Farrer, which covers a third of all New South Wales. The NBN fibre rollout plans to reach—just wait for it, members of the government—0.12 per cent of my electorate by 2015. That is 0.12 per cent, which is just the city of Albury—a city that already has pretty good, pretty sufficient broadband technology.


On 9 December 2009, when announcing the Regional Backbone Blackspots Program, Minister Conroy said that the 6,000 kilometres of fibre in the ground will benefit 395,000 residents in more than 100 regional communities. But what he did not say was 'when'. It was a cruel hoax, because everybody got so excited. People who were waiting for this got so excited. But they are not excited anymore. They are seriously disappointed. He did not say 'when'. The backbone network was completed in time to be part of the infrastructure for the future, and the backhaul is something that the government has done that I do support and I thank them for it. The backhaul runs parallel to the Murray from Echuca-Moama, right up to Mildura, north to Broken Hill, passing through or nearby at least half a dozen major urban communities. How many were announced in the initial three-year NBN rollout? Zero. None. Confusion by being snubbed in this way is particularly felt, can I say, in the major inland cities of Mildura and Broken Hill—and I want to focus on Broken Hill; it is in my electorate. It was not just local residents, by the way, that were confused. Even the government's own spruiker for the NBN was staggered. Peter Blasina, otherwise known as the Gadget Guy, said he was shocked when Broken Hill was not in the rollout:


I thought that Broken Hill would be connected to the NBN before I was connected in Sydney … If I was in Broken Hill I'd be getting a group together and knocking on Steven Conroy—


the minister's—


door.


If we thought it would do any good that is exactly what we would do, but we know that it would not do any good.


The confusion even extends to the NBN's own people, because, when quizzed why Broken Hill was not in the initial rollout, a spokesperson for the NBN Co. said it was because the technology was not ready. This is how incorrect that statement was. The local council had already dug up a local footpath at the corner of Blende and Chloride streets at its own cost, watched as the fibre-optic cable was laid and refurbished the nature strip over it. That was in early February, six weeks before NBN's rollout announcement. Adding some insult to all of this is the wall-to-wall advertising blitz the government is spending taxpayers' money on in these local markets, telling us all how wonderful the world will be one day. I forgot, Madam Deputy Speaker—and you will be pleased because you would have had to rule it an unreliable prop—the little cardboard NBN truck that I have in my office, which I sometimes say to people is as close as my electorate will ever actually get to the NBN. The actual NBN truck was at Parliament House last week, I think. It popped up in Albury as well. I think it even went to Deniliquin. So there is no expense spared on the advertising for the NBN in the regional areas that are not even slated to get it in the first rollout, and goodness knows how long after 2015 it will be before they might even be mentioned as being part of the rollout. What confusion!


The truck rolled up in Deniliquin last month. Everybody was saying, 'What does this mean? Does this mean we are getting the NBN?' The drought support van was an initiative of the member for North Sydney when he was the Minister for Human Services. He said we should travel the drought affected areas of rural Australia. We should take good people from Centrelink—social workers and drought support officers. We should visit the small towns that we do not often see and we should even have a little satellite dish on the roof so we can get people's application processes happening from within the truck. That drought support truck, which morphed into a Centrelink truck, which I occasionally see on the dusty miles in the far west of New South Wales, did a really good thing. This NBN truck is just a sick joke. It cannot tell anybody when the NBN is coming, it cannot give any comfort to anyone about when faster broadband might enter their lives or their homes and it certainly cannot tell anyone what any of this will cost, either for the community as a whole or for people as individual householders. People are waiting so much longer than they need to under this government. They are going to pay so much more than they should. This gigantic, monstrous overinvestment is such a tragic waste of public dollars.


I know that there will be criticism from those opposite, and there are criticisms regularly from people on telecommunications blog type websites who send me snaky little emails saying: 'But you in the coalition didn't vote for the NBN.' No, we did not, but that does not mean that we would not bring fast broadband to people's homes with fibre to the node. We certainly would not overbuild areas that already have fast broadband. Our policy would have seen so much happen so much faster. So, when I fight for my communities and I say, 'Where is the NBN? Why has Broken Hill, a town of 20,000 people with incredible regional investment opportunities, been so overlooked?' it is not because I think the NBN is the best solution, but, if this government is spending all these taxpayer dollars on this in many cases gigantic white elephant, I do want to see some improvement in communications in the areas that I represent. Until we come to government, if indeed we are lucky enough at the next election to do so, and start fixing up this mess, I have to deal with what I have. I have to deal with what is in front of me and so I will continue to fight for the communities that I represent to appear on the map of this government and of the people in NBN Co., who seem so willing to do its bidding. I want to touch on the recommendations. I want to thank, by the way, my colleagues on the committee and the chair, the member for Lyne, and say that we on this committee are in the process of uncovering some serious failings, I believe, in the processes, the management and the rollout, which after all is what we are here to report on.


I just want to look at recommendation 3, which is quite close to my heart. It says:


The committee recommends that the NBN Co as soon as possible, provide further key information on its website in a user-friendly format … This information should include:


The date of the commencement of work in individual service areas;


The progress of the rollout in the service areas (expressed as a percentage);


The exact date of completion of the National Broadband Network rollout in each service area;


Information about how to connect to the network; and


A list of retail service providers active in the service area.


We made many good recommendations but I really want to highlight this one because, from the minute the NBN became a sort of reality in people's lives I thought, 'Well, there should be a website, because there's always a website.' You should be able to go to the website, type in your postcode and use the services of Google Earth to focus on your street. You should be provided with information on a website run by a company that is spending up to $50 billion of taxpayers' money. It should tell you what you can expect, when you can expect it, who might be delivering it, what it might cost and who you can talk to about it. But nothing like that exists. There is this dense sort of nonsense and motherhood statements about what fast broadband means but nothing that really is user-friendly. So I am glad we have got that recommendation, and I really encourage NBN Co. to pay close attention to it.


We had a group of recommendations relating to services in regional and remote areas. I particularly highlight recommendation 9, which is:


The committee recommends that the NBN Co revise its terminology and language to clarify community understanding of what the three National Broadband Network services can and cannot support, to enable the community to prepare for the network's services appropriately and become fully informed.


As I said, it is dense language, a meaningless truck which cannot really tell people anything and cannot really explain anything.


Recommendation 10 is:


The committee recommends that the NBN Co include in its web-based interactive rollout map specific information on the provision of voice services for communities in fixed wireless and satellite access areas.


The reason that is necessary is that it has never occurred to anyone in this government, and it probably has not occurred to anyone in the NBN, that there are areas where we do not have sufficient voice communications and we do not have sufficient mobile services, and that maybe a voice over internet protocol is the way that we could achieve some of that. So do take note, please, NBN Co.: there are areas of Australia where you will be coming with this project that do not even have a decent mobile signal, so voice communication is probably a priority for them areas before anything else.


While regional and remote Australia has been spruiked as being very well looked after, it certainly has not been. I quickly want to conclude by talking about some evidence that was presented to a public hearing we had in Sydney relating to the rollout in the Berrigan Shire. The director of corporate services from the Berrigan Shire Council spoke to the committee and indicated—

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (17:41):  It is a pleasure to rise tonight to speak on the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, entitled Review of the rollout of the National Broadband Network. This report covers the period from 1 July to 31 March 2012. Throughout this period of reporting there has been a number of landmark achievements reached to support the NBN rollout. The achievements in the rollout include NBN Co reaching an agreement and signing contracts for fibre rollout with: Syntheo in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory; Visionstream in Tasmania; Silcar in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT; and Transfield in my home state of Victoria. NBN has released a three-year national fibre rollout plan which details a list for some 3.5 million homes and businesses where work is underway already or due to begin up to mid-2015. It has also released a 12-month rollout schedule. NBN Co. has commenced its short-term satellite service, which will be of enormous benefit to Australians—particularly those in provincial and remote Australia—in its improvement of high-speed broadband services. This will be coupled with the announcement by NBN Co. that it has entered into an agreement with Space Systems/Loral which will deliver two new satellites to support the long-term satellite service. We have seen housing developments turned on to the NBN in western Sydney, and the member for Chifley was talking about before. We have also seen the final version of the wholesale broadband agreement. This means that we have seen some 40 retail service providers sign the WBA, and this includes Australia's largest ISP providers: Telstra, Optus and iiNet. 


Over the same period we have seen a number of regulatory milestones, including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's consideration and approval of the structural separation of Telstra and the accompanying draft customer migration plan. These are very important steps in delivering a national broadband network to all Australians, no matter where they live. The ACCC's approval of the definitive agreements will also see the NBN able to use existing Telstra pit-and-pipe infrastructure. That is going to allow for cheaper, faster and easier rollout with less overhead cabling and destruction to communities. The ACCC also approved an agreement with Optus for the decommissioning of Optus's HFC network. It should be noted that the NBN Co. special access undertaking which deals with the NBN access terms and conditions, is constantly being improved. It is an evolutionary process that has continued to grow, and it has developed out of feedback from businesses and industry. The ACCC and the committee will monitor this during the next review that we have. The report also notes that the committee is aware that the NBN Co. is still in the early stage of the rollout and that due to delays with the Telstra agreement, a change to the number of points of interconnect and changes to the government's greenfields policy there has been a delay. That happens when you are undertaking a nationally significant piece of infrastructure such as the NBN.


The committee feels that because these targets are not able to be compared between performance reports, it notes that NBN Co. considers it perfectly legitimate to measure its performance against the targets contained in the 12-month and 3-year rollout plans. The committee has recommended that the shareholder minister's report include key performance indicator information for targets in the business plan for homes passed, homes connected and services in operation.


During the time of this reporting we have been out and we have had a look at sites that are already up and running; places like Willunga in South Australia, where we went out and visited and saw cable being put into the ground. We went and saw the nodes being put there and we spoke to the many small businesses who were going to benefit from having a high-speed broadband network, something they have never had in the past. A lot of those businesses were really excited about it. There have been examples— and there are some in the report—that talk about how they had spoken to their providers and got nowhere for a long period of time—got nowhere in being able to access high-speed broadband.


With the NBN coming through it should be noted that the work of member for Kingston, Amanda Rishworth, has been very strong. Amanda took us to a lot of businesses and the local council and the library. The library is now running programs for seniors that are getting them in there and teaching them about the internet and computers and high-speed broadband. They are saying that it is just flat out; they cannot keep up with the amount of people who want to know and want to get onto this 21st century thinking. It was important that we go and see these things happening on the ground.


In my own electorate of McEwen, South Morang started putting the cable into the ground, and one of the fantastic things about this is that we are getting students from Peter Lalor College—kids who were on the cusp of going bad or good—and giving them an opportunity to learn and be part of the fitting of fibre and the laying of fibre out in the streets and to homes. There are some fantastic young kids, all good young blokes, that are out there and learning this sort of stuff—they are learning to splice. It is giving them an opportunity to take a career that they may not have had previously and it may have been pretty tough for them. But these are just some of the small benefits that happen through the NBN as a side thing while we are delivering this fantastic piece of infrastructure.


I want to compare this to what we have heard from those opposite. We have heard again tonight this false figure of $50 billion. They make this figure up and not one person has ever been able to come and back that figure up.




Mr Van Manen:
  You do not even know what it is going to cost!




Mr MITCHELL:
  Not one person has backed it up.




Mr Perrett:
  So, you are admitting you are making it up?




Mr MITCHELL:
  We will take the interjection there, that it is an admission that it a false claim. It has just been made up for something to do.


I have a look back to the 11 years when they were in government and I remember that Opel, which was plan number 18 or 19 or 20—I cannot remember because they all failed. I remember the maps that were brought out by the then Howard government—those wonderful masters of technology—that had the big Opel plan and the big map saying, 'We are going to service 75 per cent of your electorate'. You think communities would go, 'Wow wee isn't this great? How exciting is this?' The problem was, when you actually had a look at the map it never took into consideration things that we have in country areas like mountains, trees, buildings and lakes. All these things. None of that was taken into consideration. If we had got a great big iron and flattened the earth to dead flat and cut all the trees down then, maybe, the Opel contract they had may have worked. I say 'may have' because even they could not prove that it was going to work. The NBN project will deliver high-speed broadband to places that were never, ever in consideration by those opposite. During all their plans—failed plans, because every single one of them failed—




Mr Robb:
  Not true.




Mr MITCHELL:
  The member for Goldstein says that that is not true. I would be happy for you to leave your little inner-city coven and come out to anywhere around the outskirts of Melbourne and say: 'We didn't fail. You haven't got broadband.' Why? Because everything that you did failed. Not one of them worked, and that is why these programs are being delivered now and people are screaming. I am happy for you, member for Goldstein, to write to your constituents and say, 'You don't want the NBN,' because, like the rest of your crew, you bag it. You say that it is not worth it and that it is too expensive, and then you bitch and whinge and carp and whine because it is not in your areas—you are absolute jokes.



Mr Robb interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  We know about your ability to do these things. You are part of the financial team that got an auditor's fine because of your inability to tell the truth. While you sit there carping, whingeing and whining about the NBN we are actually getting on the ground and delivering it, and we are delivering it to places that would never have seen it under your government—never did and never will. You had 11 years and you did not do a thing. You sat there and did nothing; meanwhile Australia fell behind—




Mr Van Manen:
  How long is it going to take them to pay off?




Mr MITCHELL:
  Let us just take that interjection. I remember back in 2003, when I was in the state government, we did a report on rural and regional telecommunications in Victoria. It is worth having a read. Have a read about what happened then. Even your coalition partners, the Nationals, were complaining. The Victorian Nationals were complaining that the Howard government failed to deliver telecommunications to regional areas. I tell you what, Bert, I will even give you a signed copy. I have plenty of them sitting around because I was actually part of that.


At the same time that we are delivering the NBN, other carping from over there comes from the member for Gilmore. The member for Gilmore does not tell her community that she does not want the NBN and that she does not think they deserve it, but, when it does come to her electorate, what does she do? She gets up in the House, in front of everyone, and says: 'They're digging up the nature strip. Who's going to reseed the grass in the nature strip?' You have to be absolutely kidding yourselves if you think that the biggest concern of the world is that the nature strip is getting dug up. But, again, you do not see her out there saying to her community, 'I'm voting against this; I don't want the NBN.' The fact of the matter is that every single bit of polling and all the questionnaires show that people desperately want it.


What I have found to be the biggest issue with the NBN is not getting it delivered quickly enough. In my electorate and everywhere else I go people say: 'We want this. When are we getting it?' That is one of the issues that the committee is dealing with at the moment. We are talking about Telstra workforce issues and about how we can get people out on the ground faster and quicker to get this out there, because getting enough people on the ground to put the cable into the pipes and the pits to get it to the homes as quickly as possible is the biggest shortfall we have.

Mr MITCHELL:
  Stand on your credibility and we will watch you fall flat on your face.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Order! Members, through the chair.




Mr MITCHELL:
  We hear all these things but, when it comes to evidence, those on the other side have nothing—not a thing—to talk about. They sit there and say: 'We know how to do it faster. We know how to do it cheaper.' To those on the other side I say go down to the Parliamentary Library and grab yourself a book called The Wired Brown Land. I am sure that if you read it, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would say, 'Wow, this sounds amazing!' It was written by a bloke by the name of Paul Fletcher—




Mr Perrett:
  I know that guy!




Mr MITCHELL:
  Oh, you know that guy! He was out there talking about, 'We need fibre to the home; this is the greatest thing to happen.' Well, blow me down, when I got to the committee meeting there was a bloke with exactly the same name sitting there saying: 'We don't need it. It's wrong.' It is typical hypocrisy from those opposite, whether it is on carbon pricing or the NBN. The member for Flinders is out there saying in his thesis, the one he wrote with his words of wisdom, that Liberal constituents will be upset, but bad luck, we have to do this. Paul Fletcher goes out and says, 'We need fibre to the home and we need it now. It is the only way we can keep up in the 21st century economy,' but then goes to the committee and says, 'Oh, no, we don't need this. We can make it work through the technology, just like we did in the 11 years that we were in government, which left us with about 15 per cent of people connected.' The NBN is an important thing to have done. It is like the railways of the 19th century. We know that. Early Hansards show that, back then, the forefathers of the Liberal Party and the Country Party were asking why we needed an Australia-wide rail network.



Mr Perrett interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  That is right! The Luddites on the other side back then said, 'We don't need trains. What good are they?' Now they say, 'We don't need broadband. What do we need broadband for?' We need it because in every single field that this country deals in—education, health, business and personal use—it is going to deliver faster and better broadband and some absolutely exciting things. Even those opposite might learn something. But, as usual, they will sit in their little caves and say, 'No, we don't need this.' But they will still shy away from going out and telling their communities that each and every day they are in here saying 'no' to the NBN. (Time expired)

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (17:56):  I rise to make a few comments on the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, which deals with the time from 1 July 2011 to March 2012. Obviously, the National Broadband Network is very important for the national interest. It is great to hear from the member for McEwen about the actual rollout and about the 3.5 million homes that are about to be connected or are in the process of being connected and which have already had the nature strips in front of their homes dug up. Obviously, that is an inconvenience, but when you are talking about the productivity agenda of the nation and the education agenda of the nation, it is a small sacrifice for the good of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren.


Sadly, as all of those in an economic or shadow economic portfolio would know, productivity in Australia has been flatlining for approximately 10 years. Productivity is the real indicator—the most significant indicator—of whether the economic engine is finely tuned. How do we improve our productivity? Not by lowering wages. The reality is that we will never compete with India, China or Indonesia when it comes to wages. That is not the way to compete in terms of the future of the nation. The way to compete is by doing things smarter and by delivering services more cheaply and more efficiently. How do you do that? Obviously, by investing in education. We on this side can tick that box—we have doubled the education budget. The last budget was a tough budget, but we have kept the investment in higher learning. Those opposite were obsessed with making sure that everyone had a flag and/or a flagpole. That is important; our national symbols are important—I do not take that away—but I will stack our 3,000 libraries up against their 3,000 flagpoles any day. So we can proudly tick the education box.


What else can you do? You have to be able to invest in doing things smarter—invest in the health agenda and the education agenda. It is not enough to build new classrooms; you have to give people the opportunity to learn and you have to deliver services in a new way. That is how we are going to improve productivity in this nation. The NBN is an important part of this. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition say, 'Well, I'm not really very technologically savvy,' in fact, I think he said that he could not even send emails. Well, the reality is that the NBN is so much more than that. It is not just about sending emails. It is about letting businesses in the remote parts of Blair compete with businesses in the southern parts of the United States or the southern parts of China. It will let Australian businesses compete on the world stage in the niche markets with the products that we do so well, particularly when it comes to setting up a new Switzerland in the south in terms of managing funds. That is a great way by which we can compete, and the NBN is a part of that. I look forward to the next report from the NBN committee and the great news that they are delivering for Australia.


Debate adjourned.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (16:30):  In this, the third report by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network on the rollout of the National Broadband Network, there are some very important criticisms made of the NBN Co. by the whole committee, not simply by the coalition members, which go to the whole function of the committee and indeed the accountability of the NBN Co. for this massive public investment. The recommendations complain about the failure of the NBN to respond to questions, whether it is questions on notice or questions in committee hearings.


Recommendation 2, for example, calls on the government to include meaningful, consistent KPIs and statistics, such as homes passed, homes connected and services in operation. These are meaningful terms that people can understand, as opposed to the rather bizarre concept that the NBN Co. has invented—I have never seen it anywhere else in the world of telecommunications—where it boasts not of the number of households that have been passed but of the number of households that are contained within areas in which construction has commenced, as though that has any relevance. The fact that you are living in a house which is part of an area of 20,000 households and that the NBN has put a shovel in the ground somewhere in that area does not bring you better broadband services. It does not do anything for you, in fact. It is obviously just a device to get over what has been an extraordinary failure in delivery.


I think it is important to run through some of the NBN's scorecard as at June this year. Let us take the most important metrics. In their corporate plan, the NBN estimated that by 30 June 2012—in other words, by the end of this month—there would be 145,000 households passed with the fibre optic cable. As of May, 18,200 premises were passed; so not even 15 per cent has been achieved.


They also estimated in their corporate plan, which was published just at the end of 2010, that by the end of this month 172,000 households would be passed in greenfields areas—that is, in new housing developments, as opposed to the brownfields areas, which of course are built-up areas. They said, 'We'll have passed 172,000 households in greenfields areas by the end of June 2012.' By the end of December 2011, which is the latest number we have, they had passed a massive 951 households. That is an extraordinary failure, barely five per cent of what they had forecast.


They forecast that by the end of this month there would be 1,000 households with active connections to the fixed wireless service. This is the service that will go into the four per cent of the country which will not be getting the fibre-to-the-premises service or the satellite service. They said, 'One thousand will be connected by fixed wireless as at the end of June.' As at the end of May, they had active connections to 52 households. There is a bit of a pattern here—it is another five per cent achievement. The total number of active connections that they forecast, therefore, by 30 June 2012 was 151,000 active connections, and as of May the active connections are in fact 11,000. Of those 11,000, 7,300 are on the interim satellite service. So in terms of the whole purpose, the whole thrust and the object of the NBN Co., which is the fibre-to-the-premises rollout, supported by the fixed wireless roll-out, it is a colossal failure. When you move out to 30 June 2013, they had estimated in their corporate plan that there would be 805,000 households to be passed in the brownfields areas, and it now appears from their latest publication that there will be only 236,000 households passed.


This is a colossal failure, and the government really provides very little in the way of explanation other than to say that it took some time to finalise the negotiations with Telstra. What they overlook is that the negotiations with Telstra included, from the very outset, an arrangement that the NBN Co.—before all the precedent conditions were satisfied—could have access to Telstra's infrastructure, and they have had access to that for just under a year. So, as an excuse, the Telstra contractual negotiations are very, very thin.


In the industry, there is general amazement at the slowness of the NBN Co.'s rollout. There is general amazement and disappointment at what appears to be much less than competent management on the part of the NBN Co. But I may say that it goes further than that. While you can attribute much of this delay to poor management on the part of the NBN Co—and that is certainly what people in the industry and in the civil engineering world are saying—there is also this problem: the universal experience around the world has been that building fibre-to-the-premises networks is inordinately slow and expensive. Even in Singapore, where they are building a fibre-to-the-premises network—or seeking to do so—it has taken much longer, cost a lot more and resulted in some pretty acrimonious litigation between the various parties in that tiny country, with all of the advantages of density that it offers in terms of a rollout of this kind.


If you want to compare a statistic or a metric between Australia and the United States, Telstra's experience with its small fibre-to-the-premises rollout in South Brisbane, where it has more houses connected just in that little suburb of Brisbane than the NBN Co. has all over Australia, is, as they have told us, that once the fibre is bought to the premises it is still taking one man-day—that is to say, generally it takes two technicians half a day—to cut over the services over to the fibre from the copper, and they have not been able to get that time down. That is obviously very expensive given labour costs. Interestingly, the experience of Verizon, which has done a similar fibre-to-the-premises rollout in America—which they have now stopped because they simply could not make it pay—is that it has taken exactly the same time, one technician-day, to achieve that cut-over. This goes to a key recommendation in the coalition members' and senators' dissenting report here. What we have urged them to do is to investigate ways of speeding up the rollout by using existing infrastructure where possible and deploying different architecture, such as fibre to the node, where appropriate, because the one thing we know—and again this is global experience—is that you can achieve very high speeds using fibre to the node. You do not need to go very far: TransACT is doing it here in Canberra. They are getting 60 megabits per second down and 10 megabits per second up on fibre-to-the-node architecture using VDSL for the last copper piece. They are doing it right here. In the UK they are delivering 80 megabits per second download speed. So in terms of functionality and outcome it is much more than adequate, certainly more than people are likely to pay for. But the government refuses to investigate that, refuses to look at that, in a pig-headed way that is having the consequence of depriving Australians of upgraded broadband services. 


The approach we would take and will take if the Australian people return us to government, and the approach we would urge the government to take, is to target the underserved areas first. Don't overbuild areas that are already well served with broadband. This is one of the most extraordinary aspects to the NBN Co., and I look at the member for Chifley over here, who has complained bitterly about areas in his electorate that are not in the three-year rollout, areas which have got little better than dial-up. He quite rightly cannot understand any more than I can why the NBN Co. is not addressing those areas. If his constituents vote for the coalition and a coalition government is returned with the support of a new coalition member for Chifley, he will be able to console himself in his defeat with the thought that they will get their services upgraded more quickly. In his electorate these areas are not getting upgraded and yet here in Canberra in the suburb of Crace, where TransACT has installed fibre to the premises, the best architecture you can get, the NBN Co. is going to overbuild it. In Ballarat, where TransACT, for example, has an HFC network and again is delivering very high speeds, 100 megabits per second, the NBN Co. is going to overbuild that to deliver people—wait for it: 100 megabits per second. The same is true in my electorate. They are going to overbuild areas well served by HFC in my own electorate with their fibre-optic cable and yet neglect areas that are poorly served. 


The approach that the government should be taking—if the NBN Co. were run in a businesslike way, in a sensible way as opposed to this ideological obsession with fibre to the premises—is to target the areas that are poorly served first. It would then ensure that those areas receive infrastructure upgrades as a priority. It would use a mix of technologies so that the rollout were cheaper, faster and as a consequence more affordable, bearing in mind that income or lack of it is the biggest obstacle to broadband usage. If it did that, we would see the object of the NBN Co., which we all understand to be giving all Australians access to very fast broadband at an affordable price—that should be the object—achieved much sooner. It is very cold comfort indeed for Australians who have been waiting to have their broadband services upgraded to be told by the NBN, 'Oh, we will get to you sometime in the next decade or perhaps the decade after it,' and then, as they lament the leisurely timetable in the NBN's corporate plan, discover that even on the basis of that timetable, which is slow enough, the NBN is barely able to reach 10 per cent of its targets. In some cases, as I have noted earlier, it is only achieving about five per cent of its target. This is an incompetently managed company, owned by and directed by an incompetent government. It is a lose-lose-lose situation. Australians will be waiting much longer than they need to to get better broadband. Taxpayers will pay much more than they ought to to achieve this broadband upgrade. At the end of the day, as a consequence of this gigantic overinvestment, the services will be more expensive and therefore less affordable.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:45):  Perhaps I can clarify for Mr Turnbull, the member for Wentworth. I am pleased to advise the House that, under the three-year construction timetable announced by the government back in March, those areas that I have been championing for some time to drag out of the broadband dark ages—particularly Woodcroft and Doonside, which have been held up—will get the NBN. They are delighted that they have been included in the schedule and, late next year, residents in those areas will start to be connected to the NBN. That is terrific news for them.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Proceedings suspended from 
16:46
 to 
17:01





Mr HUSIC:
  Just before the break I was indicating to the House that it was my great pleasure to inform members that, following a very active campaign, we were successful in seeing communities that had previously been black spots included in the NBN construction timetable, and that by next year residents in Woodcroft and Doonside would be connected. Some residents were overjoyed to hear that—some of them had not even experienced YouTube—because some suburbs in Western Sydney that were dependent on a dial-up connection are looking forward to the prospect of having superfast broadband. In cooperation with Telstra, we have seen some neighbourhoods in these suburbs be able to connect to the HFC network; others are benefiting from an investment in the ADSL network in the area through the rollout of what is called Top Hat, which will install extra cabinets in existing areas where ADSL is provided. People will now be able to access much faster broadband speeds.


I convened two community forums in the Woodcroft area. The first forum, in December last year, attracted over 100 residents and this was followed up by another forum I held in April, which was attended by a similar number of people. We were able to tell those people that, through a combination of work between Telstra and NBN Co., these suburbs would get access. I am correcting the record, because the member for Wentworth has suggested that these suburbs would still be without a connection under the NBN plans, when in fact that is not the case. The other thing I would point out, which should be taken into consideration by every member of the coalition, is the concern of residents that if the coalition gets in they will be denied access to superfast broadband, because the coalition is failing to support this technology. That is a very real concern for my constituents.


I have a simple challenge for those opposite. We saw last week the Leader of the House highlight the complaints of the member for Mitchell that the NBN was not coming out to his electorate. Mr Hawke was carrying on with the standard, rote lines that those opposite use to rail against the NBN but was then complaining, as those opposite do—as was the member for Wide Bay earlier—that the NBN has not gone to their neck of the woods. My simple challenge for any coalition member who feels that the NBN is a waste of money—to use the coalition's words, not the words of the general public or of most people in Australia—is that they should say to their electorate: 'On your behalf, I have determined that I will write to Senator Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and I will ask that our area be opted out of the rollout,' because there are certainly a lot of other suburbs in this country that would love to see the broadband network rolled out to their area. If those opposite do not recognise the enormous value that this technology is providing to this country, even at the moment, they should opt out. IBM, for example, in commissioned work entitled A Snapshot of Australia’s Digital Future to 2050,predicts that there is, through ICT, superfast broadband and other online applications, a value of up to $131 billion to our economy. That research was just provided in the last two weeks. If those opposite do not see the value of it, they should opt out and tell their constituents that they are turning their back on this equipment, on this infrastructure, on this technology. Have the courage to not say one thing here and then another thing in your own electorates. That is the simple challenge I extend to those opposite. I am absolutely confident that not one of them will write that letter to Minister Conroy, because they know what we know—and what Essential research found—and that is that even their own supporters, the people who vote for the coalition, support the NBN.


I have spoken about the value to the economy and the communities, but I am particularly pleased about what this does from an employment perspective—with nearly 20,000 jobs created as a result of the rollout of the NBN. While there are some jobs that will be created, there will be a period of transition for Telstra, which has operated its copper network for quite a number of decades—I cannot say 'countless' because we can count how many decades they have had it for. As the copper network is decommissioned, there will be changes to the workforce within Telstra. To provide for that situation there was a negotiation between NBN Co. and Telstra. Through the binding definitive agreements, the government agreed to provide $100 million to Telstra under a retraining funding deed to help retain and redeploy those Telstra employees who would be affected by the reforms to the structure of the industry—chiefly, structural separation. That RFD will conclude in 2019.


Over that period of eight years Telstra have to do a number of things. In particular, they need to ensure that, for example, under the deed, they support the availability of an appropriately trained workforce and that they establish a retraining arrangement with the staff who would otherwise face a redundancy as a consequence of the rollout of the NBN. This is detailed in the report. I commend the secretariat for this element of the report, because I think it faithfully reproduces exactly—following the appearance by Telstra back in April at the committee hearing—the nature of the questions from the committee as well as Telstra's responses, which I think were detailed as far as possible given that the actual binding definitive agreements came into effect in March and there was time required to negotiate the actual RFD. The deed operates by identifying an automatically eligible work group or employees who would be eligible for retraining—particularly those who work on the copper and HFC network and the direct field support workforce that conducts copper and HFC field based support, including workforce management, workforce and resource planning and construction program management, along with a number of other areas. Those employees who may face redundancy will be retrained.


This is particularly important to me because I have been concerned, knowing the composition of that workforce. It is an older workforce—on average, they are about 45 years of age—and, for them to face redundancy now, given the specialised skills set that they possess, it would be difficult for them to find work elsewhere. So, given the nature of the copper network versus a fibre network, it is important to be able to retrain them, using their existing skills base to lever off into new skills sets. Certainly that is why I feel this RFD is critical, and I am grateful to the committee chair in agreeing to have this component looked at as part of the joint committee's work and that we look at those workforce planning issues, particularly as it affects this section of the workforce. There are just over 6,000 employees in that automatically eligible workforce category who will be considered for retraining. Registered training organisations will be used, and Telstra itself has those capabilities. They will be able to identify the training needs under a training plan. Courses would be developed and a training methodology and target set for retraining. Telstra is also engaging in consultation with relevant stakeholders such as the unions that are involved with, or have coverage within, Telstra. Under the RFD, the training plan has to use 70 per cent of the funds for accredited training delivered by a registered training organisation, and they must be registered with a state or training authority.


Also I was keen to see that this training be spread out between urban and regional areas, and it was pleasing to see that Telstra indicated that it has a long history of delivering training to all geographic locations nationally. Its training is, to use its terminology, delivered as part of the business-as-usual training plan, and resources for that retraining will be planned on an annual and quarterly basis.


The initial training plans have been submitted to the department. They were supposed to be delivered by 30 April this year. In its appearance, Telstra had said that it was in the process of consulting employees, unions and governments on the first draft of that training plan. We look forward to talking with them further and gauging where they are at in the development of the training plan and how they will take the first steps to implement that plan.


We had also been interested to know how long it would take between the RFD coming into effect and it becoming operational, because there were redundancies that were taking place for employees that potentially would fall under the scope of the automatically identified or eligible work group. Telstra had indicated that they did not believe that there would be a great or significant impact at this stage, because the bulk of their business continues to rely upon the copper network. It is heartening to see to that they will also ensure that they pick up those employees in the meantime, and that they will receive retraining and potential redeployment to ensure that they remain within Telstra and within the sector, because my overwhelming concern is that we have major skills shortages within the sector—I have detailed that in the House previously—and the challenge, if we are to maximise the benefit out of the NBN, is to deal with those skills shortages.


These are the types of issues that I am proud to say will be picked up by a special group that has been formed within the government—the Labor Digital Economy Group. It will be looking at these types of issues, plus ways to maximise the value of the rollout of the NBN within our digital economy. As I indicated earlier, the estimates for that would range—if you take, for example, Google's commissioned work—from $70 billion worth of value to the economy through to, potentially, by 2050, according to IBM, $1 trillion worth of value to our economy, through the application of technology, the internet and the improved productivity that flows from businesses and governments and communities effectively digitising the way that they operate. That enables them to be in much greater touch with communities and customers, and enhances the way that they work.


Certainly, there is a lot that we can look forward to. I am looking forward to the Labor Digital Economy Group engaging with the ICT sector and picking up on issues such as skills shortages, and issues such as to how to get more businesses to embrace the online world and improve the way that they work. That group will, I think, form an important bridge between the sector and government.


Finally, I would like to pick up on a point that the member for Wentworth raised. He indicated—and I suspect others are going to try to indicate that, for instance, the NBN Co. has not met the targets it has set—that there has been no adequate reason as to why that would be the case. In actual fact, he is wrong. The report itself does deal with the ACCC's decision to increase the number of points of interconnect from 14 to over 121, and I draw the House's attention to paragraphs 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14, where it is clearly stated that major regulatory changes or positions by the regulator that had not been foreseen, and could not have been reasonably foreseen, have altered the way in which the corporate plan has to be shaped. Obviously those opposite continue their campaign to denigrate the NBN. I heard the member for Wentworth say that there is general amazement within the industry about NBN. If anything, there is general amazement about the position of those opposite. Most people in the sector cannot fathom how those opposite would say that the NBN would not in one swift move, in one powerful move, address something that they had tried 19 times to address but were simply unable to. If they say the NBN is not worth doing, why did they try 19 times to devise a plan that simply did not work? Their supporters support the NBN. The industry supports the NBN. Everyone knows the value of this technology to our nation. (Time expired)

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (17:15):  I am pleased, as a member of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, to speak in this debate in the House today and to make some comments about the recommendations ,but also some reflections as a rural and regional member of this parliament. Given the serious and urgent issues about broadband, wireless and mobiles or any sort of communication in rural and regional Australia, I think those experiences from the electorate of Farrer should be reflected in the context of today's debate.


The member for Chifley talked about this side of the House attacking NBN Co., making negative comments and denigrating the process. What I would say is that I am actually tired of making excuses for NBN Co. There can always be reasons why things do not get done on time, presented on time or provided in a thorough enough manner, but what the government seems to be doing over and over is just making excuse after excuse for this incredibly well-resourced company, which is moving towards using $50 billion of public taxpayers' funding.


I know the issues are that it is off balance sheet, it is an investment, it will provide a return and so on. It is rationalised away that it is not really government spending to the level that you might think. But it will not provide a return unless people pay for the NBN—what they believe the NBN is worth and what the NBN actually charges them as householders. We continually receive information that indicates that those costs are going to be quite high. Why would you, as a householder, pay $100, $120 or $150 a month for something that you are already getting for quite a bit less than that? Sure, there might be a few more bells and whistles; but, if you do not want those bells and whistles, why should you pay more? There is just so much lose, lose, lose in this for the constituents that I represent.


The opposition spokesperson for communications, the member for Wentworth, put it very well in his remarks a little while ago when he said that, under a coalition, we would not target areas that already have fast broadband. It seems like a no-brainer but it is one that the government and NBN Co. cannot get right. We would target underserved areas first. We would not overbuild high-speed networks that already have high fibre cable—




Mr Perrett:
  High fibre?




Mr Mitchell:
  High fibre? Healthy!




Ms LEY:
  Fibre optic cable. I am happy for the government to correct my momentary lapse there, but that will not save them from the real criticism of NBN Co. and its lack of activity in regional areas.


I will just go back to my seat of Farrer, which covers a third of all New South Wales. The NBN fibre rollout plans to reach—just wait for it, members of the government—0.12 per cent of my electorate by 2015. That is 0.12 per cent, which is just the city of Albury—a city that already has pretty good, pretty sufficient broadband technology.


On 9 December 2009, when announcing the Regional Backbone Blackspots Program, Minister Conroy said that the 6,000 kilometres of fibre in the ground will benefit 395,000 residents in more than 100 regional communities. But what he did not say was 'when'. It was a cruel hoax, because everybody got so excited. People who were waiting for this got so excited. But they are not excited anymore. They are seriously disappointed. He did not say 'when'. The backbone network was completed in time to be part of the infrastructure for the future, and the backhaul is something that the government has done that I do support and I thank them for it. The backhaul runs parallel to the Murray from Echuca-Moama, right up to Mildura, north to Broken Hill, passing through or nearby at least half a dozen major urban communities. How many were announced in the initial three-year NBN rollout? Zero. None. Confusion by being snubbed in this way is particularly felt, can I say, in the major inland cities of Mildura and Broken Hill—and I want to focus on Broken Hill; it is in my electorate. It was not just local residents, by the way, that were confused. Even the government's own spruiker for the NBN was staggered. Peter Blasina, otherwise known as the Gadget Guy, said he was shocked when Broken Hill was not in the rollout:


I thought that Broken Hill would be connected to the NBN before I was connected in Sydney … If I was in Broken Hill I'd be getting a group together and knocking on Steven Conroy—


the minister's—


door.


If we thought it would do any good that is exactly what we would do, but we know that it would not do any good.


The confusion even extends to the NBN's own people, because, when quizzed why Broken Hill was not in the initial rollout, a spokesperson for the NBN Co. said it was because the technology was not ready. This is how incorrect that statement was. The local council had already dug up a local footpath at the corner of Blende and Chloride streets at its own cost, watched as the fibre-optic cable was laid and refurbished the nature strip over it. That was in early February, six weeks before NBN's rollout announcement. Adding some insult to all of this is the wall-to-wall advertising blitz the government is spending taxpayers' money on in these local markets, telling us all how wonderful the world will be one day. I forgot, Madam Deputy Speaker—and you will be pleased because you would have had to rule it an unreliable prop—the little cardboard NBN truck that I have in my office, which I sometimes say to people is as close as my electorate will ever actually get to the NBN. The actual NBN truck was at Parliament House last week, I think. It popped up in Albury as well. I think it even went to Deniliquin. So there is no expense spared on the advertising for the NBN in the regional areas that are not even slated to get it in the first rollout, and goodness knows how long after 2015 it will be before they might even be mentioned as being part of the rollout. What confusion!


The truck rolled up in Deniliquin last month. Everybody was saying, 'What does this mean? Does this mean we are getting the NBN?' The drought support van was an initiative of the member for North Sydney when he was the Minister for Human Services. He said we should travel the drought affected areas of rural Australia. We should take good people from Centrelink—social workers and drought support officers. We should visit the small towns that we do not often see and we should even have a little satellite dish on the roof so we can get people's application processes happening from within the truck. That drought support truck, which morphed into a Centrelink truck, which I occasionally see on the dusty miles in the far west of New South Wales, did a really good thing. This NBN truck is just a sick joke. It cannot tell anybody when the NBN is coming, it cannot give any comfort to anyone about when faster broadband might enter their lives or their homes and it certainly cannot tell anyone what any of this will cost, either for the community as a whole or for people as individual householders. People are waiting so much longer than they need to under this government. They are going to pay so much more than they should. This gigantic, monstrous overinvestment is such a tragic waste of public dollars.


I know that there will be criticism from those opposite, and there are criticisms regularly from people on telecommunications blog type websites who send me snaky little emails saying: 'But you in the coalition didn't vote for the NBN.' No, we did not, but that does not mean that we would not bring fast broadband to people's homes with fibre to the node. We certainly would not overbuild areas that already have fast broadband. Our policy would have seen so much happen so much faster. So, when I fight for my communities and I say, 'Where is the NBN? Why has Broken Hill, a town of 20,000 people with incredible regional investment opportunities, been so overlooked?' it is not because I think the NBN is the best solution, but, if this government is spending all these taxpayer dollars on this in many cases gigantic white elephant, I do want to see some improvement in communications in the areas that I represent. Until we come to government, if indeed we are lucky enough at the next election to do so, and start fixing up this mess, I have to deal with what I have. I have to deal with what is in front of me and so I will continue to fight for the communities that I represent to appear on the map of this government and of the people in NBN Co., who seem so willing to do its bidding. I want to touch on the recommendations. I want to thank, by the way, my colleagues on the committee and the chair, the member for Lyne, and say that we on this committee are in the process of uncovering some serious failings, I believe, in the processes, the management and the rollout, which after all is what we are here to report on.


I just want to look at recommendation 3, which is quite close to my heart. It says:


The committee recommends that the NBN Co as soon as possible, provide further key information on its website in a user-friendly format … This information should include:


The date of the commencement of work in individual service areas;


The progress of the rollout in the service areas (expressed as a percentage);


The exact date of completion of the National Broadband Network rollout in each service area;


Information about how to connect to the network; and


A list of retail service providers active in the service area.


We made many good recommendations but I really want to highlight this one because, from the minute the NBN became a sort of reality in people's lives I thought, 'Well, there should be a website, because there's always a website.' You should be able to go to the website, type in your postcode and use the services of Google Earth to focus on your street. You should be provided with information on a website run by a company that is spending up to $50 billion of taxpayers' money. It should tell you what you can expect, when you can expect it, who might be delivering it, what it might cost and who you can talk to about it. But nothing like that exists. There is this dense sort of nonsense and motherhood statements about what fast broadband means but nothing that really is user-friendly. So I am glad we have got that recommendation, and I really encourage NBN Co. to pay close attention to it.


We had a group of recommendations relating to services in regional and remote areas. I particularly highlight recommendation 9, which is:


The committee recommends that the NBN Co revise its terminology and language to clarify community understanding of what the three National Broadband Network services can and cannot support, to enable the community to prepare for the network's services appropriately and become fully informed.


As I said, it is dense language, a meaningless truck which cannot really tell people anything and cannot really explain anything.


Recommendation 10 is:


The committee recommends that the NBN Co include in its web-based interactive rollout map specific information on the provision of voice services for communities in fixed wireless and satellite access areas.


The reason that is necessary is that it has never occurred to anyone in this government, and it probably has not occurred to anyone in the NBN, that there are areas where we do not have sufficient voice communications and we do not have sufficient mobile services, and that maybe a voice over internet protocol is the way that we could achieve some of that. So do take note, please, NBN Co.: there are areas of Australia where you will be coming with this project that do not even have a decent mobile signal, so voice communication is probably a priority for them areas before anything else.


While regional and remote Australia has been spruiked as being very well looked after, it certainly has not been. I quickly want to conclude by talking about some evidence that was presented to a public hearing we had in Sydney relating to the rollout in the Berrigan Shire. The director of corporate services from the Berrigan Shire Council spoke to the committee and indicated—

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (17:41):  It is a pleasure to rise tonight to speak on the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, entitled Review of the rollout of the National Broadband Network. This report covers the period from 1 July to 31 March 2012. Throughout this period of reporting there has been a number of landmark achievements reached to support the NBN rollout. The achievements in the rollout include NBN Co reaching an agreement and signing contracts for fibre rollout with: Syntheo in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory; Visionstream in Tasmania; Silcar in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT; and Transfield in my home state of Victoria. NBN has released a three-year national fibre rollout plan which details a list for some 3.5 million homes and businesses where work is underway already or due to begin up to mid-2015. It has also released a 12-month rollout schedule. NBN Co. has commenced its short-term satellite service, which will be of enormous benefit to Australians—particularly those in provincial and remote Australia—in its improvement of high-speed broadband services. This will be coupled with the announcement by NBN Co. that it has entered into an agreement with Space Systems/Loral which will deliver two new satellites to support the long-term satellite service. We have seen housing developments turned on to the NBN in western Sydney, and the member for Chifley was talking about before. We have also seen the final version of the wholesale broadband agreement. This means that we have seen some 40 retail service providers sign the WBA, and this includes Australia's largest ISP providers: Telstra, Optus and iiNet. 


Over the same period we have seen a number of regulatory milestones, including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's consideration and approval of the structural separation of Telstra and the accompanying draft customer migration plan. These are very important steps in delivering a national broadband network to all Australians, no matter where they live. The ACCC's approval of the definitive agreements will also see the NBN able to use existing Telstra pit-and-pipe infrastructure. That is going to allow for cheaper, faster and easier rollout with less overhead cabling and destruction to communities. The ACCC also approved an agreement with Optus for the decommissioning of Optus's HFC network. It should be noted that the NBN Co. special access undertaking which deals with the NBN access terms and conditions, is constantly being improved. It is an evolutionary process that has continued to grow, and it has developed out of feedback from businesses and industry. The ACCC and the committee will monitor this during the next review that we have. The report also notes that the committee is aware that the NBN Co. is still in the early stage of the rollout and that due to delays with the Telstra agreement, a change to the number of points of interconnect and changes to the government's greenfields policy there has been a delay. That happens when you are undertaking a nationally significant piece of infrastructure such as the NBN.


The committee feels that because these targets are not able to be compared between performance reports, it notes that NBN Co. considers it perfectly legitimate to measure its performance against the targets contained in the 12-month and 3-year rollout plans. The committee has recommended that the shareholder minister's report include key performance indicator information for targets in the business plan for homes passed, homes connected and services in operation.


During the time of this reporting we have been out and we have had a look at sites that are already up and running; places like Willunga in South Australia, where we went out and visited and saw cable being put into the ground. We went and saw the nodes being put there and we spoke to the many small businesses who were going to benefit from having a high-speed broadband network, something they have never had in the past. A lot of those businesses were really excited about it. There have been examples— and there are some in the report—that talk about how they had spoken to their providers and got nowhere for a long period of time—got nowhere in being able to access high-speed broadband.


With the NBN coming through it should be noted that the work of member for Kingston, Amanda Rishworth, has been very strong. Amanda took us to a lot of businesses and the local council and the library. The library is now running programs for seniors that are getting them in there and teaching them about the internet and computers and high-speed broadband. They are saying that it is just flat out; they cannot keep up with the amount of people who want to know and want to get onto this 21st century thinking. It was important that we go and see these things happening on the ground.


In my own electorate of McEwen, South Morang started putting the cable into the ground, and one of the fantastic things about this is that we are getting students from Peter Lalor College—kids who were on the cusp of going bad or good—and giving them an opportunity to learn and be part of the fitting of fibre and the laying of fibre out in the streets and to homes. There are some fantastic young kids, all good young blokes, that are out there and learning this sort of stuff—they are learning to splice. It is giving them an opportunity to take a career that they may not have had previously and it may have been pretty tough for them. But these are just some of the small benefits that happen through the NBN as a side thing while we are delivering this fantastic piece of infrastructure.


I want to compare this to what we have heard from those opposite. We have heard again tonight this false figure of $50 billion. They make this figure up and not one person has ever been able to come and back that figure up.




Mr Van Manen:
  You do not even know what it is going to cost!




Mr MITCHELL:
  Not one person has backed it up.




Mr Perrett:
  So, you are admitting you are making it up?




Mr MITCHELL:
  We will take the interjection there, that it is an admission that it a false claim. It has just been made up for something to do.


I have a look back to the 11 years when they were in government and I remember that Opel, which was plan number 18 or 19 or 20—I cannot remember because they all failed. I remember the maps that were brought out by the then Howard government—those wonderful masters of technology—that had the big Opel plan and the big map saying, 'We are going to service 75 per cent of your electorate'. You think communities would go, 'Wow wee isn't this great? How exciting is this?' The problem was, when you actually had a look at the map it never took into consideration things that we have in country areas like mountains, trees, buildings and lakes. All these things. None of that was taken into consideration. If we had got a great big iron and flattened the earth to dead flat and cut all the trees down then, maybe, the Opel contract they had may have worked. I say 'may have' because even they could not prove that it was going to work. The NBN project will deliver high-speed broadband to places that were never, ever in consideration by those opposite. During all their plans—failed plans, because every single one of them failed—




Mr Robb:
  Not true.




Mr MITCHELL:
  The member for Goldstein says that that is not true. I would be happy for you to leave your little inner-city coven and come out to anywhere around the outskirts of Melbourne and say: 'We didn't fail. You haven't got broadband.' Why? Because everything that you did failed. Not one of them worked, and that is why these programs are being delivered now and people are screaming. I am happy for you, member for Goldstein, to write to your constituents and say, 'You don't want the NBN,' because, like the rest of your crew, you bag it. You say that it is not worth it and that it is too expensive, and then you bitch and whinge and carp and whine because it is not in your areas—you are absolute jokes.



Mr Robb interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  We know about your ability to do these things. You are part of the financial team that got an auditor's fine because of your inability to tell the truth. While you sit there carping, whingeing and whining about the NBN we are actually getting on the ground and delivering it, and we are delivering it to places that would never have seen it under your government—never did and never will. You had 11 years and you did not do a thing. You sat there and did nothing; meanwhile Australia fell behind—




Mr Van Manen:
  How long is it going to take them to pay off?




Mr MITCHELL:
  Let us just take that interjection. I remember back in 2003, when I was in the state government, we did a report on rural and regional telecommunications in Victoria. It is worth having a read. Have a read about what happened then. Even your coalition partners, the Nationals, were complaining. The Victorian Nationals were complaining that the Howard government failed to deliver telecommunications to regional areas. I tell you what, Bert, I will even give you a signed copy. I have plenty of them sitting around because I was actually part of that.


At the same time that we are delivering the NBN, other carping from over there comes from the member for Gilmore. The member for Gilmore does not tell her community that she does not want the NBN and that she does not think they deserve it, but, when it does come to her electorate, what does she do? She gets up in the House, in front of everyone, and says: 'They're digging up the nature strip. Who's going to reseed the grass in the nature strip?' You have to be absolutely kidding yourselves if you think that the biggest concern of the world is that the nature strip is getting dug up. But, again, you do not see her out there saying to her community, 'I'm voting against this; I don't want the NBN.' The fact of the matter is that every single bit of polling and all the questionnaires show that people desperately want it.


What I have found to be the biggest issue with the NBN is not getting it delivered quickly enough. In my electorate and everywhere else I go people say: 'We want this. When are we getting it?' That is one of the issues that the committee is dealing with at the moment. We are talking about Telstra workforce issues and about how we can get people out on the ground faster and quicker to get this out there, because getting enough people on the ground to put the cable into the pipes and the pits to get it to the homes as quickly as possible is the biggest shortfall we have.



Mr Van Manen interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  We do use local businesses. The member opposite interjects but, again—



Mr Van Manen interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  Stand on your credibility and we will watch you fall flat on your face.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Order! Members, through the chair.




Mr MITCHELL:
  We hear all these things but, when it comes to evidence, those on the other side have nothing—not a thing—to talk about. They sit there and say: 'We know how to do it faster. We know how to do it cheaper.' To those on the other side I say go down to the Parliamentary Library and grab yourself a book called The Wired Brown Land. I am sure that if you read it, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would say, 'Wow, this sounds amazing!' It was written by a bloke by the name of Paul Fletcher—




Mr Perrett:
  I know that guy!




Mr MITCHELL:
  Oh, you know that guy! He was out there talking about, 'We need fibre to the home; this is the greatest thing to happen.' Well, blow me down, when I got to the committee meeting there was a bloke with exactly the same name sitting there saying: 'We don't need it. It's wrong.' It is typical hypocrisy from those opposite, whether it is on carbon pricing or the NBN. The member for Flinders is out there saying in his thesis, the one he wrote with his words of wisdom, that Liberal constituents will be upset, but bad luck, we have to do this. Paul Fletcher goes out and says, 'We need fibre to the home and we need it now. It is the only way we can keep up in the 21st century economy,' but then goes to the committee and says, 'Oh, no, we don't need this. We can make it work through the technology, just like we did in the 11 years that we were in government, which left us with about 15 per cent of people connected.' The NBN is an important thing to have done. It is like the railways of the 19th century. We know that. Early Hansards show that, back then, the forefathers of the Liberal Party and the Country Party were asking why we needed an Australia-wide rail network.



Mr Perrett interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  That is right! The Luddites on the other side back then said, 'We don't need trains. What good are they?' Now they say, 'We don't need broadband. What do we need broadband for?' We need it because in every single field that this country deals in—education, health, business and personal use—it is going to deliver faster and better broadband and some absolutely exciting things. Even those opposite might learn something. But, as usual, they will sit in their little caves and say, 'No, we don't need this.' But they will still shy away from going out and telling their communities that each and every day they are in here saying 'no' to the NBN. (Time expired)

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-26,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (17:56):  I rise to make a few comments on the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, which deals with the time from 1 July 2011 to March 2012. Obviously, the National Broadband Network is very important for the national interest. It is great to hear from the member for McEwen about the actual rollout and about the 3.5 million homes that are about to be connected or are in the process of being connected and which have already had the nature strips in front of their homes dug up. Obviously, that is an inconvenience, but when you are talking about the productivity agenda of the nation and the education agenda of the nation, it is a small sacrifice for the good of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren.


Sadly, as all of those in an economic or shadow economic portfolio would know, productivity in Australia has been flatlining for approximately 10 years. Productivity is the real indicator—the most significant indicator—of whether the economic engine is finely tuned. How do we improve our productivity? Not by lowering wages. The reality is that we will never compete with India, China or Indonesia when it comes to wages. That is not the way to compete in terms of the future of the nation. The way to compete is by doing things smarter and by delivering services more cheaply and more efficiently. How do you do that? Obviously, by investing in education. We on this side can tick that box—we have doubled the education budget. The last budget was a tough budget, but we have kept the investment in higher learning. Those opposite were obsessed with making sure that everyone had a flag and/or a flagpole. That is important; our national symbols are important—I do not take that away—but I will stack our 3,000 libraries up against their 3,000 flagpoles any day. So we can proudly tick the education box.


What else can you do? You have to be able to invest in doing things smarter—invest in the health agenda and the education agenda. It is not enough to build new classrooms; you have to give people the opportunity to learn and you have to deliver services in a new way. That is how we are going to improve productivity in this nation. The NBN is an important part of this. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition say, 'Well, I'm not really very technologically savvy,' in fact, I think he said that he could not even send emails. Well, the reality is that the NBN is so much more than that. It is not just about sending emails. It is about letting businesses in the remote parts of Blair compete with businesses in the southern parts of the United States or the southern parts of China. It will let Australian businesses compete on the world stage in the niche markets with the products that we do so well, particularly when it comes to setting up a new Switzerland in the south in terms of managing funds. That is a great way by which we can compete, and the NBN is a part of that. I look forward to the next report from the NBN committee and the great news that they are delivering for Australia.


Debate adjourned.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (18:12):  I rise to speak on the Statute Stocktake (Appropriations) Bill (No. 1) 2012. The purpose of this bill is to repeal whole acts and special appropriations that are no longer relevant or in fact are wholly redundant. For example, it repeals old appropriations that have been spent, exhausted or lapsed. The bill therefore is housekeeping in nature. Perhaps the term 'noncontroversial' was coined for this bill. It is the fifth stock-take bill since 1988. It forms part of an ongoing process to clean-up the statute book. Despite the bills title, 'Appropriations', it does not in fact enact any new legislation, nor does it seek to appropriate any funds. If enacted, it would repeal 93 redundant appropriation acts from 1984 to 1999, 35 redundant supply acts from 1984 to 1997 and three acts containing redundant appropriations from the Treasury portfolio, including the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Repeal Act 2006, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Pre-Transfer Contracts) Act 2006 and the Mint Employees Act 1964. The bill also repeals three superannuation related provisions contained in the Superannuation Act 1922 and the Superannuation (Pension Increases) Act, which contain redundant provisions. Megan Shellie, a bright young law student who is currently doing work experience in my office, observed that housekeeping of this nature is indeed a very good thing. She said that this exercise will be of benefit to law students everywhere in reducing the amount of redundant legislation they have to read in the course of their studies. So we have helped law students all over the country, which is a great thing!


The bill's explanatory memorandum states that the bill:


… would also further the Government’s deregulation agenda. The Government has stepped up its deregulation reform program … It is important that continued progress is made by Government.


While this work is worthwhile—and we support the nature of this bill and the removal of all those acts from the statute; it is indeed tidying up—it does not make any material change with regard to easing the regulatory burden on business, as suggested by the explanatory memorandum. It can hardly be described as a feature of a meaningful deregulation agenda to remove some appropriation bill that applied for three years some 20 years ago.


This bill serves to remind us of how the government has failed to honour its key commitments on deregulation. We are reminded of the government's failure to honour its famous so-called 'one in, one out' commitment. Remember that, Madam Deputy Speaker? What a brave statement that was, heralded from one end of the country to the other. The government said it would be the champion of deregulation. That was a commitment to repeal one piece of red tape or regulation for every new piece introduced. I searched throughout this bill. I got quite excited. I thought we were going to see some material deregulation, something that was going to improve the abysmal productivity performance of the economy after five years of this government. Despite a rabid search of this bill, nothing could be found. This commitment to repeal one piece of red tape or regulation for every one piece introduced is not added to in any significant way by this piece of legislation.


The latest analysis by the Parliamentary Library shows that, since coming to office, the government has in fact introduced 18,089 new regulations and has repealed just 86 items—not 18,086 items but 86 items. This would have to be one of the most abysmal failures in terms of promises in the history of the federal parliament, and that is a big stretch when you think of some of the things that have been broken in the last year or two. But the opportunity for deregulation in this bill unfortunately has not been taken up by the government.


We know that, when convenient to do so, the government exempts proposals from regulatory impact statements. It exempted the NBN related legislation. We just had a most eloquent speech from the member for McEwen—I don't think!—on the question of the NBN. What he failed to mention was what will probably be another couple of thousand regulations associated with that white elephant in the end. That is not recorded, of course. It is only the biggest infrastructure project in our history, but it does not rate a mention when it comes to featuring in the budget bottom line or when we look at new regulations that have been added.


This bill, while supported by the coalition, represents another massive missed opportunity for material reform in the area of deregulation—an area of abysmal failure, I am afraid, by this government. Nevertheless, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:19):  I am not prepared to take the word of the member for Goldstein on regulations. He is hardly the most numerate man in the chamber. He is the guy with the $70 billion black hole. I think he was there when the coalition was announcing, during the campaign, their response to the NBN. I think he was there with the member for Casey. There was this extraordinary press conference. They completely fluffed it. In any event—




Mr Haase:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I wish that the member would come back to the point.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  I agree with you. I have been very tolerant. I hope the member for Blair is going to address the bill before us.




Mr NEUMANN:
  I will. The member for Goldstein waxed lyrical in criticism of us. This legislation does what it says it does. It is a stocktake piece of legislation—one of a series of about five—getting rid of 93 appropriation acts from back in the days when Bob Hawke was the Prime Minister in 1984-85 through to the days when John Howard was the Prime Minister in 1998-99. It also gets rid of 35 supply acts from the same period, three acts containing redundant special appropriations from the Treasury portfolio and three provisions on two special appropriations from the Finance portfolio. It does not appropriate any money; it is good housekeeping. It repeals whole items of legislation and special appropriations within acts that are simply otiose. In the circumstances it is worthwhile legislation. We know there is a lapsing—that is, if the money is not allocated at the end of the financial year, the legislation has no force and effect on the appropriation, so there is no loss of federal government money there. 


This legislation is part of a series of statute stocktake bills dating back to 1998—a process to clean out the statute books. We are doing it, and I am pleased that those opposite are supporting it. But all too often they did not do these sorts of things when they were in power, so they can hardly criticise us for doing it. We have stepped up. I think the member for Goldstein criticised us about what we are doing on legislative instruments. We have had a series of amendments introduced by the Attorney-General on the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. These amendments have contributed to getting rid of that tranche of legislation, which is unnecessary and redundant. The Special Minister of State put it well when he said in his second reading speech on 20 June 2012 that the government has stepped up its deregulation reform program, including the progress made at the business advisory forum in May 2012 and the Prime Minister's economic forum in June 2012. I notice that my new premier, Premier Campbell Newman, did not have the grace, humility, determination or credit to attend the forum. He was too busy, he said. Sadly, he was not interested in the deregulation process that we are undertaking. 


I notice a document signed by my friend the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting on Deregulation, who is sitting beside me. It makes reference to what we are doing on deregulation in this legislation—it is streamlined, effective, productive, and it is an annual update on the Australian government's deregulation agenda, which this legislation is part of. The forward to the legislation says what this government is about. What this legislation before the chamber really makes clear is that good quality regulations are key to achieving the Australian government's objectives of improved productivity, increased competitiveness, economic growth and equity. That is what this legislation is about. Regulatory reform is a process. It is an ongoing task. It should be pursued. Legislation such as this is important. We were criticised by the member for Goldstein for removing regulation and for the deregulation process. He should have a look at what we have done in the last 12 months—removing about 12,000 instruments, including a number of instruments that are contained in the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. He should have a look at the fact that there are a further 2,600 instruments under consideration for removal as part of the review process. He should give us credit for actually fixing up things that he did not have the intention and determination to do when his government was in power and when he was a minister and sat on the treasury bench. In the circumstances, I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (18:25):  I take the opportunity to thank members who have contributed to this debate, especially the member for Blair, who always makes a very sensible contribution to these matters. 


The Statute Stocktake (Appropriations) Bill (No.1) 2012 is the fifth statute stocktake bill since 1998, forming part of an ongoing process to clean up the statute book by repealing redundant legislation. This bill also supports the government's deregulation agenda by reducing complexity. The bill repeals 93 redundant appropriation acts from 1984 to 1999, 35 redundant supply acts from 1984 to 1997 and three acts containing redundant special appropriations from the Treasury portfolio. 


The bill also continues to implement the government's response to former Senator Andrew Murray's report of December 2008 entitled Operation sunlight: overhauling budgetary transparency by repealing three superannuation related provisions containing two redundant special appropriations from the finance portfolio. This bill repeals whole acts or special appropriations within acts that are redundant. It does not appropriate any money. In addition to the appropriation acts that will be repealed by this bill, the government is reviewing appropriation acts since the 1999-2000 financial year to determine whether more recent appropriation acts are also redundant and should be repealed. I commend the bill to the House. 


Question agreed to.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-06-26,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (18:12):  I rise to speak on the Statute Stocktake (Appropriations) Bill (No. 1) 2012. The purpose of this bill is to repeal whole acts and special appropriations that are no longer relevant or in fact are wholly redundant. For example, it repeals old appropriations that have been spent, exhausted or lapsed. The bill therefore is housekeeping in nature. Perhaps the term 'noncontroversial' was coined for this bill. It is the fifth stock-take bill since 1988. It forms part of an ongoing process to clean-up the statute book. Despite the bills title, 'Appropriations', it does not in fact enact any new legislation, nor does it seek to appropriate any funds. If enacted, it would repeal 93 redundant appropriation acts from 1984 to 1999, 35 redundant supply acts from 1984 to 1997 and three acts containing redundant appropriations from the Treasury portfolio, including the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Repeal Act 2006, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Pre-Transfer Contracts) Act 2006 and the Mint Employees Act 1964. The bill also repeals three superannuation related provisions contained in the Superannuation Act 1922 and the Superannuation (Pension Increases) Act, which contain redundant provisions. Megan Shellie, a bright young law student who is currently doing work experience in my office, observed that housekeeping of this nature is indeed a very good thing. She said that this exercise will be of benefit to law students everywhere in reducing the amount of redundant legislation they have to read in the course of their studies. So we have helped law students all over the country, which is a great thing!


The bill's explanatory memorandum states that the bill:


… would also further the Government’s deregulation agenda. The Government has stepped up its deregulation reform program … It is important that continued progress is made by Government.


While this work is worthwhile—and we support the nature of this bill and the removal of all those acts from the statute; it is indeed tidying up—it does not make any material change with regard to easing the regulatory burden on business, as suggested by the explanatory memorandum. It can hardly be described as a feature of a meaningful deregulation agenda to remove some appropriation bill that applied for three years some 20 years ago.


This bill serves to remind us of how the government has failed to honour its key commitments on deregulation. We are reminded of the government's failure to honour its famous so-called 'one in, one out' commitment. Remember that, Madam Deputy Speaker? What a brave statement that was, heralded from one end of the country to the other. The government said it would be the champion of deregulation. That was a commitment to repeal one piece of red tape or regulation for every new piece introduced. I searched throughout this bill. I got quite excited. I thought we were going to see some material deregulation, something that was going to improve the abysmal productivity performance of the economy after five years of this government. Despite a rabid search of this bill, nothing could be found. This commitment to repeal one piece of red tape or regulation for every one piece introduced is not added to in any significant way by this piece of legislation.


The latest analysis by the Parliamentary Library shows that, since coming to office, the government has in fact introduced 18,089 new regulations and has repealed just 86 items—not 18,086 items but 86 items. This would have to be one of the most abysmal failures in terms of promises in the history of the federal parliament, and that is a big stretch when you think of some of the things that have been broken in the last year or two. But the opportunity for deregulation in this bill unfortunately has not been taken up by the government.


We know that, when convenient to do so, the government exempts proposals from regulatory impact statements. It exempted the NBN related legislation. We just had a most eloquent speech from the member for McEwen—I don't think!—on the question of the NBN. What he failed to mention was what will probably be another couple of thousand regulations associated with that white elephant in the end. That is not recorded, of course. It is only the biggest infrastructure project in our history, but it does not rate a mention when it comes to featuring in the budget bottom line or when we look at new regulations that have been added.


This bill, while supported by the coalition, represents another massive missed opportunity for material reform in the area of deregulation—an area of abysmal failure, I am afraid, by this government. Nevertheless, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:19):  I am not prepared to take the word of the member for Goldstein on regulations. He is hardly the most numerate man in the chamber. He is the guy with the $70 billion black hole. I think he was there when the coalition was announcing, during the campaign, their response to the NBN. I think he was there with the member for Casey. There was this extraordinary press conference. They completely fluffed it. In any event—




Mr Haase:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I wish that the member would come back to the point.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  I agree with you. I have been very tolerant. I hope the member for Blair is going to address the bill before us.




Mr NEUMANN:
  I will. The member for Goldstein waxed lyrical in criticism of us. This legislation does what it says it does. It is a stocktake piece of legislation—one of a series of about five—getting rid of 93 appropriation acts from back in the days when Bob Hawke was the Prime Minister in 1984-85 through to the days when John Howard was the Prime Minister in 1998-99. It also gets rid of 35 supply acts from the same period, three acts containing redundant special appropriations from the Treasury portfolio and three provisions on two special appropriations from the Finance portfolio. It does not appropriate any money; it is good housekeeping. It repeals whole items of legislation and special appropriations within acts that are simply otiose. In the circumstances it is worthwhile legislation. We know there is a lapsing—that is, if the money is not allocated at the end of the financial year, the legislation has no force and effect on the appropriation, so there is no loss of federal government money there. 


This legislation is part of a series of statute stocktake bills dating back to 1998—a process to clean out the statute books. We are doing it, and I am pleased that those opposite are supporting it. But all too often they did not do these sorts of things when they were in power, so they can hardly criticise us for doing it. We have stepped up. I think the member for Goldstein criticised us about what we are doing on legislative instruments. We have had a series of amendments introduced by the Attorney-General on the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. These amendments have contributed to getting rid of that tranche of legislation, which is unnecessary and redundant. The Special Minister of State put it well when he said in his second reading speech on 20 June 2012 that the government has stepped up its deregulation reform program, including the progress made at the business advisory forum in May 2012 and the Prime Minister's economic forum in June 2012. I notice that my new premier, Premier Campbell Newman, did not have the grace, humility, determination or credit to attend the forum. He was too busy, he said. Sadly, he was not interested in the deregulation process that we are undertaking. 


I notice a document signed by my friend the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting on Deregulation, who is sitting beside me. It makes reference to what we are doing on deregulation in this legislation—it is streamlined, effective, productive, and it is an annual update on the Australian government's deregulation agenda, which this legislation is part of. The forward to the legislation says what this government is about. What this legislation before the chamber really makes clear is that good quality regulations are key to achieving the Australian government's objectives of improved productivity, increased competitiveness, economic growth and equity. That is what this legislation is about. Regulatory reform is a process. It is an ongoing task. It should be pursued. Legislation such as this is important. We were criticised by the member for Goldstein for removing regulation and for the deregulation process. He should have a look at what we have done in the last 12 months—removing about 12,000 instruments, including a number of instruments that are contained in the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. He should have a look at the fact that there are a further 2,600 instruments under consideration for removal as part of the review process. He should give us credit for actually fixing up things that he did not have the intention and determination to do when his government was in power and when he was a minister and sat on the treasury bench. In the circumstances, I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (18:25):  I take the opportunity to thank members who have contributed to this debate, especially the member for Blair, who always makes a very sensible contribution to these matters. 


The Statute Stocktake (Appropriations) Bill (No.1) 2012 is the fifth statute stocktake bill since 1998, forming part of an ongoing process to clean up the statute book by repealing redundant legislation. This bill also supports the government's deregulation agenda by reducing complexity. The bill repeals 93 redundant appropriation acts from 1984 to 1999, 35 redundant supply acts from 1984 to 1997 and three acts containing redundant special appropriations from the Treasury portfolio.
