Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:08):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment, I present the committee's advisory report on the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012, incorporating additional comments and a dissenting report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms RISHWORTH:
  On 16 February 2012, the House Selection Committee referred the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012 to the employment and education committee for inquiry and report. The bill was introduced by the member for Melbourne, who was subsequently appointed to the committee for the purposes of this inquiry. The inquiry received 23 submissions from employee and employer groups, carer organisations and others with an interest in flexible arrangements in Australian workplaces. On 23 March, the committee held a public hearing in Canberra to explore some of the themes raised in submissions with stakeholders as well as with the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.


The bill proposes substantive and formal changes to the current right to request flexible working arrangements. The substantive changes to the right to request include: increasing the scope of the right to request flexible working arrangements to all national system employees; increasing the scope of arrangements that define a carer in relation to requests for flexible working arrangements; and strengthening the grounds required to refuse a request for flexible working arrangements for the purposes of caring from 'reasonable business grounds' to 'serious countervailing business grounds'. The bill also proposes empowering Fair Work Australia to make flexible working arrangements orders and provides for the imposition of penalties on parties that fail to implement these orders.


Submissions to the inquiry were divided on whether they supported or opposed the proposed extension of the right to request flexible working arrangements. These arrangements are currently subject to a number of reviews outlined in the report. These include an independent review of the Fair Work Act 2009 and a consultation by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations on expanding the right to request flexible working arrangements under the National Carer Recognition Framework. Additionally, the General Manager of Fair Work Australia is currently conducting research into the extent to which individual flexibility arrangements under modern awards and enterprise agreements are being agreed to, and the content of those arrangements; and the operation of the provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to employee requests.


I note that, while the majority of members of the committee agreed with the principles outlined in the bill, the committee has recommended that the bill not be considered until the results of these reviews and government responses are released.


As well as extending the right to request flexible working arrangements, the bill proposes to alter the formal status of the right by removing these provisions from the National Employment Standards. Only one organisation provided evidence to the inquiry that supported the proposed removal of the right to request flexible working arrangements from the National Employment Standards. Others either questioned or opposed this element of the bill. I understand the member for Melbourne has provided additional comments on the purpose of such a change. However, there was considerable argument against the proposed removal of flexible working arrangements from the National Employment Standards. That was certainly a concern of government members of the committee.


The National Employment Standards set out clear minimum conditions that must apply to employees and it is appropriate that the right to request flexible working arrangements is included. This was the view held by government members of the committee. The inclusion of the right to request, as a minimum condition of employment, contributes to an awareness that benefits both employees and employers. Removal of the right to request would also mean that agreed individual flexible working arrangements could be overridden by a collective enterprise agriculture agreement—a situation described by the Ai Group as 'counterintuitive'.


In closing, I thank all those who provided evidence to the inquiry for making the trip to Canberra and my committee colleagues for the work they put into it. I also note the work done by the secretariat, in particular Glenn Worthington. I thank them for their input and I commend the report to the House.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (10:13):  I rise to speak on the advisory report of the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012 as proposed by the member for Melbourne. The coalition members—the members for McPherson, Aston and I—of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment support the recommendation of the committee and recognise the views of some, at least, who gave evidence to the committee that they support some action in this area. We were keen to point out that, whilst supporting the recommendation, we do not necessarily endorse the general thrust of the legislation, which is to pass further enforceable responsibilities onto the employers. Further, we are of the opinion that better results will be achieved if employers are encouraged to work in a cooperative fashion with their employees rather than engaging in an environment of confrontation by government regulation enforcing particular outcomes.


To that extent, we took some note of the evidence given by the Australian Industry Group where, firstly, they discussed the conditions in the economy that are affecting business and placing many under strain at the moment. Australian industry perspective business conditions are very tough under the two-speed economy. Mr Callahan went on to say:


Costs of doing business are highly significant at the moment. In the context of this bill before the parliament I think it is important that members take that on board from the perspective of our concern, in particular, that other jobs are potentially under threat at the moment and it is a very difficult time for doing business in Australia.


He went on to say:


The right to request provisions, in their current form, are a very important feature of the act as they encourage cooperation though open dialogue between employees and their employers about achieving meaningful flexibility in the workplace that works on both a personal level for the employee and an operational level for the employer. Unfortunately, the bill as it currently stands would undermine this very important principle and purpose.


The coalition members were concerned that this bill may bring about further confrontation in the workforce and, in that case, be counterproductive to a good outcome. Mr Callahan went on to say: 


We believe that the right to request flexible working arrangements as it currently exists under the Fair Work Act is effectively fulfilling the government's intention and we have not identified any problems necessitating a change to the act in this regard.


He also said: 'It would convert a facilitative mechanism that encourages open dialogue at the workplace into an adversarial mechanism.'


We also took evidence from Carers Australia which would somewhat confirm this opinion. In fact, the possibility of this legislation becoming a new point of conflict between employers and employees was conceded by Carers Australia, who showed a preference for a cooperative approach rather than compulsion. They said that, if the legislation is passed, it may become an effective disincentive to employing people from groupings more likely to have caring responsibilities.


We do support the recommendation, because it defers action at this stage, but the driving force behind that is that we do not necessarily accept that this is the correct way to engage with carers, and the people they care for, for the employers. We do not have a special confidence in the Fair Work review. Our concerns with the Fair Work review are that it will not go to some of the things that are affecting conflict in the workplace at the moment in a broader view—not, in particular, with this situation with carers but that the Fair Work review may have some deficiency. But we are more than prepared to wait and see what it says and what the government's reaction to that review is.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (10:19):   I move:


That this House:


(1) calls on Australian parliamentarians to endorse the Global Parliamentarian Declaration on the Arms Trade Treaty;


(2) recognises:


(a) that the poor regulation of arms:


(i) results in tens-of-thousands of lives needlessly lost every year;


(ii) undermines peace and peace building processes, human security, poverty reduction initiatives, and prospects for sustainable socioeconomic development; and


(iii) facilitates gender-based violence against women who disproportionately endure the indirect, longer-term consequences of armed conflict; and


(b) the immediate need for a legally binding international agreement on the regulation of the global trade in arms;


(3) congratulates successive Australian governments for their demonstrated commitment to an internationally binding arms trade treaty; and


(4) calls on the Australian Government to continue strong advocacy for an international arms trade treaty at the upcoming United Nations negotiations on the matter in July 2012.


It is difficult to overstate the devastating effect of illicit weapons on individuals and communities around the world. In fact, it is estimated that 1,500 people are killed each day from conflict and armed violence. Incredibly, around 12 billion bullets are produced every year—that is about two for every person on the planet.


Part of the problem is that the multibillion dollar global trade in arms is largely unregulated. As Amnesty International and Oxfam Australia have noted in a letter to all MPs and senators, the trade in arms is more poorly regulated than the trade in bananas or coffee. Weapons are often traded irresponsibly between countries, with no consideration of whether they will be used to commit human rights abuses or diverted to those who will.


In the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, for example, weapons continue to pour into the country despite clear evidence of human rights abuses, fuelling ongoing conflict and human suffering—weapons are diverted to war lords, women are raped at gunpoint and children are recruited as soldiers. In the DRC the asking price for an AK-47 is reported to be just US$50.


Most human rights violations are not committed with tanks or other heavy artillery; they involve small arms and light weapons. In small communities, such as in the Pacific, it is easy to imagine that just one armed gunman could hold a whole village hostage.


During July, UN member states will meet to negotiate a new treaty to regulate international transfers of conventional weapons. The purpose of the treaty is not to limit or reduce legitimate arms transfers but, rather, to prevent irresponsible transfers by requiring states to undertake risk assessments of each transfer to determine if they will be used to commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or seriously impair poverty reduction or socio-economic development. This is the fundamental purpose of the treaty, and specific criteria achieving this must be included in the treaty text.


A robust treaty should include all types of conventional arms, including small arms and light weapons, and ammunition. Ammunition is likely to be a sticking point, particularly for the US, which argues that it is too onerous to track. However, ammunition must be included in the scope of the treaty. Some weapons, such as the AK-47, are virtually indestructible. So their use continues for decades, by one group after the next as they are traded around, because ammunition for them is readily available. The treaty should also cover all types of trade activity, including transhipments, brokering and gifting. Critically, the treaty should be legally binding and require national implementation with clear reporting provisions.


Successive Australian governments have strongly supported the establishment of a robust treaty. Australia has co-authored every United Nations resolution on an arms trade treaty since 2006 and has played an active role as Friend of the Chair. Australia has advocated widely for the arms trade treaty in the Pacific, the Caribbean and Africa. I encourage the Australian government delegation, led by Foreign Minister Carr, to continue to champion a robust, comprehensive and legally binding instrument. There is no doubt that negotiating this treaty in four weeks is an ambitious task. However, considering the staggering impact irresponsible arms transfers have on humanity, there is certainly an urgent need for a positive outcome. And, where there's a will, there's a way.


The deepening crisis in Syria is indeed a poignant reminder of the critical need for an arms trade treaty. Amnesty International's latest report on Syria, Deadly reprisals, provides further evidence that deliberate and unlawful killings are part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population, are carried out in an organised manner and as part of state policy, and therefore amount to crimes against humanity. And yet some nations, such as Russia, continue to ship weapons to Syria, despite the high risk they will be used to commit atrocities.


The international community now has a historic opportunity to negotiate a treaty that will prevent weapons getting into the wrong hands and could save hundreds of thousands of lives. I would like to pay tribute to Amnesty International and Oxfam Australia for their campaign to raise awareness and support within the community and among parliamentarians. I note the briefings conducted by Amnesty International last week in the parliament on this subject. I also note and welcome the efforts of the Parliamentarians for Global Action, or PGA, to promote the new treaty as one of its major campaigns, including asking parliamentarians to sign the Global Parliamentarian Declaration on the Arms Trade Treaty. So far, more than 1,500 parliamentarians from all over the world, including more than 50 Australian federal MPs and senators, have signed the declaration.


I thank colleagues for their support of this important arms trade treaty that will play a role in promoting regional and global security and save tens of thousands of lives needlessly lost each year.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (10:24):  Yes, I second the motion. I am appreciative of the opportunity to speak on this important motion and I thank the member for Fremantle for bringing it to the attention of this parliament today. Each day the scourge of war directly affects millions across the globe. Countless more continue to suffer the indirect effects, decades after conflicts subside, through human rights abuses, poverty and human trafficking. Weapons are more easily finding their way into the hands of non-state actors, fuelling decades-long conflicts and creating new ones. The toll on civilians continues to rise with each passing year, and women and children are disproportionally affected as existing inequities are magnified and they are exposed to sexual violence and exploitation.


Whilst the causes of each conflict are complex, there is a simple truth: wars require weapons. Limiting the flow of arms into conflict regions would help stem violence. But, unfortunately, arms easily find their way though because the trade has very little regulation. In fact, regulations applying to bananas are greater than those applying to the global arms trade.


To remedy this situation, from 2 to 27 July, the United Nations will host discussions for a global arms trade treaty. The treaty is the culmination of six years of investigation and has involved extensive consultations with countries and non-governmental organisations. I am also pleased to say that the treaty has had strong bipartisan support though successive Australian governments.


The arms trade treaty is intended to outlaw the transfer of arms if there is a substantial risk they could be used in breaching international humanitarian law, be diverted from the legitimately intended recipient, affect regional security or be used by terrorist networks. A revolutionary and welcome aspect of this agreement is its broad scope; covering all weapons, transfer types and transactions. That means any weapon, from helicopter gunships to handguns, will be covered. Transfer types will include import, export, temporary transfer, state sanctioned, commercial transactions, technology transfer, plus so-called gifts and aid; and transactions will also cover brokers and dealers, whether state-sponsored or not.


While there is strong support for the treaty in general, Amnesty International is urging parliamentarians across the world to show their support and ensure that the substance of the treaty is not watered down during the upcoming negotiation process, as so often happens. Last week the Parliamentary Friends of Amnesty was privileged to host Widney Brown, Amnesty International Global Director of International Law and Policy, who outlined the status of the negotiations and the issues still to be resolved. Of particular concern are calls to remove ammunition and technology transfer from the treaty. Some countries have objected to ammunition on the basis that it is too hard to track. But it was pointed out that Australia already has a system tracking its ammunition, and there is no reason why other countries could not adopt a similar process.


The restriction on technology transfer ensures that a more recent and disturbing trend is stamped out. It has come to the attention of Amnesty that in order to bypass arms embargoes, weapons factories are being built in conflict regions. Such factories intensify conflict though easy access to arms, destabilise regions and place even more women and children in danger. The process should be stopped and must certainly remain an area regulated by this treaty.


In conclusion, I would urge all members of this place to sign the Global Parliamentarian Declaration on the Arms Trade Treaty. Once again, I would like to thank Widney Brown and Amnesty for their continued advocacy on this important treaty, and thank the member for Fremantle for moving this motion in this place today.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (12:52):  by leave—I rise today to recognise the recent retirement of Mr Michael John Palmer AO, APM from his role as the Inspector of Transport Security, a role he has discharged admirably since his appointment in 2004. I also table the most recent report from Mr Palmer, the Offshore oil and gas resources sector security inquiry, which I received on 7 June 2012.




OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES SECTOR SECURITY INQUIRY



Firstly, I would like to take some time to discuss this important report which I announced in February last year. I have previously updated the House on the importance of this inquiry—the first-ever comprehensive review of the security of the oil and gas sector that employs more than 10,000 Australians, contributes 2.5 per cent of Australia's GDP and generates an impressive $28 billion in revenue. 


The reserves in the north-west of Australia, the Bass Strait and the Timor Sea provide employment for our nation, income for our economy and energy to the world. In fact, Australia is the world's ninth largest energy producer.


We need to ensure that we have effective security arrangements in place and the right response capabilities in the event of an incident or attack on offshore oil and gas exploration and production infrastructure. This is all the more important as current and future exploration continues to push out into deeper and more distant waters to satisfy the increasing worldwide demand for oil and gas resources. 


The report is thorough—drawing on detailed input and consultation with state and territory governments, industry and peak bodies such as the board of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA). Indeed, industry's input was critical to the development of this report and I would like to thank them for their generous and honest interactions and contributions. Simply put, the report would not be of the quality it is today without the access, aid and assistance they provided. 


With the sector's assistance, Mr Palmer and his team undertook extensive Australian and international consultation to better understand, review and assess security planning and preparedness, recruitment, training, government and industry interaction, command and control arrangements, response capacity and clarity, and communication and information-sharing arrangements in the oil and gas resources sector environment.


In preparing the report, the team conducted 31 offshore and onshore visits and over 50 consultations in Australia as well as eight offshore and onshore site visits and 45 consultations internationally. These spanned Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland, the Bass Strait, and the Joint Petroleum Development Area in the Timor Sea through to site visits organised by the United States Coast Guard to facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. 


The inquiry also benefited from a legal framework, research and discussion paper prepared by the University of Queensland, which was considered as part of the preparation of this inquiry report, informing the inquiry on the current and relevant international and Australian maritime law. The final result is an impressive depth of inquiry for an important issue—with 10 detailed recommendations spanning issues ranging from onsite security audits and inspections, security access, exercise and exclusion zones through to government and industry interaction and relationships, incident response and, importantly in the current computer age, cybersecurity. In addition to the recommendations, the report details possible options in response to the recommendations raised. 


Furthermore, drawing upon the learnings from the offshore and international consultations, the report details a further 10 possible approaches for consideration, based on United States, North Sea and our own experiences as to what has worked successfully and what could be improved. In summary, the report highlights an important point. We can be confident that our security measures are international best practice. 


However, it also highlights areas where current security related practices and arrangements could be improved, and it suggests options which will warrant further consideration by government. I thank Mr Palmer for his work on this important issue and for his detailed report, which I table for members and commend members to read in detail.




RETIREMENT OF THE INSPECTOR OF TRANSPORT SECURITY 



While thanking Mr Palmer I would also like to acknowledge his wider contribution. For those who may not be aware, Mr Palmer is a 35-year career police professional. He brought to this report and to his role as the Inspector of Transport Security extensive experience in policy leadership and reform in the community, national and international policing sector. It is a difficult role, requiring the investigation of transport security matters, including major transport incidents, or, where necessary, patterns of incidents which may indicate possible weaknesses in our transport security systems. It is also a position that requires significant vision to proactively identify where transport security arrangements could be further improved. And Mr Palmer has done so with distinction. 


It has certainly been a busy time during his tenure, during which a number of very important inquiries were undertaken, in addition to the offshore inquiry. His work included the surface transport security assessment, theSydney Airport security screening review, and the ferry security inquiry. Of particular importance was Mr Palmer's international piracy and armed robbery at sea security inquiry, which looked into the worldwide issue of maritime piracy and armed robbery at sea, and considered the effectiveness of security arrangements of Australian ships in light of this threat. This work has directly resulted in Australia making a significant contribution to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime Counter-Piracy Program. Indeed, the report has been used by a number of nations when developing their response to piracy and has ensured that Australia has in place an appropriate security framework to deal with maritime threats. Of course, these inquires—past and current—were in addition to his inquires conducted for other portfolios such as the inquiry into the circumstances of the immigration detention of Cornelia Rau and more recently the Risdon Prison Complex inquiry, undertaken for the Tasmanian government.


Mr Palmer's contribution to Australia goes beyond his most recent work inquiring into matters of national importance. I mentioned he has had 35 years as a police professional; a career which started as a member of the Northern Territory Police in 1963 where he served Territorians for 16 years. In 1983, after having acted as barrister at law in Queensland, he returned to the Territory as a commissioned officer, before being promoted to Commissioner of the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services in 1988. It was also at this time that he received the Australian Police Medal.


In 1997, he was selected as the member for Asia to the Interpol Executive Committee where he served for three years. Here he worked as part of the executive committee to supervise the delivery of the decisions of the Interpol General Assembly and prepare the agenda and program of work for the general assembly's consideration. It was also during this period that he was rightly recognised for his work in introducing far-reaching anticorruption processes in the Australian Federal Police, receiving the Officer of the Order of Australia in 1998. It was of no surprise that upon his return he was promoted, this time to commissioner in the Australian Federal Police, where he served for a further seven years.


Finally, before taking up the role as Inspector of Transport Security, he worked for a number of years as a private consultant and as an associate professor at Charles Sturt University's Australian Graduate School of Policing, providing a valuable opportunity to pass on his wealth of knowledge and insight into both the law and law enforcement to the next generation of leaders. Indeed, his academic pursuits have been notable, from being conferred a Doctor of Letters for his advancement of policing to his extensive writing on modern police practices, including as the co-editor of the authoritative law enforcement text, Police Leadership in Australasia.


In closing, it is always very sad to lose from this position such a wealth of experience and judgment. However, I am pleased to note that he will continue to contribute to public life through his ongoing work in the human rights and not-for-profit sector, and through future engagements in the public and private sectors. 


I sincerely thank Mick Palmer for his many decades of service to the safety of the nation and wish him all the very best in his future endeavours.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Wide Bay to speak for 9½ minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Truss (Leader of The Nationals) speaking for a period not exceeding nine and a half minutes.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-06-25,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (13:03):  Protecting Australia's $28-billion-a-year oil and gas industry is vital for Australia's future energy security. As the minister notes, the industry employs some 10,000 Australians across the country and accounts for 2.5 per cent of Australia's GDP. Offshore oil and gas production provides a major input into our economy and its infrastructure is of critical national importance. There are around 170 oil and gas production platforms in operation around the Australian coast from the Timor Sea, the North West Shelf to the Bass Strait.


Australia's gas production for domestic and export markets continues to increase every year. However, petroleum liquids production is still falling. In 2000-01 Australia produced 272.4 million barrels of petroleum liquids. By 2009-10, this had fallen to 186.9 million barrels. There is further scope for exploration and appraisal drilling to address the growing demand for petroleum liquids. While Australia accounts for approximately 0.6 per cent of world oil supply and 1.5 per cent of worldwide demand, oil and natural gas accounts for nearly 56 per cent of primary energy consumed in Australia. In fact, Australia is the ninth largest energy producer in the world.


With the rise in international piracy and the threat of terrorism, it is certainly timely to revisit the security requirements in place to protect our offshore oil and gas assets. I note from the minister's summary of the report being tabled today that he said we can be confident that our security measures are international best practice. However, I am alarmed to read in the report:


… it is understood no on-site offshore facility security assessments have been conducted since 2007.


That is indeed an alarming gap. It suggests the gaping security assessment gap is indeed real. Indeed, the report highlights and recommends:


In the opinion of the Inquiry, the current Australian situation is unsatisfactory and arrangements should be implemented which provide the capacity for an effective offshore security audit program to be introduced and maintained.


What in fact is happening—to use the minister's words—is best practice in the world is indeed at risk. That is hardly world's best practice. If asylum seeker boats can turn up every day, often unobserved, it is clear that our security is as open as a sieve. 


In recent years, pirates have been involved in unsuccessful attempts to attack and take over an oil rig off the coast of Nigeria with a firefight erupting between the Nigerian Navy and the pirates. As the minister has noted before, while there is no suggestion of a particular threat against any specific oil and gas platform, vigilance is essential.






It is clear that any potential security threat would be extremely damaging to our national economy and affect our energy security. I refer the minister to today's report finding:


While within Victoria and Western Australia relevant state police engage on a regular basis in joint exercises with industry on near-shore offshore facilities, it is understood that no Commonwealth agency has participated in such exercises since about 2004.


There are other unsatisfactory findings. The report stipulates:


Industry has emphasised the constructive relationship it generally enjoys with government agencies. There is, however, common agreement that increased engagement between industry and government security agencies, aimed at enhancing mutual levels of understanding—industries' knowledge of the intelligence gathering, analysis and dissemination processes of government and government's knowledge and expertise of industry—in the security space, is necessary.


Moreover:


While this initiative will make a positive contribution to the improvement of the nature and quality of intelligence sharing and the interaction between government and industry, the broader current levels of engagement and communication would benefit from further and ongoing improvement …


The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), which were already playing a constructive role in government and industry relationships through the publications of the Business Liaison Unit (BLU), have been quick to recognise and react to these industry concerns and an industry roundtable was convened by them in Canberra during March 2012 to specifically address the primary matters of concern.


In terms of security shortfalls relating to recruitment, the report finds:


The vetting of Australian employees as part of the application process for a MSIC generally comprises a criminal-record check, as well as internal company checks deemed appropriate. Industry sees the MSIC process as providing an additional layer of security vetting above the level they can provide themselves.


However, although the MISC vetting process provides a security assessment and a photographic record of an individual employee, the process is limited. Currently, the requirement for a MSIC does not apply to foreign nationals or to Australian and other workers engaged on non-regulated vessels operating under subcontract arrangements.


Clearly, as the report finds, much more needs to be done.


The coalition will always support sensible moves to enhance our maritime security regime. The coalition has a history of proposing and supporting sensible measures to enhance our maritime security regime and, in this case, the security of our offshore oil and gas assets. For example, in 2005 it was a coalition amendment to the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 that required operators to write and follow security plans, including security risk assessments and preventative strategies to manage risk.


The coalition notes the report and is extremely concerned about the gaping holes in Australia's offshore oil and gas resources security. The coalition has a record of securing Australia's borders and strengthening security requirements across the maritime industry including our offshore oil and gas assets. There appears, from this report, to have been serious lapses since 2007. It is not satisfactory at all—let alone, the world's best practice.


Finally, like the minister, I would like to pay tribute to the outgoing Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Michael Palmer as he completed his term on 7 June this year. He has served with distinction not only in his most recent role but in an outstanding, career of service and dedication. He served in his current position as Inspector of Transport Security during the whole time I was transport minister, and I admired his dedication and commitment.


As the minister noted, Mr Palmer is a decorated policeman of 35 years service, winning the Australian Police Medal in 1988. He started out with the Northern Territory police in 1963 where he served for 16 years. Then, after a stint as barrister-at-law in Queensland, he went back to the Territory in 1983, this time as a commissioned officer. He was duly promoted to the rank of Commissioner of the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services in 1988. He became the Member for Asia, as the minister said, in the Interpol Executive Committee in 1997.


It was during this time that Mr Palmer was one of the architects of the Australian Federal Police's anti-corruption provisions. This earned him an Officer of the Order of Australia award in 1998. I could go on, but let me thank him for his exemplary service and, in particular, the last seven in his role as Inspector of Transport Security. He leaves with the best wishes and respect of all who have served and worked with him, and the coalition wishes him well for the future. His extensive career background gave great authority to his reports.


Finally, I also take the opportunity to welcome Mr Andy Hughes, who took up the post of Inspector of Transport Security from 8 June. Mr Hughes is also an experienced police officer. He has served in the AFP, including in the senior executive service, and was the Chief Police Officer for the ACT, as well as being in charge of national operations and international operations for the AFP. He was the commissioner of the Fiji Police Force and spent two years with the United Nations as the police adviser on peacekeeping internationally. As Mr Palmer has observed, Mr Hughes comes ideally equipped for the position, and I wish him well in the new role.

 (Parramatta) (13:13):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee's advisory report on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012, together with the dissenting report and the minutes of proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms OWENS:
  by leave—The Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 makes consequential administrative changes to support the tax rate changes in the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. In particular, the bill sets withholding rates so that the correct amounts are withheld and are available for payment under the second bill at a later date. The substantive provisions of the bill are in schedule 1. It replicates exactly the provisions in schedule 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the third bill. The third bill was one of four bills that the committee examined in its last advisory report, tabled on Monday, 18 June 2012. In this inquiry the committee received submissions on this issue and took evidence from key stakeholders—in particular, the Financial Services Council, the Property Council and the Treasury. The committee concluded that all four bills should proceed. The referral of the bill is in effect requesting the committee to repeat its previous inquiry. The committee sees no constructive benefit in this, given that the circumstances are much the same as when the committee tabled its report a week ago. The committee reiterates its previous recommendation that the House pass the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 as proposed.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (13:15):  by leave—I rise to make a statement in connection with the Economics Standing Committee advisory report on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012.


Liberal members of the committee have lodged a dissenting report in relation to this bill. It is curious that this report, as the chair of the committee outlined, reflects on a bill that was before the committee only a matter of weeks ago and which the committee has already reported on. Mindful of that, the Liberal members of the committee have made dissenting comments that highlight our concern that perceptions about the sovereign risk in Australia are founded in reason—because this government does not know whether it is Arthur or Martha. That goes very directly to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012.


The government originally announced they were reducing the rate from 30 per cent down to 7½ per cent. Then they announced in the budget that they were increasing the rate from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. Then they decided to withdraw and leave it at 7½ per cent, before introducing this bill, which puts it back up to 15 per cent. Is it any wonder at all that people are confused about what this government is up to? Is it any wonder that as Liberal members of the committee we stand steadfastly opposed not only to the impact of the bill itself but also to the very process of in-again, out-again, on-again, off-again, that this government has adopted with respect to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and, more broadly, with respect to withholding taxes are generally?


We stand by our concerns as raised in the previous dissenting report of the committee. We also highlight that there were some robust criticisms of Treasury modelling and of the comparison rate chart that was put forward by Treasury and tabled and lodged with the committee secretariat and raised by, for example, the Property Council of Australia.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (13:17):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work ( Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. It is interesting that it took the government only 10 days to announce this legislation, but only after the Leader of the Opposition had announced the coalition's Better Plan for Accountability and Transparency for Registered Organisations. It is flattering that Labor has sought to emulate the stance that had been articulated by the Leader of the Opposition, but, as usual, Labor's plan is lacking in a number of key areas: it still sees Fair Work Australia in control of investigating registered organisations; it does not expressly provide Fair Work Australia with the ability to cooperate with police; the requirements and penalties are still not in line with the Corporations Act; and it has no reporting mechanism on why investigations are going overtime.


The coalition's plan, on the other hand, seeks to make sure that members of registered organisations can be assured that their money is being used for the right things and for their interests. There are rules to ensure that companies and their boards of directors do the right thing—the same rules should apply to registered organisations and their officers. Our plan seeks to ensure that registered organisations and their officers are as accountable and transparent as companies and their directors, and that we have a level playing field where we ensure that everybody plays by the same rules. It is clear from the experience with the HSU that Fair Work Australia is not up to the job of making sure that registered organisations do the right thing—it is either a model of incompetence or is engaging—or has engaged in—a deliberate and overt go-slow to protect the government.


The coalition's plan proposes to remove from Fair Work Australia both the investigative and the compliance powers over registered organisations and give those powers instead to a new, genuinely independent body, which will be called the Registered Organisations Commission. The Registered Organisations Commission will have stronger powers. It will be tasked with acting quickly and efficiently and will be required to cooperate with other law enforcement agencies where it is in the interests of the public to do so.


By contrast, in this bill and under Labor's proposed changes Fair Work Australia would continue to be responsible for registered organisations. Under the government's plan, former union bosses are going to regulate union bosses. It is akin to putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. The rules and requirements which would apply as a result of the proposed changes are still significantly weaker than those currently applicable to company directors. Company directors are subject to 697 federal and state provisions that impose legal liabilities, including massive fines and jail time. 


While the penalties proposed in the bill are in line with other civil penalties in the Fair Work Act, they still fall considerably short of those required under the Corporations Act. It is the disjointed and inconsistent nature of this regulation that creates opportunities for people to find loopholes. This is disappointing but also expected of this government.


Under the coalition's plan, the penalties would be the same across the board, whether for union bosses or company directors. It is worth noting that we can enforce penalties all we like but, at the end of the day, it is individual behavioural systems that let the everybody down. This point was highlighted in an article by Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks when he said:


Those who believe that liberal democracy and the free market can be defended by the force of law and regulation alone, without an internalised sense of duty and morality, are tragically mistaken.


As we discussed in earlier debates today, that rings very true. In a perfect world, citizens would be more aware of their 'moral' responsibility; however, as we all know, this is not necessarily the case.


While this bill seeks to expand police cooperation powers, it does not clearly state that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that we get clarity on whether there will be cooperation in this area. There is also no express provision to allow Fair Work Australia to provide a brief of evidence to the DPP when it is important to give express powers to allow this to happen. This is a bill designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses that sees former union bosses as the 'cops on the beat'. It is a weak bill that does not go far enough and we call on the government to support the common-sense amendments that we will be proposing.


These amendments will include: to give specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence; to ensure that the investigation is conducted by Fair Work Australia, not outsourced entirely, as this bill would allow; to ensure that the disclosure of how money is spent is provided to Fair Work Australia as well as to union members; to have reports to parliament on why investigations are taking so long, when the investigations last for more than a year, and then every six months thereafter; to make the provision relating to police cooperation very clear so that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police at the commencement, during and at the conclusion of an investigation; and to increase the penalties for misusing members' funds, in line with the Corporations Act. At the end of the day these bills and the penalties imposed should not be compromised to keep union bosses happy. They should be designed to protect everyday working Australians that fund these unions in the first place.


In terms of the case with the HSU, it is disgraceful to see health workers' money being spent for personal purposes by union bosses and employees. Our health workers, who look after our ageing population, work with the disabled and support the sick, are not usually rolling in dough. They work hard to pay their bills and pay their unions to represent their best interests. If I were part of this workforce paying union dues, I would be outraged by the recent reports in the media about what has gone on and the outrageous, unauthorised expenditure of union funds. It is because of this investigation that we stand here today debating this proposed legislation. We have maintained all along that the process Fair Work Australia has undertaken on this investigation was severely lacking. The final report that was produced had 1,200 pages, with many pertaining to the former secretary of the HSU.


We will not oppose this bill but will seek to apply sensible amendments to make it work better in everybody's interests, as we agree that something needs to be done to ensure that money being paid by members to registered organisations is used for proper purposes. As previously stated, and as usual, the coalition have a better plan and we will seek to improve the proposed legislation by making the amendments I referred to earlier.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-06-25,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:25):  It is obvious, as a number of members have already made clear in their contributions to this debate, that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 is a response to some pretty concerning allegations that have been made in recent times about expenditure of union money in this country. There should be a fundamental principle that applies whatever your union, and that is that members' funds are spent for the advancement of members' interests.


Unions are one of the few organisations that we have left in this country where members are able to exercise some very real control over the direction of their organisation and who runs it. You will find more democracy and control in a union than you will find in a publicly listed or a privately listed company or in many incorporated associations. It is a fundamental principle of unions, but it of course relies on members being properly informed about what happens in their union, including in their union leadership.


To the extent that this bill aims to provide members of unions with more information about what is happening in their own organisations, we are supportive of the intent of the bill. We note that the ACTU, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, also supports this legislation. However, I do wish to raise one comment, which is that I wonder whether, in their haste to introduce this bill, the government have created in some ways an unlevel playing field. 


The requirements for disclosure of remuneration that are found in this bill would be a very good principle if they in fact applied across the board. But what we know is that, in many instances, unions and workers will find themselves negotiating with private proprietary limited companies and those companies may be very big and very powerful. There is no obligation on the five most senior staff within a privately listed company to tell the union or the workforce what they are earning and yet there will be an obligation on the people in the union to disclose their remuneration. So, potentially, as a result of this bill, we will have a situation where a union official—and it might not even be an elected official; it might be a staff member—is sitting down across the table from a very well paid human resources manager or consultant or one of the directors of the company, and one side will know what the other gets paid but the reverse will not be the case. 


I am concerned that that may lead to a situation of significant power imbalance between workers and their representatives on the one hand and employers who may be very big and powerful employers on the other. For all the reasons I outlined before, that is not enough reason to stand in the way of this bill. But we do note that perhaps, in their haste, the government have tipped the playing field slightly against the people that this is supposed to assist.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (13:29):  I rise also to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 and support the amendments moved by this side of the House. I will begin my remarks by quoting from another member in his contribution late last week. The member said:


In my experience, the vast majority of trade unions are professionally managed by highly competent and dedicated people who act on the basis of sound professional advice. But, regrettably, there have been exceptions to that. Officers have sought to obtain personal benefit or benefit on behalf of others at the expense of members of their union. Reported instances include not only misapplying funds and resources of the union but also using the privileges of their office to attract and obtain services and benefits from third parties. 


Aside from issues of profiteering, secret commissions and tax avoidance, these undeclared benefits can compromise officials. Rather than diligently representing the interests of their members without fear or favour they effectively ‘run dead’ as a result of these side deals. This is no less than graft and corruption in its most reprehensible form, and it occurs at the expense of vulnerable members whose interests they have been charged with representing.


That was in the early part of the contribution from the member for Barton, who made, I thought, an extremely good contribution to this debate last Thursday. They are words that I very much agree with. 


Unions play a fundamental role in Australian workplaces and people have the right, and should always have the right in our free and open democracy, to join a trade union. And to ensure that the trade union is managed properly and within the law, you need to ensure that the laws that govern them give people faith that they can trust that the money they are contributing will be used to represent their best interests. 


The same applies to the employer who decides to join a group of like-minded employers to have their interests represented in industrial relations in this country. It is an important element of running a business, dealing with your staff. It is a complicated area of law which very rarely goes through a period of five years without having substantial change in one form or another. So these are important institutions in our country. Trade unions are a very important institution in our society.


What we have seen in the last 2½ to three years—and have probably seen only very few times in the past—is a fundamental undermining of the role of unions and the faith that people have in their operation. I think that the member for Barton is right to say in his contribution that the vast majority of trade union officials are professional and that the vast majority of unions are managed professionally by highly competent and dedicated people, and many of them in this parliament, who were formerly trade union officials, fit into that category. They care deeply about their perspective, they care deeply about the working people who join trade unions, and they have sought in their career to represent them to the level that they have risen in being elected to the federal parliament, and I think that genuinely of many of those on the other side.


But what, I think, should pain us all is that laws—laws which I have some familiarity with—have for some time been so badly abused and so badly misused. It must cause many of those on the other side a great deal of pain to see the institutions which are so valued and so important in our society undermined by those who are—in the member for Barton's words—'profiteering', seeking 'secret commissions' and practising 'tax avoidance' which is 'no less than graft and corruption in its most reprehensible form'.


The allegations and the evidence which have been produced in relation to the Health Services Union are an example. No worse allegations could have been made. The fact that we are having to debate this bill in such haste, as the member for Melbourne commented, shows just how shameful this episode has been. It has dragged out for a period of four years because the agency which has been enlisted to investigate it has dragged its feet, for whatever reason. It has been shown not to have the capabilities or the capacity to investigate thoroughly enough or to bring justice to those members whose funds have been used in inappropriate ways.


Putting aside the contemporary and real political debate in relation to a member of this parliament who had involvement in these issues, and putting aside whether he was at fault or not, there is no doubt that this behaviour went on. There is no doubt that this behaviour was allowed to go on for a very long period of time, and there is no doubt that many within the union movement knew that it was going on. There is no doubt about that. A very recent piece from Aaron Patrick in the Australian Financial Review steps clearly through what people knew and when they knew, and the extent of the involvement of people in the party of those who sit opposite must bring great pain to many.


So this bill is an attempt by the government to address issues which have become clear in the HSU matter and other matters that the member for Barton refers to further in his speech, and he makes the point that the Prime Minister has some familiarity with some of those similar issues. To those involved in industrial relations, practitioners across the country, I think people are genuinely shocked at the level, as the member for Barton said, of graft and corruption which has gone on, and are surprised that these measures have had to be enacted in the first place. 


We say, and rightly, that this bill does not go far enough. In fact the Leader of the Opposition announced, just 10 days before this bill was announced, stronger measures, and they are measures that we move as amendments to this bill. What we need now—and what we quite obviously needed in the past but what was not fully understood—are the strongest possible measures, measures which are consistent with responsibilities that corporations are required to meet. We need these measures because the faith of people who are paying their union dues week in and week out has been fundamentally undermined by the evidence as to and the examples through the Health Services Union. For those who do not understand or know, the Health Services Union workers are the people who push trolleys around hospitals: the hospital orderlies. These are not well-paid people. These are people who usually come from a migrant background, a non-English-speaking background. They are usually low skilled; although, some current members of the HSU are undoubtedly skilled employees. Many are unskilled and many are exactly the sort of workers who should be members of a trade union because they do need assistance in negotiations.


It has been a fundamental principle I have always supported that if someone wants to be represented they should have that opportunity. So it must pain all of us to see what has happened to these people who have committed their small amount of funds, albeit from their pay packets, every week, funds that could be used for all sorts of other purposes to make their life easier. In doing so they have knowingly made their own choice to commit to an organisation because they think that it is helping them to better their circumstances and that it is an institution that will negotiate with employers on their behalf to ensure a far better outcome in their workplace. But what they now know is that the money they contributed, for however long they have been contributing to that institution, has not always gone to these good causes, including the good cause of fighting for their rights and responsibilities.


We hear much from those opposite about the rights of working people and about ensuring that working people have fair pay and conditions and fair workplaces. We currently hear in question time the minister for workplace relations trying to create each day a political issue out of state legislation because he claims working people are going to be worse off, yet we have not heard the same minister and other members who also argue strongly on these matters—like the member for Wakefield and the member for Kingston, in my own state of South Australia—express the great outrage that they should be expressing when it comes to these matters. This bill is before the House not because the Labor Party want to reform the way that registered organisations operate but because they want to cover their great shame at the way that these workers have had their money ripped off from them in unimaginable ways. They have been ripped off to an enormous extent. There are suggestions that the amount of money ripped off from these union members could be somewhere around $20 million. The sums are quite extraordinary.


I have always been uncomfortable with the fact that trade union members contribute money to a political party whether they wish to or not and I think that is an area of reform that this country needs to consider. I know the new Premier of Queensland is considering such things, and I congratulate him for it. Early on in his premiership he is proving to be someone who will get things done, someone who is setting a course for the right things to be done. And this is a right thing to do. To give people choice about where their money is going is the right thing to do, particularly in the circumstances which we have seen in this HSU debacle, this shameful episode in Australian industrial relations history which is not yet fully investigated or prosecuted. So this bill is a shameful attempt by the minister for workplace relations to cover what is an ongoing sore for the union movement and the Labor Party which undermines the faith Australians have in these important institutions. The Australian Labor Party is an important institution as well but currently the leadership is trying to undermine as much as it possibly can people's faith in it.


As Senator Abetz has said time and time again, in relation to this bill—and the member for Forde repeated this before—it is true that this bill is designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses and it sees former union bosses as the cops on the beat. It is completely conflicted. It is weak at its very foundations. It will not do the job it needs to do to ensure recovery of the faith that has been lost in this whole process, this whole shambolic HSU episode with its factionalism and nastiness and with its 'graft and corruption', to quote the member for Barton's terrific contribution last Thursday—reflecting the freedom of the back bench that he now has to outline some of these concerns. He did so in a quite fulsome way, as the House should be reminded. Obviously, he knows and he has seen all this as he makes the point in his contribution that in his time in legal practice these issues have been played out. That is the most concerning thing of all, that what has gone on at the HSU could be rife in the union movement. Certainly the member for Barton was indicating last week that there are concerns about other episodes and other examples and that these are matters which should be looked at, and I am sure that in the future there will be more consideration given to ensuring that the money of trade unionists, the people who decide willingly to contribute their own funds for their own betterment in the workplace, is being used in an appropriate fashion.


Sadly, this bill will not ensure that that is the case. The proposed amendments that have been put up by the coalition will ensure that that is the case. Certainly, they will ensure that there will be a greater level of transparency to ensure that people are being represented and are getting what they think they should be getting from the product that they are purchasing, which is membership of an organisation which seeks to assist with their working life, not for their money to be spent on the most objectionable indulgences by its officials. This has been a shameful episode in Australian industrial relations history and this bill should be tougher so that it does not happen again.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,11,1,speech
"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (13:17):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work ( Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. It is interesting that it took the government only 10 days to announce this legislation, but only after the Leader of the Opposition had announced the coalition's Better Plan for Accountability and Transparency for Registered Organisations. It is flattering that Labor has sought to emulate the stance that had been articulated by the Leader of the Opposition, but, as usual, Labor's plan is lacking in a number of key areas: it still sees Fair Work Australia in control of investigating registered organisations; it does not expressly provide Fair Work Australia with the ability to cooperate with police; the requirements and penalties are still not in line with the Corporations Act; and it has no reporting mechanism on why investigations are going overtime.


The coalition's plan, on the other hand, seeks to make sure that members of registered organisations can be assured that their money is being used for the right things and for their interests. There are rules to ensure that companies and their boards of directors do the right thing—the same rules should apply to registered organisations and their officers. Our plan seeks to ensure that registered organisations and their officers are as accountable and transparent as companies and their directors, and that we have a level playing field where we ensure that everybody plays by the same rules. It is clear from the experience with the HSU that Fair Work Australia is not up to the job of making sure that registered organisations do the right thing—it is either a model of incompetence or is engaging—or has engaged in—a deliberate and overt go-slow to protect the government.


The coalition's plan proposes to remove from Fair Work Australia both the investigative and the compliance powers over registered organisations and give those powers instead to a new, genuinely independent body, which will be called the Registered Organisations Commission. The Registered Organisations Commission will have stronger powers. It will be tasked with acting quickly and efficiently and will be required to cooperate with other law enforcement agencies where it is in the interests of the public to do so.


By contrast, in this bill and under Labor's proposed changes Fair Work Australia would continue to be responsible for registered organisations. Under the government's plan, former union bosses are going to regulate union bosses. It is akin to putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. The rules and requirements which would apply as a result of the proposed changes are still significantly weaker than those currently applicable to company directors. Company directors are subject to 697 federal and state provisions that impose legal liabilities, including massive fines and jail time. 


While the penalties proposed in the bill are in line with other civil penalties in the Fair Work Act, they still fall considerably short of those required under the Corporations Act. It is the disjointed and inconsistent nature of this regulation that creates opportunities for people to find loopholes. This is disappointing but also expected of this government.


Under the coalition's plan, the penalties would be the same across the board, whether for union bosses or company directors. It is worth noting that we can enforce penalties all we like but, at the end of the day, it is individual behavioural systems that let the everybody down. This point was highlighted in an article by Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks when he said:


Those who believe that liberal democracy and the free market can be defended by the force of law and regulation alone, without an internalised sense of duty and morality, are tragically mistaken.


As we discussed in earlier debates today, that rings very true. In a perfect world, citizens would be more aware of their 'moral' responsibility; however, as we all know, this is not necessarily the case.


While this bill seeks to expand police cooperation powers, it does not clearly state that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that we get clarity on whether there will be cooperation in this area. There is also no express provision to allow Fair Work Australia to provide a brief of evidence to the DPP when it is important to give express powers to allow this to happen. This is a bill designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses that sees former union bosses as the 'cops on the beat'. It is a weak bill that does not go far enough and we call on the government to support the common-sense amendments that we will be proposing.


These amendments will include: to give specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence; to ensure that the investigation is conducted by Fair Work Australia, not outsourced entirely, as this bill would allow; to ensure that the disclosure of how money is spent is provided to Fair Work Australia as well as to union members; to have reports to parliament on why investigations are taking so long, when the investigations last for more than a year, and then every six months thereafter; to make the provision relating to police cooperation very clear so that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police at the commencement, during and at the conclusion of an investigation; and to increase the penalties for misusing members' funds, in line with the Corporations Act. At the end of the day these bills and the penalties imposed should not be compromised to keep union bosses happy. They should be designed to protect everyday working Australians that fund these unions in the first place.


In terms of the case with the HSU, it is disgraceful to see health workers' money being spent for personal purposes by union bosses and employees. Our health workers, who look after our ageing population, work with the disabled and support the sick, are not usually rolling in dough. They work hard to pay their bills and pay their unions to represent their best interests. If I were part of this workforce paying union dues, I would be outraged by the recent reports in the media about what has gone on and the outrageous, unauthorised expenditure of union funds. It is because of this investigation that we stand here today debating this proposed legislation. We have maintained all along that the process Fair Work Australia has undertaken on this investigation was severely lacking. The final report that was produced had 1,200 pages, with many pertaining to the former secretary of the HSU.


We will not oppose this bill but will seek to apply sensible amendments to make it work better in everybody's interests, as we agree that something needs to be done to ensure that money being paid by members to registered organisations is used for proper purposes. As previously stated, and as usual, the coalition have a better plan and we will seek to improve the proposed legislation by making the amendments I referred to earlier.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-06-25,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:25):  It is obvious, as a number of members have already made clear in their contributions to this debate, that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 is a response to some pretty concerning allegations that have been made in recent times about expenditure of union money in this country. There should be a fundamental principle that applies whatever your union, and that is that members' funds are spent for the advancement of members' interests.


Unions are one of the few organisations that we have left in this country where members are able to exercise some very real control over the direction of their organisation and who runs it. You will find more democracy and control in a union than you will find in a publicly listed or a privately listed company or in many incorporated associations. It is a fundamental principle of unions, but it of course relies on members being properly informed about what happens in their union, including in their union leadership.


To the extent that this bill aims to provide members of unions with more information about what is happening in their own organisations, we are supportive of the intent of the bill. We note that the ACTU, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, also supports this legislation. However, I do wish to raise one comment, which is that I wonder whether, in their haste to introduce this bill, the government have created in some ways an unlevel playing field. 


The requirements for disclosure of remuneration that are found in this bill would be a very good principle if they in fact applied across the board. But what we know is that, in many instances, unions and workers will find themselves negotiating with private proprietary limited companies and those companies may be very big and very powerful. There is no obligation on the five most senior staff within a privately listed company to tell the union or the workforce what they are earning and yet there will be an obligation on the people in the union to disclose their remuneration. So, potentially, as a result of this bill, we will have a situation where a union official—and it might not even be an elected official; it might be a staff member—is sitting down across the table from a very well paid human resources manager or consultant or one of the directors of the company, and one side will know what the other gets paid but the reverse will not be the case. 


I am concerned that that may lead to a situation of significant power imbalance between workers and their representatives on the one hand and employers who may be very big and powerful employers on the other. For all the reasons I outlined before, that is not enough reason to stand in the way of this bill. But we do note that perhaps, in their haste, the government have tipped the playing field slightly against the people that this is supposed to assist.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,11,2,speech
"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (13:29):  I rise also to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 and support the amendments moved by this side of the House. I will begin my remarks by quoting from another member in his contribution late last week. The member said:


In my experience, the vast majority of trade unions are professionally managed by highly competent and dedicated people who act on the basis of sound professional advice. But, regrettably, there have been exceptions to that. Officers have sought to obtain personal benefit or benefit on behalf of others at the expense of members of their union. Reported instances include not only misapplying funds and resources of the union but also using the privileges of their office to attract and obtain services and benefits from third parties. 


Aside from issues of profiteering, secret commissions and tax avoidance, these undeclared benefits can compromise officials. Rather than diligently representing the interests of their members without fear or favour they effectively ‘run dead’ as a result of these side deals. This is no less than graft and corruption in its most reprehensible form, and it occurs at the expense of vulnerable members whose interests they have been charged with representing.


That was in the early part of the contribution from the member for Barton, who made, I thought, an extremely good contribution to this debate last Thursday. They are words that I very much agree with. 


Unions play a fundamental role in Australian workplaces and people have the right, and should always have the right in our free and open democracy, to join a trade union. And to ensure that the trade union is managed properly and within the law, you need to ensure that the laws that govern them give people faith that they can trust that the money they are contributing will be used to represent their best interests. 


The same applies to the employer who decides to join a group of like-minded employers to have their interests represented in industrial relations in this country. It is an important element of running a business, dealing with your staff. It is a complicated area of law which very rarely goes through a period of five years without having substantial change in one form or another. So these are important institutions in our country. Trade unions are a very important institution in our society.


What we have seen in the last 2½ to three years—and have probably seen only very few times in the past—is a fundamental undermining of the role of unions and the faith that people have in their operation. I think that the member for Barton is right to say in his contribution that the vast majority of trade union officials are professional and that the vast majority of unions are managed professionally by highly competent and dedicated people, and many of them in this parliament, who were formerly trade union officials, fit into that category. They care deeply about their perspective, they care deeply about the working people who join trade unions, and they have sought in their career to represent them to the level that they have risen in being elected to the federal parliament, and I think that genuinely of many of those on the other side.


But what, I think, should pain us all is that laws—laws which I have some familiarity with—have for some time been so badly abused and so badly misused. It must cause many of those on the other side a great deal of pain to see the institutions which are so valued and so important in our society undermined by those who are—in the member for Barton's words—'profiteering', seeking 'secret commissions' and practising 'tax avoidance' which is 'no less than graft and corruption in its most reprehensible form'.


The allegations and the evidence which have been produced in relation to the Health Services Union are an example. No worse allegations could have been made. The fact that we are having to debate this bill in such haste, as the member for Melbourne commented, shows just how shameful this episode has been. It has dragged out for a period of four years because the agency which has been enlisted to investigate it has dragged its feet, for whatever reason. It has been shown not to have the capabilities or the capacity to investigate thoroughly enough or to bring justice to those members whose funds have been used in inappropriate ways.


Putting aside the contemporary and real political debate in relation to a member of this parliament who had involvement in these issues, and putting aside whether he was at fault or not, there is no doubt that this behaviour went on. There is no doubt that this behaviour was allowed to go on for a very long period of time, and there is no doubt that many within the union movement knew that it was going on. There is no doubt about that. A very recent piece from Aaron Patrick in the Australian Financial Review steps clearly through what people knew and when they knew, and the extent of the involvement of people in the party of those who sit opposite must bring great pain to many.


So this bill is an attempt by the government to address issues which have become clear in the HSU matter and other matters that the member for Barton refers to further in his speech, and he makes the point that the Prime Minister has some familiarity with some of those similar issues. To those involved in industrial relations, practitioners across the country, I think people are genuinely shocked at the level, as the member for Barton said, of graft and corruption which has gone on, and are surprised that these measures have had to be enacted in the first place. 


We say, and rightly, that this bill does not go far enough. In fact the Leader of the Opposition announced, just 10 days before this bill was announced, stronger measures, and they are measures that we move as amendments to this bill. What we need now—and what we quite obviously needed in the past but what was not fully understood—are the strongest possible measures, measures which are consistent with responsibilities that corporations are required to meet. We need these measures because the faith of people who are paying their union dues week in and week out has been fundamentally undermined by the evidence as to and the examples through the Health Services Union. For those who do not understand or know, the Health Services Union workers are the people who push trolleys around hospitals: the hospital orderlies. These are not well-paid people. These are people who usually come from a migrant background, a non-English-speaking background. They are usually low skilled; although, some current members of the HSU are undoubtedly skilled employees. Many are unskilled and many are exactly the sort of workers who should be members of a trade union because they do need assistance in negotiations.


It has been a fundamental principle I have always supported that if someone wants to be represented they should have that opportunity. So it must pain all of us to see what has happened to these people who have committed their small amount of funds, albeit from their pay packets, every week, funds that could be used for all sorts of other purposes to make their life easier. In doing so they have knowingly made their own choice to commit to an organisation because they think that it is helping them to better their circumstances and that it is an institution that will negotiate with employers on their behalf to ensure a far better outcome in their workplace. But what they now know is that the money they contributed, for however long they have been contributing to that institution, has not always gone to these good causes, including the good cause of fighting for their rights and responsibilities.


We hear much from those opposite about the rights of working people and about ensuring that working people have fair pay and conditions and fair workplaces. We currently hear in question time the minister for workplace relations trying to create each day a political issue out of state legislation because he claims working people are going to be worse off, yet we have not heard the same minister and other members who also argue strongly on these matters—like the member for Wakefield and the member for Kingston, in my own state of South Australia—express the great outrage that they should be expressing when it comes to these matters. This bill is before the House not because the Labor Party want to reform the way that registered organisations operate but because they want to cover their great shame at the way that these workers have had their money ripped off from them in unimaginable ways. They have been ripped off to an enormous extent. There are suggestions that the amount of money ripped off from these union members could be somewhere around $20 million. The sums are quite extraordinary.


I have always been uncomfortable with the fact that trade union members contribute money to a political party whether they wish to or not and I think that is an area of reform that this country needs to consider. I know the new Premier of Queensland is considering such things, and I congratulate him for it. Early on in his premiership he is proving to be someone who will get things done, someone who is setting a course for the right things to be done. And this is a right thing to do. To give people choice about where their money is going is the right thing to do, particularly in the circumstances which we have seen in this HSU debacle, this shameful episode in Australian industrial relations history which is not yet fully investigated or prosecuted. So this bill is a shameful attempt by the minister for workplace relations to cover what is an ongoing sore for the union movement and the Labor Party which undermines the faith Australians have in these important institutions. The Australian Labor Party is an important institution as well but currently the leadership is trying to undermine as much as it possibly can people's faith in it.


As Senator Abetz has said time and time again, in relation to this bill—and the member for Forde repeated this before—it is true that this bill is designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses and it sees former union bosses as the cops on the beat. It is completely conflicted. It is weak at its very foundations.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (13:44):  Today I am delighted to pay tribute to three inspiring young athletes from my electorate of Higgins. Three young women—Shelley Chaplin and Cobi Crispin, both of Ashburton, and South Yarra's Katy Parrish—have been chosen to compete in the London 2012 Paralympics.


Now 21 years old, Katy Parrish competed in the Beijing Games when she was just 17, an experience she has described as her greatest moment. Katy was born with cerebral palsy but she has never let it hold her back. I wish her all the best in her 100-metre, 200-metre, 4x100 metre relay and long jump events. Close friends Shelley and Cobi have been nominated to represent Australia in wheelchair basketball, with the team to be officially confirmed in early July. Twenty-eight-year-old Shelley is a seasoned Paralympian who has competed in both Athens and Beijing, while 24-year-old Cobi also competed in Beijing. Both girls nominate winning the bronze medal at those games as their career highlights.


We all know that to compete at an Olympic level takes a huge amount of determination that most of us simply cannot fathom, but Paralympians take it to a whole new level. Determination, commitment, strength and courage are words that come to mind when you think of the challenges these athletes have overcome to excel in their chosen fields. On my website contact page I invite Higgins residents to send messages of support that I will pass on to Shelley, Cobi and Katy for the Paralympics between 29 August and 9 September this year. I want them to know that we are behind them, wish them all the best and know that they will do Australia proud.

 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  On behalf of the House I want to acknowledge the dreadful tragedy that happened on Thursday last week, when an asylum seeker boat capsized with considerable loss of life. The precise details of this matter still remain unknown but what we do know is that there were likely to be over 200 people on board this boat, including one 13-year-old boy. The boat capsized with considerable loss of life. While survivors were rescued, at this stage we are unable to determine, tragically, how many people have lost their lives in the sea. One hundred and ten survivors have been transferred to authorities on Christmas Island and a number have been transferred to the mainland for treatment. This is a dreadful human tragedy. I know that members across the parliament would be feeling the weight of that, and we can see many in our community who are grieving from this dreadful news.


We should acknowledge the efforts of those who went to the rescue in not easy circumstances. They include our Australian Navy; our Air Force, which had planes assisting; Customs and Border Protection personnel; personnel from other agencies; and merchant vessels, who responded to the need for assistance and diverted from their commercial activities in order to be available to help. We should thank them for their efforts. Without them many more people would have died. Today we respectfully and very sincerely acknowledge the lives lost last week.

 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:05):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to the government's intention to give the Alcoa aluminium smelter at Point Henry $42 million in hush money to help pay its carbon tax bill. Given that the Australian Aluminium Council has warned that the carbon tax will contribute to ensuring Australian aluminium operations have no long-term future, will the Prime Minister now announce similar bailouts for all the other 16,000 workers in the industry at sites like Gladstone, Portland, Kwinana, Kurri Kurri and Bell Bay?




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the suggestion in that question of hush money is a very serious allegation to make not just against the government but against the company Alcoa. I request that the Leader of the Opposition, if possible, rephrase the question in a more sensible way.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:06):  In relation to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I have been concerned, as have the members for Corangamite and Corio, about the circumstances at Alcoa. We have also been advised by the company of those circumstances, which the Leader of the Opposition has come into the Parliament and misrepresented today. The circumstances of Alcoa which have been made available to the government include pressure on Alcoa because of international prices and because of the age of some of its capital stock. We have worked with Alcoa because we believe these jobs are precious. We believe the jobs of Australian workers are precious, and that is why when jobs are being threatened in our economy—for example, by the global financial crisis—we have always worked to protect jobs. We have taken that same ethos about understanding how important jobs are to working people to circumstances at Alcoa and we are working with the company because we want to see a continuation of the company and a continuation of those jobs.


The Leader of the Opposition, of course, is not at all concerned about those jobs; the only thing that will ever worry him is what is the best way of distorting this issue, to make it about his fear campaign. This is not about the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign; this is about a different set of circumstances. He owes it to the workers there to be honest about it. He owes it to that region of Victoria to be honest about it. He owes it to the people of Australia to be honest about it.


For us on this side of the parliament, jobs will always be something we work to protect. On that side of the parliament, any threat to jobs is just an excuse to try and politically profit as part of their destructive and aggressive negativity. We will work to help working people; they will keep being negative about working people and their lifetime prospects, as we have seen the Leader of the Opposition be already today.

He should actually pay the respect to working people necessary to acquaint himself with the facts. I refer him to the statement of the Managing Director of Alcoa, Mr Alan Cransberg, who has, as Alcoa has previously stated, that 'the review of the Point Henry smelter and the current situation have not been brought about by the upcoming price on carbon but are as a result of the international price of aluminium and the high Australian dollar'.


The Leader of the Opposition, once again, in here trying to sell his misrepresentations to these working people and to Australians generally—completely disgusting to try and create that fear, completely disgusting to try and profit off that fear but in keeping with the kind of negativity we always expect from the Leader of the Opposition. He has never cared about saving a job, he has never acted to save a job and today he is not telling the truth about these jobs.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition has the call and will refer to the motion before the chair.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, standing orders should be suspended because this is the second anniversary of the Gillard government and this Prime Minister should face the parliament and explain her manifest failures—her failures to be competent, her failures to be trustworthy, her failure to be honest and open with the Australian people.



Mr Champion interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order, the member for Wakefield!




Mr ABBOTT:
  Standing orders must be suspended because you would think any Prime Minister who was at all proud of her record would at least put out a glossy brochure to celebrate the second anniversary. It is not as if this is a government which is not spending a lot of money on self-promotion.




Mr Swan:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: yes, he should come back to why standing orders should be suspended. That is what he should do.



Honourable members interjecting—  



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the Opposition has the call and will refer to the motion before the chair.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, standing orders should be suspended because, I tell you what, the Sussex Street squad are not just coming for the Prime Minister, they are coming for the Deputy Prime Minister too. We all know the minister for workplace relations wants to be the Treasurer in the government of the member for Griffith. That is why standing orders should be suspended. 


This is a Prime Minister who consistently runs away from facing up to this parliament, who consistently runs away from giving an account of her stewardship to the Australian people, and you would think that after two long years of failure the least she would try to do is come into this parliament and give an explanation of what has happened in this time. Two years ago she said that a good government had lost its way. That is what the Prime Minister said, and standing orders should be suspended so she can explain exactly what she meant by that. We know that when the Prime Minister said a good government had lost its way she did not actually believe that; because, just a few months ago, when she was again challenged by the member for Griffith, she said that it was not a good government, it was an absolutely shambolic government and it was completely paralysed by the ineptitude and the incompetence of the member for Griffith. But she did pledge that she would provide a better government and that she would give us a better way on border protection, a better way on climate change policy, a better way on the mining tax.


But, as the people of Australia well know—and this is why standing orders should be suspended—the government has just got worse and worse. This is a bad government getting worse, and every day its failures become more apparent. It is a government which is incompetent and untrustworthy. It has got the Midas touch in reverse. The only thing that this government is good at is savagery against anyone who dares to stand up against it, and that is why standing orders should be suspended. We only have to look at what the current Deputy Prime Minister said about the member for Griffith, and this is why standing orders should be suspended: so that the Prime Minister can explain herself. Why did she put the Deputy Prime Minister up to say that the member for Griffith has no Labor values and never had any? Why did she put up the member for Bendigo to go out there and carpet-bomb the reputation of the former Labor Prime Minister of this country, calling him a psychopath with an ego problem? And what does it say—and this is why standing orders should be suspended—about this Prime Minister and about these ministers at the table that 31 members of caucus were prepared to back a 'psychopath' against the current incumbent Prime Minister?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will—




Mr ABBOTT:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, standing orders should be suspended because six days before the last election, this Prime Minister stood up and said, hand on heart, to the Australian people: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' and she needs to give an explanation. Why did she mislead the Australian public six days before the last election? Why did she mislead the Australian public to win votes? Why, having scrambled back into the Lodge, did she do the exact opposite of what she had promised before the last election the Australian public that she would do? This is a Prime Minister who simply cannot be trusted, and standing orders should be suspended so that this Prime Minister can give an explanation of why now she will not even mention the carbon tax. It is like the anniversary that she does not want to mention. This is the tax—and this is the anniversary—that dare not speak its name. That is why standing orders must be suspended, because this is a Prime Minister and a government that are in denial. The Prime Minister is clearly in denial about the impact of the carbon tax on the aluminium industry. Her own modelling shows that there will be a 61 per cent decline in aluminium production under the carbon tax, and she tries to pretend that the workers at Point Henry could not be happier about the carbon tax, that they love the carbon tax, that the last thing they are concerned about is the carbon tax. Well, she needs to explain why she wants to put in place a government policy that will all but destroy the aluminium industry in this country. We have the minister for climate change constantly telling us that the coal industry could not be happier about the carbon tax and they love the carbon tax—even though the whole point of a carbon tax is to stop the use of coal. If it does not stop the use of coal what is the point? Coal is what is producing the emissions which the carbon tax is designed to limit, and the government's own modelling shows that, absent carbon capture and storage, the coal industry will go from 70 per cent of electricity production down to 10 per cent. It spells the death of the coal industry as we know it.



This is a rotten Prime Minister leading a rotten government. This is why standing orders ought to be suspended. We know that the faceless men are about to change the leader of the Labor Party but they cannot change the government; only the Australian people can do that, and, boy, are they waiting for that day!

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:12):  I second the motion. It is important that standing orders are suspended to provide the Prime Minister with an opportunity to explain why the government has failed to find its way under her stewardship. The Leader of the Opposition is right: there was a time when Labor celebrated the anniversaries of their dear leaders. They would set out their glorious achievements in 75-page documents no less. I have one here. Remember the days of the Rudd government? On their anniversaries they would put out a one-year progress report and they would send out full-colour glossies on their achievements. But now here we are, two years on from Kevin's fundamental injustice day, 24 June 2010, and there has not been a peep on the glorious achievements of the Gillard government. Now why would this be? That is why standing orders must be suspended, because the Gillard government would be lucky to put out a half-pager—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has used her prop.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  We remember the Prime Minister's infamous speech on the day after the betrayal of the member for Griffith on that dark and stormy night two years ago. The Prime Minister declared that under the member for Griffith the government had lost its way. Standing orders must be suspended to provide the Prime Minister with the opportunity to explain why she has failed to find her way—or indeed any way—on the three issues she nominated as her highest priorities: border protection, climate change and the mining tax. This Prime Minister's version of finding her way is like a dodgy taxi driver taking unwitting passengers on a mystery tour as the cost of the trip goes up and up and up, and it is the Australian taxpayers who are going to be paying the exorbitant fare. As the fare goes through the roof, it is the Australian taxpayers who will pay. Standing orders must be suspended so that we can look at the issue of border protection. This is one of the great policy failures of this generation. The Prime Minister first announced her East Timor solution, denied she had announced East Timor, and recommitted to East Timor, all within the space of just three days. As respected political commentator Laurie Oakes said at the time, her performance was:


… silly and slippery and slimy and shifty in all that and it's a very, very bad start to her prime ministerial career.


Standing orders must be suspended to provide the Prime Minister with an opportunity to explain why she has failed to find her way on border protection, because after that 'silly and slippery and slimy and shifty' start the Prime Minister has gone from bad to worse. The High Court has ruled her Malaysia solution illegal, yet she continues to hold it up as one of her finest policy initiatives. She still has not convinced her coalition partner, the Greens, to back her policy.


Standing orders must be suspended so that we can debate the Prime Minister's more novel approach to finding her way on climate change, with her announcement, first, of a citizen's assembly. I remind members that in her speech announcing that policy the Prime Minister said:


… I will not rush headlong into economy-wide changes that people are not familiar with …


She went on:


I will honour my commitment to building a consensus that is informed by the facts, tested by robust debate and concluded through common sense and open-mindedness.


Therefore, we will have a citizen's assembly! Then, just days before the election came the next step on her pathway, with the infamous statement:


There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.


Does anyone believe that she would be prime minister today if six days before the last election she had stood up and said, 'There will be a carbon tax under a government I lead'?


The Deputy Prime Minister is sitting at the table. He said that the suggestion of Labor introducing a carbon tax was an 'hysterical allegation'. Who is looking hysterical now? It is important to remember that these comments were in direct response to the Leader of the Opposition, who said repeatedly that, 'as night follows day', there would be a carbon tax under this government.


Standing orders must be suspended because there is a mining tax which is already under challenge in the High Court and which has increasingly rubbery foundations. It is a tax with highly doubtful revenue streams, while the government's anticipated revenues have already been spent by the Prime Minister. As the UBS report finds, this mining tax is already dodgy. The figures are already dodgy, and as a result of the mismatch between the tax revenue that the tax is going to come up with and the spending, the government is going to raise the tax or bring it in under other— (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:17):  Who said this?


The world view of this ugly conservatism is distinguished by complete absence of optimism, total lack of generosity of spirit and denial that politics all involves ... give as well as take.


…   …   …


The triumph of fear over hope is palpable.


That was the Leader of the Opposition in an article in 1998 about the One Nation Party. In that article he opposed the politics of fear over the politics of hope, and he opposed the politics of fear over the politics of fact.


Since then we have seen an opposition leader desperate because of his loss. We know that from his own words. The same person who wants to claw back the payments to families, who wants to claw back the education funding, who wants to claw back the assistance to pensioners, veterans, students and the elderly had this to say about losing power:


We all need grief counselling … It's like a bereavement. Not as bad as losing a child or a spouse but up there with losing a parent. It's very hard.


That is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say about going into opposition. No wonder we say that the quote from Johnson about Goldwater fits: 'In your guts you know he's nuts.' No wonder we say this.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order on relevance. Mr Albanese, you can sit down.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call and will be held in silence.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  I was making the point that in his words to date the member has not yet addressed the motion. Given that this is a matter where standing orders should be suspended to debate the motion, I ask him to come back to the motion.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask the Leader of the House to address the motion before the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Here we see personified why we should not be suspending standing orders: this is all about their dummy spit. This is all about those opposite and their failure to acknowledge the fact that they lost the election in 2010. That is why they have come in here and moved suspensions of standing orders on 61 separate occasions. They say it is very effective but they run away from it just like they ran away from the parliament. This Leader of the Opposition is the only member of parliament to ever try to run out of parliament when a division was called. Everyone else tries to get in; he tried to get out, but he was beaten by the gazelle over here.



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Sturt is not being relevant.




Mr ALBANESE:
  We should not suspend standing orders because we should not give in to the indulgence of those opposite. It is not our fault that they do not sit on this side of the chamber. It is not our fault that every day they move a suspension of standing orders for the sole purpose that, during the division, they can sit on the government benches for just a few minutes. That is the only possible explanation. What we see from those opposite is that they are not conservatives; they are wreckers; they are extremists; they are reactionaries; and they are desperate as it comes to July 1.


As it comes to July 1 those opposite know that all of their fear campaigns that Whyalla will disappear off the map, and all the other fears—and we heard it again in the suspension motion. The Leader of the Opposition said today: 'We will see the death of the coal industry'—at a time when we know there is half a trillion dollars of investment in the resources sector pipeline.


We should not suspend standing orders because I predict I might have got the next question. If I did, I might have been asked about the Regional Infrastructure Fund and what people have to say about that. Those on this side of the House have supported the minerals resource rent tax because we support the support for superannuation and the support for regional infrastructure. This is what the Leader of the National Party had to say a year ago:


I share the disappointment about how few mining companies contribute to the areas they invade and how little state governments return of the massive royalty incomes they receive to the communities.


That is what he had to say. I thought that might have been an aberration—it might have just been a mistake—because the Nats do make mistakes, but just this month in the Mudgee Guardian he said that mining companies:


… could not expect to take away a region’s resources without leaving something for the community.


That is what he had to say, and then he went on to say:


… mines had a responsibility to contribute to the specific infrastructure provided to meet their needs.


When they are out there in their communities, they say, 'We want regional infrastructure; we need regional infrastructure; we should do something about it.' It is just like when they go around and say they have the exactly same target that we do on climate change; the difference is this: we are using a market to get there by introducing an emissions trading system with a fixed price. Those opposite want to get there the same way, but not only are they climate sceptics; they are market sceptics as well. They want to do it through the old Soviet command style economy of this Leader of the Opposition.


The fact is that they say no to everything in this parliament, except yes to Work Choices, yes to clawing back tax cuts and pension rises, yes to ripping the NBN out of the ground, yes to taking billions away from public hospitals and yes to slashing the education budget. But we know they want to avoid discussion. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has been missing a bit on the last couple of weekends—he has been doing no doorstops.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the House will return to the issue before the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  If we did not have a motion to suspend standing orders before us, we might ask why it is that they run away from the parliament and from debate. We know that there is a real concern from those opposite when it comes to accountability. It is probably why they have just suspended standing orders to avoid question time. They do not like questions. They will not answer any questions about what their involvement was in the James Ashby affair—not the member for Sturt; he runs from that.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the motion before the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer all run away from accountability. So we would certainly welcome a debate on a whole range of issues, but not a debate on their self-indulgence—a debate that says, 'I'm so great. I'm so fantastic. How dare the Australian people not vote for me as Prime Minister!' That is essentially what we are putting up with here: the longest dummy-spit in Australian political history from this bloke opposite, who just puts his ego before everything.


He goes to conferences and says things like this: 'I'll be the next Prime Minister of Australia.' He says that when he goes to state conferences. He runs down the Australian economy and runs down the performance of this government, except when he is held to account when he is overseas. There, he says:


… Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable.


That is exactly what the shadow Treasurer said as well.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am wondering if the Leader of the House would entertain a suspension of standing orders to extend the time to allow the member for Griffith to comment on the second anniversary of—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Once again, they abuse. They get two goes and we get one, but they insist on interrupting.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will refer to the motion before the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  We think it is a fair deal: one of us versus two of them. I conclude my comments on this, the great words of Robert Menzies:


… on far too many questions we have found our role to be simply that of the man who says ""No.""

There is no room in Australia for a party of reaction. There is no useful place for a policy of negation.

 (Page) (15:49):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's report 3/2012: Referrals made November 2011 to March 2012 (3rd report of 2012).


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms SAFFIN:
  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of 2012, which addresses referrals made between November 2011 and March 2012. This report deals with three inquiries with a total estimated cost of $302.2 million. In each case the committee recommends the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding.


The first inquiry examined Defence Housing Australia's proposal for the development of housing for defence families at Rasmussen in Townsville, Queensland. The key objectives of the project are to ensure that the proportion of defence families residing in private rental accommodation in the Townsville area remains under the target of 15 per cent and to maintain the housing stock in Townsville at acceptable levels. Defence Housing Australia plans to develop 1,180 residential allotments and one medium-density site in 30 stages on a site of approximately 99 hectares. Defence Housing Australia then intends to construct 401 dwellings to supply housing for defence personnel.


One of the key issues for this proposal concerns the potential for large flood events to impact on the Rasmussen site. Defence Housing Australia stated that the proposed development will be above the one-in-100-year flood event level. The committee pursued this issue, suggesting that a one-in-100-year flood may not be the worst flood event that could occur, as recent flood events around the nation have shown. In particular, my deputy on the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Mallee, pursued this issue. The committee accepts that Defence Housing Australia is developing and building on the Rasmussen site within normal guidelines and according to advice provided by local and state government agencies regarding the potential for flooding. I move to speak to the second inquiry of this report. The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport seeks approval for a project that will increase bulk fuel storage capacity and integrate and co-locate fuel storage on Christmas Island.


Christmas Island has a high dependency on fuel to maintain essential services and operations owing to its isolated location. Diesel is used primarily in the generation of electricity; aviation fuel is essential for commercial and government aviation operations; and unleaded petrol is used for private, commercial and government vehicles. Increased activity, including sea, land and air transport components, has particularly increased demand for diesel and aviation fuel. The ability to maintain essential services and operations on the island is limited by the current capacity of the fuel storage infrastructure.


The proposal describes several measures that will increase fuel storage capacity and co-location of facilities. However, a key element in the proposal, and the key concern for the Shire of Christmas Island is the proposed location of the service station. There are four outcomes proposed for the service station, each with key advantages and disadvantages. The shire does not entirely agree with the department's proposal.


The department reassured the committee that full and open consultation would be undertaken during the detailed design phase of the project. The committee is relying on the department, which has overall responsibility for Christmas Island, to make the best-informed decision concerning the location of the service station. The committee is confident that the department, in making that decision, will do all it can to incorporate the community's views and ameliorate any negative impacts associated with the selected location.


The third inquiry in this report examined the proposed fit-out of Commonwealth parliamentary offices at 1 Bligh Street in Sydney. The Sydney CPO, currently located at 70 Phillip Street, provides office and meeting facilities for the Prime Minister, cabinet, ministers, office holders and visiting senators and members. The Department of Finance and Deregulation stated that the 70 Phillip Street premises can be described as inadequate and no longer fit for purpose, with the key areas of concern being deficiencies in security, functionality, architecture and flexibility. Refurbishment of 70 Phillip Street has not been pursued as an option as there are several fundamental issues with the building that cannot be remedied through renovation alone.


The Department of Finance and Deregulation proposes to lease three levels of the new building at 1 Bligh Street, Sydney. The department is confident that it will achieve a far better CPO facility through contemporary design, shared facilities and the intelligent use of a superior building.


The new premises will also feature dedicated media facilities, including a live broadcast link capacity, something that has not been possible at 70 Phillip Street. One of the questions that the committee asked and was seeking reassurance about was on the telephone usage and the communications also at parking level within the planned facilities.


The committee is satisfied that the Department of Finance and Deregulation has fully considered all feasible options for the establishment of new Commonwealth parliamentary offices in Sydney, and that the selected option is a practical, long-term solution that represents value for money for the Commonwealth.


I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries, and the committee secretariat.


I commend the report to the House.

The Department of Finance and Deregulation proposes to lease three levels of the new building at 1 Bligh Street, Sydney. The department is confident that it will achieve a far better CPO facility through contemporary design, shared facilities and the intelligent use of a superior building.


The new premises will also feature dedicated media facilities, including a live broadcast link capacity, something that has not been possible at 70 Phillip Street. One of the questions that the committee asked and was seeking reassurance about was on the telephone usage and the communications also at parking level within the planned facilities.


The committee is satisfied that the Department of Finance and Deregulation has fully considered all feasible options for the establishment of new Commonwealth parliamentary offices in Sydney, and that the selected option is a practical, long-term solution that represents value for money for the Commonwealth.


I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries, and the committee secretariat.


I commend the report to the House.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-06-25,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (16:14):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. It is telling that the announcement of this legislation came just 10 days after the Leader of the Opposition announced the coalition's better plan for accountability and transparency for registered organisations. The government incorrectly accuses the coalition of not presenting policy. Well, here we have an example of the government attempting to mimic coalition policy. But this legislation does not go far enough. It does not include the measures that the coalition believes are required for true accountability and transparency for registered organisations.


There are strict rules to ensure that companies and their directors act appropriately. The coalition believes that these same rules should apply to registered organisations and to their officers. Only then can members of registered organisations be assured that their money is being used prudently. While this bill increases the penalties for officers of registered organisations, it does not go far enough. I shall now spend some time outlining some of the differences between the reporting obligations of companies and registered organisations, as well as some of the differences between directors of companies and officers of registered organisations.


The obligations on company directors are enforced by a number of regulatory bodies including the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and, where applicable, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Australians are confident in the ability of these organisations to regulate companies and their directors. The obligations on registered organisations and their officers are enforced only by Fair Work Australia. I do not have enough time to compare all of the obligations upon company directors with all of the obligations upon officers of registered organisations; however, I will take the time to outline some of the significant variations.


Section 180 of the Corporations Act requires that a director of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties with a degree of care and diligence. There is a similar provision in section 285 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The penalty for a breach by a company director is up to $200,000, while the provisions for an officer of a registered organisation currently apply a penalty of $2,200. The amendments contained within this bill, if passed, will increase the penalty for officers of registered organisations to $6,600, which is still a small fraction of the penalty applied to a company director.


Section 181 of the Corporations Act compels directors to exercise their powers and discharge their duties in good faith, in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose. This is reflected in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act in section 286. Again, the penalty for a breach by a company director is up to $200,000, while the penalty for an officer of a registered organisation according to this bill will be $6,600.


Section 182 of the Corporations Act has the provision that a director or officer of a company must not improperly use their position to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else, or to cause detriment to the corporation, while section 287 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act contains a similar provision. The penalty for directors of companies is—you guessed it—$200,000, while the penalty as amended by this legislation for a registered organisation is a princely $6,600. A provision that a company director or an officer of a registered organisation must not use information received in their position to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else or to cause detriment to another is in both the Corporations Act at section 183, and the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act at section 288. But again, we see the penalty for directors is $200,000, and the penalty in this bill as amended in relation to officers of a registered organisation is $6,600.


I trust that members are seeing a pattern developing here that, even under the provisions that this bill introduces, the penalties for directors of companies remain vastly higher than the penalties that would be imposed on an officer of a registered organisation. This pattern continues, with section 184 of the Corporations Act providing a criminal offence for directors that are reckless or intentionally dishonest and fail to exercise their powers or discharge their duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation or for proper purpose. There is no corresponding provision in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act and this bill does not introduce any. Under this bill, there are still no provisions creating criminal offences for officials of registered organisations. We have listened intently to the soap opera that has prevailed with regard to the HSU and the member for Dobell, and I stand here in stunned amazement that there has not been greater motivation to impose tougher penalties in relation to registered organisations.


In introducing this bill, the minister said:


This represents a significant increase in penalties to reflect the seriousness with which this government, and registered organisations, take compliance with workplace relations law.


For once, I agree with the minister. It does reflect the seriousness with which the government takes the sorts of breaches that this legislation deals with—it does not take it very seriously at all! It is all for slapping members of registered organisations on the wrist, whilst it is quite happy to hang directors out to dry, or to take them to the gallows or to the guillotine. If you are a member of a registered organisation you can do the HSU thing and you can misappropriate funds and you know the penalties will be light. This legislation does very little to improve that. It is nothing more than a slightly harder slap on the wrist. If a former union boss took compliance with workplace regulation seriously, he would welcome the coalition amendments which have criminal provisions for officers that are recklessly or intentionally dishonest, and which increase civil penalties in line with those applicable to company directors.


Some might think that these disproportionate penalties are appropriate when considering the large packages that some executives are reported to earn; however, these penalties also apply to mum and dad directors who might have little left after paying their employees, not just to directors of listed companies. As recent media has reported, the officers of registered organisations can also be earning substantial incomes, often many multiples of the income of the members that pay their wages. Just as directors have a duty to act prudently for the benefit of shareholders, officers of registered organisations must act prudently in the interests of their members.


This legislation sends all the wrong signals. The penalties in this legislation are a token gesture implemented by a government that is being dragged kicking and screaming to the reform process. It is nothing more than a token gesture. This legislation sends the message loud and clear that the government is not serious about dealing with the sort of unscrupulous behaviour that Fair Work Australia found was taking place at the Health Services Union. Labor is saying that it is a minor matter to defraud members and to act in a way that is contrary to the interests of members. The member for Chifley has said that union officials get paid less than company directors so the penalties should be less. This argument is absolute nonsense. These organisations control vast amounts of funds. They control in many cases the future of the members that they represent. The employees of registered organisations have the ability to inflict widespread harm on those for whose money they are effectively the custodians. Penalties should reflect the potential magnitude of the damage caused by a union officer's illegal action, not the size of their salary. The bottom line is that the fabled 'majority of union officers' who do the right thing by their members have absolutely nothing to fear from the significantly increased penalties proposed by the coalition because, if they do the right thing, if they act in the interests of their members, they will not be paying a penalty.


There are a range of matters not addressed by this bill. The coalition is concerned that former union bosses are regulating the current union bosses. That is an interesting situation—a very cosy situation. This concern is not limited to just the coalition, as constituents have also expressed their concern about the ability of Fair Work Australia to regulate unions. This bill does not address this concern. The coalition's plan for better transparency and accountability of registered organisations would have a registered organisations commission take over the roles of ensuring registered organisations do the right thing by their members and being answerable to parliament. This would address the real concern about Fair Work Australia's ability to do this job.


We have recently seen that there is a certain amount of confusion about Fair Work Australia's ability to cooperate with police and other agencies. The bill, while expanding police cooperation powers, does not make it expressly clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. I would have thought that cooperation with police forces would be an absolutely binding obligation on Fair Work Australia, not something that requires clarification at this point in time. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that it be absolutely clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. It is also important that Fair Work Australia be able to provide a brief of evidence to the DPP. Again, given the previous problems with this, it is important to give express powers to allow that to happen.


The coalition have been asking a number of questions. How can you take Labor seriously when the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was the head of the ACTU and when the minister responsible for this bill, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, sat on the ACTU when the member for Dobell also sat on the ACTU? A cosy little clique, indeed. How can you take Labor seriously when this happened right under Labor's nose while the member for Dobell was a member of parliament and Michael Williamson was the President of the Labor Party? How can you take Labor seriously on ensuring union bosses follow the rules when they have turned the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner into a toothless tiger? And how can you take Labor seriously when they still rely on the tainted vote of the member for Dobell?


This is a bill designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses and it will be enforced by former union bosses. It is a weak bill that does not go far enough. Union members, many of whom are in low-paying positions, pay their dues every week in the hope that their union will represent their interests. They should not have to put up with union fat cats using their money for long lunches, outrageous salaries and purposes unrelated to union business. Only the coalition has a plan to properly regulate unions. I call on the government to take some real action to improve union accountability.


We have seen in relation to the HSU the most egregious waste of the funds of union members—union members who work hard and go without to contribute their union dues. These are not members being paid the sorts of salaries that union officials are getting paid. They are everyday hardworking Australians who have seen their money squandered and who have real concerns about the future of the union.


The Australian Labor Party and the union movement do not need a complex review or a detailed examination of why union membership is declining. They need look no further than the mirror to see why they have a problem. They have a problem because the unions of today have lost sight of the goal for which they were established, and that was to look after the interests of the members. When you look at this legislation that has come out of the Australian Labor Party, the puppet of the union membership, you can see that the union movement is not concerned about accountability and having an organisation that works in the best interests of the members. The union movement is interested in perpetuating the personal benefits it can bestow on itself, quite clearly. Otherwise, we would have good penalties and some real teeth in this legislation: it would put sufficient sanctions in place to ensure officials appointed to union positions, who have under their charge large amounts of union funds, act in the interests of the thousands of members right around the country. It would have penalties that would be a serious deterrent, not mere slaps on the wrist as in this legislation.


This bill encapsulates so much of what is wrong with the modern Labor Party: a failure to really deal with the union movement to ensure that it is acting in the best interests not only of the members themselves but of the Australian people generally. We need to have much stronger sanctions. The coalition in government will right this problem if our amendments are not passed in this place now. Upon coming to government we will ensure that union members are as accountable as company directors. We will ensure that legislation will be in place to give union members the assurance that their money is being spent wisely, which the Australian Labor Party is not giving them. No wonder Australian workers are deserting the Labor Party. They are deserting the Labor Party because they know that the Labor Party are looking after themselves, not looking after their interests.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:28):  I start with an explanation: the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 before the House and the amendments we will move are not anti union. It is not about shackling unions to the extent that it would affect their ability to effectively represent their members. I fully acknowledge that from the Harvester award of 1907 to the election of the first female president of the ACTU in 1995, the union movement has had, and it continues to have, a significant impact on Australia's way of life. While we may disagree with the union movement on their methods and their aims, the Liberal Party from Menzies to Howard has always recognised the role unions play and the right they have to play that role. In the words of John Howard: 'We're anti-union control. We're anti-union domination. We're anti the unions having a monopoly role in the workplace, but,' 'We are not anti-union'. But this bill and the amendments the coalition seek are about lifting the standards of transparency and accountability of registered organisations, of which unions are one. It is about ensuring we do not have a repeat of the scandals of the Health Services Union, where 70,000 of the lowest paid, hardest working employees from the HSU had more than $500,000 of their money misused—misused on expensive dinners, misused on holidays, misused on escorts, misused on political campaigns and political staffers, misused to the point that this money will never be seen again.


Not to mention that HSU East made millions of dollars of expenditure without necessary controls or competition. The Temby report has detailed that over four years $2.4 million was spent on the HSU credit card without sufficient guidelines and documentation, and a whopping $17 million of contracts were entered into without a proper tender process. As documented by the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, Senator Abetz, there was: $5 million to Access Focus for what is believed to be consultancies and memorabilia; $4.9 million over three years to United Edge believed to be for IT services; and $3.4 million to Communigraphix over four years, believed to be for the union journal. And the list goes on, with the concerning revelation that some of the companies benefitting from these contracts were linked to Michael Williamson, the former President of the Australian Labor Party,


This is why we are here. This is why the coalition is taking the initiative in putting forward these amendments, to ensure that registered organisations such as unions are submitted to the same level of accountability and transparency as companies and their directors are under the Corporations Act. Under the current law, trade unions as registered organisations are subject to obligations under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. These include: not using their position for personal gain, ensuring the appropriate use of members' money and acting at all times in the best interests of the members.


But the penalties for the breach of these obligations are either minor and insufficient. Under section 287 and 288 of the Fair Work Act, civil penalties for using information to the detriment of the organisation or for personal advantage could involve fines of only up to $2,200 for an individual, and no criminal provisions apply. In contrast, under section 184 of the Corporations Act, criminal offences could lead to a fine of up to $200,000 for an individual or imprisonment for up to five years. These are serious penalties for serious crimes and this is what the coalition is seeking to achieve by moving these amendments.


What is more, the coalition believes we can no longer leave it to Fair Work Australia to police and enforce these obligations. The HSU scandal has shone a light on the deficiencies of Fair Work Australia. To take more than three years to investigate the allegations around Craig Thomson and then produce a document which is not even in the required format for the Director of Public Prosecutions is completely unacceptable. It is unacceptable to the coalition and unacceptable to the Australian people. The institutional go-slow and the incompetency displayed seriously undermined any possibility of an expeditious, effective and professional handling of the HSU matter.


What we need now is a new body, which the coalition proposes calling the Registered Organisations Commission, which will police and enforce these new compliance obligations rather than leaving it to the general manager. This new commission will take responsibility for educating members of registered organisations about their rights and acting as a repository of complaints from its members. The coalition understands that one has to separate Fair Work Australia from its day-to-day role solving disputes and making agreements, from its watchdog role ensuring proper accountability and transparency. In the words of Peter Anderson, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry head:


We need to separate some of these roles so that the arbitral side, the decision making side that affects employers and affects industry is quite distinct from the traditional role that scrutinises unions and employers organisations.


How right he is.


The problem with the government's bill is that it does not go far enough. Do not take my word for it: Labor's member for Barton and the former Attorney-General in the Rudd government, Robert McClelland, said as much in his speech to the parliament last week. And if you do not want to take his word for it, read the speech of the National Secretary of the Health Services Union, Kathy Jackson, to the HR Nicholls Society just a few weeks ago, where she made a similar point, saying: 


... I believe that there is a very strong case for extending, to the full extent possible and applicable, the same governance, investigation and enforcement provisions that apply to other corporations, generally those registered under the Corporations Act, to unions.


You see, the government's bill is a timid reaction to the loud public outrage and it is an inadequate response to the coalition's lead on the issue. Just look at the details. Under the government's bill the rules are still weak, the penalties are still weak and Fair Work Australia is still left to police these registered organisations, despite its failed record. Under the government's bill there is no real attempt to apply the standards of the Corporations Act to those of registered organisations. Under the government's bill there is no specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence. Under the government's bill there is no requirement for Fair Work Australia to report to the parliament and explain why an investigation has taken longer than a year. Under the government's bill that ere is no specific provision making it clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police at the start, during and at the end of the investigation. These are all deficiencies in the government's legislation which will be rectified by the coalition's amendments.


We have to understand that, despite the falling membership of unions, representing as they do only around 13 per cent of the private sector workforce and around 18 per cent of the overall workforce, unions are still big businesses. Unions are big businesses and their financials reflect as much. In an important report released by the Institute of Public Affairs, entitled Australian trade unions: an alternate regulatory approach, Olivia Graham and the irrepressible John Lloyd gave us a snapshot of some these financials. For example, in 2010 the CFMEU's construction and general branch in the Victorian division held net assets worth $42 million, including $4.5 million worth of investment properties and $25 million worth of property, plant and equipment. In 2011 the Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing Federation held $21,768 million in net assets and earned just over $6 million in net revenue. These are just some of the individual state based divisions. When one accumulates the net assets of the total union movement, it is easy to understand how unions can put together tens of millions of dollars every election for their brothers in the Labor Party. Given these large numbers, it is absolutely critical that the standards of financial transparency and accountability within the union movement are lifted.


In conclusion, we cannot afford to have another repeat of the HSU scandal. The Australian public will not stand for it, union members will not stand for it and the coalition will not stand for it. The coalition's amendments put before the House are a step forward They will enhance transparency, they will strengthen accountability and they will ensure that unions, which are big businesses, are subject to the same analysis, the same accountability, the same standards and the same transparency as are corporations and their directors. I recommend the amendments to the House.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (16:41):  I rise also to speak on the amendments to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. Once again in the chamber we find ourselves at an interesting juncture in the politics of our nation. In the past few weeks in the parliament, we have seen lateral transfers for defence families moved by the opposition and adopted by the government; and the victims of terrorism bill, a private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition, adopted by the government. Here, 10 days ago, we saw the Leader of the Opposition announce the coalition's better plan for accountability and transparency for registered organisations and, 10 days later, we have a bill introduced by the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Shorten, to address just that matter. It appears that the opposition is governing with its ideas and programs. Once again we see a bill in response to something. In the act-react cycle, we seem to act and the government reacts, rather than doing what it is elected to do—that is, to address the very serious problems that we have seen with the Health Services Union and unions more broadly in Australia today.


Given that we apply such stringent rules to corporations in the Corporations Act, it is not unfair in the light of the stunning and explosive revenue elations made by Fair Work Australia in their report into the Health Services Union that we look at legislation to improve the transparency and quality of registered organisations including unions. That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition proposed in the coalition's plan for better accountability and transparency for registered organisations. In this bill, we see the provisions lacking in a number of ways, and that is attempting to address a problem when you are not really addressing a problem. That is why we have proposed some very serious amendments. I am going to outline some of those shortly.


We believe, however, that the coalition has a better plan to make sure that the money of the members of these very serious organisations—which are now responsible for large amounts of money and investments and responsible for the lives of so many poor and other people at the bottom end of the scale—is spent responsibly and properly. We require the same thing from corporations and boards of directors. In the same way, when we see a Lehman Brothers style collapse, we say: 'That is terrible. Those people mismanaged their risk and their money, and those people should be dealt with.' In the same way, as the Health Services Union has, explosively, revealed serious problems and fraud, we ought to now apply the rule of law. That is why in our amendment we are bringing penalties in line with the Corporations Act, and seeking to bring across to the registered organisations act section 184 of the Corporations Act, which would make it a criminal offence for bosses of registered organisations to not act in good faith, to use their position dishonestly or to be reckless. I do not understand how that could be opposed by the government considering that is what governing is all about.


Applying the rule of law means extending the power we apply from government to negate behaviour, and the main mechanism with which we can negate this style of behaviour is the law. The Corporations Act into the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act's section 184 would provide for that, thereby negating these acts of people in registered organisations. It is an appropriate and a fair way of addressing this matter.


Further, with regard to the government's increases to the civil penalties proposed in this bill, we are seeking to further increase those penalties in line with the Corporations Act. In this modern approach to dealing with registered organisations and unions, given the seriousness of the role that they occupy in today's society, it is appropriate that the penalties mirror those in the Corporations Act that apply to boards of directors and other office bearers in corporations. That does not appear to be controversial, but the fact that it is missing from this legislation is a big gap in the government's approach.


Other issues that we have with this bill include the fact that Fair Work Australia is still in control. The approach that Fair Work Australia has taken in recent times in these investigations highlights the need for legislation to improve the situation in how Fair Work Australia addresses matters. We feel that putting Fair Work Australia in charge without considerable increases in its ability or the provision that we would make on it from this place is a weak approach. We want Fair Work Australia to have the ability to make sure its investigations are done properly. We saw three years of failure to cooperate with police, for example, with Fair Work Australia claiming it could not produce a brief of evidence. From our amendments, and from what is missing in the government's legislation, how we can take this bill seriously when it is not proposing to give specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence, given that this was one of the main criticisms of the approach that Fair Work Australia has taken? So in our amendments we are seeking to give Fair Work Australia the appropriate requirements to make sure it cooperates with police and that it can produce a brief of evidence.


We also want to make sure this parliament has a mechanism, if Fair Work Australia is not delivering on its obligations to investigate in a timely fashion, to prevent us from seeing a repeat of the situation where Fair Work Australia could take as long as it likes and be open to the perception or the accusation, which it was, that there was political interference. Whether there was or not is not my place to say, but the accusation and the perception could be made about Fair Work Australia because the parliament has no mechanism to ensure that it is acting in a timely fashion. Having reports to parliament at the year mark, and then every six months after that, as to how an investigation is going and what the expected progress will be would provide accountability and transparency into the future.


Once again, this is not subjective or targeted at anybody, and there is nothing for the government to really object to except proper transparency and accountability. That is what we are providing for with our amendments. I do not understand, and I would love to hear the government argue, why it would not be appropriate in future investigations to ensure that Fair Work Australia's investigations are held to a high standard and perceived to be at a high standard, and that at least confidence can be held in the operation of Fair Work Australia.


As I discussed, we propose increasing penalties for misusing members' funds, and the stories that we have seen out of the Health Services Union have shattered public confidence in that union, particularly for those very hardworking people in the health sector who do such a great job and who decide to contribute by joining a union. It may surprise the government and others to know that I am not against people joining unions. I think, inherently, a person's right to join a union and collaborate with others to collectively bargain to improve their conditions in the workforce is an appropriate use of their time and an appropriate choice for a person to make. 


In a free society, trade unions would operate effectively on behalf of their members. I think, though, it is an inherent mistake made by unions that they are affiliated with one political party in Australia—I put that right out there. That mix of politics and unionism in Australia has led to a situation where every member of the Labor Party in this place is a trade union official, where vast sums of members' money from lowly paid workers end up in a political party's coffers, and where the Health Services Union is mixed up at the centre of a national political scandal. In a way, that is unedifying not only for the parliament but also for unions, workers and trade unionists. There is no accident in all of that; a series of mistakes have been made.


This bill could go much further in what it is doing to make sure that this situation is rectified in some way. I do not believe we can take the government seriously with this bill when we consider that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was the head of the ACTU and the minister responsible for this bill, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, was in the ACTU at a similar time as many people who have been caught up in this problem. There are too many of these issues going around, and while there is nothing specific that we would level at anybody here, these amendments are designed to give strength, purpose and meaning to a real agenda to make registered organisations transparent and accountable. It is an appropriate and important use of this parliament's power and privilege to make sure that we do so when given the opportunity.


We have seen, given the scandal that has surrounded the Health Services Union—whose report is 12,000 pages, 900 of which deal with the former secretary of the Health Services Union—that there is real cause for concern about penalties. The coalition's amendment, particularly in relation to the disclosure of information to police, is something that ought to be supported by everybody here to make sure that in future, where there are allegations of serious misconduct, people have to cooperate with police and disclose information, and that people and officers at Fair Work Australia can cooperate fully with police at all stages of an investigation. 


It is important that we clarify the position, that we ensure that we signal to Fair Work Australia that, like every other citizen, corporation or entity in Australia, we ask of them that they cooperate with law enforcement agencies. We do not want any obstacles in the way of that cooperation, and if there are any obstacles from this parliament we want to ensure, through an amendment, that they are removed so that every officer of Fair Work Australia can then cooperate.


We find with many of these amendments before us that are proposed by the coalition that they would provide a very fair platform for the operation of registered organisations to ensure a minimising of criminal activity and other incorrect conduct, to put it politely. That this bill is designed by a former union boss to regulate other union bosses is a valid criticism and many members have made that comment in this place. I do not think it is appropriate that former union bosses design the rules for the next generation of union bosses. That is the flaw in this legislation. They may think this is something that will address the situation, but, when you go through it and look at how this bill came about—literally, the Leader of the Opposition proposed the coalition's plan, Minister Shorten came to this parliament and announced this legislation and now, here we are, debating it a short time later—it highlights that, really, this is a reaction rather than an action. 


The government did not choose to act, despite how long this Fair Work Australia investigation has been going, how long the report has been in the public domain and how serious it is in nature. The government did not say, 'This is quite serious. We really want to act on this. We'd prefer to do something. We're not going to let the opposition get a jump on us. We're not going to let them propose what to do and then react to it. We're going to propose some pretty serious measures and ensure that this does not happen again.' That way, everyone would be better off. The parliament, the union movement and registered organisations in Australia would improve in quality and be more transparent.


I think we have seen the government's agenda exposed a little. That is what is important to realise here. I guess the government's agenda is not so much about fixing this problem; it is about being perceived to be doing something about it. There is a very big distinction here, because the coalition's amendment underscores, line by line, issue by issue, that if you were serious you would be much tougher. If you were serious you would give force to what you are saying. If you were serious, provision by provision, you would have much more detail and there would be many more actual powers to ensure that Fair Work Australia had to cooperate with the police and had the power to provide a brief of evidence, ensure that, if reports were taking too long, there was a mechanism for the parliament to address them and ensure, of course, that penalties applied—that the main force and power we can give to legislation, the power to penalise, was the same as in the Corporations Act and was there to be used when this sort of situation came up.


While we do not oppose the bill itself, we have proposed these amendments. They are serious, measured amendments. They are not unfair to anybody. They are to give effect to what should be a bill to improve transparency in registered organisations in Australia to ensure that this situation does not arise again without any real recourse in law to address it effectively and quickly, where Fair Work Australia took so long to do so little about something so serious. That is why we need better legislation.


The coalition are proud to have flagged our plan for the government, and we are happy to see the government react. If they do not have the ideas, we are happy to see them react our ideas. But, when you have that reaction, I think you also have to look at the people who originated the transparency and accountability plan and listen to us very carefully about the serious strengthening amendments that we are proposing to ensure that this legislation can work effectively.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:55):  I applaud some of the remarks that the previous speaker made. His endorsement might be in a fair bit of trouble as a result of some of the remarks he made, but I applaud him for them. However, he started talking about unionists having a responsibility to speak up and the fact that the amendments being moved by the Liberal Party will overcome that problem. We have the situation with the building workers union where there is a right to silence enjoyed by everyone everywhere in the world. I do not know of any jurisdictions, outside of one-party government countries, where you have no right to silence. I will not go into all the arguments about why you should have a right to silence; suffice it to say that every country in the world provides that right to silence.


I have not seen the amendments—I could be critical and say that I did not get the courtesy of receiving the amendments—so, not having seen them, all I can do is comment upon what the previous two speakers said. In the building workers union, if the police ask you a question and you refuse to answer it, they can jail you and jail you pretty well indefinitely at their discretion. We are on very dangerous ground when fundamental freedoms are taken off people. I do not want to go into all the issues around that building workers legislation. It was only under threat from the crossbenchers that the ALP moved to remove what were abominable discretionary powers that were given to these various authorities. There had not been a single problem in almost the last seven years and there was no justification. There may be justification for some oppressive legislation in the short term to fix a short-term problem, but I would think that you would never introduce that type of legislation without a sunset clause upon it. I find it very hard to envisage a situation where fundamental freedoms and rights are taken away to overcome a temporary problem that has arisen, however bad that problem might be.


Let me turn from generalities to the bill before the House, which is aimed at increasing the responsibilities upon trade union officials in the area of accountability. The unions have all agreed to it, but I suspect that a number of them have agreed to it because they are too scared to say they do not agree to it, because someone might start looking at them and thinking that they have something to hide.


I came into this place out of a terrible baptism, which was the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland, where we had some people at the heart of police corruption. I say with very great pride that we had the courage, with our eyes open, knowing the great dangers that we took, to try to go after that centre of corruption in the police force. Most certainly it was not Terry Lewis but, on the evidence, it would appear that he was playing a part in protecting these people.


In doing that, we unleashed a monster. Monsters have been unleashed with the Salem witch burnings and the McCarthy hearings in the United States. We can find a hundred examples: the Spanish Inquisition; the burning of books in Nazi Germany; Oliver Cromwell's regime in England. There are many examples of the psychological phenomenon of witch burning. We most certainly suffered that in Queensland, and it made me very conscious of the enormous injustices that are perpetrated—in a lot of cases, upon public officials such as politicians. The leading case is Brian Austin, a minister in Queensland who was effectively the first one to go to jail. Let everyone in this place listen to this with some fear and trembling. He was jailed because he took his government car to visit his kids who were at boarding school in Armidale. He spent three years in a cage, like an animal, because he did that.


Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Owens, you would be aware that almost every government official in Australia—and I do not just mean politicians—has a government motor car which will be used for private purposes today. Whether it is picking up the kids from school or picking up a loaf of bread on the way home, it falls within that definition. But when the old witch-hunt occurs watch out, because there is no such thing as justice here. I am just worried that the government may have acted somewhat excessively in this area—and I most certainly would not be cheering the opposition on in their attacks here.


Turning to the issue of collective bargaining in Australia, I had the very great honour of addressing two of the trade unions' annual general meetings. I think at least one of them knew of my book on the history of Australia from 1890 to 1910. In that book was a very fine tribute to trade unionism in this country. We had a situation a hundred years ago in which one in 31 of us who went down the mines never came back up again. They died a terrible death from miner's phthisis or, worse still, in many cases they were buried alive. And this was not confined to mining. Of the 2,000 men who worked digging the sewerage ditches in Sydney—they were working down eight or nine feet deep and there was no circulation of air—every single one who worked there for more than two years died of miner's phthisis.


And if you are looking for the reasons for the formation of the Labor Party in Australia, look no further than miner's phthisis. The first Labor head of government elected anywhere in the world was in Queensland—Anderson Dawson, from my own family's hometown of Charters Towers. We were in Charters Towers before there was a Charters Towers. Anderson Dawson was the member of parliament for Charters Towers and the first Labor premier elected anywhere in the world. He left parliament because he had contracted lung disease, miner's phthisis, whilst he was mining. Andrew Fisher, the second Labor Prime Minister of this country, also had to leave politics on account of miner's phthisis, and his father also died from miner's phthisis.


The black people who were employed in the mines in South Africa, even though they were very poorly treated, had legislation protecting them from miner's phthisis—damping-down legislation. When they were using machine drills, which came in the 1890s, they needed damping-down legislation. It was given by the white people of South Africa to protect the black people who worked down in the mines. In Wales the miners were treated even worse. They had a steel collar welded around their neck with a number on it and they were not allowed to leave their place of work, by law. They were very much in a slave-like activity. Ken Follett wrote a very good novel based upon the situation in Wales.


Even though those people were treated like dogs and slaves, they still had protection for damping down. But in this country we did not. We had to form a union. One of the leaders of that very great union, the AWU, is in here today—and very proudly, I would think. The union was formed to combat and overcome, mainly by Ted Theodore when he went down the mine for the second time in his life and saw his mates die. That was his fork in the road to Damascus. He formed a union and he took over the running of Queensland within seven years. The people were so grateful for what he did for them—and I pay tribute to trade unionism in this. It was not just what that great union leader did for the workers and the employees. He took the land off the landed gentry, who to a large degree were foreign corporations, and redistributed it to Queenslanders. 


Probably half of the landowners in Queensland today, if they trace it back, got their original land from the redistribution policies of the Theodore government. They gave us the land so that we Australians could make a quid. And our farmers were given statutory marketing arrangements. Our dairy farmers were not told what they would be paid. They said, 'You'll pay us this amount of money via an arbitrated price'—and similarly with the workers.When the dairy farmers lost that arbitrated price their price went from 59c a litre the day before deregulation to 42c a litre the day after. Every member of this place should reflect upon the fact that they belong to a political party that participated in what the very famous dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Queensland, the most distinguished of Australia's economics faculties, Ted Colson, said in addressing a meeting. He said the three great shames of this nation were the way that we treated the men who came home from Vietnam, the way we treated the first Australians and what we did to the dairy farmers of Australia through deregulation.


Without the trade union movement we would live in a deregulated marketplace. It is easy for the speaker before last to get up and say that the unions should not give money to the ALP. If they had not, we would have a deregulated labour market in this country. To the eternal shame of the Liberal Party in Queensland, the Premier of Queensland stood up two weeks before the election and said that there will be no fly-in miners from overseas. No, what he said was, 'I'm not in favour of fly-in mining from overseas.' That was two weeks before the election. Five weeks after the election he stood up and said, 'There will be fly-in mining from overseas in Queensland.' It was a very different party before the election and after the election.


But to see a Labor government here in Canberra give the green light to flying in foreign workers from overseas! Madam Deputy Speaker, your predecessor, Mr Slipper, removed a picture of Charlie McDonald, the first member for Kennedy and my predecessor. Every speech Charlie gave in this House in his early years in the parliament was against bringing in foreign workers from overseas to undermine pay rates, to undermine safety conditions, to work for nothing and to take jobs that should have come to the local worker.


That is the contribution being made by the trade union movement. Some of them have had the courage to speak out against flying in foreign workers. In Queensland 299,000 people are registered for full-time employment but cannot get a job, with 200,000 of those unable to get a job at all. And there is Gina Rinehart telling us that she has to fly in workers from overseas. As for the assurances provided to us by the federal government, they are not worth the paper they are written on. They should be ashamed of themselves for insulting the trade union movement of Australia with such absolute rubbish like, 'We'll make sure that there is no Australian available for that position.' There would not be a member in this place that has not driven a truck around the provisions of section 457. I most certainly have. So, if you can drive around section 457, you will most certainly be able to drive it around this— (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (17:11):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. This bill will amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 to increase the financial and accountability obligations of registered organisations and their office holders, strengthen the investigative powers of Fair Work Australia and enhance remedies under the registered organisations act.


Let me start by highlighting that the need for greater oversight of registered organisations has come from Fair Work Australia itself. In its statement regarding investigations into the HSU, Fair Work Australia said of the Health Services Union:


The investigation reveals an organisation that abjectly failed to have adequate governance arrangements in place to protect union members' funds against misuse. Substantial funds were, in my view, spent inappropriately including on escort services, spousal travel, and excessive travel and hospitality expenditure.


These revelations are a clear indicator that there is an urgent need to ensure that money paid by members to registered organisations is used for proper purposes. The 1,200-page report, to the disgust of the people of Australia, detailed the financial misuse and inappropriate manner in which the hard-earned money of Health Services Union members was spent by senior union officials. It is an absolute shame that an organisation that has purported for many years to represent hardworking Australians and their rights has now been exposed as having zero regard and respect for those workers.


In saying that, I do associate my comments with those of previous members who have highlighted that there are unions that do an outstanding job. In the workplace there are organisations that do represent their members and provide value. I was always of the opinion that unions could have done much more, in particular, in building the Bowen Basin and now the Galilee Basin. Unions could have done a lot more in providing far better value for their members. But that is a debate for another day.


The revelations that union members' money was spent by union officials on escort agencies, travel, restaurants and huge cash withdrawals are a disgrace to say the least. It clearly demonstrates that there is an urgent need to ensure that money paid by members to registered organisations is used responsibly, appropriately and in a transparent way.


Today's bill will amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, which sets out the statutory obligations and privileges for so-called registered organisations. These include both federally registrable employee associations—trade unions—and federally registrable employer associations, which includes employer associations and industry associations. The task of administering obligations and responsibilities imposed on registered organisations currently belongs to the General Manager of Fair Work Australia. Such obligations include ensuring that financial statements and associated reporting requirements are met. Powers include the ability to conduct inquiries, investigate registered organisations and pursue allegations of breaches.


This bill seems little more than a hasty attempt by those opposite to give the appearance that they are making an effort to resolve the many issues plaguing the oversight of registered organisations. The reality is that this bill falls well short of doing what is necessary and we in the coalition have a number of real concerns about it. The rules and requirements as a result of the changes are still significantly weaker than those expected of company directors.


I bring the House's attention to company directors. When one hears that term one automatically thinks of the corporate top end of town—the Monopoly type of corporate director. That is not necessarily the case. The company directors in my electorate are the local mechanic and the local butcher. They may be someone who has a combined household income of around $100,000 per annum and the advice that they have received from the Taxation Office is to set up a company structure for taxation benefits, rather than give $50,000 to the husband and $50,000 to the wife as is often the case. I implore the House: when you hear the term company director do not think of the Reserve Bank, do not think of those directors of the board of multinational companies; send your thoughts to the local mechanic, the local butcher and the local businessman, because they are the people in my electorate who will ultimately be affected.


The rules and requirements as a result of the changes are still significantly weaker than those expected of a company director. While the penalties are in line with other civil penalties in the Fair Work Act, they still fall considerably short of those required under the Corporations Act. Here we have a situation where we have one set of rules under the Corporations Act for our company directors and another set of rules for our union mates. It is a juxtaposition. Why are we in this position, having this discussion? Why is this bill before the House? It was only last week in the Federation Chamber that I put up a private member's motion which sought to implement a plan that would exact the same standards of accountability and transparency from union leaders as is expected of company directors under the Corporations Act. You should have seen the Labor members of this House with union links that got up and said, 'We don't need any more transparency; we oppose the private member's motion that you put up.' There was a member who supported my motion because he was actually there and listened to it. The other members that came in were automatically opposed.


I put the private member's motion up because the unions were calling for it. The unions themselves, through the papers and their organisations, were calling for it—because there is a stench around the union movement at the moment with reference to transparency and accountability. Take, for example, the comment of the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, David Oliver. He said:



… 
every union member in this country has a right to know that 
… 
their money is going to be subject to good governance and good regulation.


The National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howes, has said that he supports bringing unions' accountability and transparency in line with the Corporations Act. Here we have two predominant unions saying that they support stronger transparency in the organisations. Furthermore, in his opening address for the 2012 congress, Mr Oliver said that unions:


… have a significant responsibility to our members to ensure and make double sure that members’ money is only used for purposes to advance our members’ interests.


The recent Fair Work Australia report leaves those comments in question.


The bill, while expanding police cooperation powers, does not make it expressly clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia it is important that this is made absolutely clear. I ask the minister, when making his final comments, to clarify that point. In addition to clarifying their responsibilities to police, I would also like to have some further conversation on the brief of evidence from Fair Work Australia and its transition to the next progressive path in the event of untoward activities. Furthermore, there is express provision to allow Fair Work Australia to provide a brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Again, given previous problems with this, it is important to include express powers to enable this to happen. It should be noted that these provisions are frankly unnecessary but need to be supported given the circumstances.


As my colleague here in the chamber, the member for Ryan, recently asked: why has this bill come about? She asked that question in a previous speech. Why does the political wing of the union movement all of a sudden feel a stronger stance against corruption and misappropriation must be taken? Is it because it is the right and honest thing to do? Is it a proactive step to stamp out cynicism within the union movement? Is it to finally put unions on the level legislative playing field that their corporate equivalents are on and impose the same kind of punishments for infringements when the only difference is where the money is coming from? No, it is not. The government lacks the moral fortitude to do something like that. It is simply because they were shamed and embarrassed into some reaction by the scandals and disgraces of the Health Services Union that have plagued this government. It is because they have been shamed by the strong leadership demonstrated by Tony Abbott on the issue and the strong stance that he is taking in bringing this situation to the fore.


The coalition is proposing eight amendments to improve the design of the bill and outcomes for workers. Most importantly we will create a new organisation to oversee the registered organisations. We suggest that setting up the organisation, as noted in the amendment, should be supported by the government. It is absolutely consistent with the government's position on the safe roads legislation; they appropriated $15 million to set up a tribunal to oversee so-called road fatalities and employment contracts in the transport workers' sector. So what we are asking for in our amendment has a precedent, and we would suggest that this government will and should support the amendments attached here.


The coalition will seek to remove the responsibility of the General Manager of Fair Work Australia to ensure compliance and shift to a new, separate and independent body which will be called the Registered Organisations Commission. This commission will fall under the auspices of the office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. It will be able to use the Fair Work Ombudsman's network and resources where appropriate and will ultimately report and be answerable to the parliament. The coalition's amendments include provision that, should a report be delayed, the commission must report to the parliament and inform the parliament of why there is a delay. The time that Fair Work Australia took to process recent investigations was nothing less than shambolic. We must implement changes in legislation to shift away from a place where situations like that can ever be repeated in this country.


The commission will also be responsible for educating registered organisations about the new obligations, and will be able to receive complaints from members and provide information about what they can do if there is a problem or a complaint. Just as there is a specific rule which applies to companies and board directors to ensure that they are doing the right thing, that rule should apply to registered organisations and their officers. So the coalition will move amendments to ensure that the penalties are the same as those applying to company directors and ensure that the Registered Organisations Commission has powers broadly in line with those provided to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.


When we come into this House we often get bashed up about saying, 'No, no, no.' The reality is: 80 per cent of the legislation that goes through this place is unopposed.




Mr Tudge:
  It's 87 per cent, isn't it?




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I have just been corrected by the member for Aston; 87 per cent of the legislation that goes through here is unopposed. We do support good legislation, but we will be the first to oppose bad legislation. One key amendment will seek to bring across section 184 of the Corporations Act into the registered organisations act. This would make it a criminal offence for bosses of registered organisations to not act in good faith, to use their position dishonestly or to be reckless. The coalition's amendment will seek to further increase penalties, in line with the Corporations Act. Believe it or not, the penalties for comparable offences by the officials in registered organisations are almost nonexistent. Similar obligations under sections 287 and 288 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 as to using information for personal advantage or causing detriment to an organisation are limited to civil penalties of $2,200 for an individual, and there are no criminal provisions.


In conclusion, I believe that this is a poor bill that will not deal with the substantive issues born out of Fair Work Australia's investigations. It goes without saying that the seemingly never-ending saga of Fair Work Australia's investigations into the Health Services Union has made it absolutely clear that major reform in this area is needed. However, I believe that the reform is needed in the management rather than the legislation. The assessment of the former Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland MP, in the submission by the Institute of Public Relations noting that there are areas of the bill that can be strengthened, is highly accurate. He commented:


The bill is a step in the right direction. However, its reforms are modest and do not go far enough.


Finally, without doubt this bill and the proposed coalition amendments are a sure method that will provide greater protection to Australians in the workplace. For too long, unions have escaped proper scrutiny and finally this has exploded with the investigation of the Health Services Union and the protracted investigation by Fair Work Australia. I commend this bill, and I commend the amendments— (Time expired)

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (17:26):  There are only two reasons that we are here debating the bill in front of us, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. The first is the sheer stench surrounding the Craig Thomson affair. Such is the stench that it has embarrassed the government into taking some action against some of their mates in the trade union movement through this bill. More importantly, it is that the opposition put out a plan to actually tackle the problem with unregulated unions just 10 days before—the coalition's plan for better transparency and accountability of registered organisations. That is the real reason that we are here discussing this bill today: we put forward a proactive proposal to deal with some of the issues which were raised throughout the Craig Thomson affair, and Labor is now rapidly trying to catch up. They are putting this bill forward so that they can pretend that they are also taking some action.


But it is a good thing that we are taking some action, and it is a good thing that we are debating trade unions and how they are regulated, their transparency and the amount of protection which is provided them in legislation. Frankly, at the moment, there is insufficient protection for union members, there is insufficient transparency and there are insufficient penalties applying to people who have breached the legislation. And the 1,200-page report of Fair Work Australia made this point very, very clearly—it found dozens upon dozens of examples of breaches of the law by the Health Services Union. Nearly every Australian would now be aware of some of these breaches, where thousands of dollars—indeed, hundreds of thousands of dollars—was misappropriated by union officials within the Health Services Union, for cash advances, for exorbitant travel, for fine dining for the union leaders and, of course, for escort services. In addition to this, almost $300,000 was appropriated by the Health Services Union for the election campaign of the now member for Dobell who, at the time, was the leader of the Health Services Union.


It was very clear from that 1,200-page report that the regulations and transparency were not sufficient to capture some of those issues. Is this the only union where these practices are going on? We simply do not know. We do know that, for example, in the construction union, all sorts of unlawfulness was discovered by the Cole royal commission—it found over 100 breaches of the law, on building and construction sites, by the building and construction trade union. So clearly there is a case that the regulations which govern trade unions are insufficient. There is clearly a case that that is happening. We actually have bipartisan agreements that the current laws are insufficient. I am pleased to see Minister Combet here because he also agrees with this proposition that the existing laws are insufficient to properly regulate and provide protections for trade union members today. Where we do disagree, though, is on the plan put forward to tackle this issue. We believe that this bill the minister has put forward goes some of the way but not far enough and fails to deal with all of the issues which are uncovered and documented in the 1,200-page Fair Work Australia report.


There are four key problems with this bill, which we believe need to be amended. Indeed, the coalition is putting forward amendments to deal with them. The first is that the bill before us still sees Fair Work Australia in control of investigating registered organisations. We simply believe that they are not up to the job to do that. We think that they have insufficient time and insufficient focus to do that. This was evidenced by the Fair Work Australia report into the Health Services Union. It took over three years to do the investigation. The report should have taken much less time than that. Furthermore, at the end of that 3½ years it was still not in a sufficient state for the police, the department or the Director of Public Prosecutions to be able to use it to action some of the egregious breaches which were outlined in that report.


So Fair Work Australia is not the right body to properly regulate and scrutinise registered organisations. We believe there should be a separate independent expert body which does that. Consequently, we are putting forward an amendment which would suggest that a registered organisations commission be established which would oversee registered organisations and would have the teeth to be able to properly scrutinise them and properly see that trade unions are being held accountable to their membership.


The second problem is that the bill does not expressly provide for Fair Work Australia the ability to cooperate with the police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that this be made absolutely clear in the bill. It must be made clear that Fair Work Australia must, in the appropriate circumstances, provide a brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions, if required. This should not be required, of course, in ordinary circumstances. In ordinary circumstances you would think that Fair Work Australia itself would actually go about doing the right thing and developing that brief of evidence to go to the Director of Public Prosecutions. But, again, the case of the Health Services Union proves that we in fact do need to make this part of legislation, because they spent 3½ years investigating this case and yet still did not provide the proper brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Furthermore, they did not cooperate with the police throughout that 3½ years of the investigation, despite the predecessor body to Fair Work Australia expressly recommending the day before Fair Work Australia was established that it should in fact put the Craig Thomson affair to the police. But they did not. We think that is disgraceful. We therefore think that there needs to be separate legislation to properly specify this in the relevant legislation which governs trade unions.


Third, the requirements and the penalties in this bill are still not in line with the Corporations Act. We think there should be a simple principle enacted in this legislation. That simple principle is that what is good for corporations is good for trade unions. In relation to penalties, for example, if the actions which were taken by the Health Services Union officials in the Craig Thomson affair occurred inside a company then individual directors may have been criminally liable for some of those things, may have had a $200,000 personal fine and could have landed in jail for up to five years. That is what occurs in the Corporations Act with the sort of egregious behaviour that we saw inside the Health Services Union. But underneath the Fair Work Australia act the penalty is up to $2,200. So you can appropriate hundreds of thousands of dollars and you can spend union members' money on prostitutes, on cash withdrawals or on your re-election campaign and the penalty is $2,200. And it is a civil penalty only.


We should be listening to Mr McClelland, the former Attorney-General, as well, who suggests that actually, if people are found guilty of such an offence, not only should they suffer greater penalties in line with the Corporations Act but also they should have to repay that money—because it is often the money of the lowest paid workers in the country that we are talking about which the trade union leaders are misappropriating for their own purposes. We do not think that is good enough. Consequently, we are putting forward amendments to bring the penalties in line with the Corporations Act.


This also goes to the issue of transparency and basic fiduciary obligations. Everybody knows that if you are a company director or a company executive you have to outline exactly where the money is being spent by a company. Executive remuneration is transparent and other measures are transparently laid out in relation to the company's accounts. We also know that company directors have to operate under fiduciary obligations. That is, they have legal obligations to act in the best interests of their company shareholders. Again, we think the trade union leaders should equally have to follow those basic guidelines. We will, again, move amendments to ensure this.


My final criticism is that the bill before us has no reporting mechanism on why investigations are going over time. It should not, frankly, have to take almost four years for an investigation to occur, with no explanation as to why it is taking almost four years. An egregious abuse of members' money should not have to take four years to investigate. It should only be a relatively short process. It should be done expediently and, if there are delays in the investigation, there should be a public statement as to why there are such delays. That, again, is a measure which we are putting forward.


In conclusion, this bill gives the perception, the pretence, that the government are concerned about corrupt practices inside trade unions, but it is just that—a pretence. They are not fair dinkum about how they are regulating trade unions through this bill. The measures do not stack up against how companies are regulated and how company directors are held accountable. The measures do not stack up in relation to transparency, and we believe that they should. The measures do not stack up in relation to the proper penalties which apply to company directors, and they should equally apply to trade union officials. Finally, the measures do not stack up in regard to the independence of the authority which has regulatory oversight of trade unions, as there indeed is an independent body which oversees the regulations governing corporations.


We are pleased that we are debating this, but we are putting forward serious amendments which we believe the government should enact. They should adopt those amendments. They would strengthen the bill and give confidence to all Australians and to all union members that their money is being protected and is being used wisely by the union leaders.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:39):  When I introduced this bill I confirmed that this government believes in a free and independent trade union movement. We believe in the advocacy of employer organisations on behalf of their members. We believe in the accountability of these registered organisations to their members.


I thank the representatives of employer organisations who, unlike those opposite, have seen fit to support our bill in its entirety. I thank the trade unions who have worked with the government as well to develop this legislation through the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council. Together we have achieved a rare feat in the workplace relations space—consensus. This consensus on the key elements of the bill was achieved without compromising the core principles underpinning the government's policy position. These principles are: respect for the role played by trade unions and employer organisations in our society and our workplace relations system; respect for the members who are entitled to expect that their interests remain the primary motivating factor for these organisations; and strong compliance with the rules of organisations as well as the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act for improved rule structures, better investigation powers and procedures with Fair Work Australia for a tripling of penalties for breaches.


I would also thank those members of this place who have spoken in favour of this bill, including those on the cross benches. Unlike others in this debate who have sought to smear and malign the trade union movement with innuendo and false charge, I have been and this government have been consistent in their approach to recent events involving compliance with the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. We have consistently stated our view, but the Fair Work investigations must be allowed to conclude without political interference. Fair Work Australia is an institution independent of the executive. We do not resile from the fact that the reports by the delegate of the general manager of Fair Work Australia into the HSU Victoria No. 1 branch and the HSU national office contain serious and disturbing material, which we have said in fairness to the members should be tested in the courts. We have also made it clear that the members of trade unions and employer organisations are entitled to expect that their membership fees will be used for their benefit.


Whilst we were doing this, I have to report to the House that those opposite have tied themselves in knots repeatedly contradicting themselves in an identifying spectacle of politicking. They have on one hand accused the government of political interference with Fair Work Australia, but then on the other hand have called upon us to intervene. They have accused, at different times, Fair Work Australia of being part of a political conspiracy, of administrative incompetence and debacle, and of delaying the release of the report for political ends. But then, when they read the report, they praised it as thorough, respected and methodical, and relied upon the content as unquestionable fact even though it had not been subject to cross-examination. They fell over themselves raising pseudo quasi-legal arguments to criticise the actions of the general manager. They then refused to acknowledge the basic tenet of our legal system and our democracy that allegations of actions contrary to law can and should be tested and determined within our court system.


Let me quote to you examples uttered by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. On 31 January this year at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition said the following about Fair Work Australia's investigation:


I just make the point that as things stand, this looks like an institutional go-slow to help the government.


That was a convenient message at the end of January, but later after the report had been released on 23 May the Leader of the Opposition described the same investigation as:


… a very long and very thorough and very meticulous and, I think, highly professional investigation.


So, there you have it. On 31 January the report is 'an institutional go-slow' and on 23 May it is amazing stuff. It is a convenient message he takes whenever it suits him in order to undermine unions and the interests of working people.


We in the government, however, have remained consistent throughout; the coalition has not. It is as simple as that in this debate about reform of registered organisations laws. This is the difference between us and those opposite when it comes to workplace relations. We make things happen, we get things done and we act in the interests of those we represent. We do not do and say things for the sake of being negative to obtain power. Most importantly, we do not keep our industrial relations policies a secret. We do not encourage the Australian voters to play hide-and-seek with our industrial relations policies. Those opposite work on the basis that the public will never find out what the coalition think until the actual election is conducted and over, just like they did in 2004. We have seen this time and time again with the opposition. They will not debate workplace relations, the full panorama of all the issues which affect all the Australian people that go to work every day. Of course, the Australian people do deserve better.


On 26 April this year, I took the difficult decision to intervene in proceedings before the Federal Court to apply for the appointment of an administrator to the East Branch of the Health Services Union. That branch covers workers in the health services sector in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. In explaining that decision, I said:


“I am particularly concerned that the interests of HSU members across Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT are not being properly served by the current dysfunction within the HSU East Branch.”


“My intervention is to ensure the broader public interest in working Australians having effective and accountable union representation is not undermined.”


I also said at the time that the decision:


… was taken to provide for the HSU to function into the future … 


meeting the expectations and in the interests of HSU members;


sustainably and in a proper and democratic way; and


in accordance with its statutory obligations, including those set out in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act.


Eight weeks later, the process of fixing this part of the Health Services Union is well underway. The Federal Court has already determined that there is sufficient dysfunction within this part of the Health Services Union and appointed an interim administrator to the HSU East Branch and HSU East, the New South Wales registered union. I thank the Hon. Michael Moore for agreeing to act in the position of administrator.


On 8 May I gave a press conference in response to the release of the report by the delegate of the General Manager of Fair Work Australia into the Health Services Union national office. During that press conference I made it clear that:


… the other unfortunate consequence is that this process has cast some doubts about the transparency and accountability of the broader trade union movement.


I believe that the problems which are reported in parts of the Health Services Union are not representative of the actions of the broader Trade Union Movement. I believe what we see here is the action of a few individuals, not the Trade Union Movement.


The government therefore committed to:


… taking wide ranging action to improve Fair Work Australia’s investigative processes … to enhance the accountability and transparency of registered organisations … strengthen associated penalties … and … introduce legislation to implement any recommendations from the KPMG Review into Fair Work Australia’s investigative capacities, once this review is completed.


Three weeks later, we delivered on these commitments and introduced the bill into this place—a bill that will improve financial training, transparency and disclosure by officials of registered organisations and by registered organisations to their members; improve the way that investigations into breaches of registered organisations provisions are conducted by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia; and introduce a threefold increase in civil penalties of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act.


Registered organisations play a fundamental role in Australia's workplace system. Registered organisations play a fundamental role in the Australian democracy. These are organisations created and registered for the purposes of representing Australian employers and employees. They have particular recognition under Australian workplace relations law by virtue of their representative status, and it is because of that registration that they have particular statutory obligations in relation to their operation, conduct and disclosure.


Registered organisations are not regulated by the Corporations Act, and this is appropriate. Some in this debate—those sitting opposite, by and large—have argued that Corporations Act regulation should be applied to registered organisations. Others have argued that penalties should be increased 100-fold. Again we see the politics of simplicity and negativity clouding the opposition. They should know that there are many similarities between the regulation of corporations and the regulation of registered organisations. Officers of organisations, like those of corporations, are subject to serious duties and obligations. For example, they must exercise care and diligence; they must act with good faith; and they must not improperly use their position for personal advantage. Further, the financial regulation of entities is similar. They are required to undertake regular reporting of their financial accounts. Auditors are required to sign off their books in accordance with accounting standards. They are subject to regulatory oversight, and the general powers of Fair Work Australia and ASIC are in fact similar. In addition, this bill uses corporations law concepts like related-party transactions.


But we must also recognise that registered organisations and corporations are different creatures, both in practice and in law. The aims of the two entities are different. Corporations are designed to generate wealth and protect the financial interests of their shareholders. Organisations are established to represent the rights of their members, whether employers or employees, at work amongst other things. There has been a false debate here that, unless all unions are regulated exactly like corporations, somehow anything else is insufficient. Yet there are many different types of entities in this country that are regulated by different regulatory regimes that are more appropriately suited to what they do and how they do it: charity organisations, not-for-profit organisations, partnerships and unincorporated associations, for example.


This bill will improve the financial accountability and transparency of registered organisations. It will increase penalties for breaches threefold in line with those in the Fair Work Act. It will make sure that officials of organisations receive appropriate financial training. It will require the remuneration of highly paid officers, related-party transactions and material personal interests to be disclosed to the members. It will fix deficiencies in the current legislation—which was in fact introduced by the Leader of the Opposition, who was the relevant minister at the time—not least by now allowing Fair Work Australia to share relevant information with state law enforcement and regulatory agencies where it is appropriate to do so. This was one of the things which those opposite were pointing to when criticising the conduct of the Fair Work investigations into the HSU, and with this bill we are actually remedying the errors in drafting made by the Leader of the Opposition when he was minister for industrial relations.


This is extremely important legislation, not entered into lightly, which should be supported by all members of this place. I should also add—when we talk about people who are supporting this—that, whilst the opposition appear to be choosing the path of negativity, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are both supporting this, as are the ACTU. In fact, some employer organisations have criticised us for going too far, such as the Master Plumbers Association. This bill has the support of the Business Council of Australia. So the stakeholders—the people who operate day to day—are unanimous in supporting us, yet those opposite still persist with their old-fashioned remedy of union baiting.


We want to make sure, on behalf of all those people in Australian society who are genuinely interested in the ongoing viability of registered organisations, that the registered organisations regulation operates in a way which ensures that organisations are accountable to their members. I commend this bill to the House.

I make the point that the minister at the table talks about registered organisations being fair and accountable, but we in the coalition do not believe that this legislation makes them sufficiently accountable. I flagged in my speech in the second reading that the coalition would move at the consideration in detail stage commonsense amendments to make some improvements to this bill, separate from our amendments which were moved at the second reading stage.


With respect to this group of amendments, the bill as drafted allows for Fair Work Australia to outsource fully an investigation to an outside body. The coalition believes that, while outside experts may be required on individual parts of an investigation, the independent statutory body should be the one to conduct and oversee the entire investigation. We have concerns that investigations being conducted by an outside entity the general manager sees fit would not allow for the proper accountability and oversight of investigations. So the coalition will move an amendment to ensure that investigations are actually conducted by Fair Work Australia, while leaving in the power for outside help to be brought in on individual parts of an investigation. In this way a full investigation of itself cannot be outsourced.


We will seek to bring across into the Registered Organisations Act section 184 of the Corporations Act, which would make it a criminal offence for bosses of registered organisations to not act in good faith, to use their position dishonestly or to behave in a reckless manner. Further, with the government's increases to the civil penalties the coalition will seek to increase penalties in line with the Corporations Act.


The coalition does not believe that the amendment that the government moves about disclosure of information to police is necessary because Fair Work Australia should at all times have the ability to cooperate fully with police as per advice published earlier this year by Stuart Wood SC. However, our amendment will make it abundantly clear that the general manager and staff of Fair Work Australia can cooperate fully with police at all stages of an investigation, including proactively providing information to police. As I said, we do not really believe we should need to make this amendment but we do so for the avoidance of doubt. The government's amendment in this area just does not go far enough to ensure that this cooperation will take place.


While Fair Work Australia presently can provide information to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the government will allow a further disclosure to all directors of public prosecutions in Australia. However, we witnessed in Fair Work Australia's last referral an inability of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue the matters raised as they were not prepared in a brief of evidence. Fair Work Australia said that it could not prepare a brief of evidence because the legislation did not allow for it. This amendment will give Fair Work Australia the express power to prepare a brief of evidence should it need to.


The government will require the publishing of information to members, including the pay, interests and expenses of senior officers. The coalition seeks to amend this provision so that the report to members, however it is provided, is also provided to Fair Work Australia within their existing reporting requirements. The coalition believes it is important that the information is provided to Fair Work Australia to ensure that regulatory oversight on how union members' money is spent is absolutely spot-on and accountable.


The coalition feels that these amendments will only improve the bill. The only way to get the best possible outcome is for the next coalition government to implement our better plan for accountability and transparency of registered organisations, because only a coalition government can restore the hope, reward and opportunity that is so horribly missing under Labor's framework.


I have spoken to a group of eight amendments. For the convenience of the House I have included my comments on all of those amendments but I am actually asking that amendments (1) to (3), as circulated in my name, be considered at this point of time.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:57):  For the sake of efficiency, I might deal with all of the amendments in my comments and then deal with them separately, seeing as the member for Farrer has spoken to all of them. At least, I will try to cover as much ground as I can in the five minutes.


In reference to the coalition amendments (1) through to (3), there are already requirements in the legislation for officers to act with care and diligence, to act in good faith, and not to use their position improperly or use information that they have obtained through acting as an officer of an organisation improperly. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already prohibits members' money being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns, and our proposal does triple penalties for breaches of the registered organisations act.


So let us be clear: the government does not condone officers of registered organisations or officers of corporations, or anyone in a position of trust or fiduciary duty, acting inappropriately, misusing funds that they are entrusted to manage or taking benefits they are not entitled to. There is nothing in the registered organisations act that prevents criminal proceedings being initiated where funds are stolen or someone engages in fraud. The registered organisations act prioritises the conclusion of criminal proceedings before civil penalties are issued in relation to the same conduct—that is in sections 311 and 312. Indeed, the registered organisations act does not prevent criminal proceedings from being commenced even after civil penalties have been applied in relation to the same conduct.


The argument that has been proposed to base these amendments upon is that registered organisations are identical to corporations. They simply are not. Registered organisations are not regulated by the Corporations Act, and this is appropriate. At no time, even in the Howard years, did the coalition government or any of its ministers ever propose saying that registered organisations are identical to corporations—clearly, a change in policy now. Some in this debate have argued that the Corporations Act regulations should be applied to registered organisations. Others have argued that penalties should be increased 100-fold. We believe that this argument is too negative and too simplistic. We do believe that officers of organisations, like those in corporations, are subject to serious duties and obligations. They must exercise care and diligence. They must act in good faith. They must not improperly use their position. We recognise that the financial regulation of these entities is similar. They are required to undertake regular reporting of the financial accounts. Auditors are required to sign off their books in accordance with accounting standards. They are subject to regulatory oversight. And the general powers of Fair Work Australia are similar to those of ASIC. In addition, this bill uses Corporations Law concepts like related party transactions.


We must also recognise that registered organisations and corporations are different creatures, both in practice and in law. The aims of the two entities are different. It is a false debate to say that unions or employer associations are identical to corporations. That has never been in the jurisprudence of this nation, and the case has not been made to change that policy in that way. If you accept what the opposition says, that unions and employer associations should be treated identically to corporations, then why stop there? Do you argue that St Vincent de Paul, who hold significant financial interests, should have the same laws apply to them as apply to BHP Billiton? Should Telstra be regulated in the same way as the toy makers union? Should Coles have the same rules apply as an unincorporated partnership running a bookshop?


We do not believe that the case for these amendments has been made. We believe that the hazards which the opposition are concerned about are adequately catered for in the propositions that are being advanced.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-06-25,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (16:14):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. It is telling that the announcement of this legislation came just 10 days after the Leader of the Opposition announced the coalition's better plan for accountability and transparency for registered organisations. The government incorrectly accuses the coalition of not presenting policy. Well, here we have an example of the government attempting to mimic coalition policy. But this legislation does not go far enough. It does not include the measures that the coalition believes are required for true accountability and transparency for registered organisations.


There are strict rules to ensure that companies and their directors act appropriately. The coalition believes that these same rules should apply to registered organisations and to their officers. Only then can members of registered organisations be assured that their money is being used prudently. While this bill increases the penalties for officers of registered organisations, it does not go far enough. I shall now spend some time outlining some of the differences between the reporting obligations of companies and registered organisations, as well as some of the differences between directors of companies and officers of registered organisations.


The obligations on company directors are enforced by a number of regulatory bodies including the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and, where applicable, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Australians are confident in the ability of these organisations to regulate companies and their directors. The obligations on registered organisations and their officers are enforced only by Fair Work Australia. I do not have enough time to compare all of the obligations upon company directors with all of the obligations upon officers of registered organisations; however, I will take the time to outline some of the significant variations.


Section 180 of the Corporations Act requires that a director of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties with a degree of care and diligence. There is a similar provision in section 285 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The penalty for a breach by a company director is up to $200,000, while the provisions for an officer of a registered organisation currently apply a penalty of $2,200. The amendments contained within this bill, if passed, will increase the penalty for officers of registered organisations to $6,600, which is still a small fraction of the penalty applied to a company director.


Section 181 of the Corporations Act compels directors to exercise their powers and discharge their duties in good faith, in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose. This is reflected in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act in section 286. Again, the penalty for a breach by a company director is up to $200,000, while the penalty for an officer of a registered organisation according to this bill will be $6,600.


Section 182 of the Corporations Act has the provision that a director or officer of a company must not improperly use their position to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else, or to cause detriment to the corporation, while section 287 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act contains a similar provision. The penalty for directors of companies is—you guessed it—$200,000, while the penalty as amended by this legislation for a registered organisation is a princely $6,600. A provision that a company director or an officer of a registered organisation must not use information received in their position to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else or to cause detriment to another is in both the Corporations Act at section 183, and the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act at section 288. But again, we see the penalty for directors is $200,000, and the penalty in this bill as amended in relation to officers of a registered organisation is $6,600.


I trust that members are seeing a pattern developing here that, even under the provisions that this bill introduces, the penalties for directors of companies remain vastly higher than the penalties that would be imposed on an officer of a registered organisation. This pattern continues, with section 184 of the Corporations Act providing a criminal offence for directors that are reckless or intentionally dishonest and fail to exercise their powers or discharge their duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation or for proper purpose. There is no corresponding provision in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act and this bill does not introduce any. Under this bill, there are still no provisions creating criminal offences for officials of registered organisations. We have listened intently to the soap opera that has prevailed with regard to the HSU and the member for Dobell, and I stand here in stunned amazement that there has not been greater motivation to impose tougher penalties in relation to registered organisations.


In introducing this bill, the minister said:


This represents a significant increase in penalties to reflect the seriousness with which this government, and registered organisations, take compliance with workplace relations law.


For once, I agree with the minister. It does reflect the seriousness with which the government takes the sorts of breaches that this legislation deals with—it does not take it very seriously at all! It is all for slapping members of registered organisations on the wrist, whilst it is quite happy to hang directors out to dry, or to take them to the gallows or to the guillotine. If you are a member of a registered organisation you can do the HSU thing and you can misappropriate funds and you know the penalties will be light. This legislation does very little to improve that. It is nothing more than a slightly harder slap on the wrist. If a former union boss took compliance with workplace regulation seriously, he would welcome the coalition amendments which have criminal provisions for officers that are recklessly or intentionally dishonest, and which increase civil penalties in line with those applicable to company directors.


Some might think that these disproportionate penalties are appropriate when considering the large packages that some executives are reported to earn; however, these penalties also apply to mum and dad directors who might have little left after paying their employees, not just to directors of listed companies. As recent media has reported, the officers of registered organisations can also be earning substantial incomes, often many multiples of the income of the members that pay their wages. Just as directors have a duty to act prudently for the benefit of shareholders, officers of registered organisations must act prudently in the interests of their members.


This legislation sends all the wrong signals. The penalties in this legislation are a token gesture implemented by a government that is being dragged kicking and screaming to the reform process. It is nothing more than a token gesture. This legislation sends the message loud and clear that the government is not serious about dealing with the sort of unscrupulous behaviour that Fair Work Australia found was taking place at the Health Services Union. Labor is saying that it is a minor matter to defraud members and to act in a way that is contrary to the interests of members. The member for Chifley has said that union officials get paid less than company directors so the penalties should be less. This argument is absolute nonsense. These organisations control vast amounts of funds. They control in many cases the future of the members that they represent. The employees of registered organisations have the ability to inflict widespread harm on those for whose money they are effectively the custodians. Penalties should reflect the potential magnitude of the damage caused by a union officer's illegal action, not the size of their salary. The bottom line is that the fabled 'majority of union officers' who do the right thing by their members have absolutely nothing to fear from the significantly increased penalties proposed by the coalition because, if they do the right thing, if they act in the interests of their members, they will not be paying a penalty.


There are a range of matters not addressed by this bill. The coalition is concerned that former union bosses are regulating the current union bosses. That is an interesting situation—a very cosy situation. This concern is not limited to just the coalition, as constituents have also expressed their concern about the ability of Fair Work Australia to regulate unions. This bill does not address this concern. The coalition's plan for better transparency and accountability of registered organisations would have a registered organisations commission take over the roles of ensuring registered organisations do the right thing by their members and being answerable to parliament. This would address the real concern about Fair Work Australia's ability to do this job.


We have recently seen that there is a certain amount of confusion about Fair Work Australia's ability to cooperate with police and other agencies. The bill, while expanding police cooperation powers, does not make it expressly clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. I would have thought that cooperation with police forces would be an absolutely binding obligation on Fair Work Australia, not something that requires clarification at this point in time. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that it be absolutely clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. It is also important that Fair Work Australia be able to provide a brief of evidence to the DPP. Again, given the previous problems with this, it is important to give express powers to allow that to happen.


The coalition have been asking a number of questions. How can you take Labor seriously when the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was the head of the ACTU and when the minister responsible for this bill, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, sat on the ACTU when the member for Dobell also sat on the ACTU? A cosy little clique, indeed. How can you take Labor seriously when this happened right under Labor's nose while the member for Dobell was a member of parliament and Michael Williamson was the President of the Labor Party? How can you take Labor seriously on ensuring union bosses follow the rules when they have turned the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner into a toothless tiger? And how can you take Labor seriously when they still rely on the tainted vote of the member for Dobell?


This is a bill designed by a former union boss to regulate union bosses and it will be enforced by former union bosses. It is a weak bill that does not go far enough. Union members, many of whom are in low-paying positions, pay their dues every week in the hope that their union will represent their interests. They should not have to put up with union fat cats using their money for long lunches, outrageous salaries and purposes unrelated to union business. Only the coalition has a plan to properly regulate unions. I call on the government to take some real action to improve union accountability.


We have seen in relation to the HSU the most egregious waste of the funds of union members—union members who work hard and go without to contribute their union dues. These are not members being paid the sorts of salaries that union officials are getting paid. They are everyday hardworking Australians who have seen their money squandered and who have real concerns about the future of the union.


The Australian Labor Party and the union movement do not need a complex review or a detailed examination of why union membership is declining. They need look no further than the mirror to see why they have a problem. They have a problem because the unions of today have lost sight of the goal for which they were established, and that was to look after the interests of the members. When you look at this legislation that has come out of the Australian Labor Party, the puppet of the union membership, you can see that the union movement is not concerned about accountability and having an organisation that works in the best interests of the members. The union movement is interested in perpetuating the personal benefits it can bestow on itself, quite clearly. Otherwise, we would have good penalties and some real teeth in this legislation: it would put sufficient sanctions in place to ensure officials appointed to union positions, who have under their charge large amounts of union funds, act in the interests of the thousands of members right around the country. It would have penalties that would be a serious deterrent, not mere slaps on the wrist as in this legislation.


This bill encapsulates so much of what is wrong with the modern Labor Party: a failure to really deal with the union movement to ensure that it is acting in the best interests not only of the members themselves but of the Australian people generally. We need to have much stronger sanctions. The coalition in government will right this problem if our amendments are not passed in this place now. Upon coming to government we will ensure that union members are as accountable as company directors. We will ensure that legislation will be in place to give union members the assurance that their money is being spent wisely, which the Australian Labor Party is not giving them. No wonder Australian workers are deserting the Labor Party. They are deserting the Labor Party because they know that the Labor Party are looking after themselves, not looking after their interests.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:28):  I start with an explanation: the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 before the House and the amendments we will move are not anti union. It is not about shackling unions to the extent that it would affect their ability to effectively represent their members. I fully acknowledge that from the Harvester award of 1907 to the election of the first female president of the ACTU in 1995, the union movement has had, and it continues to have, a significant impact on Australia's way of life. While we may disagree with the union movement on their methods and their aims, the Liberal Party from Menzies to Howard has always recognised the role unions play and the right they have to play that role. In the words of John Howard: 'We're anti-union control. We're anti-union domination. We're anti the unions having a monopoly role in the workplace, but,' 'We are not anti-union'. But this bill and the amendments the coalition seek are about lifting the standards of transparency and accountability of registered organisations, of which unions are one. It is about ensuring we do not have a repeat of the scandals of the Health Services Union, where 70,000 of the lowest paid, hardest working employees from the HSU had more than $500,000 of their money misused—misused on expensive dinners, misused on holidays, misused on escorts, misused on political campaigns and political staffers, misused to the point that this money will never be seen again.


Not to mention that HSU East made millions of dollars of expenditure without necessary controls or competition. The Temby report has detailed that over four years $2.4 million was spent on the HSU credit card without sufficient guidelines and documentation, and a whopping $17 million of contracts were entered into without a proper tender process. As documented by the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, Senator Abetz, there was: $5 million to Access Focus for what is believed to be consultancies and memorabilia; $4.9 million over three years to United Edge believed to be for IT services; and $3.4 million to Communigraphix over four years, believed to be for the union journal. And the list goes on, with the concerning revelation that some of the companies benefitting from these contracts were linked to Michael Williamson, the former President of the Australian Labor Party,


This is why we are here. This is why the coalition is taking the initiative in putting forward these amendments, to ensure that registered organisations such as unions are submitted to the same level of accountability and transparency as companies and their directors are under the Corporations Act. Under the current law, trade unions as registered organisations are subject to obligations under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. These include: not using their position for personal gain, ensuring the appropriate use of members' money and acting at all times in the best interests of the members.


But the penalties for the breach of these obligations are either minor and insufficient. Under section 287 and 288 of the Fair Work Act, civil penalties for using information to the detriment of the organisation or for personal advantage could involve fines of only up to $2,200 for an individual, and no criminal provisions apply. In contrast, under section 184 of the Corporations Act, criminal offences could lead to a fine of up to $200,000 for an individual or imprisonment for up to five years. These are serious penalties for serious crimes and this is what the coalition is seeking to achieve by moving these amendments.


What is more, the coalition believes we can no longer leave it to Fair Work Australia to police and enforce these obligations. The HSU scandal has shone a light on the deficiencies of Fair Work Australia. To take more than three years to investigate the allegations around Craig Thomson and then produce a document which is not even in the required format for the Director of Public Prosecutions is completely unacceptable. It is unacceptable to the coalition and unacceptable to the Australian people. The institutional go-slow and the incompetency displayed seriously undermined any possibility of an expeditious, effective and professional handling of the HSU matter.


What we need now is a new body, which the coalition proposes calling the Registered Organisations Commission, which will police and enforce these new compliance obligations rather than leaving it to the general manager. This new commission will take responsibility for educating members of registered organisations about their rights and acting as a repository of complaints from its members. The coalition understands that one has to separate Fair Work Australia from its day-to-day role solving disputes and making agreements, from its watchdog role ensuring proper accountability and transparency. In the words of Peter Anderson, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry head:


We need to separate some of these roles so that the arbitral side, the decision making side that affects employers and affects industry is quite distinct from the traditional role that scrutinises unions and employers organisations.


How right he is.


The problem with the government's bill is that it does not go far enough. Do not take my word for it: Labor's member for Barton and the former Attorney-General in the Rudd government, Robert McClelland, said as much in his speech to the parliament last week. And if you do not want to take his word for it, read the speech of the National Secretary of the Health Services Union, Kathy Jackson, to the HR Nicholls Society just a few weeks ago, where she made a similar point, saying: 


... I believe that there is a very strong case for extending, to the full extent possible and applicable, the same governance, investigation and enforcement provisions that apply to other corporations, generally those registered under the Corporations Act, to unions.


You see, the government's bill is a timid reaction to the loud public outrage and it is an inadequate response to the coalition's lead on the issue. Just look at the details. Under the government's bill the rules are still weak, the penalties are still weak and Fair Work Australia is still left to police these registered organisations, despite its failed record. Under the government's bill there is no real attempt to apply the standards of the Corporations Act to those of registered organisations. Under the government's bill there is no specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence. Under the government's bill there is no requirement for Fair Work Australia to report to the parliament and explain why an investigation has taken longer than a year. Under the government's bill that ere is no specific provision making it clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police at the start, during and at the end of the investigation. These are all deficiencies in the government's legislation which will be rectified by the coalition's amendments.


We have to understand that, despite the falling membership of unions, representing as they do only around 13 per cent of the private sector workforce and around 18 per cent of the overall workforce, unions are still big businesses. Unions are big businesses and their financials reflect as much. In an important report released by the Institute of Public Affairs, entitled Australian trade unions: an alternate regulatory approach, Olivia Graham and the irrepressible John Lloyd gave us a snapshot of some these financials. For example, in 2010 the CFMEU's construction and general branch in the Victorian division held net assets worth $42 million, including $4.5 million worth of investment properties and $25 million worth of property, plant and equipment. In 2011 the Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing Federation held $21,768 million in net assets and earned just over $6 million in net revenue. These are just some of the individual state based divisions. When one accumulates the net assets of the total union movement, it is easy to understand how unions can put together tens of millions of dollars every election for their brothers in the Labor Party. Given these large numbers, it is absolutely critical that the standards of financial transparency and accountability within the union movement are lifted.


In conclusion, we cannot afford to have another repeat of the HSU scandal. The Australian public will not stand for it, union members will not stand for it and the coalition will not stand for it. The coalition's amendments put before the House are a step forward They will enhance transparency, they will strengthen accountability and they will ensure that unions, which are big businesses, are subject to the same analysis, the same accountability, the same standards and the same transparency as are corporations and their directors. I recommend the amendments to the House.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (16:41):  I rise also to speak on the amendments to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. Once again in the chamber we find ourselves at an interesting juncture in the politics of our nation. In the past few weeks in the parliament, we have seen lateral transfers for defence families moved by the opposition and adopted by the government; and the victims of terrorism bill, a private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition, adopted by the government. Here, 10 days ago, we saw the Leader of the Opposition announce the coalition's better plan for accountability and transparency for registered organisations and, 10 days later, we have a bill introduced by the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Shorten, to address just that matter. It appears that the opposition is governing with its ideas and programs. Once again we see a bill in response to something. In the act-react cycle, we seem to act and the government reacts, rather than doing what it is elected to do—that is, to address the very serious problems that we have seen with the Health Services Union and unions more broadly in Australia today.


Given that we apply such stringent rules to corporations in the Corporations Act, it is not unfair in the light of the stunning and explosive revenue elations made by Fair Work Australia in their report into the Health Services Union that we look at legislation to improve the transparency and quality of registered organisations including unions. That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition proposed in the coalition's plan for better accountability and transparency for registered organisations. In this bill, we see the provisions lacking in a number of ways, and that is attempting to address a problem when you are not really addressing a problem. That is why we have proposed some very serious amendments. I am going to outline some of those shortly.


We believe, however, that the coalition has a better plan to make sure that the money of the members of these very serious organisations—which are now responsible for large amounts of money and investments and responsible for the lives of so many poor and other people at the bottom end of the scale—is spent responsibly and properly. We require the same thing from corporations and boards of directors. In the same way, when we see a Lehman Brothers style collapse, we say: 'That is terrible. Those people mismanaged their risk and their money, and those people should be dealt with.' In the same way, as the Health Services Union has, explosively, revealed serious problems and fraud, we ought to now apply the rule of law. That is why in our amendment we are bringing penalties in line with the Corporations Act, and seeking to bring across to the registered organisations act section 184 of the Corporations Act, which would make it a criminal offence for bosses of registered organisations to not act in good faith, to use their position dishonestly or to be reckless. I do not understand how that could be opposed by the government considering that is what governing is all about.


Applying the rule of law means extending the power we apply from government to negate behaviour, and the main mechanism with which we can negate this style of behaviour is the law. The Corporations Act into the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act's section 184 would provide for that, thereby negating these acts of people in registered organisations. It is an appropriate and a fair way of addressing this matter.


Further, with regard to the government's increases to the civil penalties proposed in this bill, we are seeking to further increase those penalties in line with the Corporations Act. In this modern approach to dealing with registered organisations and unions, given the seriousness of the role that they occupy in today's society, it is appropriate that the penalties mirror those in the Corporations Act that apply to boards of directors and other office bearers in corporations. That does not appear to be controversial, but the fact that it is missing from this legislation is a big gap in the government's approach.


Other issues that we have with this bill include the fact that Fair Work Australia is still in control. The approach that Fair Work Australia has taken in recent times in these investigations highlights the need for legislation to improve the situation in how Fair Work Australia addresses matters. We feel that putting Fair Work Australia in charge without considerable increases in its ability or the provision that we would make on it from this place is a weak approach. We want Fair Work Australia to have the ability to make sure its investigations are done properly. We saw three years of failure to cooperate with police, for example, with Fair Work Australia claiming it could not produce a brief of evidence. From our amendments, and from what is missing in the government's legislation, how we can take this bill seriously when it is not proposing to give specific permission for Fair Work Australia to prepare a brief of evidence, given that this was one of the main criticisms of the approach that Fair Work Australia has taken? So in our amendments we are seeking to give Fair Work Australia the appropriate requirements to make sure it cooperates with police and that it can produce a brief of evidence.


We also want to make sure this parliament has a mechanism, if Fair Work Australia is not delivering on its obligations to investigate in a timely fashion, to prevent us from seeing a repeat of the situation where Fair Work Australia could take as long as it likes and be open to the perception or the accusation, which it was, that there was political interference. Whether there was or not is not my place to say, but the accusation and the perception could be made about Fair Work Australia because the parliament has no mechanism to ensure that it is acting in a timely fashion. Having reports to parliament at the year mark, and then every six months after that, as to how an investigation is going and what the expected progress will be would provide accountability and transparency into the future.


Once again, this is not subjective or targeted at anybody, and there is nothing for the government to really object to except proper transparency and accountability. That is what we are providing for with our amendments. I do not understand, and I would love to hear the government argue, why it would not be appropriate in future investigations to ensure that Fair Work Australia's investigations are held to a high standard and perceived to be at a high standard, and that at least confidence can be held in the operation of Fair Work Australia.


As I discussed, we propose increasing penalties for misusing members' funds, and the stories that we have seen out of the Health Services Union have shattered public confidence in that union, particularly for those very hardworking people in the health sector who do such a great job and who decide to contribute by joining a union. It may surprise the government and others to know that I am not against people joining unions. I think, inherently, a person's right to join a union and collaborate with others to collectively bargain to improve their conditions in the workforce is an appropriate use of their time and an appropriate choice for a person to make. 


In a free society, trade unions would operate effectively on behalf of their members. I think, though, it is an inherent mistake made by unions that they are affiliated with one political party in Australia—I put that right out there. That mix of politics and unionism in Australia has led to a situation where every member of the Labor Party in this place is a trade union official, where vast sums of members' money from lowly paid workers end up in a political party's coffers, and where the Health Services Union is mixed up at the centre of a national political scandal. In a way, that is unedifying not only for the parliament but also for unions, workers and trade unionists. There is no accident in all of that; a series of mistakes have been made.


This bill could go much further in what it is doing to make sure that this situation is rectified in some way. I do not believe we can take the government seriously with this bill when we consider that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was the head of the ACTU and the minister responsible for this bill, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, was in the ACTU at a similar time as many people who have been caught up in this problem. There are too many of these issues going around, and while there is nothing specific that we would level at anybody here, these amendments are designed to give strength, purpose and meaning to a real agenda to make registered organisations transparent and accountable. It is an appropriate and important use of this parliament's power and privilege to make sure that we do so when given the opportunity.


We have seen, given the scandal that has surrounded the Health Services Union—whose report is 12,000 pages, 900 of which deal with the former secretary of the Health Services Union—that there is real cause for concern about penalties. The coalition's amendment, particularly in relation to the disclosure of information to police, is something that ought to be supported by everybody here to make sure that in future, where there are allegations of serious misconduct, people have to cooperate with police and disclose information, and that people and officers at Fair Work Australia can cooperate fully with police at all stages of an investigation. 


It is important that we clarify the position, that we ensure that we signal to Fair Work Australia that, like every other citizen, corporation or entity in Australia, we ask of them that they cooperate with law enforcement agencies. We do not want any obstacles in the way of that cooperation, and if there are any obstacles from this parliament we want to ensure, through an amendment, that they are removed so that every officer of Fair Work Australia can then cooperate.


We find with many of these amendments before us that are proposed by the coalition that they would provide a very fair platform for the operation of registered organisations to ensure a minimising of criminal activity and other incorrect conduct, to put it politely. That this bill is designed by a former union boss to regulate other union bosses is a valid criticism and many members have made that comment in this place. I do not think it is appropriate that former union bosses design the rules for the next generation of union bosses. That is the flaw in this legislation. They may think this is something that will address the situation, but, when you go through it and look at how this bill came about—literally, the Leader of the Opposition proposed the coalition's plan, Minister Shorten came to this parliament and announced this legislation and now, here we are, debating it a short time later—it highlights that, really, this is a reaction rather than an action. 


The government did not choose to act, despite how long this Fair Work Australia investigation has been going, how long the report has been in the public domain and how serious it is in nature. The government did not say, 'This is quite serious. We really want to act on this. We'd prefer to do something. We're not going to let the opposition get a jump on us. We're not going to let them propose what to do and then react to it. We're going to propose some pretty serious measures and ensure that this does not happen again.' That way, everyone would be better off. The parliament, the union movement and registered organisations in Australia would improve in quality and be more transparent.


I think we have seen the government's agenda exposed a little. That is what is important to realise here. I guess the government's agenda is not so much about fixing this problem; it is about being perceived to be doing something about it. There is a very big distinction here, because the coalition's amendment underscores, line by line, issue by issue, that if you were serious you would be much tougher. If you were serious you would give force to what you are saying. If you were serious, provision by provision, you would have much more detail and there would be many more actual powers to ensure that Fair Work Australia had to cooperate with the police and had the power to provide a brief of evidence, ensure that, if reports were taking too long, there was a mechanism for the parliament to address them and ensure, of course, that penalties applied—that the main force and power we can give to legislation, the power to penalise, was the same as in the Corporations Act and was there to be used when this sort of situation came up.


While we do not oppose the bill itself, we have proposed these amendments. They are serious, measured amendments. They are not unfair to anybody. They are to give effect to what should be a bill to improve transparency in registered organisations in Australia to ensure that this situation does not arise again without any real recourse in law to address it effectively and quickly, where Fair Work Australia took so long to do so little about something so serious. That is why we need better legislation.


The coalition are proud to have flagged our plan for the government, and we are happy to see the government react. If they do not have the ideas, we are happy to see them react our ideas. But, when you have that reaction, I think you also have to look at the people who originated the transparency and accountability plan and listen to us very carefully about the serious strengthening amendments that we are proposing to ensure that this legislation can work effectively.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-06-25,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:55):  I applaud some of the remarks that the previous speaker made. His endorsement might be in a fair bit of trouble as a result of some of the remarks he made, but I applaud him for them. However, he started talking about unionists having a responsibility to speak up and the fact that the amendments being moved by the Liberal Party will overcome that problem. We have the situation with the building workers union where there is a right to silence enjoyed by everyone everywhere in the world. I do not know of any jurisdictions, outside of one-party government countries, where you have no right to silence. I will not go into all the arguments about why you should have a right to silence; suffice it to say that every country in the world provides that right to silence.


I have not seen the amendments—I could be critical and say that I did not get the courtesy of receiving the amendments—so, not having seen them, all I can do is comment upon what the previous two speakers said. In the building workers union, if the police ask you a question and you refuse to answer it, they can jail you and jail you pretty well indefinitely at their discretion. We are on very dangerous ground when fundamental freedoms are taken off people. I do not want to go into all the issues around that building workers legislation. It was only under threat from the crossbenchers that the ALP moved to remove what were abominable discretionary powers that were given to these various authorities. There had not been a single problem in almost the last seven years and there was no justification. There may be justification for some oppressive legislation in the short term to fix a short-term problem, but I would think that you would never introduce that type of legislation without a sunset clause upon it. I find it very hard to envisage a situation where fundamental freedoms and rights are taken away to overcome a temporary problem that has arisen, however bad that problem might be.


Let me turn from generalities to the bill before the House, which is aimed at increasing the responsibilities upon trade union officials in the area of accountability. The unions have all agreed to it, but I suspect that a number of them have agreed to it because they are too scared to say they do not agree to it, because someone might start looking at them and thinking that they have something to hide.


I came into this place out of a terrible baptism, which was the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland, where we had some people at the heart of police corruption. I say with very great pride that we had the courage, with our eyes open, knowing the great dangers that we took, to try to go after that centre of corruption in the police force. Most certainly it was not Terry Lewis but, on the evidence, it would appear that he was playing a part in protecting these people.


In doing that, we unleashed a monster. Monsters have been unleashed with the Salem witch burnings and the McCarthy hearings in the United States. We can find a hundred examples: the Spanish Inquisition; the burning of books in Nazi Germany; Oliver Cromwell's regime in England. There are many examples of the psychological phenomenon of witch burning. We most certainly suffered that in Queensland, and it made me very conscious of the enormous injustices that are perpetrated—in a lot of cases, upon public officials such as politicians. The leading case is Brian Austin, a minister in Queensland who was effectively the first one to go to jail. Let everyone in this place listen to this with some fear and trembling. He was jailed because he took his government car to visit his kids who were at boarding school in Armidale. He spent three years in a cage, like an animal, because he did that.


Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Owens, you would be aware that almost every government official in Australia—and I do not just mean politicians—has a government motor car which will be used for private purposes today. Whether it is picking up the kids from school or picking up a loaf of bread on the way home, it falls within that definition. But when the old witch-hunt occurs watch out, because there is no such thing as justice here. I am just worried that the government may have acted somewhat excessively in this area—and I most certainly would not be cheering the opposition on in their attacks here.


Turning to the issue of collective bargaining in Australia, I had the very great honour of addressing two of the trade unions' annual general meetings. I think at least one of them knew of my book on the history of Australia from 1890 to 1910. In that book was a very fine tribute to trade unionism in this country. We had a situation a hundred years ago in which one in 31 of us who went down the mines never came back up again. They died a terrible death from miner's phthisis or, worse still, in many cases they were buried alive. And this was not confined to mining. Of the 2,000 men who worked digging the sewerage ditches in Sydney—they were working down eight or nine feet deep and there was no circulation of air—every single one who worked there for more than two years died of miner's phthisis.


And if you are looking for the reasons for the formation of the Labor Party in Australia, look no further than miner's phthisis. The first Labor head of government elected anywhere in the world was in Queensland—Anderson Dawson, from my own family's hometown of Charters Towers. We were in Charters Towers before there was a Charters Towers. Anderson Dawson was the member of parliament for Charters Towers and the first Labor premier elected anywhere in the world. He left parliament because he had contracted lung disease, miner's phthisis, whilst he was mining. Andrew Fisher, the second Labor Prime Minister of this country, also had to leave politics on account of miner's phthisis, and his father also died from miner's phthisis.


The black people who were employed in the mines in South Africa, even though they were very poorly treated, had legislation protecting them from miner's phthisis—damping-down legislation. When they were using machine drills, which came in the 1890s, they needed damping-down legislation. It was given by the white people of South Africa to protect the black people who worked down in the mines. In Wales the miners were treated even worse. They had a steel collar welded around their neck with a number on it and they were not allowed to leave their place of work, by law. They were very much in a slave-like activity. Ken Follett wrote a very good novel based upon the situation in Wales.


Even though those people were treated like dogs and slaves, they still had protection for damping down. But in this country we did not. We had to form a union. One of the leaders of that very great union, the AWU, is in here today—and very proudly, I would think. The union was formed to combat and overcome, mainly by Ted Theodore when he went down the mine for the second time in his life and saw his mates die. That was his fork in the road to Damascus. He formed a union and he took over the running of Queensland within seven years. The people were so grateful for what he did for them—and I pay tribute to trade unionism in this. It was not just what that great union leader did for the workers and the employees. He took the land off the landed gentry, who to a large degree were foreign corporations, and redistributed it to Queenslanders. 


Probably half of the landowners in Queensland today, if they trace it back, got their original land from the redistribution policies of the Theodore government. They gave us the land so that we Australians could make a quid. And our farmers were given statutory marketing arrangements. Our dairy farmers were not told what they would be paid. They said, 'You'll pay us this amount of money via an arbitrated price'—and similarly with the workers.When the dairy farmers lost that arbitrated price their price went from 59c a litre the day before deregulation to 42c a litre the day after. Every member of this place should reflect upon the fact that they belong to a political party that participated in what the very famous dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Queensland, the most distinguished of Australia's economics faculties, Ted Colson, said in addressing a meeting. He said the three great shames of this nation were the way that we treated the men who came home from Vietnam, the way we treated the first Australians and what we did to the dairy farmers of Australia through deregulation.


Without the trade union movement we would live in a deregulated marketplace. It is easy for the speaker before last to get up and say that the unions should not give money to the ALP. If they had not, we would have a deregulated labour market in this country. To the eternal shame of the Liberal Party in Queensland, the Premier of Queensland stood up two weeks before the election and said that there will be no fly-in miners from overseas. No, what he said was, 'I'm not in favour of fly-in mining from overseas.' That was two weeks before the election. Five weeks after the election he stood up and said, 'There will be fly-in mining from overseas in Queensland.' It was a very different party before the election and after the election.


But to see a Labor government here in Canberra give the green light to flying in foreign workers from overseas! Madam Deputy Speaker, your predecessor, Mr Slipper, removed a picture of Charlie McDonald, the first member for Kennedy and my predecessor. Every speech Charlie gave in this House in his early years in the parliament was against bringing in foreign workers from overseas to undermine pay rates, to undermine safety conditions, to work for nothing and to take jobs that should have come to the local worker.


That is the contribution being made by the trade union movement. Some of them have had the courage to speak out against flying in foreign workers. In Queensland 299,000 people are registered for full-time employment but cannot get a job, with 200,000 of those unable to get a job at all. And there is Gina Rinehart telling us that she has to fly in workers from overseas. As for the assurances provided to us by the federal government, they are not worth the paper they are written on. They should be ashamed of themselves for insulting the trade union movement of Australia with such absolute rubbish like, 'We'll make sure that there is no Australian available for that position.' There would not be a member in this place that has not driven a truck around the provisions of section 457. I most certainly have. So, if you can drive around section 457, you will most certainly be able to drive it around this— (Time expired)

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (17:11):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. This bill will amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 to increase the financial and accountability obligations of registered organisations and their office holders, strengthen the investigative powers of Fair Work Australia and enhance remedies under the registered organisations act.


Let me start by highlighting that the need for greater oversight of registered organisations has come from Fair Work Australia itself. In its statement regarding investigations into the HSU, Fair Work Australia said of the Health Services Union:


The investigation reveals an organisation that abjectly failed to have adequate governance arrangements in place to protect union members' funds against misuse. Substantial funds were, in my view, spent inappropriately including on escort services, spousal travel, and excessive travel and hospitality expenditure.


These revelations are a clear indicator that there is an urgent need to ensure that money paid by members to registered organisations is used for proper purposes. The 1,200-page report, to the disgust of the people of Australia, detailed the financial misuse and inappropriate manner in which the hard-earned money of Health Services Union members was spent by senior union officials. It is an absolute shame that an organisation that has purported for many years to represent hardworking Australians and their rights has now been exposed as having zero regard and respect for those workers.


In saying that, I do associate my comments with those of previous members who have highlighted that there are unions that do an outstanding job. In the workplace there are organisations that do represent their members and provide value. I was always of the opinion that unions could have done much more, in particular, in building the Bowen Basin and now the Galilee Basin. Unions could have done a lot more in providing far better value for their members. But that is a debate for another day.


The revelations that union members' money was spent by union officials on escort agencies, travel, restaurants and huge cash withdrawals are a disgrace to say the least. It clearly demonstrates that there is an urgent need to ensure that money paid by members to registered organisations is used responsibly, appropriately and in a transparent way.


Today's bill will amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, which sets out the statutory obligations and privileges for so-called registered organisations. These include both federally registrable employee associations—trade unions—and federally registrable employer associations, which includes employer associations and industry associations. The task of administering obligations and responsibilities imposed on registered organisations currently belongs to the General Manager of Fair Work Australia. Such obligations include ensuring that financial statements and associated reporting requirements are met. Powers include the ability to conduct inquiries, investigate registered organisations and pursue allegations of breaches.


This bill seems little more than a hasty attempt by those opposite to give the appearance that they are making an effort to resolve the many issues plaguing the oversight of registered organisations. The reality is that this bill falls well short of doing what is necessary and we in the coalition have a number of real concerns about it. The rules and requirements as a result of the changes are still significantly weaker than those expected of company directors.


I bring the House's attention to company directors. When one hears that term one automatically thinks of the corporate top end of town—the Monopoly type of corporate director. That is not necessarily the case. The company directors in my electorate are the local mechanic and the local butcher. They may be someone who has a combined household income of around $100,000 per annum and the advice that they have received from the Taxation Office is to set up a company structure for taxation benefits, rather than give $50,000 to the husband and $50,000 to the wife as is often the case. I implore the House: when you hear the term company director do not think of the Reserve Bank, do not think of those directors of the board of multinational companies; send your thoughts to the local mechanic, the local butcher and the local businessman, because they are the people in my electorate who will ultimately be affected.


The rules and requirements as a result of the changes are still significantly weaker than those expected of a company director. While the penalties are in line with other civil penalties in the Fair Work Act, they still fall considerably short of those required under the Corporations Act. Here we have a situation where we have one set of rules under the Corporations Act for our company directors and another set of rules for our union mates. It is a juxtaposition. Why are we in this position, having this discussion? Why is this bill before the House? It was only last week in the Federation Chamber that I put up a private member's motion which sought to implement a plan that would exact the same standards of accountability and transparency from union leaders as is expected of company directors under the Corporations Act. You should have seen the Labor members of this House with union links that got up and said, 'We don't need any more transparency; we oppose the private member's motion that you put up.' There was a member who supported my motion because he was actually there and listened to it. The other members that came in were automatically opposed.


I put the private member's motion up because the unions were calling for it. The unions themselves, through the papers and their organisations, were calling for it—because there is a stench around the union movement at the moment with reference to transparency and accountability. Take, for example, the comment of the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, David Oliver. He said:



… 
every union member in this country has a right to know that 
… 
their money is going to be subject to good governance and good regulation.


The National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howes, has said that he supports bringing unions' accountability and transparency in line with the Corporations Act. Here we have two predominant unions saying that they support stronger transparency in the organisations. Furthermore, in his opening address for the 2012 congress, Mr Oliver said that unions:


… have a significant responsibility to our members to ensure and make double sure that members’ money is only used for purposes to advance our members’ interests.


The recent Fair Work Australia report leaves those comments in question.


The bill, while expanding police cooperation powers, does not make it expressly clear that Fair Work Australia can cooperate with police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia it is important that this is made absolutely clear. I ask the minister, when making his final comments, to clarify that point. In addition to clarifying their responsibilities to police, I would also like to have some further conversation on the brief of evidence from Fair Work Australia and its transition to the next progressive path in the event of untoward activities. Furthermore, there is express provision to allow Fair Work Australia to provide a brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Again, given previous problems with this, it is important to include express powers to enable this to happen. It should be noted that these provisions are frankly unnecessary but need to be supported given the circumstances.


As my colleague here in the chamber, the member for Ryan, recently asked: why has this bill come about? She asked that question in a previous speech. Why does the political wing of the union movement all of a sudden feel a stronger stance against corruption and misappropriation must be taken? Is it because it is the right and honest thing to do? Is it a proactive step to stamp out cynicism within the union movement? Is it to finally put unions on the level legislative playing field that their corporate equivalents are on and impose the same kind of punishments for infringements when the only difference is where the money is coming from? No, it is not. The government lacks the moral fortitude to do something like that. It is simply because they were shamed and embarrassed into some reaction by the scandals and disgraces of the Health Services Union that have plagued this government. It is because they have been shamed by the strong leadership demonstrated by Tony Abbott on the issue and the strong stance that he is taking in bringing this situation to the fore.


The coalition is proposing eight amendments to improve the design of the bill and outcomes for workers. Most importantly we will create a new organisation to oversee the registered organisations. We suggest that setting up the organisation, as noted in the amendment, should be supported by the government. It is absolutely consistent with the government's position on the safe roads legislation; they appropriated $15 million to set up a tribunal to oversee so-called road fatalities and employment contracts in the transport workers' sector. So what we are asking for in our amendment has a precedent, and we would suggest that this government will and should support the amendments attached here.


The coalition will seek to remove the responsibility of the General Manager of Fair Work Australia to ensure compliance and shift to a new, separate and independent body which will be called the Registered Organisations Commission. This commission will fall under the auspices of the office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. It will be able to use the Fair Work Ombudsman's network and resources where appropriate and will ultimately report and be answerable to the parliament. The coalition's amendments include provision that, should a report be delayed, the commission must report to the parliament and inform the parliament of why there is a delay. The time that Fair Work Australia took to process recent investigations was nothing less than shambolic. We must implement changes in legislation to shift away from a place where situations like that can ever be repeated in this country.


The commission will also be responsible for educating registered organisations about the new obligations, and will be able to receive complaints from members and provide information about what they can do if there is a problem or a complaint. Just as there is a specific rule which applies to companies and board directors to ensure that they are doing the right thing, that rule should apply to registered organisations and their officers. So the coalition will move amendments to ensure that the penalties are the same as those applying to company directors and ensure that the Registered Organisations Commission has powers broadly in line with those provided to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.


When we come into this House we often get bashed up about saying, 'No, no, no.' The reality is: 80 per cent of the legislation that goes through this place is unopposed.




Mr Tudge:
  It's 87 per cent, isn't it?




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I have just been corrected by the member for Aston; 87 per cent of the legislation that goes through here is unopposed. We do support good legislation, but we will be the first to oppose bad legislation. One key amendment will seek to bring across section 184 of the Corporations Act into the registered organisations act. This would make it a criminal offence for bosses of registered organisations to not act in good faith, to use their position dishonestly or to be reckless. The coalition's amendment will seek to further increase penalties, in line with the Corporations Act. Believe it or not, the penalties for comparable offences by the officials in registered organisations are almost nonexistent. Similar obligations under sections 287 and 288 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 as to using information for personal advantage or causing detriment to an organisation are limited to civil penalties of $2,200 for an individual, and there are no criminal provisions.


In conclusion, I believe that this is a poor bill that will not deal with the substantive issues born out of Fair Work Australia's investigations. It goes without saying that the seemingly never-ending saga of Fair Work Australia's investigations into the Health Services Union has made it absolutely clear that major reform in this area is needed. However, I believe that the reform is needed in the management rather than the legislation. The assessment of the former Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland MP, in the submission by the Institute of Public Relations noting that there are areas of the bill that can be strengthened, is highly accurate. He commented:


The bill is a step in the right direction. However, its reforms are modest and do not go far enough.


Finally, without doubt this bill and the proposed coalition amendments are a sure method that will provide greater protection to Australians in the workplace. For too long, unions have escaped proper scrutiny and finally this has exploded with the investigation of the Health Services Union and the protracted investigation by Fair Work Australia. I commend this bill, and I commend the amendments— (Time expired)

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (17:26):  There are only two reasons that we are here debating the bill in front of us, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012. The first is the sheer stench surrounding the Craig Thomson affair. Such is the stench that it has embarrassed the government into taking some action against some of their mates in the trade union movement through this bill. More importantly, it is that the opposition put out a plan to actually tackle the problem with unregulated unions just 10 days before—the coalition's plan for better transparency and accountability of registered organisations. That is the real reason that we are here discussing this bill today: we put forward a proactive proposal to deal with some of the issues which were raised throughout the Craig Thomson affair, and Labor is now rapidly trying to catch up. They are putting this bill forward so that they can pretend that they are also taking some action.


But it is a good thing that we are taking some action, and it is a good thing that we are debating trade unions and how they are regulated, their transparency and the amount of protection which is provided them in legislation. Frankly, at the moment, there is insufficient protection for union members, there is insufficient transparency and there are insufficient penalties applying to people who have breached the legislation. And the 1,200-page report of Fair Work Australia made this point very, very clearly—it found dozens upon dozens of examples of breaches of the law by the Health Services Union. Nearly every Australian would now be aware of some of these breaches, where thousands of dollars—indeed, hundreds of thousands of dollars—was misappropriated by union officials within the Health Services Union, for cash advances, for exorbitant travel, for fine dining for the union leaders and, of course, for escort services. In addition to this, almost $300,000 was appropriated by the Health Services Union for the election campaign of the now member for Dobell who, at the time, was the leader of the Health Services Union.


It was very clear from that 1,200-page report that the regulations and transparency were not sufficient to capture some of those issues. Is this the only union where these practices are going on? We simply do not know. We do know that, for example, in the construction union, all sorts of unlawfulness was discovered by the Cole royal commission—it found over 100 breaches of the law, on building and construction sites, by the building and construction trade union. So clearly there is a case that the regulations which govern trade unions are insufficient. There is clearly a case that that is happening. We actually have bipartisan agreements that the current laws are insufficient. I am pleased to see Minister Combet here because he also agrees with this proposition that the existing laws are insufficient to properly regulate and provide protections for trade union members today. Where we do disagree, though, is on the plan put forward to tackle this issue. We believe that this bill the minister has put forward goes some of the way but not far enough and fails to deal with all of the issues which are uncovered and documented in the 1,200-page Fair Work Australia report.


There are four key problems with this bill, which we believe need to be amended. Indeed, the coalition is putting forward amendments to deal with them. The first is that the bill before us still sees Fair Work Australia in control of investigating registered organisations. We simply believe that they are not up to the job to do that. We think that they have insufficient time and insufficient focus to do that. This was evidenced by the Fair Work Australia report into the Health Services Union. It took over three years to do the investigation. The report should have taken much less time than that. Furthermore, at the end of that 3½ years it was still not in a sufficient state for the police, the department or the Director of Public Prosecutions to be able to use it to action some of the egregious breaches which were outlined in that report.


So Fair Work Australia is not the right body to properly regulate and scrutinise registered organisations. We believe there should be a separate independent expert body which does that. Consequently, we are putting forward an amendment which would suggest that a registered organisations commission be established which would oversee registered organisations and would have the teeth to be able to properly scrutinise them and properly see that trade unions are being held accountable to their membership.


The second problem is that the bill does not expressly provide for Fair Work Australia the ability to cooperate with the police. Given the track record of Fair Work Australia, it is important that this be made absolutely clear in the bill. It must be made clear that Fair Work Australia must, in the appropriate circumstances, provide a brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions, if required. This should not be required, of course, in ordinary circumstances. In ordinary circumstances you would think that Fair Work Australia itself would actually go about doing the right thing and developing that brief of evidence to go to the Director of Public Prosecutions. But, again, the case of the Health Services Union proves that we in fact do need to make this part of legislation, because they spent 3½ years investigating this case and yet still did not provide the proper brief of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Furthermore, they did not cooperate with the police throughout that 3½ years of the investigation, despite the predecessor body to Fair Work Australia expressly recommending the day before Fair Work Australia was established that it should in fact put the Craig Thomson affair to the police. But they did not. We think that is disgraceful. We therefore think that there needs to be separate legislation to properly specify this in the relevant legislation which governs trade unions.


Third, the requirements and the penalties in this bill are still not in line with the Corporations Act. We think there should be a simple principle enacted in this legislation. That simple principle is that what is good for corporations is good for trade unions. In relation to penalties, for example, if the actions which were taken by the Health Services Union officials in the Craig Thomson affair occurred inside a company then individual directors may have been criminally liable for some of those things, may have had a $200,000 personal fine and could have landed in jail for up to five years. That is what occurs in the Corporations Act with the sort of egregious behaviour that we saw inside the Health Services Union. But underneath the Fair Work Australia act the penalty is up to $2,200. So you can appropriate hundreds of thousands of dollars and you can spend union members' money on prostitutes, on cash withdrawals or on your re-election campaign and the penalty is $2,200. And it is a civil penalty only.


We should be listening to Mr McClelland, the former Attorney-General, as well, who suggests that actually, if people are found guilty of such an offence, not only should they suffer greater penalties in line with the Corporations Act but also they should have to repay that money—because it is often the money of the lowest paid workers in the country that we are talking about which the trade union leaders are misappropriating for their own purposes. We do not think that is good enough. Consequently, we are putting forward amendments to bring the penalties in line with the Corporations Act.


This also goes to the issue of transparency and basic fiduciary obligations. Everybody knows that if you are a company director or a company executive you have to outline exactly where the money is being spent by a company. Executive remuneration is transparent and other measures are transparently laid out in relation to the company's accounts. We also know that company directors have to operate under fiduciary obligations. That is, they have legal obligations to act in the best interests of their company shareholders. Again, we think the trade union leaders should equally have to follow those basic guidelines. We will, again, move amendments to ensure this.


My final criticism is that the bill before us has no reporting mechanism on why investigations are going over time. It should not, frankly, have to take almost four years for an investigation to occur, with no explanation as to why it is taking almost four years. An egregious abuse of members' money should not have to take four years to investigate. It should only be a relatively short process. It should be done expediently and, if there are delays in the investigation, there should be a public statement as to why there are such delays. That, again, is a measure which we are putting forward.


In conclusion, this bill gives the perception, the pretence, that the government are concerned about corrupt practices inside trade unions, but it is just that—a pretence. They are not fair dinkum about how they are regulating trade unions through this bill. The measures do not stack up against how companies are regulated and how company directors are held accountable. The measures do not stack up in relation to transparency, and we believe that they should. The measures do not stack up in relation to the proper penalties which apply to company directors, and they should equally apply to trade union officials. Finally, the measures do not stack up in regard to the independence of the authority which has regulatory oversight of trade unions, as there indeed is an independent body which oversees the regulations governing corporations.


We are pleased that we are debating this, but we are putting forward serious amendments which we believe the government should enact. They should adopt those amendments. They would strengthen the bill and give confidence to all Australians and to all union members that their money is being protected and is being used wisely by the union leaders.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:39):  When I introduced this bill I confirmed that this government believes in a free and independent trade union movement. We believe in the advocacy of employer organisations on behalf of their members. We believe in the accountability of these registered organisations to their members.


I thank the representatives of employer organisations who, unlike those opposite, have seen fit to support our bill in its entirety. I thank the trade unions who have worked with the government as well to develop this legislation through the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council. Together we have achieved a rare feat in the workplace relations space—consensus. This consensus on the key elements of the bill was achieved without compromising the core principles underpinning the government's policy position. These principles are: respect for the role played by trade unions and employer organisations in our society and our workplace relations system; respect for the members who are entitled to expect that their interests remain the primary motivating factor for these organisations; and strong compliance with the rules of organisations as well as the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act for improved rule structures, better investigation powers and procedures with Fair Work Australia for a tripling of penalties for breaches.


I would also thank those members of this place who have spoken in favour of this bill, including those on the cross benches. Unlike others in this debate who have sought to smear and malign the trade union movement with innuendo and false charge, I have been and this government have been consistent in their approach to recent events involving compliance with the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. We have consistently stated our view, but the Fair Work investigations must be allowed to conclude without political interference. Fair Work Australia is an institution independent of the executive. We do not resile from the fact that the reports by the delegate of the general manager of Fair Work Australia into the HSU Victoria No. 1 branch and the HSU national office contain serious and disturbing material, which we have said in fairness to the members should be tested in the courts. We have also made it clear that the members of trade unions and employer organisations are entitled to expect that their membership fees will be used for their benefit.


Whilst we were doing this, I have to report to the House that those opposite have tied themselves in knots repeatedly contradicting themselves in an identifying spectacle of politicking. They have on one hand accused the government of political interference with Fair Work Australia, but then on the other hand have called upon us to intervene. They have accused, at different times, Fair Work Australia of being part of a political conspiracy, of administrative incompetence and debacle, and of delaying the release of the report for political ends. But then, when they read the report, they praised it as thorough, respected and methodical, and relied upon the content as unquestionable fact even though it had not been subject to cross-examination. They fell over themselves raising pseudo quasi-legal arguments to criticise the actions of the general manager. They then refused to acknowledge the basic tenet of our legal system and our democracy that allegations of actions contrary to law can and should be tested and determined within our court system.


Let me quote to you examples uttered by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. On 31 January this year at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition said the following about Fair Work Australia's investigation:


I just make the point that as things stand, this looks like an institutional go-slow to help the government.


That was a convenient message at the end of January, but later after the report had been released on 23 May the Leader of the Opposition described the same investigation as:


… a very long and very thorough and very meticulous and, I think, highly professional investigation.


So, there you have it. On 31 January the report is 'an institutional go-slow' and on 23 May it is amazing stuff. It is a convenient message he takes whenever it suits him in order to undermine unions and the interests of working people.


We in the government, however, have remained consistent throughout; the coalition has not. It is as simple as that in this debate about reform of registered organisations laws. This is the difference between us and those opposite when it comes to workplace relations. We make things happen, we get things done and we act in the interests of those we represent. We do not do and say things for the sake of being negative to obtain power. Most importantly, we do not keep our industrial relations policies a secret. We do not encourage the Australian voters to play hide-and-seek with our industrial relations policies. Those opposite work on the basis that the public will never find out what the coalition think until the actual election is conducted and over, just like they did in 2004. We have seen this time and time again with the opposition. They will not debate workplace relations, the full panorama of all the issues which affect all the Australian people that go to work every day. Of course, the Australian people do deserve better.


On 26 April this year, I took the difficult decision to intervene in proceedings before the Federal Court to apply for the appointment of an administrator to the East Branch of the Health Services Union. That branch covers workers in the health services sector in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. In explaining that decision, I said:


“I am particularly concerned that the interests of HSU members across Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT are not being properly served by the current dysfunction within the HSU East Branch.”


“My intervention is to ensure the broader public interest in working Australians having effective and accountable union representation is not undermined.”


I also said at the time that the decision:


… was taken to provide for the HSU to function into the future … 


meeting the expectations and in the interests of HSU members;


sustainably and in a proper and democratic way; and


in accordance with its statutory obligations, including those set out in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act.


Eight weeks later, the process of fixing this part of the Health Services Union is well underway. The Federal Court has already determined that there is sufficient dysfunction within this part of the Health Services Union and appointed an interim administrator to the HSU East Branch and HSU East, the New South Wales registered union. I thank the Hon. Michael Moore for agreeing to act in the position of administrator.


On 8 May I gave a press conference in response to the release of the report by the delegate of the General Manager of Fair Work Australia into the Health Services Union national office. During that press conference I made it clear that:


… the other unfortunate consequence is that this process has cast some doubts about the transparency and accountability of the broader trade union movement.


I believe that the problems which are reported in parts of the Health Services Union are not representative of the actions of the broader Trade Union Movement. I believe what we see here is the action of a few individuals, not the Trade Union Movement.


The government therefore committed to:


… taking wide ranging action to improve Fair Work Australia’s investigative processes … to enhance the accountability and transparency of registered organisations … strengthen associated penalties … and … introduce legislation to implement any recommendations from the KPMG Review into Fair Work Australia’s investigative capacities, once this review is completed.


Three weeks later, we delivered on these commitments and introduced the bill into this place—a bill that will improve financial training, transparency and disclosure by officials of registered organisations and by registered organisations to their members; improve the way that investigations into breaches of registered organisations provisions are conducted by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia; and introduce a threefold increase in civil penalties of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act.


Registered organisations play a fundamental role in Australia's workplace system. Registered organisations play a fundamental role in the Australian democracy. These are organisations created and registered for the purposes of representing Australian employers and employees. They have particular recognition under Australian workplace relations law by virtue of their representative status, and it is because of that registration that they have particular statutory obligations in relation to their operation, conduct and disclosure.


Registered organisations are not regulated by the Corporations Act, and this is appropriate. Some in this debate—those sitting opposite, by and large—have argued that Corporations Act regulation should be applied to registered organisations. Others have argued that penalties should be increased 100-fold. Again we see the politics of simplicity and negativity clouding the opposition. They should know that there are many similarities between the regulation of corporations and the regulation of registered organisations. Officers of organisations, like those of corporations, are subject to serious duties and obligations. For example, they must exercise care and diligence; they must act with good faith; and they must not improperly use their position for personal advantage. Further, the financial regulation of entities is similar. They are required to undertake regular reporting of their financial accounts. Auditors are required to sign off their books in accordance with accounting standards. They are subject to regulatory oversight, and the general powers of Fair Work Australia and ASIC are in fact similar. In addition, this bill uses corporations law concepts like related-party transactions.


But we must also recognise that registered organisations and corporations are different creatures, both in practice and in law. The aims of the two entities are different. Corporations are designed to generate wealth and protect the financial interests of their shareholders. Organisations are established to represent the rights of their members, whether employers or employees, at work amongst other things. There has been a false debate here that, unless all unions are regulated exactly like corporations, somehow anything else is insufficient. Yet there are many different types of entities in this country that are regulated by different regulatory regimes that are more appropriately suited to what they do and how they do it: charity organisations, not-for-profit organisations, partnerships and unincorporated associations, for example.


This bill will improve the financial accountability and transparency of registered organisations. It will increase penalties for breaches threefold in line with those in the Fair Work Act. It will make sure that officials of organisations receive appropriate financial training. It will require the remuneration of highly paid officers, related-party transactions and material personal interests to be disclosed to the members. It will fix deficiencies in the current legislation—which was in fact introduced by the Leader of the Opposition, who was the relevant minister at the time—not least by now allowing Fair Work Australia to share relevant information with state law enforcement and regulatory agencies where it is appropriate to do so. This was one of the things which those opposite were pointing to when criticising the conduct of the Fair Work investigations into the HSU, and with this bill we are actually remedying the errors in drafting made by the Leader of the Opposition when he was minister for industrial relations.


This is extremely important legislation, not entered into lightly, which should be supported by all members of this place. I should also add—when we talk about people who are supporting this—that, whilst the opposition appear to be choosing the path of negativity, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are both supporting this, as are the ACTU. In fact, some employer organisations have criticised us for going too far, such as the Master Plumbers Association. This bill has the support of the Business Council of Australia. So the stakeholders—the people who operate day to day—are unanimous in supporting us, yet those opposite still persist with their old-fashioned remedy of union baiting.


We want to make sure, on behalf of all those people in Australian society who are genuinely interested in the ongoing viability of registered organisations, that the registered organisations regulation operates in a way which ensures that organisations are accountable to their members. I commend this bill to the House.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (18:18):  I rise to speak on both the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill and the Income Tax Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill. This is the second time the government has introduced this bill into the parliament, following its stunning backflip on this issue last week. What an extraordinary moment.


Last week this exact provision the government excised from the bill, only to reintroduce exactly the same provision the following day—with no explanation. Unless the member for New England or the member for Lyne or the member for Kennedy or anyone else has an explanation, there is no explanation from the government as to why it dumped it last week and is reintroducing it this week. Last week the government moved an amendment to its own bill to excise the doubling of the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent from 1 July this year. That move followed reports that the government was unable to gain the support of the Greens—and that only came about because the Minister for Finance, Senator Wong, in the Senate accidentally let slip that when they could not get the support of the Greens on this proposal they decided to excise it from the TLAB bill.


So now the government is reintroducing the measure. This is the third budget measure the government has now shown signs of backing down on. Why else would the government excise it from the TLAB last week? The first budget backdown was the government's decision to re-embrace the dumped company tax cut from budget night, which the Prime Minister now says is a priority—but does not have the money for. Secondly, the government backed away from the ongoing CPI increases to the passenger movement charge. Thirdly, just last week, the government backed away from its doubling of the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent from 1 July 2012. That said, the coalition welcomed the backdown on the increase to the withholding tax on managed investment trusts. We thought it was something more significant. The Tourism and Transport Forum said the decision not to proceed with doubling the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts 'will go some way to restoring foreign investor confidence'. Unfortunately, this backdown was not before the government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the MIT withholding tax. This again reduced our predictability in the eyes of international investors. The Tourism and Transport Forum went on to say:


While some damage has been done to Australia’s reputation as an investment destination, the decision not to proceed with doubling the withholding tax rate will help to restore investor confidence and renew interest in Australian tourism projects.


So the tourism taskforce is in exactly the same position as we are. You can imagine where international investors are at. We do not know what the government are planning.


The government originally announced that they were reducing the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 30 per cent down to 7½ per cent, so they had a one-way trend. Then they announced on budget night that they were going to increase it from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent, which came as a shock to people, because investors had worked on the basis that there was a trend towards a lower level of tax. But then the flipside came last week, when the government simply removed it from one of their own bills, suggesting that they were now dumping the proposal in the face of our opposition and the opposition of a vast array of investors, only to reintroduce it again last Thursday and to rush through debate today. It is like groundhog day; this proposal has come back.


Well, the opposition is going to be entirely consistent. We will oppose this measure on the grounds that it unquestionably heightens sovereign risk perceptions of Australia and the change will have an adverse impact on infrastructure investment. The only thing consistent about this government is its inconsistency. It is the constant backflips, the twists and the turns that are creating the sovereign risk. In these pretty tough global economic conditions the government should be doing all it can to be stable and predictable. Unfortunately there are numerous examples where businesses are concerned about the sovereign risk that has developed towards Australia as a result of this government.


Ivan Glasenberg is the Chief Executive Officer of Glencore, which is currently in the middle of one of the biggest takeover-mergers in global history, with its attempt to take over Xstrata, which has a massive amount of investment here in Australia. Ivan Glasenberg said in London a few weeks ago:


At least in the Congo they need you, they want you there and if they start changing the rules on you, you may not continue investing.


…   …   …


So Australia does have its risk, yes. We saw the carbon tax, we saw the mineral resource tax. It is a First World country but is doing things that are making people cautious of investing, so Australia is becoming another country where you have got to make sure that the rules aren't going to change on you.


Ivan Glasenberg is saying that not as an outsider looking in, even though he lives overseas. He is also saying it as an Australian citizen.


At the dispatch box earlier today the Prime Minister was saying that it is the negativity of the opposition that is causing consternation. No, it is the incompetence of the Prime Minister, the incompetence of this government, that is causing consternation out there. We did not write Ivan Glasenberg's speech. We did not write the words of David Knox, Chief Executive Officer of Santos, when he said:


Governments must recognise what we all know … that investment in oil and gas is not a short-term game, but one based on a long-term outlook with returns over the long-term.


With such massive capital investment and therefore risk up-front, long-term investors like those in the oil and gas industry need stable, predictable, long-term rules.


My clear message to the Australian Government is: do not create uncertainty.


Instead provide our investors with the confidence in Australia as a stable fiscal and regulatory region—allow us to stay competitive.


'Allow us to stay competitive'—that is what they are saying.


Jack Nasser, Chairman of BHP and former global chief executive of Ford, who is on a number of global boards, including News Corporation, said:


I cannot overstate how the level of uncertainty about Australia's tax system is generating negative investor reaction. People don't know where it's going.


Here Jack Nasser is talking about the uncertainty coming out of Australia. These are people that have a propriety interest in the welfare of Australia, and they are saying, 'Hang on, why is Australia so unstable? Why are you making it harder for us to get global investment, to create jobs in Australia? Why are you doing this?'


John Stanhope, former Chief Financial Officer at Telstra and Director of AGL Energy, said:


… people looking outside at Australia think we're a sovereign risk because of the uncertainty created by policy fluctuation.


The difference is in the two parties, and that is very real. It struck me to hear from people who normally give Telstra a lot of money, 'No, we are not interested anymore.' To get rid of that uncertainty is very important.


In 2008, as I said earlier, this government moved to reduce the rate of withholding tax on managed investment trusts progressively from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, a move which was not opposed by the coalition. But we did ask the question about whether the government was really committed to it. At the time, we expressed concerns that the reduction in the withholding tax rate was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers due to the operation of double taxation agreements. Any reduction in taxation paid in Australia may simply have led to higher taxes being paid in other jurisdictions.


We expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny, as the government did not allow the bill to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics at the time. We raised serious concerns that the government's costings for the measure may have been underestimated. Today the government may try to use the previous arguments of the coalition against us in the current debate, but in the context of the current economic climate, including potential significant reductions in foreign investment and employment in the construction sector, the coalition does not view this as an appropriate time for the government to be doubling withholding tax on potential sources of investment that will help to drive economic growth and job creation. Continual change to our international taxation arrangements, coupled with the government's retrospective tax grabs on a variety of legislation, reduces international investor confidence and elevates concerns about our sovereign risk profile.


This instability in the government is creating greater uncertainty for investors and it is leaving Australian consumers, as well as Australian businesses, confused. There is a myriad of examples where the government says one thing and does another. As an example, I note an issue on which I have been criticised, the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The government has said it is absolutely committed to the NDIS—so committed, in fact, that it is going to bring forward, and accelerate, the implementation of the NDIS. The government is going to speed it up and, instead of committing $3.9 billion over the first three years, it is in fact only committing $1 billion. When I said it was a cruel hoax for the government to be claiming to speed up implementation of the NDIS when it was in fact massively underfunding it, people said: 'How dare you!' for saying that. 'How dare you suggest the government is not committed to it! How dare you suggest there is not bipartisan support!'


There is bipartisan support on the NDIS. However, buried in the last paragraph on page 3 of the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer's economic note that was published on Sunday, after three of the four headings, the government seemed to be boasting about its achievements in this regard. The Treasurer said:


That's been the focus of Labor since day one, it's been the focus of Julia Gillard since she became prime minister two years ago, and it's remained our focus as we've gone about getting the big reforms in place—


They love talking about big reforms. Everything is big, huge, monstrous—everything is enormous.


that will set us up for the future, like the pricing of carbon pollution, like introducing the Minerals Resource Rent Tax, like giving consumers a better deal in the banking system, and like beginning the long road towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme.


'The long road towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme.' I could have sworn it was a shortened road, because the government said that it was going to fast track the NDIS. The government was going to bring it forward. But what had become a fast track to bring forward the NDIS is now turning into 'the beginning of a long road' towards the NDIS. My goodness! Even the Prime Minister sought to list the NDIS as an achievement, and now, buried deep in the Treasurer's own economic note—which goes out on a Sunday—it is a long road to deliver that NDIS.


I wonder if the government is going to be here long enough to travel that long road. Perhaps it is like the original version of The Wizard of Oz, which I have just been reading to my children. I can tell you that the original version is a rather lengthy book—Dorothy seems to cross a lot of roads to get to Oz. I think the Labor Party's commitment to an NDIS is as topsy and turvy, and as wavy, and as fragile as Dorothy's trip along the yellow brick road, in its original version—which is sad, because in all of this the government is playing with people's hopes.


The Labor Party is hoping that people will ignore the travails of an incompetent government, but they cannot. Whether it be on social or health policy issues—like the NDIS; like the great big health reforms that the government said it was going to deliver as former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd sought to take over the hospitals and to form a joint partnership that is now mired in red tape; or like the national curriculum that the government has sought to claim as an achievement and that three years later still has not been rolled out—or on economic policy issues, like the bills before the House at this moment, this is a government that is inconsistent. It is a government that is fundamentally flawed in its ability to run an economy and to run a society. 


It is a government that does not know whether it is Arthur or Martha, whether it is Wayne or Wendy, or whether it is Julia or John. But what I know, and what my colleagues know and what, I am sure, the Australian people know, is that this is a government that is not fit for office and that the Labor Party has truly lost its way. It has never recovered from the events of just over two years ago and, if you want a single contemporary illustration of the incompetence of the government, you need look no further than these bills that are before the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:35):  I spoke in relation to this particular legislation last week, from memory, on schedule 4. I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012.


These bills implement a budget measure. We announced a particular measure in the budget that would lift the withholding tax rate applied to distributions for managed investments, to residents of a country that Australia had a tax information exchange agreement with, from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent, and it is commencing from 1 July 2012. The information I have received is that there is a total impact on the budget of about $260 million in revenue over the forward estimates. It is a not inconsiderable amount of money in relation to this measure, and it is part of our framework for ensuring that the budget gets back to surplus. The 15 per cent rate is still competitive with rates applying in other countries and brings us into line with the US, Canada, Hong Kong and the UK. For the information of those people who may be listening, in the UK the withholding treatment of distributions from MITs in relation to nonresidents is about 20 per cent and that rate may be reduced under certain treaties. In Japan it is 20 per cent generally and seven per cent for individuals listed in REITs, lifted to 15 per cent in 2014 unless extended. In South Korea, our fourth biggest trading partner, it is 22 per cent; in the United States, 30 per cent; in Canada, 25 per cent; in Belgium, 15 per cent; and in the Netherlands, 15 per cent. So when you look at what is happening around the world it is not unreasonable for our rate to be at 15 per cent.


The coalition have had every position possible in relation to this measure. When the coalition were in power, the rate was 30 per cent. It was an election commitment of ours back in 2007 to reduce the rate to 15 per cent, and we did that as part of our proposals to ensure more investment in this country and to make Australia a financial services and investment hub. The coalition have on numerous occasions criticised us over reducing it from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. They tried to refer the measure to the Senate Economics Committee for review but it did not vote against it. In the parliamentary debate they criticised the reduction to 7½ per cent, claiming it was a broken promise because it was a greater reduction than we had said we would do in the 2007 campaign.


The interesting question is what they would do if they returned to the treasury bench. If they are fair dinkum about opposing the increase to 15 per cent, then let us see them commit themselves to reversing that position. Let us see them make any public statements about that. Let us see them come clean about the issue. To date, they have not. If they are not going to do that, how are they going to save the $260 million across the forward estimates? What particular services in education, health and the like are they going to cut? How are they going to pay for it? Once again we see the coalition generally prepared to accept expenditure that we announce, rarely in support of the budget savings measures that we pursue and often against the revenue-raising measures that we undertake to make sure the budget is back in surplus and we have a viable budgetary position as a government.


From opposite we hear the nay-sayers and doomsayers. We heard the shadow treasury spokesperson talk down the economy and talk about sovereign risk. For heaven's sake! When we have government debt at about a 10th of the average in the OECD, inflation in the band expected by the Reserve Bank, interest rates much lower than they were under the Howard coalition government and unemployment at around five per cent, to go on about sovereign risk is simply a nonsense. We are talking about budget legislation that deals with about $260 million across the forward estimates. It flies in the face of all the economic indications and includes about half a billion dollars in investments in the mining sector alone—in coal, iron ore et cetera—in states such as Western Australia and Queensland, my home state.


If this is such a terrible measure that we are undertaking, you would expect the coalition, if they have any consistency, to come into this place and say where they would save the money, and they would eventually have to come into this place with a consistent policy. When we announced at one stage that we were going to cut the tax, the then doyen of economic responsibility for those opposite, the then Treasurer, called it a 'tax cut for foreigners'. We have had all kinds of positions on this matter from those opposite. They certainly have not been consistent in any way, shape or form. Even today there is umbrage and unction from those opposite but little evidence as to what their position is, except to say—as they traditionally do in this place—a simple no. Once again, I would like to know where they stand on this particular issue. I would like them to get rid of the histrionics, hysteria and hyperbole, and the over-the-top theatrics from the shadow Treasurer, that we see so often—designed in part to hide their embarrassment that we reduced the tax from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. Last week we saw grandiose statements and claims about us withdrawing this measure, and I think there is a degree of embarrassment from those opposite now that we have reintroduced it so quickly.


This is a sensible savings measure. It is consistent with the Henry review recommendations on location-specific rents. The government made the sensible commitment to bring the budget back to surplus and we are determined to do that on time and as promised. We are committed to making sure that the economy is strong and that we govern in a consistent way that gives certainty and security for those people who want to invest in this country. That is always the case: if the government keeps changing the rules and the laws and is inconsistent, then those who are in business are always worried about what might happen.


This is particularly important legislation. Those opposite have no consistency, and they have form on this issue: every sensible savings measure they block, or they pretend that they can find savings but they never articulate them. I think what they are doing here is simply adding to that $70 billion black hole which the shadow finance minister has admitted they have and the shadow Treasurer has also said they have. So this is another $260 million that they can add to that. If they want to be consistent, then let them come into this place tonight and support savings and our revenue-raising measures. Be consistent; do not just spend.


We know on this side of politics that we have been prudent with respect to revenue to the government. There is a lower tax-to-GDP ratio now than there was at any time under the Howard coalition government. All they did was engage in middle-class welfare, tax and spend. That was the Howard coalition government. There were rivers of gold coming in, but it was squandered and not invested in infrastructure and the kinds of things that lift productivity in places like Western Australia and Queensland. 


I support this legislation. I think it is prudent. It is part of the government's overall strategy. It is consistent with the majority recommendations of the economics committee of this House. If those opposite would ditch the word 'irresponsibility' and add 'responsibility' to their economic framework and policy, they would support it as well.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (18:45):  I speak in praise of the shadow Treasurer when he criticises the government for changing the goalposts. I think that it is right for our overseas investors to have faith in the Australian government.  Having said that, we are never going to be able to change anything if we take that principle to its logical conclusion. We would never be able to change anything. So I take the shadow Treasurer's remarks, but I think that you cannot just apply that rule to every single potential initiative by government—otherwise, we would never be able to take an initiative. 


One of the many reasons that I am aggro to the ALP-NLP corporation that runs this place is that you have a management coup every six or seven years, it would appear. Having said that, I take the shadow Treasurer's argument. It is a valid argument and I praise him for putting it forward. But I have also got to say that you have to make some changes.


We have this extraordinary situation where Australian companies pay 30 per cent tax, but foreign corporations only pay, I think, 17 per cent tax. It is an extraordinary anomaly. You say, yes, but the agreement is that our companies in America pay only 17 per cent tax and then they have to pay the rest of it when they come back to Australia. How many companies do we own in America? How many do they own in Australia? This is a very lopsided deal, a very, very lopsided arrangement. It needs to be clawed back, and part of the clawing back is happening here today. From an overseas investor's point of view, this place is dreamland—and not dreamland in so far as being the land of dreams—it is paradise. You only have to pay 17 per cent interest. You have high interest rates and you can absolutely guarantee that the dollar is going to continue to ascend. You know that the ALP-NLP corporation that runs the country is very, very committed to the idea that overseas financiers should be given a rails run. Just look at your country. The supine attitude of the last government and the current government has resulted in many of our resources being foreign owned.


Fifteen years ago all of Australia's great mining companies were Australian owned—BHP, Western Mining Corporation, Normandy and Mount Isa Mines were all Australian owned. Eighty-five per cent of our mineral resources were under those great mining companies and all were Australian owned. Now they are all foreign owned. 


The second biggest agricultural industry in this country is dairying and every single factory in Australia was Australian owned prior to deregulation in the year 2000. Now all the giant corporations in the dairy industry except Murray-Goulburn are foreign owned. All of our sugar mills with the exception of Mackay Sugar are foreign owned. Our airlines were all totally Australian owned and, thanks to the machinations of the head of Qantas and the board of Qantas, clearly, Qantas is going to be divided up into five companies and four those companies will be foreign owned. Is there anything that Australia still owns? Is there any significant company in this country that is still Australian owned? If there is, do not tell me about, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Symon, because, if the overseas corporations find out, it will not be Australian owned for very long—that is for certain.


In this place we hear a lot about Moody's and Standard & Poor's. They do not run this country and their track record is absolutely appalling. I would urge Treasury officials, if they are sitting in the House here, to go and get out the three books on Enron. Standard & Poor's and Moody's and all the rest of them told us that Enron was a great, stable and wonderful company, just two months before Enron fell over, owing their shareholders and their creditors $64,000 million. They only made a little mistake—$64,000 million in one corporation. 


It is an infinitely more complicated situation with governments. I am very worried about a tendency that governments have when they skite about not spending money. I belong to the biggest borrowing government in Australia's history. We did not borrow, as the current LNP government in Queensland is doing, to build pleasure domes in George Street—the parliamentary precinct—as the current newly appointed LNP government is doing in Queensland. We did not do that. We spent the money on building a railway line out to the middle of nowhere where there is a whole stack of coal reserves because a bloke called Les Thiess reckoned he could sell the coal to Japan. We did our homework and we reckoned he could, so we borrowed a king's ransom in money and spent it building that coal line. We had no guarantee of anyone using that line. They might have signed some agreements but they were only as good as the company. If the company fell over, we would have, so we took huge risks and we built this giant port at Gladstone, one of the six biggest ports in the world in that it could take 200,000-tonne vessels. There were only six ports in the world that could take 200,000-tonne vessels.


Not stopping there, we built one of the four biggest power stations in the world so we could have the cheapest electricity in the world. We gave those Utah coalminers a rail run, and we had a small clause which gave us the overburden coal. We drove this giant economies of scale power station on free coal because of the cunning deal we had done. We built a power station that we did not need. There were no users there for that power station. It was a huge risk that the great Ron Camm, who was more of a mentor than even my father, took in building that power station. He said, 'If we have the cheap electricity, the aluminium industry will come.' It was a huge risk. If they had gone bad with coal or aluminium they would have been annihilated as a government. Heaven only knows, they were ripped into continuously, all the time. They borrowed, spent all this money and put the state into hock. Yes, but the money was not spent on buying votes. Most of the expenditures in this place really amount to buying votes. You can say that the spending makes life more easy and more attractive for people. Well, we were hard people—13 of our cabinet had cut cane by hand as young men. We were not used to all the leisures and pleasures of life. We were used to making sacrifices, saving our money and investing it in the future in productivity.


We now spend $23,000 million every year, and three of the people on the boards of the superannuation companies that spend that money have been in to see me. They say, 'All we are doing is pumping up the balloon.' I say to Treasury, to ASIC and to all these other people who are supposed to be the prudential controllers, 'Don't you see that you are blowing up a balloon?' All of that $23,000 million is being spent on realty and on the share market and it is just blowing it up. There is nothing behind it at all, except the $23,000 million that is going to be invested next year. There is nothing actually being produced at all, and in the meantime we say, 'Oh, we have to get money from overseas to open up our coalmines and our iron mines.'


There was a 60-40 rule with superannuation in the days when I sold superannuation. I made a lot of money out of it, too. God bless all the people that I worked for, my clients. Sixty per cent of that money went into government securities, so what happened in 1998 and again with the GFC and things like the collapse of Storm Financial could not have happened under us. Sixty per cent of that money was government guaranteed. Let me give you just one example. You introduce ethanol, and then you know you have a market in Australia for ethanol. So you can go and put the money up to build a big dam to put in giant new sugar mill. It is going to produce ethanol and you know you have a market for it, and you have a guaranteed price because it is backed up by petrol prices throughout the world. It is a dwindling resource and will constantly increase in price. You know you have a beautiful lay-down misere investment here. Say the investment is in the dam and the delivery canal. Maybe we do not grow ethanol; we grow something else. But the government is in the position to be able to guarantee that sort of investment within reason.


I sit beneath a picture of the great Jack McEwen. He had many great sayings, but the one I liked best was that government is about getting it right and education is no replacement for hard work in getting it right. Sir Leo Hielscher put in time and effort and energy, and all those bridges across the Brisbane River are named after him. He was a very great man. He took risks as the Secretary of Treasury in Queensland with his advice to the government. There were the risks that men like Bjelke-Petersen and Ron Camm took. We are yielding the benefit of those to this very day. For the last 30 years the economy of this nation has been carried by the coal industry and the aluminium industry and they were both put there by huge risks being taken in investment. Sir Leo Hielscher was offered the Reserve Bank three times and offered the World Bank position once. He said: 'We did not really take a risk. We always knew that the aluminium would come. We always knew that we would be able to sell coal to Japan.' He could say that afterwards, but at the time I am sure he was sweating a little.


We have this huge resource of the $23,000 million. Why are we giving a free kick to every foreign corporation? I am very pleased to see the Treasurer moving today to take some of that money back. Mistakes have been made in the past. One of the ways of rectifying that is to get some of that money back through measures like the one he is moving tonight. I will be backing it even though I think we should all listen to what the shadow Treasurer said this evening as well.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (18:59):  In speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 it is, as the shadow Treasurer said, a bit like groundhog day. The substance of these bills was included in separate tax law amendment bills last week. Those changes, which see a doubling of the relevant withholding tax from 7½ to 15 per cent, were announced suddenly on budget night. As the shadow Treasurer quite rightly pointed out, in so many respects this tax legislation before the House—yet again, as it turns out—sums up so much about the incompetence of this government, and not just on taxation policy. It really encapsulates and symbolises the government's failure to govern, and how its incompetence, at so many levels, creates a lack of confidence in the investment community. It leverages sovereign risk, as the shadow Treasurer so rightly said, and these tax bills really sum it up, on the second anniversary of the government's sudden change of Prime Minister.


It is worth recounting some of the history on this as a window into the damage the government's approach on taxation matters is doing, specifically with regard to these bills. As I pointed out last week, four years ago in June 2008 the government legislated with great fanfare that it was reducing the relevant tax rate in this legislation down to 7½ per cent. That had been announced in Labor's first budget, and following the then Assistant Treasurer, the member for Prospect, speaker after speaker on the other side lauded the reduction to 7½ per cent and pointed out that the reduction was designed to send a signal to international investors.


Of course, it follows that the sudden decision to double to 15 per cent the relevant rate also sends a signal. It sends a signal that this government cannot be trusted on matters of tax. This is the government that four years ago made so much of reducing the rate to 7½ per cent and then suddenly, in the budget, doubled that rate. The signal it sends is that this a government that cannot be trusted. This is a government that will chop and change. This is a government, as we have seen, that will say before an election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government it leads,' to paraphrase, and after the election introduces one. This is a government that out of the blue produces a mining tax.


The message overseas, with the Labor government in Australia pricing our investment, is that investors must now take into account that taxes will increase suddenly. In luring investment here by sending that signal, which those opposite spoke so proudly about four years ago, it will have a retrospective effect. But on top of that it also has the effect of saying there is a sovereign risk of sudden changes. We do not need to take my word or the word of the shadow Treasurer on this matter. As I outlined in the debate last week, there are so many leaders in their fields representing international investors who made this very point just after the budget. We have had those statements quoted in this House about how very directly indeed the government's decision meant that investors would think twice in the future about the sorts of investments they made.


Just last Friday respected commentator Jennifer Hewett, from the Australian Financial Review, made this very point. Jennifer Hewett summed up so many of the quotes that had been put into the debate through the course of last week when she wrote:


Labor has developed an unenviable reputation for its willingness to change tax rates and structures for investments.


This completely undercuts faith in the permanence of reforms that do occur …


My friend and colleague the member for Wright, who will speak after me, knows that of all the quotes that members of this side, including myself, put forward, those statements by Jennifer Hewett in the Australian Financial Review last Friday sum up the words and the sentiment of the reaction. What it says is if you send a signal by reducing the rate to 7½ per cent you surely send an opposite signal by doubling it. You surely send a signal that when it comes to investment in Australia sudden tax changes are the order of the day. The shadow Treasurer rightly referred to the events of last week and I want to refer to them, too, because the way the government has gone about the doubling of this tax also leverages uncertainty. Suddenly, in the budget, as I said earlier in my contribution, the government doubled the rate to 15 per cent. Then we had the tax law amendment bill last week that included in, from memory, schedule 4 the very measure we are debating now. But without any announcement whatsoever the government tabled an amendment to simply delete that schedule. As the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out, the initial reaction from industry was: 'They must have backed down. They must have seen sense.' That was the reaction from industry and some of the people the shadow Treasurer quoted. But, of course, the real point is that there was not any word from the government. There was no announcement from the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer—not only was there no announcement; there was no explanation at all.


The debate in Hansard of, I think, last Wednesday sums up the chaos that afflicts this government when it comes to taxation policy. You had an amendment before the House during the debate—let me give them a little wiggle room; maybe it was a minute or two before the debate began—but no announcement, just an amendment to delete the schedule that would give effect to what had been announced on budget night. When it came to the summing up and the consideration in detail of the bill, in concluding his five-minute speech the shadow Treasurer asked the Assistant Treasurer on three separate occasions, three times in a row, what the position was. It was greeted by silence. The Assistant Treasurer was absolutely mute. Here was a minister of the Crown in here handling legislation where an amendment to strip out a fundamental budget announcement is moved and not only is there no public announcement; there is no parliamentary justification—not a word.


Those actions of the Assistant Treasurer will stand as a symbol of this government's arrogance and incompetence. I am not quite sure what the balance was, but it was only after the third occasion—I think when the shadow minister for finance spoke during consideration in detail—that, finally, the Assistant Treasurer would say that there would be a separate piece of legislation. It was barely audible in this House. And so it was on the very next day, the last sitting day of last week, that this legislation we are debating today was introduced.


This reeks of chaos in the decision making in the government. They cut a tax to 7½ per cent; they double it to 15 per cent in the budget, with all the signals that sends. They decide they are going to strip it out of a TLA bill and put it as a stand-alone measure and they cannot even communicate it. I was thinking perhaps the Assistant Treasurer really did not know what was happening or why, but in parliamentary debate—and I have witnessed quite a bit of it—I have never seen such a spectacle.


It might surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to hear me saying this, but I do not mind saying it. There are those opposite who follow these matters at a technical level pretty closely on the back bench. To be a backbencher and watch that spectacle must have been very frustrating because it was nothing short of a disgrace for decision making on the part of the government. It is, as the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out at the beginning of this debate, a symbol of so much that is wrong with this government.


When this debate is over, every member on that side who was elected or re-elected in 2007 will be able to say that they voted to decrease the tax and they voted to increase the tax. That is what they will be able to do. The actions of the Assistant Treasurer last week do sum up the government's failure on tax. It is no wonder that the incompetence and the chopping and changing that is on display directly leverage the sort of uncertainty and sovereign risk that have been spoken about in this debate.

 (Wright) (19:14):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. This bill epitomises the performance of this government in this parliament. This bill has had more starts than Black Caviar. It is like going to the tennis. I watched the women's tennis semi-final at Rafter Stadium last year. Watching this bill come in, go out, come in, go out, come in, go out is nothing short of a tennis match. I know deep in my heart that members opposite, members of this government, are embarrassed about the way this bill has been managed through this House—they must be, because there are a lot of things to be embarrassed about. Not only are we embarrassed by the way the government has conducted the transition of this bill through the House; when we speak in this House it is not just a local audience but a national and global audience. When a bill comes before the House that speaks to managed investment trusts and the imposition of tax on companies choosing to invest in this nation, it is a matter of national importance and a matter of sovereign risk.


The Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 amends the managed investment trust final withholding tax from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent on payments made in relation to income years commencing after 1 July 2012. There is one thing we can be thankful for: there is not an element of retrospectivity associated with this bill, as there are for many other pieces of legislation that come before this house. We can at least be thankful for that.


Schedule 1 to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 makes consequential amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to give effect to the increase in the consequential MIT final withholding tax rate imposed by the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. According to the budget, it is expected to generate approximately $260 million in revenue over the forward estimates. I suspect that the only reason we are having this debate is because of the $260 million this bill is forecasted to bring in.


During this debate I will bring evidence from the financial sector of this nation that says this government is prepared to blow-off $1 billion in lost revenue—flighted international revenue that would have come to this nation—to pick up $260 million. How does that work? The government are starting to make financial decisions because their political survival is so thinly strung that we have a forecasted $1.5 billion surplus. Their political decisions are built around that figure. This $260 million helps in generating that revenue, but in order to do it they are prepared to sacrifice $1 billion worth of revenue—and I will tell you who said that.


The MIT final withholding tax rate of 15 per cent will apply to fund payments made in relation to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2012. That seems like a special memorial date for this government. As we all know, the world's largest carbon tax kicks off on that date. We have the start of the investment withdrawal in Australia and yet another tax that will have a snowballing effect on investment and increase our exposure to sovereign risk. We have a two-tiered economy at the moment: we have the resources sector, which is considerably strong, and we have another sector of the community, including the electorate of Wright, which has no linkages into the resources sector. Economics 101 tells us that when you are trying to stimulate an economy there are two things that you do: decrease tax and increase government spending. We have got the increased government spending; we can go through the myriad wasteful spending activities that this government has participated in. We were supposed to see a reduction in a tax rate, and I believe that was the reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. That is like going to the tennis semifinals as well: it is in and out and in again and out again depending on where the polls are at the moment.


We recently had the Prime Minister up in Queensland telling business leaders they should be out there talking up the economy and saying how well things are going. When you walk up and down the streets of Beaudesert, when you walk up and down the streets of Gatton, which is predominantly a farming and rural precinct, or when you get up into the tourism sector of Mount Tamborine in my electorate, these people are doing it extremely tough. I forecast tonight that we are going to see double-digit figures of businesses exiting the market. If you want to get into a booming business at the moment, go and get yourself some shares in some receivables businesses or some administrators because they will be going gangbusters as result of some of this government's policies.


In 2008, when Labor previously reduced the withholding tax progressively from 30 per cent to 7.5 per cent the coalition did not oppose the relevant bill. We did not oppose it because it was done in an orderly fashion. We sent messages to the market in an orderly fashion and said that it would be staged down. We have this wake-up-and-get-out-of-bed type haphazard approach of saying: 'Today we might just double the withholding tax rate; that is a good idea, because we have run out of ideas.' As a government, they have run out of ideas. However, at the time, we did express concern that it was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers because of the operational double taxation agreements, and any reduction in taxation paid in Australia may simply have led to higher taxes being paid to other jurisdictions.


At the time, the coalition also expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny as Labor had not allowed the bill to be considered by the Senate Economics Committee, that Labor's costings of the measures would be dubious and that Labor had delivered a tax cut to foreigners in the 2008 budget but had not delivered a tax cut to Australian citizens and taxpayers. When will this Labor government realise that continual changes to our international taxation arrangements, coupled with Labor's recent retrospective tax grabs, reduce international investor confidence and elevate concerns about Australia's sovereign risk profile?


I sit on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, and it was interesting to hear from industry and the private sector about their concerns with the proposed legislative changes. Treasury indicated it expected little negative influence on investment flows from the increase. This position was vigorously rejected by industry, and I will quote from the Hansard transcript of the inquiry.


But before I do that, how often do we see that happen, where we have Treasury come out with a position or a forecast and industry vigorously rejecting or opposing it? We do not have to look too much further than last year's forecast of what this deficit was going to be. Back before the last budget I think we had a forecast for this budget in the vicinity of $10 billion. Six months later and we are looking at a figure of $22.7 billion! This is from the same department—virtually double within a six-month period. And when the recent MYEFO documents came out it bounced out to $37 billion. This is Treasury, contrasting, again, with industry, which goes to the credibility of all forecasting. Of course, who knows what the budget deficit is going to end up at? I think it is going to be in the vicinity of $44 billion, but with this government cooking the books and trying to bring expenditure back from next year into this, who knows? 


I opened my comments by saying that this bill was similar to Makybe Diva. I wouldn't be putting a punt on whichever figure—




Mr Snowdon:
  You've changed horses!




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I have changed horses. Before I digressed, I was looking at conflicting views between Treasury and the industry. This is an exchange between Anthony McDonald of Treasury and Peter Verwer, Chief Executive, Property Council of Australia:


Mr McDonald: I am not aware; there probably would be. But in this instance, to the extent that we would have allowed for any reduction in this sector as a result of the budget measure, it would be fairly minimal. 


Fairly minimal? For a $260 million pick-up in tax revenue? I ask you: how do you quantify what is 'fairly minimal'? He went on to say:


That I know might sound strange to those directly involved in the sector because we are looking at the net impact across the economy rather than just the impact in the sector. 


So, don't look at it across the sector; look at it across the whole GDP. It is similar to what the government does with reference to rationalising its debt ratio and saying, 'It's only seven per cent or only 10 per cent of GDP.' If you take this as a rational comparison against not a number that should have been used as a common denominator but the whole economy, of course it is only minimal. This is the logic that they are using to try to rationalise the irrational. He went on to say:


Again, if we are looking at financial flows there would be a greater reduction in the flows that occur through managed investment trusts but what we are interested in is what happens to the aggregate base and that is a different thing.


Mr Verwer: The question was: where would that extra money come from in order to ensure that the aggregate basis remained in alignment? We are still waiting for the answer.


Mr McDonald: That is part of what being a small, open economy that is engaged in international capital markets with a freely floating exchange rate does.


There were some other comments from Mr Verwer:


In fact, these foreign investors have said to us quite clearly that some of them had already pulled out because we no longer meet their hurdle rate—it did not take long to do the sums; others said that they have frozen the negotiations. 


To support those comments I draw your attention to the Hansard of the Economics Committee and questioning of Mr Martin Codina from the Financial Services Council. The member for Throsby asked him:


Is there any evidence for that flight of capital occurring?


That is, as a result of this legislation. This is where the $1 billion comes in. Mr Codina said:


There is absolute evidence of that. Collectively we have quantified in excess of $1 billion, some of which has been made public and some of which is highly sensitive, because of the nature of the foreign investors. In some cases you have sovereign funds—in other words, it would be akin to a foreign government being critical of the Australian government as a consequence of the change.


Why am I only hearing about this in Economics Committee hearings where the Financial Services Council of Australia is giving evidence? Why weren't these opinions sought in the consultation process? Why weren't these people consulted? When you talk to Treasury they always open up with, 'We've consulted with the industry; we've consulted with everyone; we've consulted this to death.' Mr Codina later went on to say:


Let me put it this way. We were disappointed that we were not consulted prior to the announcement being made on budget night. Since this government came into office in 2007, we have issued something like 10 media releases which were supportive of subsequent changes that have been made, either to our tax system or regulatory-wise, that essentially had their origins in the Johnson review. We were one of the leading participants in the Johnson review, involved in much of the work that was conducted there. So I guess all I can say is it did come as a surprise, as an organisation that is actively involved in assisting the government in this area, that the announcement was made without any prior consultation.


Why would a government not consult with major stakeholders on such a sensitive bill that has the capacity to generate $1 billion of flight in capital from this nation? I will tell you why. To save the budget bottom line—I can think of no other reason—of a measly $260 million.


The government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the MIT withholding tax has yet again reduced our predictability in the eyes of international investors. If passed, this bill would undermine Australia's objective of becoming a regional financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region. Attracting more foreign investment is important to achieve stronger economic growth which would lead to increased government revenue without the need for many new or increased taxes. Industry was barely consulted; the Australian people are rarely consulted; and the coalition remains opposed to this bill. (Time expired)

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (19:29):  I rise on behalf of the Australian Greens to raise a specific concern with this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012—that is, the potential impacts of the bill on investment in low-carbon and renewable energy projects. It does not appear from the terms of the bill that it would have a particular impact on this area, but there have been some significant representations made by many in the sector that the current arrangements have been attractive to those overseas funds that are particularly interested in investing in areas where there might be higher ethical and sustainability standards than one might find in an ordinary investment. 


The Australian Greens have received a letter from the Green Building Council of Australia, and I would like, if I might, to relate a couple of the points it makes. The chief executive, Ms Romilly Madew, and the executive director of advocacy, Mr Robin Mellon, make the point that:


The current withholding tax rate of 7.5 per cent has supported Australia's economic growth by encouraging investments in commercial property construction and critical infrastructure including low-carbon and renewable energy projects. The Property Council of Australia has identified that a priority of foreign investors, attracted by the lower withholding tax rate, has been high-grade buildings with strong green credentials. 


They give some examples and then go on to say:


The Green Building Council of Australia supports any initiatives, programs or campaigns that encourage Australia's green building and sustainable community industry. The PCA research indicates that the increase in the WHT rate is likely to harm investment into Australia's green building future. The GBCA urges the government to reconsider this action and examine the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the direct and indirect impacts on stakeholders, more closely.


We have been involved in some discussions over recent weeks, and these concerns remain unallayed for us. The Greens still have concerns that this bill might have a disproportionate impact on low-carbon and renewable energy projects. Senator Christine Milne, who is responsible for speaking on behalf of the Greens on Treasury matters, is taking carriage of this matter will not stand in the way of the bill passing through the House, but we are not yet in a position to give support for the passage of this bill in the Senate. Our concerns remain very real and have not yet been resolved. We understand that the government has set a self-imposed time line for getting this legislation through. On behalf of the Greens I can say that that may be the government's view but our concerns are yet to be resolved. On that basis, we will not stand in the way of its passage through the House, but that is without prejudice to the position we might take in the Senate. We feel that we have very clearly put on notice the concerns we want to see addressed.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (19:33):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. 


Since 2 May, the government has had more positions on the MIT withholding tax rate, and attracting investment, than I can count on one hand. The history is simply this: on 2 May, Minister Ferguson launched the Australian 'open for investment' campaign, designed to attract offshore investment in the 80 shovel-ready projects in Australia. Less than a week later, on 8 May, the budget was handed down, announcing the MIT would go from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent—effectively undermining the Australia 'open for investment' campaign. 


On the evening of 9 May, 2012, Minister Ferguson told the National Tourism Alliance at an industry gathering that he appreciated there were people in the room who were unhappy but that his job was to defend the government, so he would defend the government. On 20 May, Minister Ferguson failed to appear in the House to defend the MIT withholding tax increase that he said he would defend at the NTA. 


On 20 June, the government amended its own bill to take out the doubling of the MIT withholding tax rate. On 21 June, the very next day, the government reintroduced its own MIT withholding tax bill in exactly the same form to again raise the tax from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent—proving the often-made point that Labor cannot stick to a policy from lunchtime to Lateline. I note on the speakers list that Minister Ferguson is not going to come into this House and defend his government's decision to lift the MIT withholding tax rate which is effectively knocking over his campaign program for those 80 shovel-ready projects.


It is no wonder there is a crisis in confidence in the tourism industry. It appears that the government does not understand that international capital is very fluid and will flow wherever the best opportunity and returns are. I have to wonder what the Independents' price was when they sold out to approve this measure. I have just heard a member of the Greens say they are going to pass this bill in the House but reserve their opinion in the Senate. The place to block this bill is here and now, because it would not be back on the agenda without their support. If the Independents and the Greens support this legislation they will have gone from hero to zero in the tourism industry's opinion in a matter of days.


This measure will combine with nine other measures in the budget that will undermine the government's 2020 Tourism Industry Potential strategy, which was publicly released in November 2010. That strategy—or flyer, as some in the industry call it, given its lack of detail—has outlined an ambitious set of goals to promote the long-term, sustainable growth of the Australian tourism industry. According to Tourism Australia, realising this potential would mean 'doubling overnight expenditure for Australia’s tourism industry, from $70 billion to as much as $140 billion by 2020.' It would increase tourism's contribution to the GDP to up to three per cent in 2020 and increase tax revenue from tourism from $9.3 billion in 2009 to as high as $14.5 billion in 2020. The carbon tax alone makes this goal relatively unachievable. Taxing new hotel developments makes those goals even more impossible. In conceding the tourism industry's victory against Labor's departure-tax cash-grab, the government might have opted to repair some of the bridges along with other tourism infrastructure. Instead, it announced a reduction to the Asia Marketing Fund from $61 million to $48.5 million—that was in a press release that was hidden quietly on the Treasurer's website—and that was a payback for forcing government to back down on a budget measure. Such a childish response only adds to the chorus of calls for a grown-up government to get Australia back on track. The regional tourism infrastructure fund announced: firstly, has effectively reduced the Asia Marketing Fund by $12½ million; secondly, returns the industry the $11.5 million previously cut from Labor's first budget in 2008-09; and, thirdly, offers no detailed plan to deliver on either tourism demand drivers or tourism supporting infrastructure.


The tourism sector did not take lightly its huge step in launching full-blown advertising campaigns against the government in recent weeks. It did so to protect jobs and is looking forward to building what should be a normal relationship of mutual trust, full disclosure and, importantly, genuine consultation. It reflects well on tourism bodies that they did not respond to the petty slap of a reduced Asia Marketing Fund as a consequence of the government's reduced departure tax revenue. The sector might have highlighted that the government could easily have kept the Asia Marketing Fund intact since this investment was only 10 per cent of the projected revenue in the first place. 


Yet this should not be confused with the tourism industry taking the hotel investments tax lying down. This is a vital issue for the tourism industry and the government's own words reinforce the point. Eleven months ago, the now former minister for tourism, the Hon. Nick Sherry, told industry leaders:


The sad fact is that much of Australia's accommodation is outmoded and outdated and Chinese visitors in particular … are used to very modern facilities in their own country. There is a great challenge in tourism to invest in the modernisation of facilities.


In the same meeting he said that we need to see an increase in investment to realise the potential, and added that the country would need between 40,000 and 70,000 additional hotel rooms by 2020 to cope with projected demand. 


Individuals and trusts base their decisions on statements like these and like the twice-yearly releases from Australia's independent Tourism Forecasting Committee. Smart investors will always weigh potential returns with risk, and they look to the government to manage the economy according to a plan. This gives hotel investors confidence to sign on for the long-term investments in hotel developments that are typically delivered over a 10-year cycle.


In last week's debate I read into the Hansard the views of Tourism Accommodation Australia, the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, amongst others. It would benefit the House to reflect today on the prebudget submission by the Accommodation Association of Australia, delivered well in advance of the budget—in fact, it was delivered the day after Australia Day in 2012. They say in their submission:


32. While accommodation rooms within Australia are, by and large, of a high standard in comparison to other countries, continual refurbishment is required for businesses and the broader industry for it to remain globally competitive.


33. The stagnation in the number of overseas visitor arrivals in the second half of the last decade, together with the drop in domestic tourism has created a difficult trading environment for accommodation businesses, notably those in locations outside Australia’s capital cities.


34. The returns for many investors in accommodation businesses have not been adequate enough for them to make major commitments to capital expenditure on upgrading existing rooms and other parts of their businesses (restaurants, function rooms, meeting/convention space, leisure facilities).


That was the AAA prebudget submission dated 27 January 2012, so the government is aware of these issues.


Credit should be given to Minister Ferguson in delivering a prospectus of unfunded hotel investments. It is no silver bullet for tourism investment, and it is useless unless matched by other government policies that work in the same direction. I welcomed the prospectus as a 'good first step to restoring tourism infrastructure' when it was announced on 2 May 2012. Yet it only took the government six days to undermine this potentially effective measure with plans to double hotel investment tax, and today they replicate that action. This confused and incoherent approach highlights a dysfunctional government with portfolios not delivering a whole-of-government approach. Otherwise, why would you launch a policy based on a 7½ per cent tax, a week ahead of the government, in its own budget, increasing that tax to 15 per cent? It flies in the face of logic, reasoning and, in particular, investor confidence.


We were all reminded of this last week when the government withdrew its hotel investment tax and reintroduced its bill the next day in exactly the same form. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott: what sort of message does this send to potential investors? The opportunity for crossbenchers to deliver stability and certainty comes tonight with these very bills. In supporting the coalition's opposition to automatic CPI indexation of the departure tax last week, the Independents helped make Australia a more attractive tourism destination, to the tune of $125 million a year, and that is according to the government's figures. Yet fixing this demand challenge is pointless unless matched by a commitment to fix the supply-side challenges. And according to all of the tourism and accommodation sector peak bodies, the managed investment trust cash-grab is a key test for minority government to act responsibly.


Despite the government's own vacillation undermining investor confidence, the Property Council of Australia has indicated that the only hope Australia has for maintaining its reputation as a safe place to invest is for the parliament to firm its resolve and reject this bill. Independents cannot walk away from their responsibilities to regional tourism on the basis of an exaggerated regional assistance package, for this small amount of money will be spent in a meaningful way. It is vital to achieve the right mix of demand driver and supporting infrastructure allocations. Examples of demand drivers might be the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service's Three Capes Track, or the redevelopment of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Supporting infrastructure is the transport and accommodation you would use when going to see a tourist attraction, like the Spirit of Tasmania, or the Old Woolstore Apartment Hotel—something I thought the member for Bandt might be interested in. However, the money is allocated, Independents should demand accountability, planning, and an outcomes focus. As I write this, I think of the Clump Point marina and the jetty at Dunk Island—still in a state of disrepair 18 months after Cyclone Yasi, despite our Prime Minister approving money to fix this infrastructure.


I seek leave to table a photograph of the jetty at Dunk Island, still in a state of disrepair some two years after it was damaged by Cyclone Yasi.


Leave granted.




Mr BALDWIN:
  There are quite literally thousands of Australian restaurants, motels, hotels and other businesses that have not spruced up their properties since the Australian dollar approached parity with the US in 2008. With fewer customers comes less profit to reinvest in hotel upgrades to stay competitive with other markets. The crisis in both consumer and investor confidence in Australian tourism is not all because of unfortunate realities like the sluggish economic performance of our traditional markets, the high Australian dollar or natural disasters; it is also because of perfectly avoidable policies that damage tourism. The standout example, of course, is the world's largest carbon tax, which will make foreign destinations even more attractive to tourists and diminish even further returns on hotel investments.


Like potential investors, Independents must weigh the totality of government policy affecting returns on investment here compared to overseas. Doubling hotel investment tax will affect investment decisions yet so will the other nine budget measures that will damage the tourism industry. Australia should seek to grow tourism and enjoy the benefits that flow from higher employment, a diversified economy and improved ties with other nations. Overtaxing tourism will stunt this growth and is short-sighted in the extreme. For tourism there is no greater challenge facing the minority government than repairing the damage already done to investor confidence in this afternoon's debate.


So if the Independents who support the coalition and, more importantly, the industry in knocking over the CPI increases in the PMC want to remain the pin-up boys of the tourism industry then I say this to them: oppose this legislation, which will directly affect investment in your seats. It will directly destroy confidence in investment in Australia. It will destroy the concept that this is a good sovereign nation to invest in. And, importantly, think about your own electorate. Think about the employment figures in your own electorate. Think about how this investment could be placed in your electorate and you can take part in the journey.


By supporting this government, I say to them—and if indeed they do support this bill; the member for Bandt has already indicated that he will be supporting this bill in this House—at what price have you sold out your electorate? If you stood up for the tourism industry you would not be selling out the tourism industry, and those workers and those investors— (Time expired)

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (19:48):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trusts Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and associated bill. This bill is once again before the House. As bill after bill is introduced into this House, the Australian community continues to be let down by this Gillard Labor government, which refuses to listen and refuses to consult. Just last week, the government decided to withdraw the bill before a vote. The coalition believed that finally the Gillard Labor government had woken up to reason and that the Gillard Labor government had finally listened to concerns in industry and the community. I thought at least that they had noticed the immovable outrage pouring from the financial, property and tourism industries about the measures in these bills. Yet here we are again debating bills which, if passed, will be another direct attack on the Australian economy. 


I welcomed the decision not to pass the tax increase last week—a tacit admission that the government had not thought through their policy and an admission by the Gillard Labor government that they were completely wrong to introduce this measure in the first place. Their delay is yet another concerning sign that this government continues to develop policy on the run.


This scattered and confused approach does not, as they say, inspire consumer confidence. It was reported last week by Dun and Bradstreet that three-quarters of Australians are expressing concern about their financial situation and one in three Australians say they would be unable to cover basic expenses for longer than a few weeks if faced with sudden unemployment. As a result, consumers are saving. They are not spending, which poses significant risks for industries including construction and retail. Nor does this government encourage business confidence. Their incessant incompetence and their proclivity for new and increased taxes sends a signal to the international business community that Australia is not a good place in which to invest money.


Today's increase to the managed investment trust withholding tax, is yet another attack on business confidence. The Gillard government, on a whim, has decided that it will increase the withholding rate from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent—double. This increase makes investment in Australia less viable and directly undermines the aim of maintaining our economic resilience and boosting Australia's international reputation as a financial services hub in our region. This increase directly contravenes the words of the current Assistant Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, when he said in 2008:


If we are to be internationally competitive then … we must have rates of taxation that are amongst the lowest in the world.


The Assistant Treasurer should heed his own advice, because this tax increase does make us less internationally competitive and it does makes foreign investment, using the MIT structure, less attractive. This policy translates to a disincentive for foreigners to invest in Australian infrastructure. Make no mistake: this move will damage Australia's reputation and will hurt our economy. Indeed, according to the Property Council of Australia, more than $1 billion of planned foreign investment has already been affected.


Maintaining the 7.5 per cent tax rate is important because it is of fundamental importance to attract foreign investors to invest in key Australian infrastructure. In particular, many institutional investors such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds use the MIT structure to invest because they are specifically the types of organisations which are looking much longer into the future and have the capacity to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects which may not see a return for many years. They invest in the construction of buildings like electricity generation facilities, hotels and tourism facilities, hospitals, motorways and toll roads, green buildings, and other carbon dioxide abatement programs. Sometimes these projects require decades-long commitment to keeping their investment money in Australia. It is important to note that not only are these facilities crucial to the long-term benefit of the Australian economy but those institutional and pension fund investors are exactly the type of reliable and respected investors we can trust to stay here.


It has been only 48 days since the Treasurer delivered his budget—the budget of smoke and mirrors, broken promises and direct attacks on the fiscal bottom line of all Australians. After the Gillard government's apparent decision to drop the proposed increase in the managed investment trust withholding tax last week, we now have the fourth proposed change to a budget measure. The Treasurer announced that the government would be dumping their proposed company tax cuts, yet has more recently said they are now back on the table. Their second backflip was indexation of the passenger movement charge, which the government gagged debate on last week on the floor of the House because they did not want to hear how bad indexation would have been for the tourism industry.


Fortunately, the government backflipped and dumped the CPI increases that they had previously said were part of the budget. Last week we saw the dumping of the MIT withholding tax increase, and today—lo and behold—its reintroduction. As the Australian Financial Review reported today, the property and finance industries were shocked when this proposal was first put forward. Yet it is not a surprise that the Gillard Labor government is still going through with this policy. We have a government which time and time again refuses to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis on any of their bills. Yet here they are today, coming out and blasting an independent report compiled by the Allen Consulting Group.


And this report is damning. It highlights that the attempt to increase government revenue in the short term will raise $35 million but will be accompanied by a decline of $30 million in gross domestic product. This increase in federal government revenue will also be accompanied by a decrease in collections by state governments, which will further affect the financial viability of states like Queensland, still trying to overcome decades of poor and reckless financial mismanagement by state Labor governments.


Australians and international investors do not just want responsible economic management—they deserve responsible economic management. They want consistency in government and they want a government that will tell the truth, that will do what it says, and that will not expose this country to sovereign risk. The shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, persistently reminds the Gillard Labor government that so much of their legislation is exposing Australia to sovereign risk. And what is the usual response from government ministers? It is to bury their heads in the sand and pretend that nothing bad is happening. They pretend that somehow the policies they introduce into this House will not act as a disincentive for foreign investment, despite it being the express intention of the Treasurer to come up with short-term bandaid fixes to cover up his gross economic mismanagement.


This toxic government can hide all they want from the concerns of Australians and Australian families, and pretend that they are not doing the best they can to wreck the long-term viability of the Australian economy, but the truth about the Treasurer's smoke and mirrors surplus will be revealed later this year in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Behind closed doors, the government provided a so-called protected briefing for senior public servants which reportedly forecast 'turbulence and disruption' in the Australian economy as a result of volatility in Europe and the United States. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Treasurer have the gall to come into this House with their never-ending accusations of negativity from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer—as if we are the ones who are introducing poorly designed legislation, as the Gillard government does so often.


Is it mindless negativity from Mr Ivan Glasenberg, Chief Executive Officer of one of the largest commodity trading companies in the world, who said, 'We are getting greater business certainty out of Congo than we are getting out of Australia'? Is it mindless negativity when Mr Marius Kloppers, CEO of BHP Billiton, says, 'Australia is risking foreign direct investment'? Is it mindless negativity when Steve McCann, Group CEO and Managing Director of Lend Lease, says, 'Foreign capital is very important in funding large nation building projects; the country's largest real estate and infrastructure projects can't be funded, even by the biggest Australian superannuation funds; it will be the competitiveness of our industry that will suffer'?


And was it mindless negativity when Mr David Denison of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board said on 15 May this year:


Australia’s budget … doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country. 


It cannot be expressed in plainer language than that. He said that increasing the risk of investing in Australia calls into question the predictability and stability of cash flows, and if the risk of investing in Australia becomes too high then their response would be very quick and rational—they would simply stop investing in Australia.


The coalition, as the opposition, must hold this Labor-Greens coalition government to account, because we know that members on the other side of the House do not know what they are doing and do not fully consider the planned and unplanned consequences of their policies. Their answer to political instability and to a minority government is not to reassess their policies or to recognise and acknowledge when they do not have the details correct. They do not change policy; they simply change leader and swap around their ministerial titles. We recently observed the two-year anniversary of when Prime Minister Gillard and the faceless men of the ALP betrayed the trust and the will of the Australian people.


What did the sacking of Prime Minister Rudd achieve? Nothing. We will soon have, from 1 July, the world's only economy-wide carbon tax that is hundreds of per cent higher than the average carbon trading price, a tax that will do nothing for the global environment. We will soon have the economically destructive minerals resource rent tax. We will soon witness a 17 per cent increase in the passenger movement charge, which directly threatens Australia's $73.3 billion tourism industry. These taxes, increased by the Labor government, have been enforced without any rational explanation. This year's budget was clearly just another ploy in the Gillard government's desperate attempt to try to achieve a paper-thin surplus—no matter the consequences for local industry.


This is a government that give on the one hand and take on the other. They introduce a tax on carbon dioxide, increasing the cost of living for all Australians, and pretend that out of the kindness of their self-righteous hearts they are giving cash to you to ease cost-of-living pressures. They claim on the one hand that they are supporters of the industry, but on the other hand they turn around and make it as difficult as they can for industry to survive and prosper.


The Leader of the Opposition noted in his budget reply on 10 May that there is nothing wrong with this country that a change of government cannot fix. Today my message to Australian industry is: only the coalition has the economic credentials to help business survive and prosper. The coalition is committed to lower taxes, to helping attract investment in critical infrastructure—

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (18:18):  I rise to speak on both the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill and the Income Tax Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill. This is the second time the government has introduced this bill into the parliament, following its stunning backflip on this issue last week. What an extraordinary moment.


Last week this exact provision the government excised from the bill, only to reintroduce exactly the same provision the following day—with no explanation. Unless the member for New England or the member for Lyne or the member for Kennedy or anyone else has an explanation, there is no explanation from the government as to why it dumped it last week and is reintroducing it this week. Last week the government moved an amendment to its own bill to excise the doubling of the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent from 1 July this year. That move followed reports that the government was unable to gain the support of the Greens—and that only came about because the Minister for Finance, Senator Wong, in the Senate accidentally let slip that when they could not get the support of the Greens on this proposal they decided to excise it from the TLAB bill.


So now the government is reintroducing the measure. This is the third budget measure the government has now shown signs of backing down on. Why else would the government excise it from the TLAB last week? The first budget backdown was the government's decision to re-embrace the dumped company tax cut from budget night, which the Prime Minister now says is a priority—but does not have the money for. Secondly, the government backed away from the ongoing CPI increases to the passenger movement charge. Thirdly, just last week, the government backed away from its doubling of the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent from 1 July 2012. That said, the coalition welcomed the backdown on the increase to the withholding tax on managed investment trusts. We thought it was something more significant. The Tourism and Transport Forum said the decision not to proceed with doubling the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts 'will go some way to restoring foreign investor confidence'. Unfortunately, this backdown was not before the government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the MIT withholding tax. This again reduced our predictability in the eyes of international investors. The Tourism and Transport Forum went on to say:


While some damage has been done to Australia’s reputation as an investment destination, the decision not to proceed with doubling the withholding tax rate will help to restore investor confidence and renew interest in Australian tourism projects.


So the tourism taskforce is in exactly the same position as we are. You can imagine where international investors are at. We do not know what the government are planning.


The government originally announced that they were reducing the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 30 per cent down to 7½ per cent, so they had a one-way trend. Then they announced on budget night that they were going to increase it from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent, which came as a shock to people, because investors had worked on the basis that there was a trend towards a lower level of tax. But then the flipside came last week, when the government simply removed it from one of their own bills, suggesting that they were now dumping the proposal in the face of our opposition and the opposition of a vast array of investors, only to reintroduce it again last Thursday and to rush through debate today. It is like groundhog day; this proposal has come back.


Well, the opposition is going to be entirely consistent. We will oppose this measure on the grounds that it unquestionably heightens sovereign risk perceptions of Australia and the change will have an adverse impact on infrastructure investment. The only thing consistent about this government is its inconsistency. It is the constant backflips, the twists and the turns that are creating the sovereign risk. In these pretty tough global economic conditions the government should be doing all it can to be stable and predictable. Unfortunately there are numerous examples where businesses are concerned about the sovereign risk that has developed towards Australia as a result of this government.


Ivan Glasenberg is the Chief Executive Officer of Glencore, which is currently in the middle of one of the biggest takeover-mergers in global history, with its attempt to take over Xstrata, which has a massive amount of investment here in Australia. Ivan Glasenberg said in London a few weeks ago:


At least in the Congo they need you, they want you there and if they start changing the rules on you, you may not continue investing.


…   …   …


So Australia does have its risk, yes. We saw the carbon tax, we saw the mineral resource tax. It is a First World country but is doing things that are making people cautious of investing, so Australia is becoming another country where you have got to make sure that the rules aren't going to change on you.


Ivan Glasenberg is saying that not as an outsider looking in, even though he lives overseas. He is also saying it as an Australian citizen.


At the dispatch box earlier today the Prime Minister was saying that it is the negativity of the opposition that is causing consternation. No, it is the incompetence of the Prime Minister, the incompetence of this government, that is causing consternation out there. We did not write Ivan Glasenberg's speech. We did not write the words of David Knox, Chief Executive Officer of Santos, when he said:


Governments must recognise what we all know … that investment in oil and gas is not a short-term game, but one based on a long-term outlook with returns over the long-term.


With such massive capital investment and therefore risk up-front, long-term investors like those in the oil and gas industry need stable, predictable, long-term rules.


My clear message to the Australian Government is: do not create uncertainty.


Instead provide our investors with the confidence in Australia as a stable fiscal and regulatory region—allow us to stay competitive.


'Allow us to stay competitive'—that is what they are saying.


Jack Nasser, Chairman of BHP and former global chief executive of Ford, who is on a number of global boards, including News Corporation, said:


I cannot overstate how the level of uncertainty about Australia's tax system is generating negative investor reaction. People don't know where it's going.


Here Jack Nasser is talking about the uncertainty coming out of Australia. These are people that have a propriety interest in the welfare of Australia, and they are saying, 'Hang on, why is Australia so unstable? Why are you making it harder for us to get global investment, to create jobs in Australia? Why are you doing this?'


John Stanhope, former Chief Financial Officer at Telstra and Director of AGL Energy, said:


… people looking outside at Australia think we're a sovereign risk because of the uncertainty created by policy fluctuation.


The difference is in the two parties, and that is very real. It struck me to hear from people who normally give Telstra a lot of money, 'No, we are not interested anymore.' To get rid of that uncertainty is very important.


In 2008, as I said earlier, this government moved to reduce the rate of withholding tax on managed investment trusts progressively from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, a move which was not opposed by the coalition. But we did ask the question about whether the government was really committed to it. At the time, we expressed concerns that the reduction in the withholding tax rate was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers due to the operation of double taxation agreements. Any reduction in taxation paid in Australia may simply have led to higher taxes being paid in other jurisdictions.


We expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny, as the government did not allow the bill to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics at the time. We raised serious concerns that the government's costings for the measure may have been underestimated. Today the government may try to use the previous arguments of the coalition against us in the current debate, but in the context of the current economic climate, including potential significant reductions in foreign investment and employment in the construction sector, the coalition does not view this as an appropriate time for the government to be doubling withholding tax on potential sources of investment that will help to drive economic growth and job creation. Continual change to our international taxation arrangements, coupled with the government's retrospective tax grabs on a variety of legislation, reduces international investor confidence and elevates concerns about our sovereign risk profile.


This instability in the government is creating greater uncertainty for investors and it is leaving Australian consumers, as well as Australian businesses, confused. There is a myriad of examples where the government says one thing and does another. As an example, I note an issue on which I have been criticised, the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The government has said it is absolutely committed to the NDIS—so committed, in fact, that it is going to bring forward, and accelerate, the implementation of the NDIS. The government is going to speed it up and, instead of committing $3.9 billion over the first three years, it is in fact only committing $1 billion. When I said it was a cruel hoax for the government to be claiming to speed up implementation of the NDIS when it was in fact massively underfunding it, people said: 'How dare you!' for saying that. 'How dare you suggest the government is not committed to it! How dare you suggest there is not bipartisan support!'


There is bipartisan support on the NDIS. However, buried in the last paragraph on page 3 of the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer's economic note that was published on Sunday, after three of the four headings, the government seemed to be boasting about its achievements in this regard. The Treasurer said:


That's been the focus of Labor since day one, it's been the focus of Julia Gillard since she became prime minister two years ago, and it's remained our focus as we've gone about getting the big reforms in place—


They love talking about big reforms. Everything is big, huge, monstrous—everything is enormous.


that will set us up for the future, like the pricing of carbon pollution, like introducing the Minerals Resource Rent Tax, like giving consumers a better deal in the banking system, and like beginning the long road towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme.


'The long road towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme.' I could have sworn it was a shortened road, because the government said that it was going to fast track the NDIS. The government was going to bring it forward. But what had become a fast track to bring forward the NDIS is now turning into 'the beginning of a long road' towards the NDIS. My goodness! Even the Prime Minister sought to list the NDIS as an achievement, and now, buried deep in the Treasurer's own economic note—which goes out on a Sunday—it is a long road to deliver that NDIS.


I wonder if the government is going to be here long enough to travel that long road. Perhaps it is like the original version of The Wizard of Oz, which I have just been reading to my children. I can tell you that the original version is a rather lengthy book—Dorothy seems to cross a lot of roads to get to Oz. I think the Labor Party's commitment to an NDIS is as topsy and turvy, and as wavy, and as fragile as Dorothy's trip along the yellow brick road, in its original version—which is sad, because in all of this the government is playing with people's hopes.


The Labor Party is hoping that people will ignore the travails of an incompetent government, but they cannot. Whether it be on social or health policy issues—like the NDIS; like the great big health reforms that the government said it was going to deliver as former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd sought to take over the hospitals and to form a joint partnership that is now mired in red tape; or like the national curriculum that the government has sought to claim as an achievement and that three years later still has not been rolled out—or on economic policy issues, like the bills before the House at this moment, this is a government that is inconsistent. It is a government that is fundamentally flawed in its ability to run an economy and to run a society. 


It is a government that does not know whether it is Arthur or Martha, whether it is Wayne or Wendy, or whether it is Julia or John. But what I know, and what my colleagues know and what, I am sure, the Australian people know, is that this is a government that is not fit for office and that the Labor Party has truly lost its way. It has never recovered from the events of just over two years ago and, if you want a single contemporary illustration of the incompetence of the government, you need look no further than these bills that are before the House.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:35):  I spoke in relation to this particular legislation last week, from memory, on schedule 4. I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012.


These bills implement a budget measure. We announced a particular measure in the budget that would lift the withholding tax rate applied to distributions for managed investments, to residents of a country that Australia had a tax information exchange agreement with, from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent, and it is commencing from 1 July 2012. The information I have received is that there is a total impact on the budget of about $260 million in revenue over the forward estimates. It is a not inconsiderable amount of money in relation to this measure, and it is part of our framework for ensuring that the budget gets back to surplus. The 15 per cent rate is still competitive with rates applying in other countries and brings us into line with the US, Canada, Hong Kong and the UK. For the information of those people who may be listening, in the UK the withholding treatment of distributions from MITs in relation to nonresidents is about 20 per cent and that rate may be reduced under certain treaties. In Japan it is 20 per cent generally and seven per cent for individuals listed in REITs, lifted to 15 per cent in 2014 unless extended. In South Korea, our fourth biggest trading partner, it is 22 per cent; in the United States, 30 per cent; in Canada, 25 per cent; in Belgium, 15 per cent; and in the Netherlands, 15 per cent. So when you look at what is happening around the world it is not unreasonable for our rate to be at 15 per cent.


The coalition have had every position possible in relation to this measure. When the coalition were in power, the rate was 30 per cent. It was an election commitment of ours back in 2007 to reduce the rate to 15 per cent, and we did that as part of our proposals to ensure more investment in this country and to make Australia a financial services and investment hub. The coalition have on numerous occasions criticised us over reducing it from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. They tried to refer the measure to the Senate Economics Committee for review but it did not vote against it. In the parliamentary debate they criticised the reduction to 7½ per cent, claiming it was a broken promise because it was a greater reduction than we had said we would do in the 2007 campaign.


The interesting question is what they would do if they returned to the treasury bench. If they are fair dinkum about opposing the increase to 15 per cent, then let us see them commit themselves to reversing that position. Let us see them make any public statements about that. Let us see them come clean about the issue. To date, they have not. If they are not going to do that, how are they going to save the $260 million across the forward estimates? What particular services in education, health and the like are they going to cut? How are they going to pay for it? Once again we see the coalition generally prepared to accept expenditure that we announce, rarely in support of the budget savings measures that we pursue and often against the revenue-raising measures that we undertake to make sure the budget is back in surplus and we have a viable budgetary position as a government.


From opposite we hear the nay-sayers and doomsayers. We heard the shadow treasury spokesperson talk down the economy and talk about sovereign risk. For heaven's sake! When we have government debt at about a 10th of the average in the OECD, inflation in the band expected by the Reserve Bank, interest rates much lower than they were under the Howard coalition government and unemployment at around five per cent, to go on about sovereign risk is simply a nonsense. We are talking about budget legislation that deals with about $260 million across the forward estimates. It flies in the face of all the economic indications and includes about half a billion dollars in investments in the mining sector alone—in coal, iron ore et cetera—in states such as Western Australia and Queensland, my home state.


If this is such a terrible measure that we are undertaking, you would expect the coalition, if they have any consistency, to come into this place and say where they would save the money, and they would eventually have to come into this place with a consistent policy. When we announced at one stage that we were going to cut the tax, the then doyen of economic responsibility for those opposite, the then Treasurer, called it a 'tax cut for foreigners'. We have had all kinds of positions on this matter from those opposite. They certainly have not been consistent in any way, shape or form. Even today there is umbrage and unction from those opposite but little evidence as to what their position is, except to say—as they traditionally do in this place—a simple no. Once again, I would like to know where they stand on this particular issue. I would like them to get rid of the histrionics, hysteria and hyperbole, and the over-the-top theatrics from the shadow Treasurer, that we see so often—designed in part to hide their embarrassment that we reduced the tax from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. Last week we saw grandiose statements and claims about us withdrawing this measure, and I think there is a degree of embarrassment from those opposite now that we have reintroduced it so quickly.


This is a sensible savings measure. It is consistent with the Henry review recommendations on location-specific rents. The government made the sensible commitment to bring the budget back to surplus and we are determined to do that on time and as promised. We are committed to making sure that the economy is strong and that we govern in a consistent way that gives certainty and security for those people who want to invest in this country. That is always the case: if the government keeps changing the rules and the laws and is inconsistent, then those who are in business are always worried about what might happen.


This is particularly important legislation. Those opposite have no consistency, and they have form on this issue: every sensible savings measure they block, or they pretend that they can find savings but they never articulate them. I think what they are doing here is simply adding to that $70 billion black hole which the shadow finance minister has admitted they have and the shadow Treasurer has also said they have. So this is another $260 million that they can add to that. If they want to be consistent, then let them come into this place tonight and support savings and our revenue-raising measures. Be consistent; do not just spend.


We know on this side of politics that we have been prudent with respect to revenue to the government. There is a lower tax-to-GDP ratio now than there was at any time under the Howard coalition government. All they did was engage in middle-class welfare, tax and spend. That was the Howard coalition government. There were rivers of gold coming in, but it was squandered and not invested in infrastructure and the kinds of things that lift productivity in places like Western Australia and Queensland. 


I support this legislation. I think it is prudent. It is part of the government's overall strategy. It is consistent with the majority recommendations of the economics committee of this House. If those opposite would ditch the word 'irresponsibility' and add 'responsibility' to their economic framework and policy, they would support it as well.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-06-25,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (18:45):  I speak in praise of the shadow Treasurer when he criticises the government for changing the goalposts. I think that it is right for our overseas investors to have faith in the Australian government.  Having said that, we are never going to be able to change anything if we take that principle to its logical conclusion. We would never be able to change anything. So I take the shadow Treasurer's remarks, but I think that you cannot just apply that rule to every single potential initiative by government—otherwise, we would never be able to take an initiative. 


One of the many reasons that I am aggro to the ALP-NLP corporation that runs this place is that you have a management coup every six or seven years, it would appear. Having said that, I take the shadow Treasurer's argument. It is a valid argument and I praise him for putting it forward. But I have also got to say that you have to make some changes.


We have this extraordinary situation where Australian companies pay 30 per cent tax, but foreign corporations only pay, I think, 17 per cent tax. It is an extraordinary anomaly. You say, yes, but the agreement is that our companies in America pay only 17 per cent tax and then they have to pay the rest of it when they come back to Australia. How many companies do we own in America? How many do they own in Australia? This is a very lopsided deal, a very, very lopsided arrangement. It needs to be clawed back, and part of the clawing back is happening here today. From an overseas investor's point of view, this place is dreamland—and not dreamland in so far as being the land of dreams—it is paradise. You only have to pay 17 per cent interest. You have high interest rates and you can absolutely guarantee that the dollar is going to continue to ascend. You know that the ALP-NLP corporation that runs the country is very, very committed to the idea that overseas financiers should be given a rails run. Just look at your country. The supine attitude of the last government and the current government has resulted in many of our resources being foreign owned.


Fifteen years ago all of Australia's great mining companies were Australian owned—BHP, Western Mining Corporation, Normandy and Mount Isa Mines were all Australian owned. Eighty-five per cent of our mineral resources were under those great mining companies and all were Australian owned. Now they are all foreign owned. 


The second biggest agricultural industry in this country is dairying and every single factory in Australia was Australian owned prior to deregulation in the year 2000. Now all the giant corporations in the dairy industry except Murray-Goulburn are foreign owned. All of our sugar mills with the exception of Mackay Sugar are foreign owned. Our airlines were all totally Australian owned and, thanks to the machinations of the head of Qantas and the board of Qantas, clearly, Qantas is going to be divided up into five companies and four those companies will be foreign owned. Is there anything that Australia still owns? Is there any significant company in this country that is still Australian owned? If there is, do not tell me about, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Symon, because, if the overseas corporations find out, it will not be Australian owned for very long—that is for certain.


In this place we hear a lot about Moody's and Standard & Poor's. They do not run this country and their track record is absolutely appalling. I would urge Treasury officials, if they are sitting in the House here, to go and get out the three books on Enron. Standard & Poor's and Moody's and all the rest of them told us that Enron was a great, stable and wonderful company, just two months before Enron fell over, owing their shareholders and their creditors $64,000 million. They only made a little mistake—$64,000 million in one corporation. 


It is an infinitely more complicated situation with governments. I am very worried about a tendency that governments have when they skite about not spending money. I belong to the biggest borrowing government in Australia's history. We did not borrow, as the current LNP government in Queensland is doing, to build pleasure domes in George Street—the parliamentary precinct—as the current newly appointed LNP government is doing in Queensland. We did not do that. We spent the money on building a railway line out to the middle of nowhere where there is a whole stack of coal reserves because a bloke called Les Thiess reckoned he could sell the coal to Japan. We did our homework and we reckoned he could, so we borrowed a king's ransom in money and spent it building that coal line. We had no guarantee of anyone using that line. They might have signed some agreements but they were only as good as the company. If the company fell over, we would have, so we took huge risks and we built this giant port at Gladstone, one of the six biggest ports in the world in that it could take 200,000-tonne vessels. There were only six ports in the world that could take 200,000-tonne vessels.


Not stopping there, we built one of the four biggest power stations in the world so we could have the cheapest electricity in the world. We gave those Utah coalminers a rail run, and we had a small clause which gave us the overburden coal. We drove this giant economies of scale power station on free coal because of the cunning deal we had done. We built a power station that we did not need. There were no users there for that power station. It was a huge risk that the great Ron Camm, who was more of a mentor than even my father, took in building that power station. He said, 'If we have the cheap electricity, the aluminium industry will come.' It was a huge risk. If they had gone bad with coal or aluminium they would have been annihilated as a government. Heaven only knows, they were ripped into continuously, all the time. They borrowed, spent all this money and put the state into hock. Yes, but the money was not spent on buying votes. Most of the expenditures in this place really amount to buying votes. You can say that the spending makes life more easy and more attractive for people. Well, we were hard people—13 of our cabinet had cut cane by hand as young men. We were not used to all the leisures and pleasures of life. We were used to making sacrifices, saving our money and investing it in the future in productivity.


We now spend $23,000 million every year, and three of the people on the boards of the superannuation companies that spend that money have been in to see me. They say, 'All we are doing is pumping up the balloon.' I say to Treasury, to ASIC and to all these other people who are supposed to be the prudential controllers, 'Don't you see that you are blowing up a balloon?' All of that $23,000 million is being spent on realty and on the share market and it is just blowing it up. There is nothing behind it at all, except the $23,000 million that is going to be invested next year. There is nothing actually being produced at all, and in the meantime we say, 'Oh, we have to get money from overseas to open up our coalmines and our iron mines.'


There was a 60-40 rule with superannuation in the days when I sold superannuation. I made a lot of money out of it, too. God bless all the people that I worked for, my clients. Sixty per cent of that money went into government securities, so what happened in 1998 and again with the GFC and things like the collapse of Storm Financial could not have happened under us. Sixty per cent of that money was government guaranteed. Let me give you just one example. You introduce ethanol, and then you know you have a market in Australia for ethanol. So you can go and put the money up to build a big dam to put in giant new sugar mill. It is going to produce ethanol and you know you have a market for it, and you have a guaranteed price because it is backed up by petrol prices throughout the world. It is a dwindling resource and will constantly increase in price. You know you have a beautiful lay-down misere investment here. Say the investment is in the dam and the delivery canal. Maybe we do not grow ethanol; we grow something else. But the government is in the position to be able to guarantee that sort of investment within reason.


I sit beneath a picture of the great Jack McEwen. He had many great sayings, but the one I liked best was that government is about getting it right and education is no replacement for hard work in getting it right. Sir Leo Hielscher put in time and effort and energy, and all those bridges across the Brisbane River are named after him. He was a very great man. He took risks as the Secretary of Treasury in Queensland with his advice to the government. There were the risks that men like Bjelke-Petersen and Ron Camm took. We are yielding the benefit of those to this very day. For the last 30 years the economy of this nation has been carried by the coal industry and the aluminium industry and they were both put there by huge risks being taken in investment. Sir Leo Hielscher was offered the Reserve Bank three times and offered the World Bank position once. He said: 'We did not really take a risk. We always knew that the aluminium would come. We always knew that we would be able to sell coal to Japan.' He could say that afterwards, but at the time I am sure he was sweating a little.


We have this huge resource of the $23,000 million. Why are we giving a free kick to every foreign corporation? I am very pleased to see the Treasurer moving today to take some of that money back. Mistakes have been made in the past. One of the ways of rectifying that is to get some of that money back through measures like the one he is moving tonight. I will be backing it even though I think we should all listen to what the shadow Treasurer said this evening as well.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (18:59):  In speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 it is, as the shadow Treasurer said, a bit like groundhog day. The substance of these bills was included in separate tax law amendment bills last week. Those changes, which see a doubling of the relevant withholding tax from 7½ to 15 per cent, were announced suddenly on budget night. As the shadow Treasurer quite rightly pointed out, in so many respects this tax legislation before the House—yet again, as it turns out—sums up so much about the incompetence of this government, and not just on taxation policy. It really encapsulates and symbolises the government's failure to govern, and how its incompetence, at so many levels, creates a lack of confidence in the investment community. It leverages sovereign risk, as the shadow Treasurer so rightly said, and these tax bills really sum it up, on the second anniversary of the government's sudden change of Prime Minister.


It is worth recounting some of the history on this as a window into the damage the government's approach on taxation matters is doing, specifically with regard to these bills. As I pointed out last week, four years ago in June 2008 the government legislated with great fanfare that it was reducing the relevant tax rate in this legislation down to 7½ per cent. That had been announced in Labor's first budget, and following the then Assistant Treasurer, the member for Prospect, speaker after speaker on the other side lauded the reduction to 7½ per cent and pointed out that the reduction was designed to send a signal to international investors.


Of course, it follows that the sudden decision to double to 15 per cent the relevant rate also sends a signal. It sends a signal that this government cannot be trusted on matters of tax. This is the government that four years ago made so much of reducing the rate to 7½ per cent and then suddenly, in the budget, doubled that rate. The signal it sends is that this a government that cannot be trusted. This is a government that will chop and change. This is a government, as we have seen, that will say before an election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government it leads,' to paraphrase, and after the election introduces one. This is a government that out of the blue produces a mining tax.


The message overseas, with the Labor government in Australia pricing our investment, is that investors must now take into account that taxes will increase suddenly. In luring investment here by sending that signal, which those opposite spoke so proudly about four years ago, it will have a retrospective effect. But on top of that it also has the effect of saying there is a sovereign risk of sudden changes. We do not need to take my word or the word of the shadow Treasurer on this matter. As I outlined in the debate last week, there are so many leaders in their fields representing international investors who made this very point just after the budget. We have had those statements quoted in this House about how very directly indeed the government's decision meant that investors would think twice in the future about the sorts of investments they made.


Just last Friday respected commentator Jennifer Hewett, from the Australian Financial Review, made this very point. Jennifer Hewett summed up so many of the quotes that had been put into the debate through the course of last week when she wrote:


Labor has developed an unenviable reputation for its willingness to change tax rates and structures for investments.


This completely undercuts faith in the permanence of reforms that do occur …


My friend and colleague the member for Wright, who will speak after me, knows that of all the quotes that members of this side, including myself, put forward, those statements by Jennifer Hewett in the Australian Financial Review last Friday sum up the words and the sentiment of the reaction. What it says is if you send a signal by reducing the rate to 7½ per cent you surely send an opposite signal by doubling it. You surely send a signal that when it comes to investment in Australia sudden tax changes are the order of the day. The shadow Treasurer rightly referred to the events of last week and I want to refer to them, too, because the way the government has gone about the doubling of this tax also leverages uncertainty. Suddenly, in the budget, as I said earlier in my contribution, the government doubled the rate to 15 per cent. Then we had the tax law amendment bill last week that included in, from memory, schedule 4 the very measure we are debating now. But without any announcement whatsoever the government tabled an amendment to simply delete that schedule. As the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out, the initial reaction from industry was: 'They must have backed down. They must have seen sense.' That was the reaction from industry and some of the people the shadow Treasurer quoted. But, of course, the real point is that there was not any word from the government. There was no announcement from the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer—not only was there no announcement; there was no explanation at all.


The debate in Hansard of, I think, last Wednesday sums up the chaos that afflicts this government when it comes to taxation policy. You had an amendment before the House during the debate—let me give them a little wiggle room; maybe it was a minute or two before the debate began—but no announcement, just an amendment to delete the schedule that would give effect to what had been announced on budget night. When it came to the summing up and the consideration in detail of the bill, in concluding his five-minute speech the shadow Treasurer asked the Assistant Treasurer on three separate occasions, three times in a row, what the position was. It was greeted by silence. The Assistant Treasurer was absolutely mute. Here was a minister of the Crown in here handling legislation where an amendment to strip out a fundamental budget announcement is moved and not only is there no public announcement; there is no parliamentary justification—not a word.


Those actions of the Assistant Treasurer will stand as a symbol of this government's arrogance and incompetence. I am not quite sure what the balance was, but it was only after the third occasion—I think when the shadow minister for finance spoke during consideration in detail—that, finally, the Assistant Treasurer would say that there would be a separate piece of legislation. It was barely audible in this House. And so it was on the very next day, the last sitting day of last week, that this legislation we are debating today was introduced.


This reeks of chaos in the decision making in the government. They cut a tax to 7½ per cent; they double it to 15 per cent in the budget, with all the signals that sends. They decide they are going to strip it out of a TLA bill and put it as a stand-alone measure and they cannot even communicate it. I was thinking perhaps the Assistant Treasurer really did not know what was happening or why, but in parliamentary debate—and I have witnessed quite a bit of it—I have never seen such a spectacle.


It might surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to hear me saying this, but I do not mind saying it. There are those opposite who follow these matters at a technical level pretty closely on the back bench. To be a backbencher and watch that spectacle must have been very frustrating because it was nothing short of a disgrace for decision making on the part of the government. It is, as the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out at the beginning of this debate, a symbol of so much that is wrong with this government.


When this debate is over, every member on that side who was elected or re-elected in 2007 will be able to say that they voted to decrease the tax and they voted to increase the tax. That is what they will be able to do. The actions of the Assistant Treasurer last week do sum up the government's failure on tax. It is no wonder that the incompetence and the chopping and changing that is on display directly leverage the sort of uncertainty and sovereign risk that have been spoken about in this debate.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (19:14):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. This bill epitomises the performance of this government in this parliament. This bill has had more starts than Black Caviar. It is like going to the tennis. I watched the women's tennis semi-final at Rafter Stadium last year. Watching this bill come in, go out, come in, go out, come in, go out is nothing short of a tennis match. I know deep in my heart that members opposite, members of this government, are embarrassed about the way this bill has been managed through this House—they must be, because there are a lot of things to be embarrassed about. Not only are we embarrassed by the way the government has conducted the transition of this bill through the House; when we speak in this House it is not just a local audience but a national and global audience. When a bill comes before the House that speaks to managed investment trusts and the imposition of tax on companies choosing to invest in this nation, it is a matter of national importance and a matter of sovereign risk.


The Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 amends the managed investment trust final withholding tax from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent on payments made in relation to income years commencing after 1 July 2012. There is one thing we can be thankful for: there is not an element of retrospectivity associated with this bill, as there are for many other pieces of legislation that come before this house. We can at least be thankful for that.


Schedule 1 to the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 makes consequential amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to give effect to the increase in the consequential MIT final withholding tax rate imposed by the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. According to the budget, it is expected to generate approximately $260 million in revenue over the forward estimates. I suspect that the only reason we are having this debate is because of the $260 million this bill is forecasted to bring in.


During this debate I will bring evidence from the financial sector of this nation that says this government is prepared to blow-off $1 billion in lost revenue—flighted international revenue that would have come to this nation—to pick up $260 million. How does that work? The government are starting to make financial decisions because their political survival is so thinly strung that we have a forecasted $1.5 billion surplus. Their political decisions are built around that figure. This $260 million helps in generating that revenue, but in order to do it they are prepared to sacrifice $1 billion worth of revenue—and I will tell you who said that.


The MIT final withholding tax rate of 15 per cent will apply to fund payments made in relation to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2012. That seems like a special memorial date for this government. As we all know, the world's largest carbon tax kicks off on that date. We have the start of the investment withdrawal in Australia and yet another tax that will have a snowballing effect on investment and increase our exposure to sovereign risk. We have a two-tiered economy at the moment: we have the resources sector, which is considerably strong, and we have another sector of the community, including the electorate of Wright, which has no linkages into the resources sector. Economics 101 tells us that when you are trying to stimulate an economy there are two things that you do: decrease tax and increase government spending. We have got the increased government spending; we can go through the myriad wasteful spending activities that this government has participated in. We were supposed to see a reduction in a tax rate, and I believe that was the reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. That is like going to the tennis semifinals as well: it is in and out and in again and out again depending on where the polls are at the moment.


We recently had the Prime Minister up in Queensland telling business leaders they should be out there talking up the economy and saying how well things are going. When you walk up and down the streets of Beaudesert, when you walk up and down the streets of Gatton, which is predominantly a farming and rural precinct, or when you get up into the tourism sector of Mount Tamborine in my electorate, these people are doing it extremely tough. I forecast tonight that we are going to see double-digit figures of businesses exiting the market. If you want to get into a booming business at the moment, go and get yourself some shares in some receivables businesses or some administrators because they will be going gangbusters as result of some of this government's policies.


In 2008, when Labor previously reduced the withholding tax progressively from 30 per cent to 7.5 per cent the coalition did not oppose the relevant bill. We did not oppose it because it was done in an orderly fashion. We sent messages to the market in an orderly fashion and said that it would be staged down. We have this wake-up-and-get-out-of-bed type haphazard approach of saying: 'Today we might just double the withholding tax rate; that is a good idea, because we have run out of ideas.' As a government, they have run out of ideas. However, at the time, we did express concern that it was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers because of the operational double taxation agreements, and any reduction in taxation paid in Australia may simply have led to higher taxes being paid to other jurisdictions.


At the time, the coalition also expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny as Labor had not allowed the bill to be considered by the Senate Economics Committee, that Labor's costings of the measures would be dubious and that Labor had delivered a tax cut to foreigners in the 2008 budget but had not delivered a tax cut to Australian citizens and taxpayers. When will this Labor government realise that continual changes to our international taxation arrangements, coupled with Labor's recent retrospective tax grabs, reduce international investor confidence and elevate concerns about Australia's sovereign risk profile?


I sit on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, and it was interesting to hear from industry and the private sector about their concerns with the proposed legislative changes. Treasury indicated it expected little negative influence on investment flows from the increase. This position was vigorously rejected by industry, and I will quote from the Hansard transcript of the inquiry.


But before I do that, how often do we see that happen, where we have Treasury come out with a position or a forecast and industry vigorously rejecting or opposing it? We do not have to look too much further than last year's forecast of what this deficit was going to be. Back before the last budget I think we had a forecast for this budget in the vicinity of $10 billion. Six months later and we are looking at a figure of $22.7 billion! This is from the same department—virtually double within a six-month period. And when the recent MYEFO documents came out it bounced out to $37 billion. This is Treasury, contrasting, again, with industry, which goes to the credibility of all forecasting. Of course, who knows what the budget deficit is going to end up at? I think it is going to be in the vicinity of $44 billion, but with this government cooking the books and trying to bring expenditure back from next year into this, who knows? 


I opened my comments by saying that this bill was similar to Makybe Diva. I wouldn't be putting a punt on whichever figure—




Mr Snowdon:
  You've changed horses!




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I have changed horses. Before I digressed, I was looking at conflicting views between Treasury and the industry. This is an exchange between Anthony McDonald of Treasury and Peter Verwer, Chief Executive, Property Council of Australia:


Mr McDonald: I am not aware; there probably would be. But in this instance, to the extent that we would have allowed for any reduction in this sector as a result of the budget measure, it would be fairly minimal. 


Fairly minimal? For a $260 million pick-up in tax revenue? I ask you: how do you quantify what is 'fairly minimal'? He went on to say:


That I know might sound strange to those directly involved in the sector because we are looking at the net impact across the economy rather than just the impact in the sector. 


So, don't look at it across the sector; look at it across the whole GDP. It is similar to what the government does with reference to rationalising its debt ratio and saying, 'It's only seven per cent or only 10 per cent of GDP.' If you take this as a rational comparison against not a number that should have been used as a common denominator but the whole economy, of course it is only minimal. This is the logic that they are using to try to rationalise the irrational. He went on to say:


Again, if we are looking at financial flows there would be a greater reduction in the flows that occur through managed investment trusts but what we are interested in is what happens to the aggregate base and that is a different thing.


Mr Verwer: The question was: where would that extra money come from in order to ensure that the aggregate basis remained in alignment? We are still waiting for the answer.


Mr McDonald: That is part of what being a small, open economy that is engaged in international capital markets with a freely floating exchange rate does.


There were some other comments from Mr Verwer:


In fact, these foreign investors have said to us quite clearly that some of them had already pulled out because we no longer meet their hurdle rate—it did not take long to do the sums; others said that they have frozen the negotiations. 


To support those comments I draw your attention to the Hansard of the Economics Committee and questioning of Mr Martin Codina from the Financial Services Council. The member for Throsby asked him:


Is there any evidence for that flight of capital occurring?


That is, as a result of this legislation. This is where the $1 billion comes in. Mr Codina said:


There is absolute evidence of that. Collectively we have quantified in excess of $1 billion, some of which has been made public and some of which is highly sensitive, because of the nature of the foreign investors. In some cases you have sovereign funds—in other words, it would be akin to a foreign government being critical of the Australian government as a consequence of the change.


Why am I only hearing about this in Economics Committee hearings where the Financial Services Council of Australia is giving evidence? Why weren't these opinions sought in the consultation process? Why weren't these people consulted? When you talk to Treasury they always open up with, 'We've consulted with the industry; we've consulted with everyone; we've consulted this to death.' Mr Codina later went on to say:


Let me put it this way. We were disappointed that we were not consulted prior to the announcement being made on budget night. Since this government came into office in 2007, we have issued something like 10 media releases which were supportive of subsequent changes that have been made, either to our tax system or regulatory-wise, that essentially had their origins in the Johnson review. We were one of the leading participants in the Johnson review, involved in much of the work that was conducted there. So I guess all I can say is it did come as a surprise, as an organisation that is actively involved in assisting the government in this area, that the announcement was made without any prior consultation.


Why would a government not consult with major stakeholders on such a sensitive bill that has the capacity to generate $1 billion of flight in capital from this nation? I will tell you why. To save the budget bottom line—I can think of no other reason—of a measly $260 million.


The government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the MIT withholding tax has yet again reduced our predictability in the eyes of international investors. If passed, this bill would undermine Australia's objective of becoming a regional financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region. Attracting more foreign investment is important to achieve stronger economic growth which would lead to increased government revenue without the need for many new or increased taxes. Industry was barely consulted; the Australian people are rarely consulted; and the coalition remains opposed to this bill. (Time expired)

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-06-25,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (19:29):  I rise on behalf of the Australian Greens to raise a specific concern with this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012—that is, the potential impacts of the bill on investment in low-carbon and renewable energy projects. It does not appear from the terms of the bill that it would have a particular impact on this area, but there have been some significant representations made by many in the sector that the current arrangements have been attractive to those overseas funds that are particularly interested in investing in areas where there might be higher ethical and sustainability standards than one might find in an ordinary investment. 


The Australian Greens have received a letter from the Green Building Council of Australia, and I would like, if I might, to relate a couple of the points it makes. The chief executive, Ms Romilly Madew, and the executive director of advocacy, Mr Robin Mellon, make the point that:


The current withholding tax rate of 7.5 per cent has supported Australia's economic growth by encouraging investments in commercial property construction and critical infrastructure including low-carbon and renewable energy projects. The Property Council of Australia has identified that a priority of foreign investors, attracted by the lower withholding tax rate, has been high-grade buildings with strong green credentials. 


They give some examples and then go on to say:


The Green Building Council of Australia supports any initiatives, programs or campaigns that encourage Australia's green building and sustainable community industry. The PCA research indicates that the increase in the WHT rate is likely to harm investment into Australia's green building future. The GBCA urges the government to reconsider this action and examine the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the direct and indirect impacts on stakeholders, more closely.


We have been involved in some discussions over recent weeks, and these concerns remain unallayed for us. The Greens still have concerns that this bill might have a disproportionate impact on low-carbon and renewable energy projects. Senator Christine Milne, who is responsible for speaking on behalf of the Greens on Treasury matters, is taking carriage of this matter will not stand in the way of the bill passing through the House, but we are not yet in a position to give support for the passage of this bill in the Senate. Our concerns remain very real and have not yet been resolved. We understand that the government has set a self-imposed time line for getting this legislation through. On behalf of the Greens I can say that that may be the government's view but our concerns are yet to be resolved. On that basis, we will not stand in the way of its passage through the House, but that is without prejudice to the position we might take in the Senate. We feel that we have very clearly put on notice the concerns we want to see addressed.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (19:33):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. 


Since 2 May, the government has had more positions on the MIT withholding tax rate, and attracting investment, than I can count on one hand. The history is simply this: on 2 May, Minister Ferguson launched the Australian 'open for investment' campaign, designed to attract offshore investment in the 80 shovel-ready projects in Australia. Less than a week later, on 8 May, the budget was handed down, announcing the MIT would go from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent—effectively undermining the Australia 'open for investment' campaign. 


On the evening of 9 May, 2012, Minister Ferguson told the National Tourism Alliance at an industry gathering that he appreciated there were people in the room who were unhappy but that his job was to defend the government, so he would defend the government. On 20 May, Minister Ferguson failed to appear in the House to defend the MIT withholding tax increase that he said he would defend at the NTA. 


On 20 June, the government amended its own bill to take out the doubling of the MIT withholding tax rate. On 21 June, the very next day, the government reintroduced its own MIT withholding tax bill in exactly the same form to again raise the tax from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent—proving the often-made point that Labor cannot stick to a policy from lunchtime to Lateline. I note on the speakers list that Minister Ferguson is not going to come into this House and defend his government's decision to lift the MIT withholding tax rate which is effectively knocking over his campaign program for those 80 shovel-ready projects.


It is no wonder there is a crisis in confidence in the tourism industry. It appears that the government does not understand that international capital is very fluid and will flow wherever the best opportunity and returns are. I have to wonder what the Independents' price was when they sold out to approve this measure. I have just heard a member of the Greens say they are going to pass this bill in the House but reserve their opinion in the Senate. The place to block this bill is here and now, because it would not be back on the agenda without their support. If the Independents and the Greens support this legislation they will have gone from hero to zero in the tourism industry's opinion in a matter of days.


This measure will combine with nine other measures in the budget that will undermine the government's 2020 Tourism Industry Potential strategy, which was publicly released in November 2010. That strategy—or flyer, as some in the industry call it, given its lack of detail—has outlined an ambitious set of goals to promote the long-term, sustainable growth of the Australian tourism industry. According to Tourism Australia, realising this potential would mean 'doubling overnight expenditure for Australia’s tourism industry, from $70 billion to as much as $140 billion by 2020.' It would increase tourism's contribution to the GDP to up to three per cent in 2020 and increase tax revenue from tourism from $9.3 billion in 2009 to as high as $14.5 billion in 2020. The carbon tax alone makes this goal relatively unachievable. Taxing new hotel developments makes those goals even more impossible. In conceding the tourism industry's victory against Labor's departure-tax cash-grab, the government might have opted to repair some of the bridges along with other tourism infrastructure. Instead, it announced a reduction to the Asia Marketing Fund from $61 million to $48.5 million—that was in a press release that was hidden quietly on the Treasurer's website—and that was a payback for forcing government to back down on a budget measure. Such a childish response only adds to the chorus of calls for a grown-up government to get Australia back on track. The regional tourism infrastructure fund announced: firstly, has effectively reduced the Asia Marketing Fund by $12½ million; secondly, returns the industry the $11.5 million previously cut from Labor's first budget in 2008-09; and, thirdly, offers no detailed plan to deliver on either tourism demand drivers or tourism supporting infrastructure.


The tourism sector did not take lightly its huge step in launching full-blown advertising campaigns against the government in recent weeks. It did so to protect jobs and is looking forward to building what should be a normal relationship of mutual trust, full disclosure and, importantly, genuine consultation. It reflects well on tourism bodies that they did not respond to the petty slap of a reduced Asia Marketing Fund as a consequence of the government's reduced departure tax revenue. The sector might have highlighted that the government could easily have kept the Asia Marketing Fund intact since this investment was only 10 per cent of the projected revenue in the first place. 


Yet this should not be confused with the tourism industry taking the hotel investments tax lying down. This is a vital issue for the tourism industry and the government's own words reinforce the point. Eleven months ago, the now former minister for tourism, the Hon. Nick Sherry, told industry leaders:


The sad fact is that much of Australia's accommodation is outmoded and outdated and Chinese visitors in particular … are used to very modern facilities in their own country. There is a great challenge in tourism to invest in the modernisation of facilities.


In the same meeting he said that we need to see an increase in investment to realise the potential, and added that the country would need between 40,000 and 70,000 additional hotel rooms by 2020 to cope with projected demand. 


Individuals and trusts base their decisions on statements like these and like the twice-yearly releases from Australia's independent Tourism Forecasting Committee. Smart investors will always weigh potential returns with risk, and they look to the government to manage the economy according to a plan. This gives hotel investors confidence to sign on for the long-term investments in hotel developments that are typically delivered over a 10-year cycle.


In last week's debate I read into the Hansard the views of Tourism Accommodation Australia, the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, amongst others. It would benefit the House to reflect today on the prebudget submission by the Accommodation Association of Australia, delivered well in advance of the budget—in fact, it was delivered the day after Australia Day in 2012. They say in their submission:


32. While accommodation rooms within Australia are, by and large, of a high standard in comparison to other countries, continual refurbishment is required for businesses and the broader industry for it to remain globally competitive.


33. The stagnation in the number of overseas visitor arrivals in the second half of the last decade, together with the drop in domestic tourism has created a difficult trading environment for accommodation businesses, notably those in locations outside Australia’s capital cities.


34. The returns for many investors in accommodation businesses have not been adequate enough for them to make major commitments to capital expenditure on upgrading existing rooms and other parts of their businesses (restaurants, function rooms, meeting/convention space, leisure facilities).


That was the AAA prebudget submission dated 27 January 2012, so the government is aware of these issues.


Credit should be given to Minister Ferguson in delivering a prospectus of unfunded hotel investments. It is no silver bullet for tourism investment, and it is useless unless matched by other government policies that work in the same direction. I welcomed the prospectus as a 'good first step to restoring tourism infrastructure' when it was announced on 2 May 2012. Yet it only took the government six days to undermine this potentially effective measure with plans to double hotel investment tax, and today they replicate that action. This confused and incoherent approach highlights a dysfunctional government with portfolios not delivering a whole-of-government approach. Otherwise, why would you launch a policy based on a 7½ per cent tax, a week ahead of the government, in its own budget, increasing that tax to 15 per cent? It flies in the face of logic, reasoning and, in particular, investor confidence.


We were all reminded of this last week when the government withdrew its hotel investment tax and reintroduced its bill the next day in exactly the same form. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott: what sort of message does this send to potential investors? The opportunity for crossbenchers to deliver stability and certainty comes tonight with these very bills. In supporting the coalition's opposition to automatic CPI indexation of the departure tax last week, the Independents helped make Australia a more attractive tourism destination, to the tune of $125 million a year, and that is according to the government's figures. Yet fixing this demand challenge is pointless unless matched by a commitment to fix the supply-side challenges. And according to all of the tourism and accommodation sector peak bodies, the managed investment trust cash-grab is a key test for minority government to act responsibly.


Despite the government's own vacillation undermining investor confidence, the Property Council of Australia has indicated that the only hope Australia has for maintaining its reputation as a safe place to invest is for the parliament to firm its resolve and reject this bill. Independents cannot walk away from their responsibilities to regional tourism on the basis of an exaggerated regional assistance package, for this small amount of money will be spent in a meaningful way. It is vital to achieve the right mix of demand driver and supporting infrastructure allocations. Examples of demand drivers might be the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service's Three Capes Track, or the redevelopment of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Supporting infrastructure is the transport and accommodation you would use when going to see a tourist attraction, like the Spirit of Tasmania, or the Old Woolstore Apartment Hotel—something I thought the member for Bandt might be interested in. However, the money is allocated, Independents should demand accountability, planning, and an outcomes focus. As I write this, I think of the Clump Point marina and the jetty at Dunk Island—still in a state of disrepair 18 months after Cyclone Yasi, despite our Prime Minister approving money to fix this infrastructure.


I seek leave to table a photograph of the jetty at Dunk Island, still in a state of disrepair some two years after it was damaged by Cyclone Yasi.


Leave granted.




Mr BALDWIN:
  There are quite literally thousands of Australian restaurants, motels, hotels and other businesses that have not spruced up their properties since the Australian dollar approached parity with the US in 2008. With fewer customers comes less profit to reinvest in hotel upgrades to stay competitive with other markets. The crisis in both consumer and investor confidence in Australian tourism is not all because of unfortunate realities like the sluggish economic performance of our traditional markets, the high Australian dollar or natural disasters; it is also because of perfectly avoidable policies that damage tourism. The standout example, of course, is the world's largest carbon tax, which will make foreign destinations even more attractive to tourists and diminish even further returns on hotel investments.


Like potential investors, Independents must weigh the totality of government policy affecting returns on investment here compared to overseas. Doubling hotel investment tax will affect investment decisions yet so will the other nine budget measures that will damage the tourism industry. Australia should seek to grow tourism and enjoy the benefits that flow from higher employment, a diversified economy and improved ties with other nations. Overtaxing tourism will stunt this growth and is short-sighted in the extreme. For tourism there is no greater challenge facing the minority government than repairing the damage already done to investor confidence in this afternoon's debate.


So if the Independents who support the coalition and, more importantly, the industry in knocking over the CPI increases in the PMC want to remain the pin-up boys of the tourism industry then I say this to them: oppose this legislation, which will directly affect investment in your seats. It will directly destroy confidence in investment in Australia. It will destroy the concept that this is a good sovereign nation to invest in. And, importantly, think about your own electorate. Think about the employment figures in your own electorate. Think about how this investment could be placed in your electorate and you can take part in the journey.


By supporting this government, I say to them—and if indeed they do support this bill; the member for Bandt has already indicated that he will be supporting this bill in this House—at what price have you sold out your electorate? If you stood up for the tourism industry you would not be selling out the tourism industry, and those workers and those investors— (Time expired)

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (19:48):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trusts Withholding Tax) Bill 2012 and associated bill. This bill is once again before the House. As bill after bill is introduced into this House, the Australian community continues to be let down by this Gillard Labor government, which refuses to listen and refuses to consult. Just last week, the government decided to withdraw the bill before a vote. The coalition believed that finally the Gillard Labor government had woken up to reason and that the Gillard Labor government had finally listened to concerns in industry and the community. I thought at least that they had noticed the immovable outrage pouring from the financial, property and tourism industries about the measures in these bills. Yet here we are again debating bills which, if passed, will be another direct attack on the Australian economy. 


I welcomed the decision not to pass the tax increase last week—a tacit admission that the government had not thought through their policy and an admission by the Gillard Labor government that they were completely wrong to introduce this measure in the first place. Their delay is yet another concerning sign that this government continues to develop policy on the run.


This scattered and confused approach does not, as they say, inspire consumer confidence. It was reported last week by Dun and Bradstreet that three-quarters of Australians are expressing concern about their financial situation and one in three Australians say they would be unable to cover basic expenses for longer than a few weeks if faced with sudden unemployment. As a result, consumers are saving. They are not spending, which poses significant risks for industries including construction and retail. Nor does this government encourage business confidence. Their incessant incompetence and their proclivity for new and increased taxes sends a signal to the international business community that Australia is not a good place in which to invest money.


Today's increase to the managed investment trust withholding tax, is yet another attack on business confidence. The Gillard government, on a whim, has decided that it will increase the withholding rate from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent—double. This increase makes investment in Australia less viable and directly undermines the aim of maintaining our economic resilience and boosting Australia's international reputation as a financial services hub in our region. This increase directly contravenes the words of the current Assistant Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, when he said in 2008:


If we are to be internationally competitive then … we must have rates of taxation that are amongst the lowest in the world.


The Assistant Treasurer should heed his own advice, because this tax increase does make us less internationally competitive and it does makes foreign investment, using the MIT structure, less attractive. This policy translates to a disincentive for foreigners to invest in Australian infrastructure. Make no mistake: this move will damage Australia's reputation and will hurt our economy. Indeed, according to the Property Council of Australia, more than $1 billion of planned foreign investment has already been affected.


Maintaining the 7.5 per cent tax rate is important because it is of fundamental importance to attract foreign investors to invest in key Australian infrastructure. In particular, many institutional investors such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds use the MIT structure to invest because they are specifically the types of organisations which are looking much longer into the future and have the capacity to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects which may not see a return for many years. They invest in the construction of buildings like electricity generation facilities, hotels and tourism facilities, hospitals, motorways and toll roads, green buildings, and other carbon dioxide abatement programs. Sometimes these projects require decades-long commitment to keeping their investment money in Australia. It is important to note that not only are these facilities crucial to the long-term benefit of the Australian economy but those institutional and pension fund investors are exactly the type of reliable and respected investors we can trust to stay here.


It has been only 48 days since the Treasurer delivered his budget—the budget of smoke and mirrors, broken promises and direct attacks on the fiscal bottom line of all Australians. After the Gillard government's apparent decision to drop the proposed increase in the managed investment trust withholding tax last week, we now have the fourth proposed change to a budget measure. The Treasurer announced that the government would be dumping their proposed company tax cuts, yet has more recently said they are now back on the table. Their second backflip was indexation of the passenger movement charge, which the government gagged debate on last week on the floor of the House because they did not want to hear how bad indexation would have been for the tourism industry.


Fortunately, the government backflipped and dumped the CPI increases that they had previously said were part of the budget. Last week we saw the dumping of the MIT withholding tax increase, and today—lo and behold—its reintroduction. As the Australian Financial Review reported today, the property and finance industries were shocked when this proposal was first put forward. Yet it is not a surprise that the Gillard Labor government is still going through with this policy. We have a government which time and time again refuses to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis on any of their bills. Yet here they are today, coming out and blasting an independent report compiled by the Allen Consulting Group.


And this report is damning. It highlights that the attempt to increase government revenue in the short term will raise $35 million but will be accompanied by a decline of $30 million in gross domestic product. This increase in federal government revenue will also be accompanied by a decrease in collections by state governments, which will further affect the financial viability of states like Queensland, still trying to overcome decades of poor and reckless financial mismanagement by state Labor governments.


Australians and international investors do not just want responsible economic management—they deserve responsible economic management. They want consistency in government and they want a government that will tell the truth, that will do what it says, and that will not expose this country to sovereign risk. The shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, persistently reminds the Gillard Labor government that so much of their legislation is exposing Australia to sovereign risk. And what is the usual response from government ministers? It is to bury their heads in the sand and pretend that nothing bad is happening. They pretend that somehow the policies they introduce into this House will not act as a disincentive for foreign investment, despite it being the express intention of the Treasurer to come up with short-term bandaid fixes to cover up his gross economic mismanagement.


This toxic government can hide all they want from the concerns of Australians and Australian families, and pretend that they are not doing the best they can to wreck the long-term viability of the Australian economy, but the truth about the Treasurer's smoke and mirrors surplus will be revealed later this year in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Behind closed doors, the government provided a so-called protected briefing for senior public servants which reportedly forecast 'turbulence and disruption' in the Australian economy as a result of volatility in Europe and the United States. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Treasurer have the gall to come into this House with their never-ending accusations of negativity from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer—as if we are the ones who are introducing poorly designed legislation, as the Gillard government does so often.


Is it mindless negativity from Mr Ivan Glasenberg, Chief Executive Officer of one of the largest commodity trading companies in the world, who said, 'We are getting greater business certainty out of Congo than we are getting out of Australia'? Is it mindless negativity when Mr Marius Kloppers, CEO of BHP Billiton, says, 'Australia is risking foreign direct investment'? Is it mindless negativity when Steve McCann, Group CEO and Managing Director of Lend Lease, says, 'Foreign capital is very important in funding large nation building projects; the country's largest real estate and infrastructure projects can't be funded, even by the biggest Australian superannuation funds; it will be the competitiveness of our industry that will suffer'?


And was it mindless negativity when Mr David Denison of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board said on 15 May this year:


Australia’s budget … doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country. 


It cannot be expressed in plainer language than that. He said that increasing the risk of investing in Australia calls into question the predictability and stability of cash flows, and if the risk of investing in Australia becomes too high then their response would be very quick and rational—they would simply stop investing in Australia.


The coalition, as the opposition, must hold this Labor-Greens coalition government to account, because we know that members on the other side of the House do not know what they are doing and do not fully consider the planned and unplanned consequences of their policies. Their answer to political instability and to a minority government is not to reassess their policies or to recognise and acknowledge when they do not have the details correct. They do not change policy; they simply change leader and swap around their ministerial titles. We recently observed the two-year anniversary of when Prime Minister Gillard and the faceless men of the ALP betrayed the trust and the will of the Australian people.


What did the sacking of Prime Minister Rudd achieve? Nothing. We will soon have, from 1 July, the world's only economy-wide carbon tax that is hundreds of per cent higher than the average carbon trading price, a tax that will do nothing for the global environment. We will soon have the economically destructive minerals resource rent tax. We will soon witness a 17 per cent increase in the passenger movement charge, which directly threatens Australia's $73.3 billion tourism industry. These taxes, increased by the Labor government, have been enforced without any rational explanation. This year's budget was clearly just another ploy in the Gillard government's desperate attempt to try to achieve a paper-thin surplus—no matter the consequences for local industry.


This is a government that give on the one hand and take on the other. They introduce a tax on carbon dioxide, increasing the cost of living for all Australians, and pretend that out of the kindness of their self-righteous hearts they are giving cash to you to ease cost-of-living pressures. They claim on the one hand that they are supporters of the industry, but on the other hand they turn around and make it as difficult as they can for industry to survive and prosper.


The Leader of the Opposition noted in his budget reply on 10 May that there is nothing wrong with this country that a change of government cannot fix. Today my message to Australian industry is: only the coalition has the economic credentials to help business survive and prosper. The coalition is committed to lower taxes, to helping attract investment in critical infrastructure—

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (20:00):  I move:


That this House recognises the:


(1) strong history of Chinese migration to Australia over the past 200 years;


(2) significant contribution that Chinese-Australians have made over this period to our nation;


(3) vibrant festivities and events hosted by the Bennelong Chinese community and enjoyed by people of many cultures; and


(4) unique opportunity for the local Chinese, Korean and broader communities to come together at the Bennelong Cup Table Tennis Test Match for an international table tennis competition against Australia.


This year marks 40 years since the commencement of diplomatic relations between Australia and China, and 209 years since the first record of Chinese migration to the colonies that became our nation. Both of these events provided important milestones in the development of a strong and dynamic interaction between the two nations and the growth of a vibrant community of Chinese Australians that has contributed to all facets of our nation's advancement.


According to the 2011 census, 16.9 per cent of Bennelong residents list Chinese ancestry; just shy of the 17.3 per cent of people who listed their ancestry as Australian. 12.9 per cent of Bennelong residents were born in China or Hong Kong, and 17.2 per cent speak either Cantonese or Mandarin at home—more than six times the national average that now places Mandarin as the most widely spoken non-English language in Australia.


The Bennelong region has flourished from the diversification of cultures around our local community. This is most evident during cultural festivities such as Lunar New Year. Every January and February is a time of colour, dance and song as local streets and shopping centres become hubs of community and cultural celebration. Like many locals at these events, I have been taught to write my name in traditional Chinese characters, to wish people Kung Hei Fat Choy, and to give and receive traditional lollies with blessings of good luck for the year ahead.


Of course, the history of Chinese migration to Australia is not limited to the past 40 years. Whilst historical debate may never sort out fact from fiction on these issues, Chinese books dating back more than 2,000 years are said to describe Indigenous Australians, the boomerang and the presence of kangaroos in the Imperial Palace in Peking; 15th century Ming dynasty statuettes have been discovered around the Gulf of Carpentaria; and some Aboriginal cave paintings on Flinders Island depict ancient Chinese junk ships.


In more recent times, immigration documents recorded a carpenter named Ahuto travelling from China to Australia in 1803, just fifteen years after the first fleet of English convicts set foot on our soil. More is known of Mak Sai Ying, who arrived in 1818 and 11 years later became the publican at the Lion Inn Hotel in Parramatta—the first of many thousands of Chinese Australians to establish successful enterprises and become leaders of local businesses. 


The gold rush of the 1850s saw a large spike in Chinese migration, with many Chinese forcibly repatriated during some of the darker days of this legislature under the strict rules of the Immigration Restriction Act. Throughout this time, Chinese Australians have made a significant contribution to our nation. The White City Tennis Centre, with which I have a long history, was originally a Chinese market garden and another still operates in La Perouse after more than a century.


Much of the attention today focuses on the Chinatown precincts in each of the major cities, offering a snapshot of life an ocean away, and tendering shopping and culinary delights to all Australians in a modern form of cultural engagement. Yet with such strong historical ties, this engagement should not be limited to Peking duck and the Lunar New Year. As we share so many of our day-to-day experiences and celebrate the growth of our multicultural society, it is important that from early in life we are encouraged to befriend and interact with people of all cultures.


President Nixon's use of ping-pong as a non-threatening tool to facilitate diplomacy between the United States and China and enhance cultural ties highlighted the way that sport can be used to great effect. This was something I learned firsthand in my previous career, and in particular on the 5 November 1979, when I participated in the first professional tennis match in China, which received worldwide headlines as another example of improving relations between the Western world and a closed global superpower. I competed against a little known Swedish player by the name of Bjorn Borg and, considering the score line, I was happy to invoke the Chinese slogan: 'Friendship First, Competition Second.' I obviously lost.


We also played an exhibition doubles match alongside China's two leading players in front of some 6,000 people at the Sheng People's Stadium in Canton, and it was telecast to thousands more throughout the region. Prior to the match a Chinese government official told the international media:


Tennis is not that popular in China, but more people are getting interested. I think this match will have a very good influence.


Fast-forward to 2012 and China now boasts a French Open winner, two doubles grand slam tournament winners and an Olympics gold and bronze medal. The Shanghai Masters is now established in China as a major tennis venue, and the China Open goes from strength to strength. This is just an example of the powerful role that sport can play in facilitating interaction and creating the dynamic that breaks down cultural and political barriers and builds bridges between individuals, industries and governments.


In President Nixon's case, it was only one year after the US table tennis team visited that the President himself travelled to China and met with Mao Zedong: an historic moment in global politics that set the stage for the commencement of diplomatic relations between Australia and China shortly after. It was with this in mind that I developed the Bennelong Schools Table Tennis Program.


Shortly after the last election, as I visited local schools in Bennelong, I noticed a troubling pattern. Very few students from an Asian background were participating in traditional Australian sports. Sporting activity is one of the best things an individual, young or old, can do for physical, mental and social health. Different body shapes and cultural upbringing attract an interest and willingness to participate in different activities. As a result, providing access to a range of activities is essential to facilitate the same bridge-building goals achieved at diplomatic levels. With the generosity of Hyundai Australia, the Bennelong Schools Table Tennis Program is donating table tennis tables to every school in the electorate. The sporting competition is then administered by Table Tennis Australia, who will run coaching clinics and schools competitions. Many tables have already been delivered to schools and a number of students have expressed their excitement about competing against their peers and friends.


Later in the year an interschool competition will serve as opening act for the Bennelong Cup test match, featuring the Chinese women's team and Korean men's team competing against Australia. If the score line from last year's test match against Korea is any guide, the same 'Friendship First, Competition Second' slogan will likely be invoked. In order to celebrate their visit, a feature event will take place in the Great Hall, including students from schools throughout the electorate and the Bennelong Schools Choir.


These programs are important reminders of the way that sport can unite people from a diversity of cultural backgrounds, whether they are the youngest school kids or the most senior diplomats. The bringing together of China and Korea to compete alongside each other can perpetuate another way that these two nations can associate and cooperate through participation in sport.


Earlier today I spoke with the United States consul general in Sydney to discuss the possibility of the US joining next year in a competition where east meets west, where the great powers of this sport can partner with the more recent adopters to have some fun and provide entertainment for Bennelong's multicultural audience. It is often through the more light-hearted events between distant friends that our similarities, instead of our differences, can achieve some much-needed oxygen. The interaction that follows helps to develop components of a shared history which are then built upon through trade and migration, and progressively bridges are built and the building blocks of understanding, loyalty and trust are developed to ensure an enduring relationship.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for Berowra for agreeing to second this motion. His active friendship with the Chinese Australian community is well documented and he has been a strong and experienced guide for me as we have attended many community events together. I would also like to recognise my colleagues the members for Ryan, Scullin, Chisholm and Canberra who will also be speaking on this issue. I commend this motion to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott

Mr Ruddock:
  I second the motion with a great deal of pleasure and I reserve my right to speak and to further congratulate the member for Bennelong on his excellent presentation.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (20:09):  The member for Bennelong's motion invites the House to recognise the strong history of Chinese migration to Australia over the past 200 years and the significant contribution that Chinese Australians have made over this period to our nation. That is a very easy thing to support because right from the start, when the Chinese first came to make their way economically, to set up businesses, then through the 1840s to the 1890s to labour in farming pursuits, on plantations and in pursuit of gold, and right through to the present day, they have made a great contribution to the way Australia has developed economically and socially and very much identified with the multicultural society that is Australia.


The member for Bennelong's motion goes on to invite us to recognise the vibrant festivities and events hosted by the Bennelong Chinese community and enjoyed by the people of many cultures. I have not had the pleasure of accepting an invitation to those vibrant festivities and events in Bennelong, but I am sure, if those I attend throughout my electorate of Scullin are any guide, that is also a very easy part of the motion to support.


The member for Bennelong indicated that some 16 per cent of the population of his electorate indicate they have Chinese ancestry. In Scullin it is a mere four per cent, or 5,000 people, who recognise their Chinese heritage as being important to their day-to-day lives. I am indebted to two books written by my friend Arthur 'Boon Wah' Yong. One, which he published in 1999, is called Moon Cake and Meat Pies: the history, art and culture of Chinese settlement in the City of Whittlesea. He followed that up with another one, in 2008, called Chinese Settlement in Whittlesea. As he reflected in his first book, Moon Cake and Meat Pies, if we look at those that identify as Chinese they had in fact come from different parts of the world. He listed Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, East Timor, Vietnam, the Peoples Republic of China, and you can add Macau and Taiwan. So you can already see from that the contribution the Chinese have made throughout the globe. Therefore, why shouldn't they have made such a significant impact here in Australia?


In the municipality of Whittlesea, the Chinese date back to the 1850s. In Whittlesea township there are still remnants of market gardens operated by a number of families in the township. The waves of migration that have followed have meant that many people with Chinese ancestry have made their homes in the southern suburbs of the city of Whittlesea. Whether they had come in those early days to provide labour and then went on as they got economic independence to become hawkers and set up shops or whether they have come with great qualifications that have added to academe and to the way in which Australia has developed its many professions and ways of producing things through university and territory education, we recognise and should celebrate through this motion the way in which those people have been accepted.


I was interested in the second book by Arthur, Chinese Settlement in Whittlesea, and to reflect on the circumstances outlined in an article that first appeared in Evelyn Observer on Friday, 21 December 1883. It was a report of actions at the Whittlesea police court earlier that month when certain people had been charged with throwing stones and assaulting Ah Hem and Ah Soung, Chinese market gardeners, from Whittlesea. What really intrigued me was not the crime, but the fact that the two Chinese market gardeners appeared before the court accompanied by Mr James Ah Pow, Chinese interpreter, and the Chinese were sworn in through the 'orthodox fashion by blowing out a lighted lucifer'. When I reflect on the difficulties that have occurred in the acceptance of people from Chinese background later in Australia's history, I find it really something that you can actually celebrate that. In an area that accepted these people because of their hard work, in a court procedure we could also accept something that was traditional to them as people appearing before the court. And, as I have reflected from time to time, I have to express my shame at the way Chinese immigration was prevented by my own political party, but it does show that political parties can learn lessons, can change the way they perceive the value of people that come to Australia, and I think that is important.


The fourth part of the motion invites the House to recognise the unique opportunity for the local Chinese, Korean and broader communities to come together at the Bennelong Cup table tennis test match for an international table tennis competition against Australia. I am happy to support that. I am happy to support that because it represents a continuation of the member for Bennelong's support for table tennis as a relevant recreational and sporting activity for many people in his electorate. 


I am also willing to support it because of the reasons the member for Bennelong talked about concerning the strength of ping-pong diplomacy some 40 years ago. I think it is good to remind people of the significance that sport has not only in making sure that young Australians have a direction, that they can see the importance of having disciplines that they can cope with, and that they can interact with people of their own age and with other people, but also to remind people of the power of sport as a geopolitical tool. I think it is a great reminder that we should in a debate like this actually say that there are times when progress is sometimes made in a gentle way by the pursuit of sport, and not necessarily in the way that Nixon was able to use in his diplomatic efforts with the People's Republic of China at the time.


We should really use the depth and breadth of talent that Chinese Australians represent in also including them in forms of diplomacy that will assist where required because they have a different access to a cultural viewpoint that will assist in making sure that we develop in a diplomatic sense into an even more stable world. We should use our neighbours like the People's Republic of China, and perhaps like Vietnam that has a significant Chinese population, to ensure that people understand from different viewpoints the reasons we pursue the democratic institutions we pursue and be able to live in a world full of peace. 


In Arthur's book, Chinese Settlement in Whittlesea, he uses a poem that was written by a Chinese immigrant, a person who came to join his daughter in 1998, a very well-qualified person whose wife was a chemical engineer. Both were chemical engineers, highly intelligent with very good qualifications. Since coming to Australia, Jie Ha Wu has used his Chinese culture to open our eyes to calligraphy and to Chinese poems, and on the cover of this book is a poem called Praise of Australiain Chinese calligraphy. In the book the poem is translated and I wish to conclude with this poem. It says:


Flying over the equator and the Pacific Ocean from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere,


The ancient and amazing new continent surrounded by the vast expanse of ocean, the youngest and biggest island country, 


Which was founded on democracy and freedom with rich resources and wide territory,


The most and fertile place in the world is Australia.


I think that those sentiments of Chinese Australians are worth following.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (20:20):  I want to take this opportunity first to congratulate, if I may, the member for Bennelong. This is an outstanding motion. He gave me some credit, and let me just say I do not think that he needs any tuition. 


I see in this resolution the acknowledgement of the strong history of Chinese immigration to Australia over the past 200 years. I relate to that. I was formerly the member for Parramatta and when I saw that Mr Mak Sai Ying came in 1818 and settled in Parramatta, it was significant. He spoke about the significant contribution Chinese Australians have made to this nation over a period of time and I must say that I see that every day through the friends I have, through people I know in commerce, and from the contribution that people make. It is very difficult to single people out, but I look at somebody like Benjamin Chow, whom I know particularly well, who headed up the Council for a Multicultural Australia when I was minister for a time. He has been an example of those Chinese Australians who have made a very significant contribution to this nation.


I know the festivities of the Bennelong Chinese community. I have enjoyed them over many years when they were part of the electorate of Dundas and I look forward to the opportunity of witnessing the Bennelong table tennis match. 


I do not know where my family are going to stand in relation to this. I have a daughter who learnt Mandarin at Bei Da, Peking University. She is not the one who has presented the Ruddock family tree with Chinese genes. We also have the Chinese Women's Association, who are currently organising 25 years of service to the Chinese community and the wider community in my electorate—a big dinner is being held this year. There is the Chinese Social Services community organisation which provides aged care services to my community, and there is also the Friendship Association Chinese Table Tennis Club in downtown Box Hill, which also brings together many people through that great sport.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm—Deputy Speaker) (20:25):  I rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for Bennelong and thank him for bringing it to the House tonight. This is a motion I am most pleased to speak to and support. Australia is a country built on migration. It has been one of this country's greatest sources of strength. Our Chinese community, whether living in Bennelong or in my electorate of Chisholm or elsewhere in Australia makes an enormous contribution to our society and has done so for many years. 


For more than 150 years, since the days of the gold rush in the 1850s, Chinese Australians have been an integral part of the Australian way of life, both culturally and economically. Whether as part of the country's first big mining industry or as market gardeners, farm hands, operators of grocery stores, part of import-export businesses, cabinet makers, entrepreneurs or industry leaders, the Chinese community have been the working backbone of this country.


I do not think there is any place in Australia where this is more relevant than in my own electorate of Chisholm, where the influence of the vibrant and active Chinese community is the backbone of our society, particularly in suburbs such as Box Hill and Glen Waverley. Their influence has been profound. As revealed in the 2011 census released last week, my own electorate of Chisholm is home to more than 27,000 Australians of Chinese heritage, just over half of whom were born in China. It is a terrific testament to the quality of life in Australia and the value that we place on the Chinese community that we have such a wonderful mix of not only second- and third- generation Chinese Australians but as many newer migrants as well. 


You only have to spend a few minutes in my electorate—going to the shopping centre at Box Hill or Glen Waverley—to appreciate the enormous positive cultural and economic impacts of the Chinese community in 100 different restaurants and cafes, as well as a thriving fruit and vegetable market working alongside a variety of many businesses, be they medical or dental or legal practices, thriving real estate agencies or training colleges. They are all thriving and generating much wealth. There are import-export businesses. The drive and determination of the Chinese community of my electorate is palpable.


Every year this area comes alive, particularly Box Hill, with the community run and supported Chinese New Year celebrations. We are one of the only areas that has a dusk-to-dawn Chinese celebration. I have not quite made it to stay all night yet. I saw dawn in on one occasion which was pretty good going. It is an amazing event and the entire community, not just the Chinese community, embraces this event. It is the biggest cultural event and festival held in my electorate. It is a cultural tradition appreciated not only by the Chinese community; more than 70,000 people can turn up to a Box Hill Chinese New Year festival.


The continued success of these celebrations and the vibrancy of the small business community in my electorate are in part due to the work of the Asian Business Association of Whitehorse who put on the festival, raise a lot of money and donate it back to charity. The Asian Business Association of Whitehorse, which has operated for more than a decade, works to provide assistance to the local traders and operates with a connection to the area of the City of Whitehorse as well as broadly across Melbourne. The organisation's annual New Year celebrations and business networking events provide advice and assistance to small businesses, but nowadays it is also a backbone to my entire community. 


The association also produces the publication Brilliant Melbourne which keeps the Chinese community informed on what is happening around Melbourne. Publications like Brilliant Melbourne and Chinese Weekly and other newspapers in my electorate play a role in strengthening multiculturalism, social cohesion and participation throughout my community. Within my Chinese community in Box Hill they are predominantly Cantonese speakers of Indochinese descent or from Hong Kong, Singapore or Malaysia. Within Glen Waverley they are Mandarin speakers of direct mainland descent. Nowadays these two groups, which for many years were at odds with each, other have come together in the business of uniting to work between Australia and China.


I want to congratulate association president Andrew Yu and Vice President Ken Huang along with all members of the Asian Business Association of Whitehorse on the leadership they provide to our community and their involvement across the board in many things. I also congratulate City of Whitehorse Councillor Robert Chong, an outstanding community leader who has been involved in the community for more than 30 years, having come to Australia on the Colombo Plan and never gone home. He has done engineering and worked for the Australian Air Force and been a councillor at Whitehorse for many years. He is a backbone of our community and a backbone of the Chinese community. 


We also have the Chinese Women's Association, who are currently organising 25 years of service to the Chinese community and the wider community in my electorate—a big dinner is being held this year. There is the Chinese Social Services community organisation which provides aged care services to my community, and there is also the Friendship Association Chinese Table Tennis Club in downtown Box Hill, which also brings together many people through that great sport.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (20:30):  I rise to speak on the member for Bennelong's motion and I thank him for introducing this motion to reflect the significant importance of Chinese migration to the history and story of Australia.


The electorate of Ryan and the city of Brisbane, much like the electorate of Bennelong and the community in Sydney, has benefited greatly from Chinese migration to Australia. Brisbane's Chinese-Australian story began 164 years ago in October 1848, when the first Chinese migrants arrived in Brisbane as indentured labourers from Amoy aboard the sailing ship, the Nimrod. At that time, British settlement in the colony was expanding and the pastoralists were in need of cheap labour, as transportation of convicts had ceased. Between 1848 and 1853 about 1,000 Chinese labourers arrived in what is now Queensland and signed a five-year employment contract. They were employed as shepherds, labourers and servants and later as shearers.


The first group of 62 Chinese arrived in Moreton Bay a few weeks before the first load of free immigrants arrived from England on the Artemisia. The later discovery of gold was responsible for large numbers of Chinese coming to Queensland. The numbers were not great until gold was discovered on the Palmer River, inland from Cooktown in North Queensland. More than 18,000 Chinese migrated between 1875 and 1877 and, after the gold diminished, many moved to other areas of the colony, including Brisbane. They found work in many ways as merchants, land clearers, herbalists, cooks, furniture makers, hawkers, farmers and market gardeners.


In the electorate of Ryan, the Chinese established many market gardens along the creeks and watercourses and operated these during the latter part of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. They were the main providers of fresh fruit and vegetables to the expanding population. Similar activities occurred in nearly every settlement area in the colony. This was the beginning of a significant, productive economic contribution to Queensland and Australia, one that continues today.


In the electorate of Ryan, historical societies have been researching and documenting the history of the Chinese. The Chinese-Australian Historical Association is based in Ryan, established after the completion of the Chinese Club of Queensland's headquarters in Auchenflower in 1957. Like the rest of Brisbane, they suffered heavily during the 1974 floods, and the club did a lot of good work to support the wider Brisbane community at the time. They have recently erected a heritage sign in the original Chinatown of Brisbane in Albert Street. They take their story throughout the community with their travelling exhibition called 'Sojourners and Settlers—the Chinese in Queensland', which has toured the state.


There are many people in Ryan who have worked hard to document the history of Chinese migration to Brisbane. Desley Drevins from the Ashgrove Historical Society has documented the Chinese market gardens on Enoggera and Ithaca Creeks. Jeff Hilder from The Gap Pioneer & History Group has recently researched the story of the Chan brothers, who operated two market gardens at The Gap, and the Friends of Toowong Cemetery have translated and documented the information on the grave markers in the Chinese section of Toowong Cemetery.


I thank and pay tribute to Mr Ray Poon, who has worked tirelessly over the years to document the experience of Chinese immigrants to Queensland. Thanks also to the National Archives in Brisbane, whose many historical records have been preserved; to date they have digitised more than 15,000 records. I also acknowledge the hard work over many decades of the Chinese Club of Queensland, the current president, Mr Michael Chan, and Brisbane's living treasure Mr Eddie Liu, who has been deservedly recognised with the Order of the British Empire and the Order of Australia. The Liu family has been involved in the local community and Eddie is known as the 'father of Chinatown'.


I commend the member for Bennelong for drawing the attention of members to today's motion. The member for Bennelong is a strong community campaigner for his electorate and has developed a table tennis program to help students engage in sport and enjoyable exercise. I wish all the students who participate in the Bennelong Cup table tennis competition later this year the best of luck.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (20:34):  I too would like to lend my support to the member for Bennelong's private members' motion and recognise the strong and significant history of Chinese migration to Australia over the past 150 years. During this time Chinese-Australians all over the country have made a significant contribution to our nation. They are the masters of vibrant, loud and colourful festivities, and not just in Bennelong. During Canberra's National Multicultural Festival in February 2012 our Chinese community celebrated Chinese New Year—the Year of the Dragon. They came together for an extravaganza of dance, singing and performances. It was colourful, lots of fun and a wonderful reminder of the joy our Chinese community brings to Canberra.


I have my own connections to the Chinese-Australian community. My father's mother's family came out from China to Australia during the 1850s as part of the gold rush in Ballarat. Members of my family on my father's father's side also came from Germany in the 1850s, when there was a huge influx of Germans making the voyage to Australia's shores. My mother's family came out from Ireland and Scotland in the late 1800s. Despite all that, Chinese cuisine loomed large in my childhood, particularly in the sixties. Most Saturdays my father would tuck into a plate of congee, and would sit there with his red hair, blue eyes and very pale skin. My mother had mastered the art from my father's mother, and my poor old mum used to go into Chinatown every now and then to pick up fresh ginger—in the sixties it was a bit of a challenge to get that in Melbourne, so she would always go there to get her Asian foodstuff. So despite the fact that there was German, Irish and Scottish influence, the cuisine at home was very much influenced by China.


Australians, particularly working-class Australians, are a mix of every nationality. Australia is a diverse community, a multicultural community and, for the most part, an accepting community. We should be proud that so many people from all over the world view Australia as a wonderful place to live, to raise a family and to contribute to society. More and more people are willing to come to our country, adopt our values, call themselves Australian and become productive members of our society. In fact, the census data released last week shows that Canberra is becoming more culturally diverse than ever before. Between 2006 and 2011, the percentage of people in the ACT who said they had an Australian background dropped from 30.7 per cent to 26.6 per cent. And the third most reported country of birth, after Australia and England, was China, with 1.8 per cent of people living in the ACT born in China, compared to 1.1 per cent in 2006. Mandarin remained the second most popular language spoken at home, following English, increasing from 1.1 per cent to 1.9 per cent between 2006 and 2011. The number of people living in the ACT who were born overseas is also on the rise—a trend I am sure is evident in many other parts of Australia. The local Chinese community here in Canberra play a significant role in welcoming new migrants and supporting Chinese students who choose to study at our universities. They are led by Sam Wong, who this year was nominated a People of Australia Ambassador for his contribution to the community.


We are also fortunate to have many schools committed to teaching languages, including Mandarin, and encouraging young Chinese students in our community to retain their native language. For example, there is the Chinese Australian Early Childhood Centre in Mawson, which was refurbished last year, providing long day care with a focus on bilingual education in English and Mandarin. The centre is helping young children develop a proficiency in and appreciation for the Chinese language and culture from an early age, which is wonderful to see. Many of the staff at the centre are native Mandarin speakers and have been teaching at the school for over a decade. The centre itself has been running for more than 25 years, thanks to the fine work of the Association for Learning Mandarin in Australia.


As you can see, Chinese-Australians are continuing to contribute to our local communities in many different ways. Whether they emigrated here in the gold rush or are visiting now as international students keen to work here when they finish their degree, Chinese-Australians have played a key role in Australia's history and have enriched our cultural diversity and our nation immensely. I wish the member for Bennelong well at the Bennelong Cup table tennis match. I am sure it will be another great example of sport bringing different cultures together.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (21:30):  There is less than a week to go until the people of Macarthur are hit with the world's biggest carbon tax. I take this opportunity tonight to stand up for the residents, families, seniors and small business owners in my community who will suffer as a result of this tax.


The big question is, why must they suffer when the government's own figures show us that the carbon tax is not going to work. The carbon tax is a $9 billion a year tax which every Australian will pay through their electricity and gas bills. In the first four years, it will total $36 billion. But, despite the carbon tax, Australia's emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes by 2020. Why? Because electricity and gas are essential services and so everyone will pay the carbon tax, not just the major polluters as the government would have us believe.


The major impact of a carbon tax is to raise electricity prices. The government estimates a rise of up to 10 per cent in five years, although the electricity industry is predicting a 20 per cent rise over the next 18 months. In New South Wales, prices are going up 18 per cent, with nine per cent directly attributed to the carbon tax—that is nearly the entire price rise in the first year, instead of the government's five-year projection.


I have pensioners in my electorate who are already struggling with the cost of living. I am visiting homes in the middle of winter where it is freezing cold inside because the elderly are too scared to turn on their heaters. A significant electricity price rise from 1 July is going to hurt families in Macarthur. Most of them are already using electricity responsibly. It does not matter how much it costs them, they are still going to have to turn on the lights, cook the dinner, do the washing, use a computer and of course heat their homes. And let us not forget small business owners—they will have no choice but to take on the burden of these price rises or pass the cost on to their customers and risk losing business.


Earlier this month, the shadow minister for climate action and the environment, Greg Hunt, came to Macarthur for a community forum. We met with many local business owners, including Simon Bradbury, who owns Stockade Pies in Queen Street. 'Simon the Pieman' said he will have to make and sell an extra 8,000 pies per year to cover the cost of a carbon tax on his business. This is a man who represents so many like him in my electorate who are trying to support their families and my community with no help or compensation from this government.


I have recently visited many manufacturers in Macarthur to see how the carbon tax will affect their business. Most of them have said that they will be worse off, and that the carbon tax could not come at a worse time. They are already struggling against the high Australian dollar, and soon they will be paying the carbon tax while their overseas competitors will not have to. 


In recent months, I have met with businesses such as Nepean Engineering, the TRN Group, Narellan Town Grocer & Deli, Narellan Planet Health cafe, George's on Queen cafe, Sports Spirit, Funnell's Electrical, and many other local businesses concerned about this tax and the impact it will have on their businesses. Some have even written clauses into their contracts which warn customers of the possible price rises that will be passed on once the carbon tax begins on 1 July. And do not get me started on the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation that will see the government use taxpayers' money to buy shares in green projects which the private sector will not back—that is an absolute and total joke.


What puzzles me most is that under this Labor-Greens policy, instead of reducing Australia's emissions, firms will have to purchase 94 million tonnes of carbon permits overseas each year by 2020. By 2050, it will equate to 1.5 per cent of GDP. How will this help Australia reduce its own emissions and improve our environment? Not one country currently imposes an economy-wide tax on greenhouse emissions or has in place an economy-wide ETS. The US, Canada, India, China and Japan have all made it clear that they are not moving to a broad based carbon tax model like Australia's. The European Emissions Trading Scheme does not cover the whole economy and provides many industries with free emissions permits. 


Europe's scheme raised only about $500 million a year, while Labor's carbon tax will raise more in three months than Europe's has in five years. With a population of just over 500 million, the European scheme raised just over one dollar per person per year. With a population of less than 23 million, Labor's carbon tax will raise almost $400 per person per year.


The government claims that China is acting to reduce its carbon emissions, but China's emissions are forecast to rise by 500 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020. In fact, Garnaut's own climate change papers tell us that between 2005 and 2020, Chinese emissions will increase from around 5 billion tonnes of CO2 per annum to over 12 billion tonnes of CO2 per annum. Then we have Australia with the most expensive carbon tax in the world—it starts at $23 per tonne, but it will keep on going up and up and up. Treasury estimates it will be $29 per tonne in 2016; $37 per tonne in 2020; and more than $350 per tonne in 2050.



Like the people of Macarthur, the coalition believes we need to protect our environment today and for future generations. Our Direct Action Plan delivers on Australia's commitment to a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. (Time expired)

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:31):  The Riverina, as with each and every corner of this wide, vast land, will be hit hard with the carbon tax, and my constituents are not happy. The people I represent have every reason for feeling angry, frustrated and indeed cheated. This government has no mandate for imposing such a tax on the people against their will. Five days out from the 21 August 2010 election, the Prime Minister uttered those words which she must now truly regret: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That is what she said. Not long after, at the behest of the Greens, with whom Labor as well as the so-called Independents cobbled together an unholy alliance to form government, the Prime Minister announced that she would be putting a price on carbon.


There you go, I have said it: a price on carbon. If I can say that, why can't those on that side utter the words 'a tax on carbon'? We all know that, essentially, that is in fact what it is: a tax. Those opposite know that it is a price, a high one, on the way people live. It is a tax on the way they live. If people are supposed to change their lifestyles to help save the planet, as decreed by Senator Bob Brown and his successor, Christine Milne, then why is Labor giving people a household assistance package to—as it claims—more than make up the difference? If that is the case, people will not alter what they are doing in order to create less carbon emissions. It makes no sense, and Labor knows it.


Labor members, nervous about their seats at the next election—which cannot come soon enough—know that their constituents are also nervous about increasing costs of living. In the Riverina, at least three local councils have been placed in the Labor-Greens carbon tax crosshairs. Griffith City Council, Wagga Wagga City Council and Coolamon Shire Council have been placed on Minister Greg Combet's carbon tax hit list because they have people who dare to take rubbish to the dump. Those people, many of them mere bush battlers, cannot understand why they will now be hit with the triple whammy of higher tip user fees, higher council rates and increased costs of living under the carbon tax.


Take for example—one example of many—Joyce Lucas, an age pensioner from the Wagga Wagga suburb of Ashmont. She is deeply concerned about how she will afford her electricity bill under the carbon tax. At present, she is struggling to pay her rent and amenities. She is currently paying three-quarters of her income to rent and bills. She is already paying $180 before usage on her gas and electricity. She is worried that the carbon tax will increase this proportion to 100 per cent, and she has been advised by Centrelink to return to work, even though she is over the retirement age and has recently been battling cancer. Her neighbours are turning off their gas because they cannot afford their heating.


Councils will pass on their carbon costs to ratepayers, and pensioners such as Joyce from Ashmont will be whacked again. It is not going to save the planet, because Australia's emissions are miniscule compared to those countries which are not imposing and have no intention to impose an economy-wide carbon tax.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (11:01):   I thank colleagues for allowing this debate to occur. It is an important one not only for the international community about also for Australia's sovereign position in the way Australian aid dollars are use. This comes from a lot of work done in the United Kingdom on debt relief. There was a 2005 UK report into heavily indebted poor countries which led to a tripartite supported bill in the UK parliament known as the Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act 2010. At a time in the Australian parliament when bipartisanship is so difficult to achieve, it is good to see another jurisdiction in a minority government delivering tripartite support for something of such importance. It can be done when people act in good faith. The significance of this bill is obviously to provide relief through an international initiative on heavily indebted poor countries. Around 40 eligible countries are involved in dealing with their significant problem of debt, which then applies obvious pressures on any form of program delivery for those countries to participate in the modern economy, whether it is through progress in agriculture, women's health, education or basic governance principles. All of those issues become secondary in a country trying to work its way out of a very heavy loading of debt through questionable dealings.


I fully understand concerns in regard to chasing dodgy lenders and having a parallel exercise of pinning down those who, for the wrong reasons, have provided lending. The International community should do more to pin down those who have been the vultures in this exercise. I would also urge this fundamental support for debt relief in developing countries.


The reason this is not only about providing relief to 40 countries and the Millennium Development Goal arguments about doing that is the issue of Australian aid dollars. If we are going to maximise the effectiveness of Australian aid dollars, I would have thought we need them to go to the very important programs in agriculture. I remind everybody of the words of Bill and Melinda Gates, who said that 'no country has achieved a rapid ascent from hunger and poverty without raising agricultural productivity'. You cannot do that without making a financial contribution. I remind the House Tim Costello's comments that, in dealing with global poverty, the one issue he thinks there should be focus on is women's empowerment and related issues around women's health and sexual health. Those programs cannot be delivered without dealing with debt. Issues of corruption or maladministration around governance principles will not be addressed unless there is some conditional program work in dealing with debt. Long term, the knowledge contribution of many countries of the world will not happen unless debt is tackled. Australian aid dollars should be going to those programs, not to vulture funds. 


We have a precedent on the table in the UK parliament, where long and good work has been done and where consensus has been reached in building a model that sees UK aid dollars—much of it in the Asia-Pacific region—going to valuable aid programs to help countries participate in the modern economy and modern community rather than paying off debts to vulture funds. Australia could replicate that and should replicate that, not only for the moral arguments but for the pure economic arguments around Australian aid dollars going to the right programs rather than to any dodgy lenders or to vulture funds. I urge this House to support this motion.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (11:06):  I want to thank the member for Lyne bringing this important motion before parliament. I also want to thank Jubilee Australia for its advocacy on this issue. Not many Australians know about vulture funds, but the name sums it up quite well. Vulture funds buy debts owed by very poor countries for a small amount and then seek to enforce the full face value of the debt plus interest and fees in courts around the world, including here in Australia.


In November 2010 the New South Wales Supreme Court ruled that the Democratic Republic of the Congo must pay $30 million, plus legal costs and a $2 million court imposed fine, to a New York based vulture fund named FG Hemisphere Associates or FG Capital Management. As explained by the ABC's Damien Carrick on Radio National last year, the sum forms part of a debt incurred in the 1980s by the authoritarian government of what was then Zaire. The original $37 million loan, which has now ballooned to over $100 million, was for power transmission lines and a hydropower dam near the home of long-time dictator Mobutu.


The DRC is a country of around 66 million people, 80 per cent of whom live below the poverty line. DRC has been involved in a protracted internal conflict which has claimed around 3½ million lives, and it has very little infrastructure. It has gone through a process of debt cancellation, having completed the World Bank and IMF Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, HIPC, process and received some debt forgiveness from creditors. However, the vulture funds refuse to participate in the debt relief scheme and, in the case of FG Hemisphere, it instead began pursuing repayment of $100 million for the old DRC debt, which is $80 million more than the DRC would have been expected to pay for the debt under the HIPC process. FG has scoured the world in search of foreign assets belonging to the DRC. The vulture fund was able to bring the case in Australia because the DRC held shares in an Australian mining company. The DRC was forced to sell its shares to transfer the $30 million profit to FG.


As Jubilee Australia notes, this is not the first time the Congo has been targeted. In January 2009, a South African tribunal authorised FG Hemisphere to seize, for 15 years, payments owing to the DRC's state owned electric authority, SNEL, for electricity generated from the Grand Inga hydroelectricity facility and sold to South Africa. This should amount to $105 million. In March 2009 FG obtained a court order from the Royal Court of Jersey for an interim injunction upon the right of the DRC state owned mining company Gecamines to receive payments on its 20 per cent share in GTL. GTL was ordered to send all future payments owed to Gecamines to FG Hemisphere until the debt was satisfied. In 2010 a Hong Kong court gave FG Hemisphere vulture fund the right to seize the $350 million sum the China Railway Group was to pay a state owned Congolese mining company. While the actions of vulture funds in taking advantage of legal loopholes to profit from desperately poor countries have been condemned by the United Nations, IMF, World Bank, donor governments and civil society and while there have been multilateral initiatives such as the Paris Club to try to discourage vulture funds, it remains entirely legal for vulture funds to pursue their claims in court. As Jubilee Australia has described it:


The insatiable greed of a small number of individuals is undermining international debt relief initiatives. Money that thanks to debt relief, should be going to lifesaving medicines and schooling, is lining the pockets of wealthy investors instead. Without legislation to prevent it, these so called ‘vulture funds’ are free to profiteer from poor country debts in Australian courts.


The UK parliament, with tripartite support, passed legislation in 2010 entitled the Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act, which limits the ability of creditors to use UK courts to recover extortionate amounts from poor countries engaged in international debt relief efforts. The landmark law, which was due to expire in June 2011 as a result of a sunset clause in the legislation, has been made permanent in April this year, with no opposition in the UK. The law has successfully kept the FG Hemisphere's vulture fund out of UK courts. I am confident that similar legislation would receive support from all members of this place and I look forward to it being the subject of a bill in the near future.


As noted by the United Nations independent expert on foreign debt and human rights, Dr Cephas Lumina, 'vulture fund activity erodes the gains from international debt relief efforts at the expense of both the citizens of distressed debtor countries and taxpayers of countries that have supported international debt relief efforts'. It does not make sense for Australia and other countries to give debt relief and foreign aid so generously while allowing vulture funds to take this money through litigation. I commend the member for Lyne for his motion, which brings this very important matter to the attention of the House.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (11:11):  I concur with the comments of the member for Fremantle and I too thank the member for Lyne for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. I think it is worth going back and looking at the history of where these initiatives stemmed from, with the creation of the HIPC initiative in 1996 by the IMF and the World Bank. As both the previous speakers have touched on, we should be looking at taking all avenues possible to try to assist poor countries not only to get out of the burden of debt they are under but also to develop their economies so that they are able to compete on the world stage.


That brings me to my primary concern, which is that vulture funds impede the ability of those countries to undertake those activities. But, more importantly, there is a failure to deal with the underlying issue that creates this problem for these countries in the first place—that is, a lack of free and equitable access to the world economy. That is driven by the activities of Western developed nations in terms of tariffs and market restriction. In particular in this case I am going to single out the Europeans and the Americans. I think we in Australia have done a tremendous amount over the past 30 years to try to free up access to our economy and to compete effectively and efficiently in the world market and create opportunities for others to do so.


The member for Lyne touched on a really interesting point in terms of agricultural productivity and I certainly agree with his comments in that regard. How do we grow the agricultural productivity of these nations? I think in this case China provides us with a very instructive example. Forty years ago, with very poor agricultural resources, it was barely able to provide for itself. It made some very significant changes in its agricultural policies, including, firstly, allowing farmers to sell some of their produce, then allowing farmers to move that produce to different towns within the county and ultimately allowing farmers to own their own farms. One of the recurring problems in underdeveloped countries is the lack of clear and well-defined property ownership, and we see that here in Australia too, in the Indigenous community. I think that is a huge issue for the Indigenous community. In that international marketplace, it is actually property ownership, with clearly defined boundaries for who owns what, that creates the economic incentive for people to take risk, maybe obtain microfinance to start to grow their own small businesses and lift themselves out of poverty. 


We as a nation, I think, are very generous in our aid, both from a government perspective and from an individual perspective. I certainly concur with the sentiments of the member for Lyne and the member for Fremantle that we want to ensure and we need to ensure that our Australian aid dollars are spent effectively and that it is not going to corrupt governments or to the arms dealers that like to foment conflict in many of these nations, which turns the money into an international money-go-round: we provide aid funding to these countries, the leaders of those countries then misuse those funds to purchase arms to continue the conflict and the population at large suffers as a result.


We as the coalition have said that we do not believe that this initiative will provide an effective remedy and, as we have flagged, we will oppose this motion.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (11:16):  Debt is not the most serious issue that developing countries face, but unsustainable debt burdens can, in certain cases, be a barrier to development. So the HIPC Initiative was launched in 1996 by the IMF and the World Bank, and its aim is to ensure that no poor country faces a debt burden that it cannot manage.


HIPC has a two-step process. The decision point requires that countries must fulfil the following four conditions: be eligible to borrow from the World Bank's International Development Association; face an unsustainable debt burden; have established a track record of reform and sound policies; and have a poverty reduction strategy paper. Of the 39 countries that are eligible or potentially eligible for HIPC Initiative assistance, 32 are receiving full debt relief from the IMF and other creditors after reaching their completion points. We know that, for these countries, debt relief has freed up resources for social spending. Before the HIPC Initiative, eligible countries were spending a little more on debt service than on health and education combined. Now their expenditure on health, education and social services has gone up and averages five times what they spend on debt payment. For the 36 countries that have debt relief, debt service paid, on average, has declined about two percentage points of GDP over the noughties. So the HIPC Initiative has been successful.


I think it is important that in considering any issue of debt relief we bear in mind the purpose for which debt is acquired. Debt is not of itself a bad thing. Just as we would not want to shut off credit markets to low-income Australians, so too we want to make sure that any reforms in the area of debt do not shut off access to credit for well-managed developing country borrowers. In fact, what is particularly striking is that more finance is not flowing to the world's poorest countries. The return on capital ought to be highest for countries that are furthest behind the world average incomes, yet it has proven difficult to attract investors to these countries.


The concept that I find most attractive in this space is Michael Kremer and Seema Jayachandran's notion of 'odious debt'. They define odious debt as sovereign debt that is incurred without the consent of the people and not for their benefit. They give the example of debt incurred by apartheid era South Africa. They argue that that debt should not be transferrable to successor governments. They argue that the development of an institution which could truthfully announce whether regimes were odious could create an equilibrium in which lenders have a strong incentive not to loan to odious countries but in which regimes in low-income countries that are spending borrowings for the advantage of their people could still obtain access to credit markets. To me, the notion of odious debt is particularly attractive, because it focuses on how the money is spent rather than on how much money is acquired. I would urge the House to do what it can to pursue the notion of odious debt.


The big shift since the creation of the HIPC initiative has been the rise of China as a donor. This is transforming overseas direct assistance. China currently operating largely outside the OECD DAC framework means that it is difficult for other countries to know what aid China is providing and to work in with that aid. So anything that we are doing in the space of odious debt, vulture funds or the HIPC initiative needs to take into account how the Chinese government will respond. To the extent we can, we need to bring China into the community of nations that believes that overseas aid should be used to further the wellbeing of individuals rather than simply of regimes and leaders.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (12:57):  I rise to speak in opposition to the Marriage Amendment Bill. I want to say at the outset that I have the utmost respect for my colleagues who are in favour of this bill, and my esteem for those in my own party is not diminished in any way because I hold a different view from them. I am pleased to be a member of a political party that accepts that this issue is one that involves deeply held and differing views, and so I will put my view on the record again and I will, when the time comes, exercise my right to a conscience vote.


It is a matter of public record that those opposite do not have the same option but are being silenced and held to a party political view. But this is an issue where genuine beliefs and identity are debated in our democracy, and we will find out as a test of this debate how weak or strong we are as a democratic nation. In a way this debate reveals to us our capacity or our failure to live with the tension of sharing the politics, respectfully acknowledging that there are different views and that each view should be heard.


I start out making that claim because it is too often the case in the debate about same-sex marriage that people who are opposed to it are maligned as homophobic, intolerant, bigoted, brainwashed by religious indoctrination or intellectually inferior to those who support it. I want to put on the record that such a view is of itself intolerant and 'otherphobic'. I want to put on the record how proud I am of our federal party, following the victory of 2007, in undertaking the substantive program of legislative change that saw more than 80 pieces of law amended to give lesbian, gay and transgender individual Australians the same practical rights before the law.


Yet I stand in opposition to this proposed law before the House for a number of reasons. Firstly, regardless of culture, time or place, the organic nature of the family unit that is the natural consequence of the union of a man and a woman is the key social unit on which a stable society is built. Marriage is almost universally viewed as a legal and social event that is life generating and is understood to be much more often than not linked to children. Terri Kelleher from the Australian Family Association cites recent research and argues that:


Although the family takes many forms in contemporary Australian society, it is uncontroversial to insist that the ideal family environment is that in which children are raised by their own mother and father. According to a 2004 study, 73.6% of children under 18 in Australia live with their biological parents in intact families. It is a statistic we expect most Australians would applaud: the more children growing up in such circumstances, the better. The institution of marriage is instrumental in realising this ideal, by binding a man, a woman, and their biological children in a stable family unit. 


The Marriage Act defines marriage to mean the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. This is a commonly held position in the broad Australian community. It is a position expressed by our Prime Minister and a position held by many people of many faiths. Many but not all Catholic people like myself and Islamic people, Jewish people, secular humanists and Indigenous families think of marriage in this way. We prize it and we understand it very certainly as a union between a man and a woman. The Chinese Methodist Church in Australia put it this way in their submission to the recent inquiry into this bill:


Marriage is the logical basis of the family … an institution fundamental to the well-being of all of society, not just religious communities.


…   …   …


The preservation of the unique meaning of marriage is not a special or limited interest but serves the good of all. Therefore, we stand all who are of a kin mind in promoting and protecting marriage as the union of one man and one woman.


The Ambrose Centre for Religious Liberty in its recent public submission on the bill cited Frank Furedi in the Australian on 25 and 26 June 2011:


From a sociological perspective, the ascendancy of the campaign for gay marriage provides a fascinating story about the dynamics of the cultural conflicts that prevail in Western society. During the past decade the issue of gay marriage has been transformed into a cultural weapon that explicitly challenges prevailing norms through condemning those who oppose it.


…   …   …


As a result, it does not simply represent a claim for a right but a demand for the institutionalisation of new moral and cultural values.


This brings me to another reality that needs to be acknowledged: too often it is overstated that the broader community is in favour of legislative change to the current definition of marriage. It is a claim that is made here again today, but it does not reflect the community to which I belong. A cursory view of speeches in this place in response to the call from the member for Melbourne to consult with our communities indicates that there are more elected representatives on the record in this place reflecting a majority community opposition to a change than there are elected representatives conveying community support. In short, community support for a change to the definition of marriage is overstated and community opposition is understated. For these reasons, and for several others that I will not have time to speak on, I oppose the bill.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (13:02):  On 17 June 2004 I spoke in this parliament in support of the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which made changes to the Marriage Act 1961. As I said in my speech of 17 June:


A marriage is and should be between a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. The amendments in the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 include those marriages entered into in other jurisdictions and overseas, measures which are important to ensure legal loopholes are not used to introduce social changes which go against the will of the people. Far be it from me to criticise the courts, but where there is a lawyer and there is a loophole, there is a possibility for social change. The other amendments to the Marriage Act will spell out that overseas adoptions cannot be undertaken by persons not in a marriage which is recognised in Australia. These are consistent amendments, consistent both with the social expectations of the people of Australia and the legal definition of marriage.


I will not delay the House further by restating all I had to say at that time.


I acknowledge that there has been a concentrated campaign to change the definition contained in the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry. I respect their campaign and, in particular, the right they have in a free and democratic society to pursue their agenda without the personal persecution that may happen in other countries and societies.


There are two bills aimed towards changing the act to allow same-sex marriage currently before our House. However, I am extremely disappointed at the tone of the argument made by certain individuals and groups alike who are pro-same-sex marriage, making me a target, stating that I am homophobic for not supporting the change. I can assure this House that that is not the case. Whilst I understand the highly charged emotion attached to their argument, I do not agree with the tone from some—and, thankfully, not all.


I do not discriminate against any individual on the basis of gender or sexuality. I choose and always have chosen my employees on the basis of their ability to deliver the outcomes required. I choose my circle of friends on the basis of common interest; sexuality and gender do not come into the argument. I am not going to name names, but I have had in the past, currently have and probably will in the future have employees who are homosexual. But they work for me because they have the capacity to do the job and to deliver the outcomes required. I have a number of genuine friends who are homosexual, both male and female, because we share a common interest across a broad selection of topics. As I said, and I want to restate to the House, I am not homophobic. For those who say I am not reflecting my electorate of Paterson, I also say that is not the case. In my office, we keep an electorate database of all contacts from my constituents. Of all of the emails, phone calls, letters and meetings with my constituents of Paterson in relation to the issue of same-sex marriage, as of last Friday 92 per cent were against same-sex marriage. Only eight per cent were for it. For those who said I should have spent money surveying the whole of my electorate, the feedback from those both for and against has been resounding enough not to warrant further expenditure. I have said to them they are welcome to do a whole-of-electorate survey and provide me with the results, along with details of how the polling was done. Nothing has transpired.


I say to those who have condemned me for my stance that I am representing the majority view of my electorate of Paterson, which also happens to align with my personal view, based on my strong faith values. I recognise and acknowledge the right of any individual to campaign on any issue. I recognise the rights of the individuals to have their own views and their own opinions. But it also should be said that they should respect me and allow me to have my views and my values. They are based on a Christian faith and fortunately, in this situation, they are reflected by the broader consensus of my electorate. Therefore I will be opposing this bill in its entirety.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (13:07):  This debate is about change. It is the next stage in a long line of important policy changes relating to marriage and the status of married people in Australian society. So far as women are concerned, it was only in 1883 that the South Australian Married Women's Property Act began to allow married women to own and dispose of property in Australia. Despite most women gaining the right to vote in 1902, women could still lose their Australian nationality when they married a non-Australian national, even up until the late 1940s. Before 1966, many women had to resign from Public Service positions upon getting married. After campaigns for change, Australian society and its parliaments have changed their views on the status of women, once regarded as mere subjects in the institution of marriage.


As late as 1959, Indigenous Australians did not necessarily have the right to marry a person of their own choosing. The case of Gladys Namagu and Mick Daly in that year demonstrated the arbitrary nature of marriage arrangements in relation to Indigenous Australians. Gladys, an Indigenous woman, and Mick, a white man, were denied the opportunity to marry at first instance. This kind of discriminatory treatment in marriage was to change after much struggle, including the 1967 referendum campaign. Before 1975, we still had a system of fault based divorce in this country. Some would prefer that system to still be in place. I strongly, strongly disagree. Fortunately, so did others, with the effect that in 1975 we saw a more humane approach to the already difficult decision to end a marriage.


To all of those who campaigned and struggled for change in relation to each of these important issues, I say thanks, because those changes have reflected broader societal change. They have corrected injustices and they have made us a better society. Campaigns for racial and gender equality have been hard fought and are ongoing. They have rightly reached into all aspects of law making, including laws relating to marriage. This campaign and this debate will be the same. It is an historic debate which reflects a shift in social expectations. Australia agreed to be bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980, and, in so doing, it recognised the importance of equality before the law and principles of nondiscrimination. There has been a lengthy campaign for law reform to reflect these basic premises in the ensuing decades and it continues today. After winning the 2007 election Labor pushed on with reforms which saw around 85 Commonwealth laws changed to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. I am proud that we did. Last year Labor's national policy platform was changed to support amendments to the Marriage Act which would ensure equal access to marriage under statute for all adult couples, irrespective of sex, who have a mutual commitment to a shared life. I am speaking in support of marriage equality today to give effect to those statements. I will be voting in favour of marriage equality in the bill before us and I hope that other members of my party will do the same. I simply believe that voting for marriage equality is the right thing to do.


There will be those who disagree with me. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs and I have listened to the witnesses who have come before the inquiry into the bill. Strong views have been put against the bill. I have found them, in the final analysis, to be unconvincing. On this occasion votes against marriage equality may prevail, but I know that this debate will not end merely because debate on one piece of legislation ends. It will continue in society until equality, including equality in marriage, is achieved regardless of sexual preference.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (13:11):  I rise to fiercely defend the status quo in relation to this bill. Change for the sake of change is simply a waste of human endeavour. All of us are constrained in society by the mores of that society popular at the time, and any change that is sustainable is change that is well thought through and necessary. None of the aforementioned are required for change to the Marriage Act. The Marriage Act clearly states, as you are all aware and as has been heard ad nauseam, marriage is between a man and a woman for life to the exclusion of all others. It is the perfect world. Of course, it is the perfect environment for the propagation, raising and teaching of children to sustain the society that we have and enjoy today and that some of us fiercely defend.


There are others in the community, sadly, who would have change ad nauseam. The slightest suggestion by one minority group in society that tomorrow ought be different from today is listened to, splinter groups are formed, lobby groups are formed and suddenly we, who maintain the status quo, are encouraged to feel as though we are second-rate citizens because we do not believe in the particular popular 'ism' of the day.


I am proud to be a stick-in-the-mud if that is what I am to be categorised as. I have no hesitation in accepting that couples, multiples or whatever may live together and choose whichever particular sexuality they desire, but at the end of the day any domestic relationship is just that. It is enjoyed by members of our society in a free society. What they do not have the opportunity to enjoy is declaring themselves equal in every respect to a couple that is a man and a woman living together to the exclusion of all others for life; therefore, they are not married. If couples wish to lament the fact that they cannot be married because they are a same-sex couple or living in a polygamous arrangement, so be it; such are the constraints at law in our society today and so they ought to be. I was much heartened to hear a member of the government today express so much good sense when the member for Robinson came into this place and expressed her point of view, firmly espousing that she would not be changing her point of view, because she thought it was right. I too believe that my point of view is right and that the definition of marriage ought remain.


There are many other definitions of relationships. I have some here. We have polygamy, and most of us know about it. It encompasses both a man with multiple wives in polygamy and also polyandry, which is one wife with multiple husbands living in a domestic relationship. We have polyamory, a de facto type of marriage where both partners have more than one partner. And then we have polyfidelity, which is an expanded monogamy. All of these arrangements exist in our society today and no-one loses a great deal of sleep over that. But none of those aforementioned relationships can consider themselves to be married. For the sake of those couples who do live as man and wife, a male and a female, to raise children in an environment which is most popular and stable in our community today, they ought not to be shown disrespect or denigrated by giving the same legal definition to all of those other domestic arrangements.


I state my case. I firmly believe in maintaining the status quo and that any debate in regard to changing the Marriage Act is such a waste of time in this place because there are so many other vitally important issues to be debated.

"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (13:16):  I support the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 that has been proposed by the member for Throsby and supported by others. Like many members, I have taken many points of view from amongst my constituents and have consulted in relation to the issues and I think it is fair to say, as everyone would be familiar with, that there are many strong points of view right across the spectrum on this issue. But ultimately for me as a member of parliament and as an individual this is a matter of discrimination against same-sex couples that I believe the parliament should remedy. Same-sex couples should not be denied the ability to marry if they should choose to do so.


The bill amends the Marriage Act 1961 to address this issue by amending the definition of marriage from 'husband and wife' to 'two people'. Importantly, it does not place an obligation on a minister of religion or a marriage celebrant to marry same-sex couples if they should not wish to do so. The bill simply seeks to remove discrimination and to advance equality in our society. It is important, as the member for Throsby indicated in introducing the bill, to note that marriage has changed over the years. We no longer have betrothals and dowries, a wife's vow of obedience or the prohibition of certain interracial or interreligious marriages. Times change and it is important that the legislature change with them. Ending discrimination does not take away someone's rights; it establishes equal rights for members of our community.


Labor, I would submit, has a very proud history of fighting for rights and ending discrimination. That is one of the reasons that I am a member of the Labor Party and the Labor movement, although I have enormous respect for the diversity of views on this issue amongst the members of the Labor Party. When one looks at the history of the Labor Party, it established the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and in the last term of this parliament Labor amended 85 separate pieces of legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. Australia is not acting alone on this matter either. Ten countries and even more jurisdictions now allow same-sex marriage. Although I do respect, as I have said, the different views in relation to this matter, the Labor movement has always fought for equality and justice and I believe that this sits within that tradition.


As for many other members, this is also a matter relevant to my own family and extended family. I cannot and will not contemplate support for discrimination against persons whom I care for. Should members of my family or my friends wish to solemnify their same-sex relationship by seeking to become married, I have respect for that. For the people for whom I care and have regard, I as a member of parliament but particularly as a member of my family cannot support discrimination let alone in the way that I construct the current arrangements discriminate against the rights of same-sex couples to marry. For those reasons, in brief, I do support the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 and am happy to have my support on the record.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-06-25,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (13:20):  I have spoken in the past on the issue of same-sex marriage and I intend to remain consistent in both the tone and content of my contribution here today. I am opposed to same-sex marriage but I recognise that there are very strongly held views to the alternative and I acknowledge that this issue does have the potential to become quite divisive in the wider community.


In relation to the tone of the debate, I take my lead from the previous speaker. I think his contribution was very respectful in tone and I think that is the manner in which the debate should be held. It is my intention to participate in this debate along those lines and to listen to both sides. As I said, I think there is a real risk of this debate becoming very divisive in the community. I think some, particularly some on the Left, have deliberately used inflammatory language, portraying people who do not support same-sex marriage as being somehow bigoted and homophobic. I think that is terribly unfair and not the way we should allow this debate to develop.


On the weekend, there was a great example of how this debate should be pursued when the Nationals had their state conference in Bowral. A motion on this very issue was narrowly defeated, but it was a very mature and constructive debate. It is fair to say, perhaps, that a lot of the younger members of the party were advocating change, but I do not think same-sex marriage is an issue which neatly divides on the basis of age or any other basis.


I have had the chance to ask a lot of people in my electorate for their views and I have often been surprised by their comments and the level of passion they have about this issue. Many people are quite ambivalent about this issue and think that there are far more important issues for this parliament to be considering at this time in our history. However, there are others, on either side of the debate, who have very passionate views. I understand that. I am not trying to belittle the issue. But it is fair to say that a significant number of people who contact me on this issue want us, in this parliament, to focus on other things. That is what brings me to my conclusion—that I am not sure how much longer we should continue to have this debate. The issues have, I believe, been well and truly canvassed both in this place and in the broader community and surely it is time to bring on the vote. Bring on the vote and let us see where we stand on this issue. Get a clear indication of where we, the 43rd parliament, stand on this issue and then move on to the other issues which people in the community regard as being of greater importance to their lives at this time.


In relation to the substance of the issue, I do support the recognition of legal rights within same-sex relationships but I do not support the proposed changes to the Marriage Act. I think that is the only politically consistent position and the only position of integrity I can take, because it is the position I took to the people of Gippsland at the last general election. Importantly, that position is also entirely consistent with the broader view of my party. We took a position of being opposed to same-sex marriage to the voters at the last election and we are consistent in the application of that policy position in a very open and transparent manner. There have been no surprises in relation to the view of the Nationals and my own personal view. If we wanted to adopt a different position, I think it would be incumbent upon us to take that back to the people who elected us in the first place.


I think that stands in stark contrast to this Prime Minister and her breach of trust on the carbon tax. This Prime Minister explicitly ruled out introducing a carbon tax prior to the last election, yet only weeks or months later she had a change of mind. But she did not take it back to the people of Australia. That is where this Prime Minister and her fundamental breach of trust have caused so many problems for the current government. I think this issue is the opposite of the approach I have taken—I took a position to the people of Gippsland and I am going to be consistent with it. That is the openness and transparency I think you need to show as a member of parliament. If we are going to restore community confidence in the integrity of our democratic system and restore faith in the parliament and the people who serve here, this is a very important principle to remember and one I intend to adhere to whenever it is humanly possible to do so.


As I said, I had a position of opposition to same-sex marriage at the last election campaign and I will continue to maintain that position for the remainder of the 43rd parliament. I certainly do not intend to change my mind on this issue and, even if I did, it would be after I had given my constituents the chance to vote at a general election. So I say again: I think we should bring on the vote on this issue. We need to have the vote and move on to other issues of importance to the Australian people. I acknowledge that this is an issue about which members of parliament clearly cannot please everyone in the electorate or in the broader Australian community. Some people in my electorate will be very disappointed with my view and others will be very pleased. I fear that we may have to agree to disagree on this particular point. I would like to reassure those who may be disappointed by the position I have taken here today that I will continue to work in support of other efforts to improve outcomes for gay and lesbian people in the Gippsland community, but I will not be supporting changes to the marriage act.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (13:25):  I also rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. My views and opinions on this matter are on the public record. Last week I made abundantly clear that I support marriage equality and outlined my reasons for that support. Today, I thought I would share with the House, and particularly with my electorate, the different views regarding marriage equality in the many emails and letters that I have received in my office—certainly the ones that are printable. I can say with absolute certainty that, and this reflects the view of the earlier speakers, marriage equality is a very divisive issue for many. People have come out of the woodwork—not the closet but the woodwork—in support of their opposition to same-sex marriage and have offered a variety of reasons for their position. However, I would suggest that there is a vast, untapped middle group of Australians who are not particularly passionately for or against same-sex marriage; perhaps they are indifferent or even supportive of change. Certainly, the random surveys have suggested consistently that across Australia about 65 per cent of people are in favour of allowing same-sex-attracted people to marry.


I received letters from a number of churches, one organisation and quite a few individuals. I will give one example, from many in the Greek Orthodox community of St George in Brisbane who passed their view on to me. I am respectful of the views of the Greek Orthodox community of St George—I have been to one of their services. I know that this is a deeply held belief for many people in that community. Other people have written to me, saying that they have a particular problem with the idea of children being raised by either two mothers or two fathers. One individual—I will not name names—goes on to quote studies and give statistics about children who go through their whole life never experiencing a bond with a father or the nurturing characteristics of a mother and the effect this has on children emotionally, mentally and physically.


The reality is that there are many single-parent households in Australia where people do manage to become good, responsible citizens who go about their day-to-day lives. Despite the absence of a mother or father, which might be sad and might even create some emotional baggage for them, they nevertheless get on and do what they can.


We know that Australia is changing. I see in the latest ABS data, which was released late last week, that for the first time the actual number of people in a registered marriage fell below 50 per cent. Even in those modern-day marriages that are occurring, only around 30 per cent—and it is heading south—occur in a church, a mosque, a temple or in some other religious establishment.


Obviously, religious beliefs play a large role in individuals' views, particularly surrounding same-sex marriage. I have received many emails and letters from around the country from people who believe that the Bible and Christianity recognise that marriage is only between a man and a woman and that because marriage has been between a man and a women for centuries it ought to continue in this way. None of these people actually advocated that we should give our leaders the right to have 700 wives, like Solomon, but I do not think that any of our leaders would be willing to take on the challenge anyway. One of the correspondents referred to Genesis 2:18:


Then the Lord God said, ""It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him.""


On the other hand, I have received emails from constituents in my electorate of Moreton who believe same-sex partners should be equal before the law and should be able to marry if they so choose. They ask that the government keep pace with society's expectation of the natural progression of equal opportunity for gay and lesbian couples and urge parliamentarians to achieve this historic reform as soon as possible.


As I have mentioned in this House before, last year I conducted my own survey, receiving 2,270 survey responses. The breakdown from the survey was: 44 per cent supported the current definition of marriage, 53 per cent supported change and three per cent were unsure. This is a challenging topic, and I look forward to engaging with my constituents for as long as possible before it is changed.

"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (13:30):  I rise to oppose totally the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. Once again we are confronted with social-engineering attempts that focus on the self-indulgent homosexual movement's push for same-sex marriage. Society is expected to take for granted claims—driven by bullying tactics of activist minority groups—of discrimination and inequality over marriage,. The question needs to be asked: how are homosexuals discriminated against when no homosexual is denied marriage under Australian law and marital requirements are applicable equally to every Australian resident without exception? Isn't declining to accept marital rules a self-discriminating free choice and not a social or legal discrimination? De facto heterosexual couples are not discriminated against for choosing to refuse marriage, so what is the special obligation or need for homosexuals to marry?


History and culture have never regarded a pair of same-gendered individuals as a co-habiting couple deserving a title or a special minority status. It goes without saying that if marriage were redefined to include same-sex couples, then adult-consenting incest, polyandry, polygamy or group marriage relationships could not be excluded without once again raising issues of discrimination. In 2003, Peter Spriggs wrote an article titled 'What's wrong with letting same-sex couples ""marry?""' printed in issue No, 256 Family Research Council, Washington DC. He said:


… abolishing the option of marital eligibility and legalising same gender marriage would create a special, exclusive, classificatory right no one else has and discriminate the social order. Everyone including homosexuals has the same equal option ""to marry a person of the opposite gender who is of age, sane, not married and not a close relative"".


If our biological make-up is physiologically, functionally and psychologically designed for complementary intimacy with the opposite gender, why do homosexuals possessing heterosexual gender choose biologically incompatible partners?


Homosexuals do have the human right to self-determination, including the right to choose incompatible partners, but where is their right to demand society accept biologically and socially incompatible partner choices for marriage? Since the often publicly expressed words 'right to marriage' do not exist under the Australian Constitution, the claims and demands are flawed and driven by activist propaganda to influence public sympathy for ineligible self-chosen relationships. I think it abominable that gay activists continue to focus on and manipulate civil rights strategies to justify claims for same-sex marriage and keep using discrimination, inequality platforms and homophobic accusations to intimidate politicians and the public. Noted American lesbian and literary figure Camille Paglia quite succinctly argued in 1974: 


Nature exists whether … like it or not. And in nature, procreation is the single relentless  … norm … our sexual bodies were designed for reproduction.


She also argued, surprisingly, that gay men had a right to marry but to a heterosexual woman.


This bill is about future muzzling of churches, requiring primary and secondary schools and even kindergartens to indoctrinate children that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual lifestyles, as well as having two mothers and two fathers is no different from having a mother and father. Marriage is a public, not a private, institution; it is not a socially engineered niche for a minority making up its own terms and conditions that, as has been shown, share absolutely no common values with marriage.


A number of my parliamentary colleagues have come into this place today and spoken in this debate. In fact, one colleague said to me while we were coming up in the lift: 'You've got nothing to lose—you're retiring.' I will put on record, as I have done in the past, that this is not the first time that I have defended the sanctity of marriage. I will continue to do so now and into the future; whether I am a member of parliament or not is irrelevant. I do that because constituents have overwhelmingly supported me in my defence of the sanctity of marriage. As I said at the outset: I oppose this Marriage Amendment Bill in its entirety.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (12:57):  I rise to speak in opposition to the Marriage Amendment Bill. I want to say at the outset that I have the utmost respect for my colleagues who are in favour of this bill, and my esteem for those in my own party is not diminished in any way because I hold a different view from them. I am pleased to be a member of a political party that accepts that this issue is one that involves deeply held and differing views, and so I will put my view on the record again and I will, when the time comes, exercise my right to a conscience vote.


It is a matter of public record that those opposite do not have the same option but are being silenced and held to a party political view. But this is an issue where genuine beliefs and identity are debated in our democracy, and we will find out as a test of this debate how weak or strong we are as a democratic nation. In a way this debate reveals to us our capacity or our failure to live with the tension of sharing the politics, respectfully acknowledging that there are different views and that each view should be heard.


I start out making that claim because it is too often the case in the debate about same-sex marriage that people who are opposed to it are maligned as homophobic, intolerant, bigoted, brainwashed by religious indoctrination or intellectually inferior to those who support it. I want to put on the record that such a view is of itself intolerant and 'otherphobic'. I want to put on the record how proud I am of our federal party, following the victory of 2007, in undertaking the substantive program of legislative change that saw more than 80 pieces of law amended to give lesbian, gay and transgender individual Australians the same practical rights before the law.


Yet I stand in opposition to this proposed law before the House for a number of reasons. Firstly, regardless of culture, time or place, the organic nature of the family unit that is the natural consequence of the union of a man and a woman is the key social unit on which a stable society is built. Marriage is almost universally viewed as a legal and social event that is life generating and is understood to be much more often than not linked to children. Terri Kelleher from the Australian Family Association cites recent research and argues that:


Although the family takes many forms in contemporary Australian society, it is uncontroversial to insist that the ideal family environment is that in which children are raised by their own mother and father. According to a 2004 study, 73.6% of children under 18 in Australia live with their biological parents in intact families. It is a statistic we expect most Australians would applaud: the more children growing up in such circumstances, the better. The institution of marriage is instrumental in realising this ideal, by binding a man, a woman, and their biological children in a stable family unit. 


The Marriage Act defines marriage to mean the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. This is a commonly held position in the broad Australian community. It is a position expressed by our Prime Minister and a position held by many people of many faiths. Many but not all Catholic people like myself and Islamic people, Jewish people, secular humanists and Indigenous families think of marriage in this way. We prize it and we understand it very certainly as a union between a man and a woman. The Chinese Methodist Church in Australia put it this way in their submission to the recent inquiry into this bill:


Marriage is the logical basis of the family … an institution fundamental to the well-being of all of society, not just religious communities.


…   …   …


The preservation of the unique meaning of marriage is not a special or limited interest but serves the good of all. Therefore, we stand all who are of a kin mind in promoting and protecting marriage as the union of one man and one woman.


The Ambrose Centre for Religious Liberty in its recent public submission on the bill cited Frank Furedi in the Australian on 25 and 26 June 2011:


From a sociological perspective, the ascendancy of the campaign for gay marriage provides a fascinating story about the dynamics of the cultural conflicts that prevail in Western society. During the past decade the issue of gay marriage has been transformed into a cultural weapon that explicitly challenges prevailing norms through condemning those who oppose it.


…   …   …


As a result, it does not simply represent a claim for a right but a demand for the institutionalisation of new moral and cultural values.


This brings me to another reality that needs to be acknowledged: too often it is overstated that the broader community is in favour of legislative change to the current definition of marriage. It is a claim that is made here again today, but it does not reflect the community to which I belong. A cursory view of speeches in this place in response to the call from the member for Melbourne to consult with our communities indicates that there are more elected representatives on the record in this place reflecting a majority community opposition to a change than there are elected representatives conveying community support. In short, community support for a change to the definition of marriage is overstated and community opposition is understated. For these reasons, and for several others that I will not have time to speak on, I oppose the bill.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (13:02):  On 17 June 2004 I spoke in this parliament in support of the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which made changes to the Marriage Act 1961. As I said in my speech of 17 June:


A marriage is and should be between a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. The amendments in the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 include those marriages entered into in other jurisdictions and overseas, measures which are important to ensure legal loopholes are not used to introduce social changes which go against the will of the people. Far be it from me to criticise the courts, but where there is a lawyer and there is a loophole, there is a possibility for social change. The other amendments to the Marriage Act will spell out that overseas adoptions cannot be undertaken by persons not in a marriage which is recognised in Australia. These are consistent amendments, consistent both with the social expectations of the people of Australia and the legal definition of marriage.


I will not delay the House further by restating all I had to say at that time.


I acknowledge that there has been a concentrated campaign to change the definition contained in the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry. I respect their campaign and, in particular, the right they have in a free and democratic society to pursue their agenda without the personal persecution that may happen in other countries and societies.


There are two bills aimed towards changing the act to allow same-sex marriage currently before our House. However, I am extremely disappointed at the tone of the argument made by certain individuals and groups alike who are pro-same-sex marriage, making me a target, stating that I am homophobic for not supporting the change. I can assure this House that that is not the case. Whilst I understand the highly charged emotion attached to their argument, I do not agree with the tone from some—and, thankfully, not all.


I do not discriminate against any individual on the basis of gender or sexuality. I choose and always have chosen my employees on the basis of their ability to deliver the outcomes required. I choose my circle of friends on the basis of common interest; sexuality and gender do not come into the argument. I am not going to name names, but I have had in the past, currently have and probably will in the future have employees who are homosexual. But they work for me because they have the capacity to do the job and to deliver the outcomes required. I have a number of genuine friends who are homosexual, both male and female, because we share a common interest across a broad selection of topics. As I said, and I want to restate to the House, I am not homophobic. For those who say I am not reflecting my electorate of Paterson, I also say that is not the case. In my office, we keep an electorate database of all contacts from my constituents. Of all of the emails, phone calls, letters and meetings with my constituents of Paterson in relation to the issue of same-sex marriage, as of last Friday 92 per cent were against same-sex marriage. Only eight per cent were for it. For those who said I should have spent money surveying the whole of my electorate, the feedback from those both for and against has been resounding enough not to warrant further expenditure. I have said to them they are welcome to do a whole-of-electorate survey and provide me with the results, along with details of how the polling was done. Nothing has transpired.


I say to those who have condemned me for my stance that I am representing the majority view of my electorate of Paterson, which also happens to align with my personal view, based on my strong faith values. I recognise and acknowledge the right of any individual to campaign on any issue. I recognise the rights of the individuals to have their own views and their own opinions. But it also should be said that they should respect me and allow me to have my views and my values. They are based on a Christian faith and fortunately, in this situation, they are reflected by the broader consensus of my electorate. Therefore I will be opposing this bill in its entirety.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (13:07):  This debate is about change. It is the next stage in a long line of important policy changes relating to marriage and the status of married people in Australian society. So far as women are concerned, it was only in 1883 that the South Australian Married Women's Property Act began to allow married women to own and dispose of property in Australia. Despite most women gaining the right to vote in 1902, women could still lose their Australian nationality when they married a non-Australian national, even up until the late 1940s. Before 1966, many women had to resign from Public Service positions upon getting married. After campaigns for change, Australian society and its parliaments have changed their views on the status of women, once regarded as mere subjects in the institution of marriage.


As late as 1959, Indigenous Australians did not necessarily have the right to marry a person of their own choosing. The case of Gladys Namagu and Mick Daly in that year demonstrated the arbitrary nature of marriage arrangements in relation to Indigenous Australians. Gladys, an Indigenous woman, and Mick, a white man, were denied the opportunity to marry at first instance. This kind of discriminatory treatment in marriage was to change after much struggle, including the 1967 referendum campaign. Before 1975, we still had a system of fault based divorce in this country. Some would prefer that system to still be in place. I strongly, strongly disagree. Fortunately, so did others, with the effect that in 1975 we saw a more humane approach to the already difficult decision to end a marriage.


To all of those who campaigned and struggled for change in relation to each of these important issues, I say thanks, because those changes have reflected broader societal change. They have corrected injustices and they have made us a better society. Campaigns for racial and gender equality have been hard fought and are ongoing. They have rightly reached into all aspects of law making, including laws relating to marriage. This campaign and this debate will be the same. It is an historic debate which reflects a shift in social expectations. Australia agreed to be bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980, and, in so doing, it recognised the importance of equality before the law and principles of nondiscrimination. There has been a lengthy campaign for law reform to reflect these basic premises in the ensuing decades and it continues today. After winning the 2007 election Labor pushed on with reforms which saw around 85 Commonwealth laws changed to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. I am proud that we did. Last year Labor's national policy platform was changed to support amendments to the Marriage Act which would ensure equal access to marriage under statute for all adult couples, irrespective of sex, who have a mutual commitment to a shared life. I am speaking in support of marriage equality today to give effect to those statements. I will be voting in favour of marriage equality in the bill before us and I hope that other members of my party will do the same. I simply believe that voting for marriage equality is the right thing to do.


There will be those who disagree with me. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs and I have listened to the witnesses who have come before the inquiry into the bill. Strong views have been put against the bill. I have found them, in the final analysis, to be unconvincing. On this occasion votes against marriage equality may prevail, but I know that this debate will not end merely because debate on one piece of legislation ends. It will continue in society until equality, including equality in marriage, is achieved regardless of sexual preference.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (13:11):  I rise to fiercely defend the status quo in relation to this bill. Change for the sake of change is simply a waste of human endeavour. All of us are constrained in society by the mores of that society popular at the time, and any change that is sustainable is change that is well thought through and necessary. None of the aforementioned are required for change to the Marriage Act. The Marriage Act clearly states, as you are all aware and as has been heard ad nauseam, marriage is between a man and a woman for life to the exclusion of all others. It is the perfect world. Of course, it is the perfect environment for the propagation, raising and teaching of children to sustain the society that we have and enjoy today and that some of us fiercely defend.


There are others in the community, sadly, who would have change ad nauseam. The slightest suggestion by one minority group in society that tomorrow ought be different from today is listened to, splinter groups are formed, lobby groups are formed and suddenly we, who maintain the status quo, are encouraged to feel as though we are second-rate citizens because we do not believe in the particular popular 'ism' of the day.


I am proud to be a stick-in-the-mud if that is what I am to be categorised as. I have no hesitation in accepting that couples, multiples or whatever may live together and choose whichever particular sexuality they desire, but at the end of the day any domestic relationship is just that. It is enjoyed by members of our society in a free society. What they do not have the opportunity to enjoy is declaring themselves equal in every respect to a couple that is a man and a woman living together to the exclusion of all others for life; therefore, they are not married. If couples wish to lament the fact that they cannot be married because they are a same-sex couple or living in a polygamous arrangement, so be it; such are the constraints at law in our society today and so they ought to be. I was much heartened to hear a member of the government today express so much good sense when the member for Robinson came into this place and expressed her point of view, firmly espousing that she would not be changing her point of view, because she thought it was right. I too believe that my point of view is right and that the definition of marriage ought remain.


There are many other definitions of relationships. I have some here. We have polygamy, and most of us know about it. It encompasses both a man with multiple wives in polygamy and also polyandry, which is one wife with multiple husbands living in a domestic relationship. We have polyamory, a de facto type of marriage where both partners have more than one partner. And then we have polyfidelity, which is an expanded monogamy. All of these arrangements exist in our society today and no-one loses a great deal of sleep over that. But none of those aforementioned relationships can consider themselves to be married. For the sake of those couples who do live as man and wife, a male and a female, to raise children in an environment which is most popular and stable in our community today, they ought not to be shown disrespect or denigrated by giving the same legal definition to all of those other domestic arrangements.


I state my case. I firmly believe in maintaining the status quo and that any debate in regard to changing the Marriage Act is such a waste of time in this place because there are so many other vitally important issues to be debated.

"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (13:16):  I support the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 that has been proposed by the member for Throsby and supported by others. Like many members, I have taken many points of view from amongst my constituents and have consulted in relation to the issues and I think it is fair to say, as everyone would be familiar with, that there are many strong points of view right across the spectrum on this issue. But ultimately for me as a member of parliament and as an individual this is a matter of discrimination against same-sex couples that I believe the parliament should remedy. Same-sex couples should not be denied the ability to marry if they should choose to do so.


The bill amends the Marriage Act 1961 to address this issue by amending the definition of marriage from 'husband and wife' to 'two people'. Importantly, it does not place an obligation on a minister of religion or a marriage celebrant to marry same-sex couples if they should not wish to do so. The bill simply seeks to remove discrimination and to advance equality in our society. It is important, as the member for Throsby indicated in introducing the bill, to note that marriage has changed over the years. We no longer have betrothals and dowries, a wife's vow of obedience or the prohibition of certain interracial or interreligious marriages. Times change and it is important that the legislature change with them. Ending discrimination does not take away someone's rights; it establishes equal rights for members of our community.


Labor, I would submit, has a very proud history of fighting for rights and ending discrimination. That is one of the reasons that I am a member of the Labor Party and the Labor movement, although I have enormous respect for the diversity of views on this issue amongst the members of the Labor Party. When one looks at the history of the Labor Party, it established the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and in the last term of this parliament Labor amended 85 separate pieces of legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. Australia is not acting alone on this matter either. Ten countries and even more jurisdictions now allow same-sex marriage. Although I do respect, as I have said, the different views in relation to this matter, the Labor movement has always fought for equality and justice and I believe that this sits within that tradition.


As for many other members, this is also a matter relevant to my own family and extended family. I cannot and will not contemplate support for discrimination against persons whom I care for. Should members of my family or my friends wish to solemnify their same-sex relationship by seeking to become married, I have respect for that. For the people for whom I care and have regard, I as a member of parliament but particularly as a member of my family cannot support discrimination let alone in the way that I construct the current arrangements discriminate against the rights of same-sex couples to marry. For those reasons, in brief, I do support the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 and am happy to have my support on the record.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-06-25,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (13:20):  I have spoken in the past on the issue of same-sex marriage and I intend to remain consistent in both the tone and content of my contribution here today. I am opposed to same-sex marriage but I recognise that there are very strongly held views to the alternative and I acknowledge that this issue does have the potential to become quite divisive in the wider community.


In relation to the tone of the debate, I take my lead from the previous speaker. I think his contribution was very respectful in tone and I think that is the manner in which the debate should be held. It is my intention to participate in this debate along those lines and to listen to both sides. As I said, I think there is a real risk of this debate becoming very divisive in the community. I think some, particularly some on the Left, have deliberately used inflammatory language, portraying people who do not support same-sex marriage as being somehow bigoted and homophobic. I think that is terribly unfair and not the way we should allow this debate to develop.


On the weekend, there was a great example of how this debate should be pursued when the Nationals had their state conference in Bowral. A motion on this very issue was narrowly defeated, but it was a very mature and constructive debate. It is fair to say, perhaps, that a lot of the younger members of the party were advocating change, but I do not think same-sex marriage is an issue which neatly divides on the basis of age or any other basis.


I have had the chance to ask a lot of people in my electorate for their views and I have often been surprised by their comments and the level of passion they have about this issue. Many people are quite ambivalent about this issue and think that there are far more important issues for this parliament to be considering at this time in our history. However, there are others, on either side of the debate, who have very passionate views. I understand that. I am not trying to belittle the issue. But it is fair to say that a significant number of people who contact me on this issue want us, in this parliament, to focus on other things. That is what brings me to my conclusion—that I am not sure how much longer we should continue to have this debate. The issues have, I believe, been well and truly canvassed both in this place and in the broader community and surely it is time to bring on the vote. Bring on the vote and let us see where we stand on this issue. Get a clear indication of where we, the 43rd parliament, stand on this issue and then move on to the other issues which people in the community regard as being of greater importance to their lives at this time.


In relation to the substance of the issue, I do support the recognition of legal rights within same-sex relationships but I do not support the proposed changes to the Marriage Act. I think that is the only politically consistent position and the only position of integrity I can take, because it is the position I took to the people of Gippsland at the last general election. Importantly, that position is also entirely consistent with the broader view of my party. We took a position of being opposed to same-sex marriage to the voters at the last election and we are consistent in the application of that policy position in a very open and transparent manner. There have been no surprises in relation to the view of the Nationals and my own personal view. If we wanted to adopt a different position, I think it would be incumbent upon us to take that back to the people who elected us in the first place.


I think that stands in stark contrast to this Prime Minister and her breach of trust on the carbon tax. This Prime Minister explicitly ruled out introducing a carbon tax prior to the last election, yet only weeks or months later she had a change of mind. But she did not take it back to the people of Australia. That is where this Prime Minister and her fundamental breach of trust have caused so many problems for the current government. I think this issue is the opposite of the approach I have taken—I took a position to the people of Gippsland and I am going to be consistent with it. That is the openness and transparency I think you need to show as a member of parliament. If we are going to restore community confidence in the integrity of our democratic system and restore faith in the parliament and the people who serve here, this is a very important principle to remember and one I intend to adhere to whenever it is humanly possible to do so.


As I said, I had a position of opposition to same-sex marriage at the last election campaign and I will continue to maintain that position for the remainder of the 43rd parliament. I certainly do not intend to change my mind on this issue and, even if I did, it would be after I had given my constituents the chance to vote at a general election. So I say again: I think we should bring on the vote on this issue. We need to have the vote and move on to other issues of importance to the Australian people. I acknowledge that this is an issue about which members of parliament clearly cannot please everyone in the electorate or in the broader Australian community. Some people in my electorate will be very disappointed with my view and others will be very pleased. I fear that we may have to agree to disagree on this particular point. I would like to reassure those who may be disappointed by the position I have taken here today that I will continue to work in support of other efforts to improve outcomes for gay and lesbian people in the Gippsland community, but I will not be supporting changes to the marriage act.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (13:25):  I also rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. My views and opinions on this matter are on the public record. Last week I made abundantly clear that I support marriage equality and outlined my reasons for that support. Today, I thought I would share with the House, and particularly with my electorate, the different views regarding marriage equality in the many emails and letters that I have received in my office—certainly the ones that are printable. I can say with absolute certainty that, and this reflects the view of the earlier speakers, marriage equality is a very divisive issue for many. People have come out of the woodwork—not the closet but the woodwork—in support of their opposition to same-sex marriage and have offered a variety of reasons for their position. However, I would suggest that there is a vast, untapped middle group of Australians who are not particularly passionately for or against same-sex marriage; perhaps they are indifferent or even supportive of change. Certainly, the random surveys have suggested consistently that across Australia about 65 per cent of people are in favour of allowing same-sex-attracted people to marry.


I received letters from a number of churches, one organisation and quite a few individuals. I will give one example, from many in the Greek Orthodox community of St George in Brisbane who passed their view on to me. I am respectful of the views of the Greek Orthodox community of St George—I have been to one of their services. I know that this is a deeply held belief for many people in that community. Other people have written to me, saying that they have a particular problem with the idea of children being raised by either two mothers or two fathers. One individual—I will not name names—goes on to quote studies and give statistics about children who go through their whole life never experiencing a bond with a father or the nurturing characteristics of a mother and the effect this has on children emotionally, mentally and physically.


The reality is that there are many single-parent households in Australia where people do manage to become good, responsible citizens who go about their day-to-day lives. Despite the absence of a mother or father, which might be sad and might even create some emotional baggage for them, they nevertheless get on and do what they can.


We know that Australia is changing. I see in the latest ABS data, which was released late last week, that for the first time the actual number of people in a registered marriage fell below 50 per cent. Even in those modern-day marriages that are occurring, only around 30 per cent—and it is heading south—occur in a church, a mosque, a temple or in some other religious establishment.


Obviously, religious beliefs play a large role in individuals' views, particularly surrounding same-sex marriage. I have received many emails and letters from around the country from people who believe that the Bible and Christianity recognise that marriage is only between a man and a woman and that because marriage has been between a man and a women for centuries it ought to continue in this way. None of these people actually advocated that we should give our leaders the right to have 700 wives, like Solomon, but I do not think that any of our leaders would be willing to take on the challenge anyway. One of the correspondents referred to Genesis 2:18:


Then the Lord God said, ""It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him.""


On the other hand, I have received emails from constituents in my electorate of Moreton who believe same-sex partners should be equal before the law and should be able to marry if they so choose. They ask that the government keep pace with society's expectation of the natural progression of equal opportunity for gay and lesbian couples and urge parliamentarians to achieve this historic reform as soon as possible.


As I have mentioned in this House before, last year I conducted my own survey, receiving 2,270 survey responses. The breakdown from the survey was: 44 per cent supported the current definition of marriage, 53 per cent supported change and three per cent were unsure. This is a challenging topic, and I look forward to engaging with my constituents for as long as possible before it is changed.

"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2012-06-25,"



Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (13:30):  I rise to oppose totally the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. Once again we are confronted with social-engineering attempts that focus on the self-indulgent homosexual movement's push for same-sex marriage. Society is expected to take for granted claims—driven by bullying tactics of activist minority groups—of discrimination and inequality over marriage,. The question needs to be asked: how are homosexuals discriminated against when no homosexual is denied marriage under Australian law and marital requirements are applicable equally to every Australian resident without exception? Isn't declining to accept marital rules a self-discriminating free choice and not a social or legal discrimination? De facto heterosexual couples are not discriminated against for choosing to refuse marriage, so what is the special obligation or need for homosexuals to marry?


History and culture have never regarded a pair of same-gendered individuals as a co-habiting couple deserving a title or a special minority status. It goes without saying that if marriage were redefined to include same-sex couples, then adult-consenting incest, polyandry, polygamy or group marriage relationships could not be excluded without once again raising issues of discrimination. In 2003, Peter Spriggs wrote an article titled 'What's wrong with letting same-sex couples ""marry?""' printed in issue No, 256 Family Research Council, Washington DC. He said:


… abolishing the option of marital eligibility and legalising same gender marriage would create a special, exclusive, classificatory right no one else has and discriminate the social order. Everyone including homosexuals has the same equal option ""to marry a person of the opposite gender who is of age, sane, not married and not a close relative"".


If our biological make-up is physiologically, functionally and psychologically designed for complementary intimacy with the opposite gender, why do homosexuals possessing heterosexual gender choose biologically incompatible partners?


Homosexuals do have the human right to self-determination, including the right to choose incompatible partners, but where is their right to demand society accept biologically and socially incompatible partner choices for marriage? Since the often publicly expressed words 'right to marriage' do not exist under the Australian Constitution, the claims and demands are flawed and driven by activist propaganda to influence public sympathy for ineligible self-chosen relationships. I think it abominable that gay activists continue to focus on and manipulate civil rights strategies to justify claims for same-sex marriage and keep using discrimination, inequality platforms and homophobic accusations to intimidate politicians and the public. Noted American lesbian and literary figure Camille Paglia quite succinctly argued in 1974: 


Nature exists whether … like it or not. And in nature, procreation is the single relentless  … norm … our sexual bodies were designed for reproduction.


She also argued, surprisingly, that gay men had a right to marry but to a heterosexual woman.


This bill is about future muzzling of churches, requiring primary and secondary schools and even kindergartens to indoctrinate children that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual lifestyles, as well as having two mothers and two fathers is no different from having a mother and father. Marriage is a public, not a private, institution; it is not a socially engineered niche for a minority making up its own terms and conditions that, as has been shown, share absolutely no common values with marriage.


A number of my parliamentary colleagues have come into this place today and spoken in this debate. In fact, one colleague said to me while we were coming up in the lift: 'You've got nothing to lose—you're retiring.' I will put on record, as I have done in the past, that this is not the first time that I have defended the sanctity of marriage. I will continue to do so now and into the future; whether I am a member of parliament or not is irrelevant. I do that because constituents have overwhelmingly supported me in my defence of the sanctity of marriage. As I said at the outset: I oppose this Marriage Amendment Bill in its entirety.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-06-25,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:44):  Eddie Koiki Mabo and a group of Murray Islanders challenged almost two centuries of legal doctrine when they asked the courts to recognise them as the rightful owners of their land in the Torres Strait. On 3 June 1992, the High Court found the group did have native title and that it was a right that extended to all Indigenous Australians. Seven High Court judges declared:


… the Meriam people are entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands …


Eddie Mabo died of cancer on 21 January 1992, just five months before this historic High Court ruling, which would change Australian land law. The judgment was so historic because it completely overturned the idea of terra nullius—land belonging to no-one—and said that native title survived in many places even though the land had been taken by the Crown. Today the ruling continues to play an important part in islander identity. On 3 June 2012, Aboriginal people across the nation marked 20 years since this historic decision, which changed the lives of Aboriginal people and the ties they had to their land.


The Wiradjuri tribe reside in my electorate, with large populations being in Griffith, Leeton, Narrandera, Wagga Wagga and West Wyalong, as well as a number of other places. Based on 2011 census data for the division of Riverina, there were 6,866 people identified as Indigenous persons in my electorate. On Saturday, 26 May, I attended the Sorry Day commemoration for Wagga Wagga and was moved by the words of local elder and chair of the Wagga Wagga Aboriginal Elders Group Isabel Reid. I would like to share with you her eloquent words, which were superbly delivered:


Sorry Day remembers the separation of Aboriginal children from their families and communities


Taking Aboriginal children away began in 1869 and possibly before then.


It was a Government policy of the past.


Today is the day to remember because it is important to remember the past.


But we do have to move on and make a future for ourselves and our children.


It is up to us as Aboriginal people to do this.


It is our time now to make things better.


Once we had no say but now we have.


We need to take all the opportunities available to us.


I'll do what I can but it is up to each person to make their own personal choice.


Life goes on.


The hurt does go away in time.


We need for you to be proud of everything that Aboriginal people have achieved.


Be positive.


If I can do it, so can you.


I was part of the Stolen Generations but I had to carry on.


I am very proud of what Aboriginal people have achieved and happy that so many are doing well.


You can do well too.


You can build on the work of the people like William Ferguson, Jack Kinchella, Helen Grosvenor, Selina and Jack Patten.


They began the struggle.


It's up to us all not to let them down.


They had the hard row and we need to make sure we keep on going and do the best we can.


The past is history.


Tomorrow is a mystery.


But today, is a gift. That is why they call it the present.


Brilliantly said, Aunty Isabel.


On 2 December 2011 the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Senator Nigel Scullion, and I had the pleasure of visiting an establishment which encompasses the words of Aunty Isabel. Tirkandi Inaburra Cultural and Development Centre is an Aboriginal community-run centre offering Aboriginal boys aged between 12 and 15 years a culturally based residential program aimed at reducing future contact with the criminal justice system by strengthening the boys' cultural identity, self-esteem and resilience. The centre houses 16 boys at a time, and the boys stay at the centre on a voluntary basis for three to six months. Whilst at the centre, the boys engage in educational, sport, recreational, life, living skills and cultural activities which have all been designed to incrementally develop each participant's skills and abilities. Schooling is providing on site by the New South Wales Department of Education and Training. The centre is located on a 780-hectare property between Coleambally and Darlington Point.


The name 'Tirkandi Inaburra' means 'to learn to dream' in the Wiradjuri language. Tirkandi Inaburra delivers a culturally based residential program aimed at strengthening cultural identity and resilience and empowering its young participants to reach their full potential in life. Boys who live in communities located between the Lachlan and the Murray and between Balranald and the western side of the Blue Mountains are eligible to apply to come to the centre. The boys choose to attend the program, they choose to stay and they choose to comply with the rules. The centre, well managed by Anthony Paulson—who is a wonderful role model—is having an encouraging impact on the lives of those who have been mentored there. Most of the boys who attend this centre thrive once they rejoin their communities, and it is places such as this which Senator Scullion believes should be replicated across this wide brown land and which would make the late Eddie Mabo very proud. It is a positive place where people are given responsibility for the path their lives can take.


All fair-minded Australians want to see respectful and adequate recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As I said in my inaugural speech:


Nationally, we need to do more for Aboriginal health to increase the life expectancy and standard of living of our first nation people.


Help needs to go where it is most needed. Words are one thing, but genuine, desperately needed action is essential to enable better health outcomes, more affordable housing and greater job prospects for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in rural and remote areas, including the Riverina. The money is there to achieve such goals; it just needs to be allocated appropriately so it does not end up in the pockets of bureaucrats and lawyers.


A recent account of where we are failing was shown by the ABC's 7.30 a few days shy of Mabo's 20th anniversary. On Wednesday, 30 May ABC reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna was on the streets in a small Aboriginal community which has been plagued by abuse and violence. Less than 10 hours drive from Sydney, the world's seventh richest city, lies a community racked with despair, beset by strife of the worst imaginable kind. For decades the mission and its people went unnoticed and ignored until Marcus Einfeld, the then President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, crossed the divide in 1987 and launched an investigation into the living conditions and the state of housing inside Toomelah in northern New South Wales. What he found shamed the nation and forced people in high places to take action.


Dirt roads were paved, housing was built and a sewerage system was put in place. Yet despite tens of millions of dollars worth of government funding which was poured in over two decades, and despite the involvement of dozens of government agencies, the problems which plagued Toomelah of yesteryear are still sadly all too present today. According to elder Glynis McGrady, children as young as five are being raped and girls as young as nine were prostituting themselves at truck stops for cigarettes and money. Sexual abuse is rife in the community, yet little is done. How could we let this get so bad?


The federal member for Parkes, a colleague of mine, Mark Coulton, said the ABC's 7.30 shows exactly what is happening in Toomelah. He has been working with both Toomelah's local government and the Nationals state member Kevin Humphries to come up with a solution which will benefit the community. In 2009 the government closed down the Community Development Employment Projects, exacerbating social problems and intensifying the high level of unemployment. The Community Development Employment Projects, an initiative to assist unemployed Aboriginal people, was hugely popular in Toomelah and created local employment opportunities for residents. The community has unfortunately experienced a number of ill effects since the closure of the program.


The area holds a special place in my federal colleague's heart and he wants to see the right thing done for these people. He said: 'The people of Toomelah are good people. The community has a special place with me. Something needs to be done. I know most of the residents personally. I am very fond of them. They are wonderful people, but they are living in a very troubled society. While it may be fair for adults to choose how they live, the children that live within that community have no say as to the poverty they are brought up into and they need their safety secured.'


In his inaugural speech to the New South Wales parliament on 30 May 2007, Kevin Humphries said:


I would say, and am saying, sorry—sorry for what we have not achieved for Aboriginal people in this country. It is 40 years since the recognition of Aboriginal citizenship and I can honestly say we have a very long way to go in closing the gaps that exist between the lives of indigenous and non­indigenous people. I am committed to growing and supporting leadership within our Aboriginal communities, growing community capacity and encouraging all people to take advantage of what mainstream Australia has to offer.


However, with bad examples come good ones. On 27 March this year, as part of the fly-in fly-out inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, I had the pleasure of visiting Milikapiti, a community on Melville Island off the coast of the Northern Territory. The health centre staff on the island include Raelene Mungatopi, who won the 2010 award for excellence from the Northern Territory health service for having the highest blood testing rates in Australia for diabetes diagnosis and ongoing management. Another Aboriginal health worker, Miriam Daniels, has achieved one of the highest child immunisation rates in any Aboriginal community in the Territory. Both women noted that they had taken up training on the urging—might I say insistence—of Raelene's aunty but were finding it hard to find successors because of the need to go to Darwin for training.


The Aboriginal people in my electorate of Riverina are another example of people moving on and making a future for themselves and for their children. In the past few months I have attended openings of Aboriginal medical centres in the larger centres of Griffith and Wagga Wagga and was lucky enough to tour these great new facilities. The Aboriginal people are taking what they have and moving forward to establish a better future for the younger generations. On Friday, 8 June the Griffith Aboriginal Medical Service was officially opened. The service is dedicated to the entire community and currently has 6,500 clients on its books, with 2,000 being Aboriginal people. The Griffith Aboriginal Medical Service was established in July 2000 and now has a centre of which it should be rightly proud.


The original organisation was a community controlled health service in name only, having no resources to provide healthcare services to Aboriginal people within the region at the western end of the Riverina electorate. In May 2004 the Aboriginal medical service received funding from the Department of Health and Ageing. In 2009 the Aboriginal medical service received capital works funding to purchase and refurbish an existing building and to relocate existing services into a more spacious facility. The relocation occurred in November 2011. On the first day of the following month, Senator Scullion and I toured the new centre in Jondaryan Avenue. I was most impressed with the outlook of this new centre, which not only featured services for medical treatment but represented a safe place for teenagers, new mothers, struggling community members and anyone in need of help of any kind to go. The centre offers a comprehensive range of services to assist the community. 


A similar service is being established in Wagga Wagga. The Riverina Medical and Dental Aboriginal Corporation clinical services building opening took place on Friday, 18 May. I acknowledge the government's investment in these important Aboriginal facilities. We all need to help close the gap—today, tomorrow and into the future—not just for Aboriginal Australians but for all those whose home is girt by sea.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:55):  I pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land upon which we meet and also to the Jagera, Ugarapul and Yuggera people of my electorate in South-East Queensland. I want to express my sympathy to Bonita, the wife of Eddie Mabo, his immediate family, extended family and friends. 


In his famous Redfern speech on 10 December 1992, then Prime Minister Paul Keating described the Mabo judgment as one of the practical building blocks of change. He said it did away with what he described as the 'bizarre conceit' that this continent had no owners prior to European settlement. He went on to say that the Mabo judgment had established a fundamental truth which laid the basis for justice—and that justice is deserving of recognition today, 20 years later. We have so much more to do in closing the gap.


But the lie of terra nullius—that no-one actually occupied the land—was done away with by those brave judges on the High Court of Australia. It showed the High Court at its best and I pay tribute to Sir Anthony Mason and those in the majority who supported Eddie Mabo and his co-litigants. Those litigants had the courage and determination to bring a claim which did away with the falsehood and reveal the fact that our Indigenous brothers and sisters were occupiers of the land well before white settlement took place. Eddie Mabo was not alone. There were a number of people who went with him on that journey—people like David Passi, James Rice and others. I pay tribute to all of them for what they did. 


Eddie Mabo was born on 29 June 1936 on Murray Island. He always believed Murray Island belonged to him and his family. He had a variety of different occupations—assistant teacher, deck hand, gardener and groundsman, for example—but he never really believed that he did not own the land and he refused to accept it. When he mentioned that to members of academia in Townsville, who later became his friends, and discovered the concept of terra nullius, that white people did not believe he owned the land, he was incredulous and his great passion was aroused. It took 10 years of litigation to get it to the High Court. As with other great figures of history who died before they saw the final outcome of their efforts—such as FDR, the great US President, and John Curtin in Australia, both of whom died before World War II was concluded—tragically, Eddie Mabo died five months before the High Court handed down the historic Mabo decision which expelled the notion of terra nullius from Australian law and paved the way for a new era of justice and native title legislation.


I pay tribute to Paul Keating and the then Labor government, who had the courage and conviction to prosecute the case for the Native Title Act, which came into being in 1993. It was developed in partnership with Indigenous communities. It was not imposed; it was done with consultation, collaboration and cooperation. The Native Title Act was not uncontroversial. There was a lot of fear, loathing and misinformation spread by those who would foster and create division in our community. Fortunately, however, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed this legislation. The economy was not destroyed, society did not break down and the world did not come to an end, but justice rained down like a river. A whole series of cases emerged as a result of the Mabo decision and native title legislation. I am pleased the government has seen fit to streamline the process, to bring down the reforms we saw in 2009, which gave the Federal Court greater control of native title mediation, and increase the number of consent orders or determinations from 11 in 2008-09 to 24 in 2010-11. I am pleased the federal Attorney-General, on the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision on 31 May, pointed that out in her speech. There are few people whose lives have touched Australians and will continue to touch them as Eddie Mabo's did, fighting injustice, racism and inequality. His life deserves to be recognised. It was recognised in a telemovie and has been recognised in the history books and on ABC's Four Corners. On a daily basis, his judgment is quoted throughout the country. We pay tribute to him for his courage, his conviction and his belief in the rightness of his case and the cause of justice. For that we pay tribute and we say farewell to a great figure of Australian history, a great Australian and a great man.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:01):  I rise to support the marking of the 20th anniversary of the passing of Eddie Mabo. There are moments in each of our lives which define who we are and what we stand for, moments which may even determine our destiny. The significance of those moments may sometimes not become clear until much later. The story of a nation is similarly marked by such moments where an event or even a speech may change the course of its people. When a moment in the life of an individual determines both the character and destiny of the individual and that of a nation, the moment is indeed profound. For Eddie Koiki Mabo that moment was his realisation in 1974 that his ancestral lands had been taken from him and were owned by the Crown. That moment changed his life and the spirit of a nation.


Eddie Mabo's name has since been ingrained in Australian history. Joined by Sam Passi, David Passi, Celuia Mapo Salee and James Rice, Eddie Mabo began his crusade to have his lands returned to their rightful owners—the Meriam people. His determination gave inspiration to his people. Born in 1936, Eddie Mabo was a Meriam man from Mer island, better known as Murray Island, in the Torres Strait. His mother died very early in his life and he was raised by his maternal Uncle Benny. At 19 years of age he was exiled from his homeland, not even allowed to return to see his dying father.


He settled in Townsville and soon established a reputation as an activist or, as others would describe him, an agitator. He attended protest marches and would sit in white-man-only bars waiting to be served. As the member for Barton reminded us in his Lionel Murphy Memorial Lecture delivered at the Australian National University on 7 September 2011, Lionel Murphy in a 1982 judgment had this to say about agitators:


If he is an agitator, he is in good company. Many of the great religious and political figures of history have been agitators and human progress owes much to the efforts of these and many who are unknown.


Indeed Australia owes much to Eddie Mabo. He too was an agitator. His decade-long battle ended on 3 June 1992 when justice was restored. Sadly, Eddie Mabo did not live to hear the High Court verdict. He died five months earlier, in January 1992. His life, however, was recognised when he was granted an Australian Human Rights Medal and perhaps more so by the Australian newspaper in 1992 naming him Australian of the Year. His legacy, however, is not what he achieved for himself but what he achieved for his people and for Australia. 


Both as individuals and as a nation our identity is determined by what we do. We are judged harshly for our wrongdoings and praised for what we do right. Since white settlement in Australia, the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians has been the cause of some of our greatest failures and national shame. Conversely, the relationship has delivered some of Australia's greatest moments—for example, the 1967 referendum, Gough Whitlam on 16 August 1975 pouring a handful of dirt into the hands of Vincent Lingiari symbolising the return of their lands, Cathy Freeman carrying the Australian flag around Sydney Olympic Stadium at the 2000 Olympics, Paul Keating's Redfern speech in December 1992, Kevin Rudd's apology to the stolen generation, and of course the High Court Mabo case. All left proud images imprinted in the hearts and minds of those who were there at the time or who in their own way shared in the moment. On each of these occasions the international community looked on with praise and admiration. Indeed they were all moments of national pride.


In rejecting the notion of terra nullius in a six-one judgment, the High Court handed down a verdict which signalled three very important messages: firstly, that no person and no government is above natural justice; secondly, that our justice system is there for all; and, thirdly, that all people are equal in Australian law. The 1992 High Court decision was a personal victory for Eddie Mabo, a cultural victory for his people and a national victory for Australian identity. Not everyone, however, was pleased with Eddie Mabo's crusade. His grave site in Townsville was desecrated and he was reburied on Murray Island.


The High Court decision was not, however, a panacea for the complex problems facing Australia's Indigenous people. There is no better recognition of that than the government's Closing the Gap statement. The merits of the Northern Territory intervention policy continue to be disputed. What is not disputed, however, is that the underlying problems which led to the intervention must be addressed. As Eddie Mabo's wife, Bonita Neehow, recently said in an interview published in the Australian newspaper on 2 June 2012: 'The alcohol, drugs and sexual abuse problems poisoning indigenous communities are still there.'


In the Lionel Murphy Memorial Lecture that I referred to earlier, the member for Barton addressed the disadvantage that exists throughout Indigenous communities. As with the mainland Indigenous people, the permeation of white culture into the Torres Strait Islands over the past 200 years has forever changed the once peaceful existence they enjoyed. A new culture has set in and neither white nor Indigenous culture offers the solutions we are looking for. We need new approaches, we need to look outside of our normal thinking and we need people like Eddie Mabo.


I have spoken about Aboriginal and Indigenous disadvantage in this country on many other occasions and I will not go into it in detail other than to say this: it is a problem that has confronted governments of this nation now for at least 50 years. It is a problem where governments have been well intentioned in their efforts to address that disadvantage over the 50 years and I am aware of governments and ministers from both sides of politics who have worked in earnest to try and reduce that disadvantage. The statistics we see today, and again I understand there was some more commentary in the daily papers today, are still of concern to us all. The disadvantage that exists is still widespread and still a cause of embarrassment and national shame for the people of Australia. We do need to look for alternative solutions and we do need to recognise that until we find those solutions that disadvantage will continue.


I close by making reference briefly to the judges that were sitting in the High Court case at the time: Justice Mason, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh. Justice Dawson was the dissenting judge. All of the others were in general agreement with the verdict. It should be noted that it is of credit to them that, after so many years, they too recognised the injustice that had been perpetrated on the Indigenous people of Australia by denying them their rightful entitlement to the land on which they lived. Vincent Lingiari, whom I referred to earlier, was perhaps one of the first Indigenous people to try and lay claim to the lands from which he came and that is why, as I said earlier, Gough Whitlam poured a handful of dirt into his hands. It was symbolic of the land that was returned to his people at the time.


But that was returned under different circumstances. It was not as profound as the Mabo decision, which in fact recognised the title that existed for the Indigenous people because they had previously lived off the land. For the judges who handed down the decision it would not have been an easy decision to have made at the time given that there was 200 years of history, and not only in this country. Perhaps it is even more extensive if you go to other Commonwealth nations. Yet they made this decision knowing full well what the consequences of it would be, and I commend them for the justice they handed down on the day. I commend Eddie Mabo and his colleagues for taking up the fight on behalf of their people.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:11):  Imagine the moment in 1974 when, talking with his friends, Eddie Koiki Mabo realised his land was owned by the Crown, not by him and his people. Noel Loos and Henry Reynolds recall: 'Koiki was surprised and shocked.' He had kept saying, 'No way, it's not theirs. It's ours.' It would turn out to be one of the most significant moments in Australian history. From then to the historic High Court decision of 3 June 1992 Eddie Mabo showed us that a deeper appreciation of Indigenous Australia is the responsibility of all Australians and that the recognition of Indigenous history and culture and the challenges it faces is not an optional part of being Australian but is essential to who we are.


Eddie Mabo Day, 3 June, helps us identify, acknowledge and celebrate all Indigenous Australians and their contribution to our nation. It is a critical part in the process of reconciliation. But it is also a great moment to celebrate the life of a great Australian and to remember a man of extraordinary vision, warmth and intelligence. Eddie Mabo's story is one in which I think Australians can take great pride. I think it is also a reminder that Australia is at its strongest when we remember the stories of Indigenous Australians.


One of the books that have made an impression on me is Stories of the Ngunnawal, a collection of stories of the local Ngunawal people. To me those stories reflect that so much of what Eddie Mabo was facing was also being faced here in the Canberra region. There had been suggestions in the middle of the 20th century that the last remnants of the Ngunawal people had gone. An article in the Canberra Times in 1985 said, according to the writers, it was felt the last remnants of the Aboriginal tribes of this area were gone by 1911 with the deaths of Ned and Lucy Carroll at the Edgerton mission station. The article went on to say that reports of the extinction of the Ngunawal people had been greatly exaggerated 'according to a very much alive survivor, Mr Tom Phillips of Kambah'. Tom Phillips was indeed a character. One story has him being arrested while walking naked in the Namadji area. Apparently he was called into a courtroom with a blanket wrapped around him. The judge said, 'What are you doing, walking around like that? You can't walk around like that in front of people.' Mr Phillips said to the judge: 'Mate, I'm an Aboriginal. I was born naked, and I'll walk around how I want. I'm not going to sit here and listen to a man sitting there with a dead carcass on his head telling me I can't do this and that. I'll walk around how I want.'


Another great survivor of the Ngunawal people is Auntie Agnes Shea. She is a familiar sight to those of us who attend conferences in Canberra because she is one of the most frequent of those to welcome attendees to country. Auntie Agnes tells the story about how as a young girl she did not learn the Ngunawal language. She says: 'The elders decided that, if we kept using it at home, we wouldn't do it intentionally but automatically we'd use it if we were off down the town or somewhere, and it would get us into trouble.' By that, she means the risk of being taken away from her parents. Auntie Agnes says: 'So they forbade us to use our language, for our protection, and that's how we came to lose so much of the Ngunawal language. I was around seven or eight then.'


It is a great source of pride to me to be a federal member representing the land of the Ngunawal people, to be able to remember some of their stories and recognise the great strength of Indigenous Australia and that we are greater as a country thanks to that Indigenous heritage. This is, I think, broadly recognised by both sides of parliament, on this the 20th anniversary of the Mabo judgment, but it was not always thus. The Attorney-General, in a speech on 6 June, reminded her audience of some of the history of the Mabo case. She said:


Disenfranchised by the Bjelke-Petersen government, Eddie Mabo, David and Sam Passi, Celuia Salee and James Rice, all from the Meriam people, set themselves the seemingly improbable task of literally creating a space for indigenous rights to land and waters—where previously this had been said to be an impossibility.


She pointed out that the Bjelke-Petersen government dogmatically attempted to legislate away any prospect of native title, that Tim Fischer had said that native title was unnecessary as 'dispossession of Aboriginal civilisation was always going to happen' and that Hugh Morgan said that the High Court had thrown property law into chaos and 'given substance to the ambitions of Australian communists and the Bolshevik left for a separate Australian state'. She pointed out that Tim Fischer said, 'Mabo has the capacity to put a brake on Australian investment, break the economy and break up Australia—a brake, a break and a break-up we can do without,' and that John Hewson, after native title legislation passed the parliament in December 1993, described it as a 'day of shame'. John Hewson said:


The Coalition is totally opposed to this piece of legislation. It is bad legislation. It will prove to be a disaster for Australia. It goes way beyond the High Court. It introduces inequities into the Australian system. It consciously sets out to divide the Australian nation and there is only one thing you can do with bad legislation and that is to throw it out.


The reason I quote all these statements made two decades ago by a business leader and prominent members of the opposition is that they remind us of what the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has called the divide in Australian politics between the reformers and the wreckers. It reminds us that almost every reform that is now held dear in Australia was not gotten through bipartisan agreement but was hard fought for at the time. Great reform never comes easy. It is often opposed at the moment at which it is fought for. But in so many cases Australia can now look back to great Labor reforms like native title with a sense of pride. I believe it will be so for the great Labor reforms like a price on carbon, a mining tax, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Broadband Network.



Reconciliation works best in Australia when it is not just self-flagellatory reconciliation—although there were great wrongs done—but when it also operates with a sense of pride. The moment in the 2000 Olympics when Cathy Freeman won gold and the moment when she lit the Olympic flame were moments that did as much for the cause of reconciliation as perhaps all the honourable speeches of this kind. There was the moment when Gough Whitlam poured sand into the hand of Vincent Lingiari and Lingiari said to him, 'We're all mates now.' These sparks of positive reconciliation are a great source of pride for all Australians, and it is with a great sense of pride that I remember the 20th anniversary of the Mabo judgment.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-06-25,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (17:20):  Sunday, 3 June marked the 20th anniversary of the Mabo native title High Court decision. As the Prime Minister stated some weeks ago, this was a sublime moment in the life of our nation. The Mabo decision, as it has affectionately become known, had a profound impact on Indigenous land rights, extinguishing the terra nullius myth that had been in existence for so many years. It is a case that has gone down in Australia's legal and cultural history as a turning point in our nation's story. When the High Court of Australia handed down its historic judgment, it accepted the claim of Eddie Mabo and other claimants that their people had occupied the island of Mer for hundreds of years before the arrival of the British. This was a landmark decision, finding that the Meriam people were entitled, as against the whole world, to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands in the Murray Islands. The decision overturned the idea that Australia was terra nullius—a land belonging to no-one—at the time of colonisation. It had profound implications for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land rights movement nationally. 


It was wonderful earlier this month to see so many people celebrating the 20-year anniversary of the High Court's decision, and it gives me great joy that this landmark case will always have a special place in our nation's heart. This year the ACT Torres Strait Islanders Corporation, established in 1996, hosted the ACT celebration of Mabo, and they have been doing that for a number of years. The corporation organised a high-level event in partnership with the National Museum of Australia during National Reconciliation Week. The event, held at the National Film and Sound Archive, was attended by special guest speaker Gail Mabo, the eldest daughter of Eddie and Bonita Mabo.


I was disappointed not to be able to attend, as parliament was sitting at the time, but I believe the day was a wonderful success and the celebrations befitted this momentous day. Last year I did manage to attend the events, held here at Parliament House. Again it was a lovely day of celebration and, most importantly, of dance and culture. There were Thursday Islanders and Torres Strait Islanders from all over Australia, primarily from the Sydney community but also from the ACT community. They joined together in song and dance and also to reminisce about their stories. It was a wonderful event last year and it is a pity I had to miss it this year.


We should always continue to mark this day because the decision acknowledged and affirmed what Indigenous people have always known—that this land was not empty or vacant but was occupied by a proud and peaceful people who had lived on this land and as part of this land for many thousands of years. To really get a grasp of their place as Australia's first people, you only have to consider recent archaeological finds in Arnhem Land, where rock art has been carbon dated to around 28,000 years ago. This is one of the earliest examples of rock art in the world, and its significance should not be underestimated. When we consider the Mabo decision in this context, why would we not want to celebrate having one of the oldest cultures on this earth? 


The Prime Minister at the time of the Mabo decision was Paul Keating, and he recognised Mabo for what it was—not a burden, not a problem, but an opportunity. He noted that Mabo was a historic decision, one which Australia could make into a turning point and the basis of a new relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. He said:


The message should be that there is nothing to fear or to lose in the recognition of historical truth, or the extension of social justice, or the deepening of Australian social democracy to include Indigenous Australians.


These words continue to be relevant today, 20 years on. Prime Minister Keating reminded us that the big things, the great things in Australian politics, never come easily, yet we should embrace them and accept them as part of our nation's continuing history.


To me the Mabo decision reinforces Australia's cultural diversity and our differences, which we should celebrate and not conceal. Several years ago, I had the opportunity to visit Thursday Island, in the Torres Strait, as part of a tour I was doing with Australian Defence Force Cadets. There is a naval cadet unit there and it is incredibly popular with the kids—and I am talking about the school-age cadets here—because it links into their culture. As we all know, this is a great fishing and great pearling culture. There is a huge and very strong connection with the sea. The beauty about this Navy Cadets facility was not only that they had linked into that culture and strong tradition but also that they were introducing the kids to the notion of discipline and the naval tradition. So they got the best of both worlds in many ways: the history and tradition of the Navy plus the history and tradition of their own people, the Thursday Islanders. The kids loved going to the Navy Cadets after school once a week. It was very strongly supported by the community, particularly the schoolteachers. We were up there to launch the new cadet facilities and it was a great event. From memory, it was a very hot event but it was a wonderful event.


What really underscored the diversity for me during that visit was that I had the opportunity to go to the graveyard. I love visiting graveyards and I was given a tour by one of the people who lived on Thursday Island. I am not sure whether many people are aware of this but I was told that, when they bury their dead, they bury them in the traditional way and then they wrap the headstone with plastic or ribbons or something to mark the fact that a person has only recently been buried. After 12 months, I understand that they open up the grave and open the coffin—all the families are there—and that is designed to set the soul free. They then close it up and the person is truly on the way to the next life.


It is a really strong tradition that I had never heard of or seen beforehand and it underscored the diversity of Australia's people. During that visit I went to Thursday Island and after that I went to Bamaga, where there is a completely different Indigenous community. I then went to Nhulunbuy, which also has a different Indigenous community. I was then up at the Coburg Peninsula for another event and, again, there was a completely different Indigenous community. So the diversity, tradition, cultural strength and richness of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are extraordinary, and decisions like the Mabo case underscore and recognise that.


The 20th anniversary of Mabo celebrates one of our great and proud achievements as a nation. It righted a wrong and set our nation on a new course towards greater acceptance and reconciliation and, as I said, a greater understanding and appreciation of its diversity. I commend the anniversary.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (17:28):  It is timely that we today discuss this issue because tomorrow night at the State Library of New South Wales, the Mitchell Library, there will be a public lecture in the Metcalfe Auditorium about an Indigenous Australian who, way back in the 1920s, after a period in Italy and other parts of the European continent, went to Britain alone in support of Indigenous rights in this country, and there has been a recent publication about that.


Of the sustained opposition to this change, Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, commented:


It is a narrative that reveals a fundamental lack of understanding about the importance of land and country to our very soul. And it's a message that demonises those standing firm rather than acknowledging their need to do so.


His hope, he said:


… is that we all realise the role we can play in changing the narrative and that mutual respect must underline the story.


In 1993 the Native Title Act brought to Australia recognition of the nation's traditional owners in response to the High Court decision made on 3 June 1992 that Eddie Koiki Mabo's 10-year fight for recognition as custodian of the Meriam people's lands gave lie to the legal notion of terra nullius. Of course, we have seen dramatisations of his fight on our television sets over the last month or so, and there has been a plethora of recognition events.


To those familiar with the concept of recognition of traditional ownership of land, the actions of other countries belied notions that the nation would be taken over by heathens, that houses would be plundered and that the agriculture and resource industries would grind to a halt. That is certainly the rhetoric that accompanied the Mabo decision and the government action to put it into effect. It is worth noting that as early as the 1820s the United States of America had signed a formal agreements with Indian traditional owners, that in the 1840s the Waitangi Treaty was signed by over 500 Maori chiefs and the British crown and that in the 1870s the Canadian government and the First Nations of the Canadian prairies sought to establish agreements to ratify native rights and provide compensation to the First Nations. These actions, taken over 100 years previously, formed the genesis of legal recognition of the land rights and sea rights of Indigenous Australians.


In the 20 years since the Mabo judgment, we have seen the highs of 1992 and the lows of the Yorta Yorta's situation along the New South Wales-Victoria border. The decision on the latter ruled that 'traditional links had been washed away by the tides of history'. Since this time we have witnessed a changing landscape in the recognition of Indigenous people's rights and customs. The traditional connections between Indigenous people and the land, the sun, the sea and the sky are very difficult for many Australians to understand. However, we have progressed to coexistence from the rhetoric of the extinguishment of rights. Indeed, although financial and other compensation is small relative to their profits, the resource sector has in the main turned full circle and acknowledged rights in cooperation with stakeholders. The sector has been reaching agreements providing economic resources, employment and education benefits to those in need. Most importantly, the process now gives traditional owners a place at the table to decide the future of their lands. For too long historic claims that will help reconciliation in Australia have been litigated to death. This trench warfare has cost millions of dollars, which have been squandered on legal and consultancy fees. Actions designed by state governments and large corporations determined to drag out negotiations until the National Native Title Tribunal was forced to mediate were enhanced by the Howard government's 10-point Wik plan, which included forcing parties to negotiate, essentially with a gun at their head—take it or leave it.


Fortunately, these attitudes are changing. State governments recognise the need to ratify agreements to facilitate development and allow for much needed investment in infrastructure. Likewise, the decision to mediate via the High Court is welcome. The return to the Yorta Yorta case by the former Victorian Attorney-General Rob Hulls and the resolution of the outstanding issues surrounding the case symbolise the change of attitudes by the states and, slowly, the legal profession. The former managing director of CRA, which is now Rio Tinto, is quoted as saying:


'I think there was a point … when business started saying to government, 'Catch up! We're out here doing business … and your attitudes are actually inhibiting us from moving forward', …


In New South Wales alone, at the end of the last financial year, there were 26 registered claimant applications, and another three were registered this year. I will briefly touch on one of those claims as an indication of the long-term benefits of the claims in assisting the education on reconciliation of the broader Australian community. The recent registration of claim by the Gomeroi people, who are broadly situated between Singleton, Moree and Walgett, ensures their place at the table for negotiations with developers, governments and resource companies. The research compiled by the New South Wales native title service provider NTSCORP is deserving of a thesis in itself. This research included: the compilation of over 60,000 family trees, the largest known genealogy of Indigenous Australians ever undertaken; over 1,000 interviews; researching archived newspapers and school, farm and police records since 1830; the purchase of hundreds of birth, marriage and death certificates at $30 a pop from the state government; meetings conducted throughout the state; and negotiations with key stakeholders. This research, which was led by Dr Ken Lum and his team, was recently subject to analysis by Debra Jopson in the Sydney Morning Herald. It acknowledges that people who live over a radius of 100,000 square kilometres have a shared past, rituals, kinship and—importantly—identity. It also recognises that Aboriginal history and interactions in southern parts of Australia have the same gravity and meaning as those of their northern brothers and sisters. Early settlement, massacres and enforced separation from families killed neither their spirit nor their connection with the land from where they come. In passing, I commemorate the people who every year have remembrance events around the Appin Massacre in my electorate.


This claim by the Gomeroi people gives hope to those in other parts of New South Wales who are working towards recognition. It was recently announced by the Attorney-General that the federal government will provide increased funding and anthropological grants to research on native title claims. This is welcome news. We need to ensure that researchers are able to provide solid evidence of kinship, cultural activities and connections to the country. It is crucial not only for claiming land title but also for our country's own story.


Research measures include clarification that capital gains tax and income tax payments will not apply to native land title agreements and improvements to increase the flexibility of Indigenous land use. This will ensure that the work which Eddie Mabo started over a chat and a sandwich on a bench with Henry Reynolds will not have been in vain.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (17:36):  I am pleased to resume my remarks about the recent report of the Corporations and Financial Services Committee into the collapse of Trio Capital. When I was interrupted I was speaking on the topic of Mr Jack Flader and the other international masterminds who appear to have been involved in perpetrating this fraud on Australian investors. The committee in its report has called on the regulators—ASIC and APR—and the Australian Federal Police to urgently reopen an investigation into likely criminal activity in this matter. The committee has also urged ASIC to fund the liquidator of Trio to continue its factual investigation into where the money went, particularly the assets of the ARP growth fund. It seems beyond dispute that the money went offshore to the British Virgin Islands, but the final outcome is still, to the committee's great surprise, not known with certainty.


In my remarks I will focus in particular on the ARP growth fund, which was one of the funds operated by Trio Capital and one of the funds in which a significant number of my constituents lost large amounts of money. In fact, the tragedy of this affair is that a large number of Australians invested the entire balance of their self-managed superannuation fund into the ARP growth fund. The average balance was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and there are people who have lost more than that as a result of the fraudulent conduct of those responsible for the operation of Trio.


The history of this affair was canvassed in some detail in the committee's report. As late as 2008 an audit of the ARP growth fund as well as other managed investment schemes which were part of Trio's range of products continued to certify the accounts as giving a true and correct report of the financial position of the fund. The principal asset of the ARP growth fund was a derivative contract held by a company in the British Virgin Islands. It turns out that the auditor did not independently verify the existence of the company or the value of the contract. Indeed, a key factual question is whether the principal underlying asset of the ARP growth fund ever existed and had value. The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority gave evidence to the committee that it believes that the contract did exist but that its value fell to zero as a result of the collapse of the US investment bank Bear Stearns in the global financial crisis in 2008. I am sceptical as to the validity of that explanation. The committee heard other evidence—which I personally found persuasive—that if the contract did exist then it would have retained value as a consequence of the fact that the liabilities of Bear Stearns were assumed by JP Morgan, another US investment bank. In its report, the committee indicates that it is not satisfied as a factual matter that the value of the contract did fall to zero or, at the very least, the committee is not satisfied that the conclusion drawn on this matter by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is founded on reasonable investigation.


Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill, as you would know, given your other capacity as chair of the corporations and financial services committee, just last Friday when the other relevant regulator, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, appeared before the committee, we further canvassed the question of whether the underlying derivative contract purportedly held by the ARP Growth Fund or a company some steps down the chain of companies ever in fact existed. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission expressed its view that the contract did exist but that the value of the contract fell to zero. 


Again, I want to place on record that I am not satisfied that that has been demonstrated and I am not satisfied that the liquidator has been able to reach a conclusion on that matter, and nor am I satisfied that the matter has been demonstrated to a degree which is persuasive to those of my constituents and others who lost money in the ARP Growth Fund. I note that this is one of the matters that the liquidator of Trio, PPB, intends to further investigate and reach a conclusion on, should it be the case that ASIC follows the recommendation of the committee and provides further funding to PPB to allow it to continue its factual investigation.


One of the grave difficulties that this case and this episode presents is the fact that Australians have been treated differently in relation to the loss of substantial amounts of money. Last year the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Bill Shorten, announced $55 million of compensation to some of those who were defrauded in the Trio matter. The basis for that compensation is under a longstanding provision of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. Under part 23 of that act, it is open to the minister to determine that compensation is payable in the event of fraud or theft suffered by an APRA regulated superannuation fund. It is not contested that the law confines the availability of that remedy to APRA regulated superannuation funds. It is not contested that self-managed superannuation funds are not APRA regulated superannuation funds. That is clear on the face of the legislation. However, one of issues which the committee gave consideration to and made a recommendation about is the factual circumstances in which most of those who lost money in the ARP Growth Fund came to put their money into that fund. In the main, they came to put their money into that fund through moving their money out of a previous investment vehicle, the Professional Pensions Pooled Superannuation Trust.


The Professional Pensions Pooled Superannuation Trust was a vehicle controlled by a financial adviser named Mr Paul Gresham, who operated extensively on the north shore of Sydney, as well as in other areas. It is through his activities that many of my constituents lost money. Mr Gresham had his clients put their money into the Professional Pensions Pooled Superannuation Trust. For many years it operated perfectly satisfactorily, putting money into a range of legitimate and reputable investment vehicles. What happened some time between 2003 and 2005 is that Mr Gresham advised his clients to move their money out of the PPPST—the Professional Pensions Pooled Superannuation Trust—and into another vehicle, the ARP Growth Fund. We now know, including from the terms of an enforceable undertaking obtained from Mr Gresham by the Australian Securities Investment Commission, that Mr Gresham was a co-conspirator in the circumstances in which a collection of fraudsters took control of a pre-existing reputable funds management business and renamed it Trio. We now know that Mr Gresham was in on this from the start.


The relevance of this is that the Professional Pensions Pooled Superannuation Trust is a vehicle which is regulated by APRA. It is an APRA regulated superannuation fund, and persons investing in a pooled superannuation trust, as a matter of law, can have the benefit of the same remedy under part 23 of the act as has already been made available by the minister to others who lost money in the case of Trio. Therefore, one of the recommendations in the report is that the minister, his department and the relevant agencies give careful consideration to the factual circumstances in which investors who were originally in the Professional Pensions Pooled Superannuation Trust then moved their money into the ARP Growth Fund. The government should give careful consideration to whether that factual circumstance is itself an act of fraud or theft which caused those investors to lose their money. On the basis of the material the committee was able to consider and on the basis of the facts which have been agreed by Mr Gresham in the enforceable undertaking which he has given to ASIC, it appears that there may be a good basis for reaching the view that the very act on the part of Mr Gresham of inducing his clients to move their money from the Professional Pensions Pooled Superannuation Trust into the ARP Growth Fund was itself an act of fraud or theft and an act the victims of which were persons who had their money in an APRA regulated fund. That matter was canvassed in a recommendation of the committee's report, and I would urge the minister, his department and the relevant agencies—including APRA—to have careful regard to.


In addition to recommendations which are directed to the extent possible at trying to deal with the extraordinary loss suffered by many Australians in the Trio Capital affair, the committee has also made a broader set of recommendations directed towards policy changes to reduce the prospect of a similar fraud being perpetrated in the future. In particular, we have recommended that consideration to be given to rules requiring managed investment schemes to disclose the details of their underlying investments. In the case of Trio, what happened was that people who were saving money for retirement through the vehicle of a superannuation fund—either an APRA regulated fund or a self-managed super fund—had their money placed into highly risky offshore investment vehicles. It is very hard to understand the basis on which any financial adviser could recommend that the entirety of an individual's retirement savings be invested in an offshore vehicle in a notorious jurisdiction such as the British Virgin Islands when the underlying asset of that vehicle is a highly complex derivative contract. That appears to be a highly risky strategy, and if the underlying details of the investment of a managed investment scheme were required to be disclosed—for example, in the product disclosure statement—it would make it somewhat more difficult for such an ill-advised investment to occur. It would be no panacea, but it may be of some assistance.


Thee Trio collapse has been a sorry episode, and many Australians have suffered as a result. There is more work to do to clean it up. I commend the committee's report to the parliament.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (17:49):  I rise to speak on the first interim report of the Climate Change, Environment and the Arts Committee's inquiry into Australia's biodiversity in a changing climate. This is an update on the progress of the inquiry itself. We do have additional site inspections planned. I am a  member of the committee and we are continuing to gather evidence. I want to focus briefly on one of the areas that is covered in this first interim report, and that is the committee's visit to Western Australia and particularly into the area of my electorate. Of course, most of us know that the south-west of Western Australia is one of Australia's 15 biodiversity hotspots. It is actually one of only two internationally recognised biodiversity hotspots. Margaret River forms the western extremity of the Gondwana Link—a landscape connectivity project creating wildlife corridors from the south-west forest to the Great Western Woodlands, 1,000 kilometres to the east.


The committee met with the South West Catchments Council, South Coast National Resource Management, the Cape to Cape Catchments Group and Greening Australia. The committee inspected Lake Cave just to have a look at the declining water levels in the cave itself. We saw some excellent examples of riparian rehabilitation along the Boodjidup Brook. Many of the issues the committee heard about during the meetings and site visits related to changing rainfall patterns and the serious issue—and this is an extensive issue in the south-west—of phytophthora dieback. The impact of changing rainfall patterns, reduced groundwater and tree decline are all associated with this very extensive disease in the south-west of WA. 


We also focused in these case studies in biodiversity management on site visits to the Tasmanian midlands and Central Plateau. Several groups focused on the adaptation taking place and that is what we see in the evidence we took about changing rainfall patterns, fire regimes, threats from pests and diseases, cooperative biodiversity conservation approaches and the importance of research and citizens' science. In the New South Wales Snowy Mountains region we heard about feral horse management in the Australian Alps, and that had a great impact on me. There was a constant reference to feral pests and weeds—the real practical issues. The issue of feral pests and weeds is a very serious one. I read recently where weeds cost the Australian economy $4.6 billion per annum. Feral pests and weeds is not a minor issue; farmers spend $1.5 billion themselves to control about 1,000 agricultural weed species. There are another 2,300 weed species that are a problem for natural ecosystems.


The work that this committee will continue to do is a very important body of work on case studies in biodiversity management and Australia's biodiversity in a changing climate. I am looking forward to what will come ahead and working on concluding the committee's work and the recommendations for our final report. I commend this document, Case studies on biodiversity conservation: Volume 1, to the House and I commend not only the secretariat for the work it is doing but also the committee for its application in looking at this issue.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (17:54):  I rise to support the report before us today, Case studies on biodiversity conservation: volume 1. I congratulate all those members of the committee who have made a contribution to the debate. On 2 June 2011, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts commenced an inquiry into biodiversity in a changing climate in relation to nationally important ecosystems. The committee's terms of reference highlight certain areas which I will not go over tonight. I congratulate the secretariat on the work that they have done and the programs that they put together for us. To date, my knowledge in this area has increased immeasurably.


I will not concentrate on the committee's visit to south-west Western Australia, as I was unable to attend those inspections and hearings. But, according to all the feedback I received from those members who did attend, what they learned there was of great importance and significance and has contributed to the overall understanding of the issues that the committee is looking at.


On 30 January this year the committee visited the Tasmanian midlands and the central plateau. The visit focused on sites where climate change is having an impact on terrestrial biodiversity. The committee visited three distinct sites and undertook inspections in rather challenging conditions. It was an extremely wet day, which made it difficult to see the sites in the way we probably would have had the weather not been quite so inclement. But we were provided with insight into the diversity of the Tasmanian landscape and the challenges both common and unique to each of the regions.


We looked at the revegetation of the midlands. The midlands is one of the 15 national biodiversity hot spots. This was quite evident from our visit, as were the impacts of climate change and the changes in rainfall. Tasmania has a Mediterranean climate, receiving most of its rain in winter, but there has been a decrease in rainfall which has had an impact on the climate in that area. It causes significant problems for the environment and for agriculture. It brought home to me both the importance of the climate and preserving biodiversity and the impacts on agriculture in the area. Every single sector of that community is affected by the changing climate.


We visited the Grassy Hut site and received briefings from Greening Australia and the Tasmanian Land Conservancy. We received very important information covering a range of issues such as revegetation, threats to the region and mitigation of threats. We visited the Central Plateau and saw the pencil pines. We saw how there had been changes in the subalpine area above 800 metres and what this has meant for those pines. We inspected some pencil pines near Pine Lake boardwalk and received briefings from the DPIPWE officers on the threats to that species. 


One of the sights which impacted on me enormously was when we looked at the miena cider gums. We could see how these small- to medium-sized woodland trees of the Central Plateau were dying and their sensitivity to the effects of the drought. It was quite an important issue. We concentrated on the changes in rainfall patterns and we learned about and observed the dramatic decline in those cider gums. There were many other aspects of the environment, local ecological systems and biodiversity which have been affected by that decline. We learned about the fire regimes in alpine ecosystems and the threats from pests and diseases and how they change with a change in the climate—changes in rainfall and changes in temperature. On a number of occasions, we learned about invasive—

Ms HALL:
  Prior to the division I was talking about the impact of invasive species as a result of climate change. Our visit to Tasmania also highlighted the importance of the need for research into ways that we can ameliorate the threat of climate change. Our visit to Tasmania illustrated that climate change is a threat to biodiversity and it showed that we really need to take the issue seriously. The central plateau is one of the few alpine areas in Australia and our visit illustrated to us just how vulnerable alpine ecosystems are.


We followed our visit to Tasmania with a visit to the New South Wales Snowy Mountains region, and that was in February this year. We had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the Great Eastern Ranges Initiative and local partner organisations from Kosciuszko to the coast. We were able to see firsthand the unique biodiversity of Australia's alpine regions. It was very interesting to note that the area of ground covered with snow is covered for more than 60 days, but that is predicted to reduce to 38 or 50 days. The last couple of snow seasons have demonstrated that the snow is starting later and thawing earlier. This has an enormous impact on that environment.


One of the threatened species that was mentioned was the pygmy possum. Its habitat has been impacted by the change in climate and the fact that the period of snow is reducing. It is not only the animals that we can see, like the pygmy possum; there are also microscopic insects in the water and the impact that the early thawing of snow has on the survival of some of the insects. It is a whole-of-ecosystem impact. It really is reducing the biodiversity of that area. The rising snow line shows that climate change is having an enormous impact on that area. Climate change in the alpine area of the Snowy Mountains is also impacted on by invasive species. The previous speaker mentioned feral horses, but there are also foxes and they are moving further up the alpine, which is creating problems.


I would like to quickly touch on the Great Eastern Ranges Initiative. That is a wonderful initiative. It is a partnership initiative between the private sector and the national park. It looks at things in a new way. What we saw when we visited the Great Eastern Ranges Initiative was unique. It should be used as a model for other areas. There is a strong need for more research and a strong need for looking at ways of counteracting invasive species such as feral animals and environmental weeds. Community attitude can play a very important role in the development of this. The visit to the alpine area of the Snowy Mountains really highlighted the issues that are important in relation to biodiversity and climate change within the alpine environment.


The other area I would like to very quickly touch on is our visit to Sydney Olympic Park. It was quite exciting to see the number of young people at the park and what had been done there to preserve biodiversity. We saw the extensive ecological restoration and remediation program. There was public engagement at all levels. Once again, that is a model for what can happen when you have a commitment to actually improving biodiversity. It also shows how community engagement is very important. On the day we visited Sydney, we went to the Australian Botanical Gardens at Mount Annan. We were given a brief and visited the site. The aspect of that visit that I found most exciting was the seed bank. We learnt about the activities of the seed bank and saw how important it is in preserving biodiversity. I think all members of the committee were very impressed by the research that is taking place at Mount Annan. We saw the Wollemi pine, which as we all know is a living fossil, and it provided an interesting case study that demonstrated the importance of revegetation and protecting areas to help species survive.


This is a very important inquiry being undertaken by the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, and I think that the information it brings to light will be critical to both this government and governments to come. I highly recommend the case study in biodiversity management to the House. I encourage members to read it and then to read the final report of the committee.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (18:25):  I rise to speak briefly on the statement I made to the House on behalf of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts in presenting the interim report of the inquiry into Australia’s biodiversity in a changing climate which we have been carrying out. I thank the member for Shortland for the comments she has just made; as a member of the committee she along with the other committee members has contributed to the committee's work, and there has been a good team effort in trying to get through the work before us.


I thank very much all of the people who made submissions to the committee. To date, we have received about 83 submissions, and they are all very good quality submissions. In fact, I have learnt a lot just from reading them. I think that the inquiry is very worth while given the number of very well researched and professional submissions we have received.


In the course of the inquiry, it became absolutely clear to me that Australia's marine and terrestrial biodiversity has already sustained considerable damage—some of it permanent—which has mostly been caused by human activity. It is also clear from the extensive evidence presented to the committee that climate change is adding to the damage and presenting additional risks. On current future climate forecasts, the damage is very likely to escalate. 


Much of our flora and fauna is unique to Australia, but many of Australia's endemic plant and animal species have already been lost. Regardless of the causes of climate change, a changed climate will change the natural environment. The consequences of changes to our natural environment will be widespread, with impacts on agricultural production, human and animal health, and national economic drivers such as productivity and tourism. I will try to refer to each of those in the brief time that I have left to speak. 


Agriculture relies on several factors, including water supply, soil nutrients, the timing of rainfall and temperature changes. Agriculture is also very much affected by natural environmental factors such as pollination, disease, pest plants, and animal and insect infestation, and all of those factors are in turn influenced and dependent on climate, weather and biodiversity. That is the crux of the matter: all of the things that affect agriculture are in turn impacted by biodiversity, and we sometimes take our biodiversity for granted. The reality is that it is fundamental to human life as well as to animal and insect life.


In essence, a healthy natural environment increases agricultural productivity; conversely, extreme weather events, low rainfall, restricted water supplies and pests and pesticides can add significantly to agricultural costs and lower productivity. In a similar way, physical and mental health outcomes are also directly linked to a healthy environment. Poor food quality, the use of pesticides, disease, pollution, the general environment and extreme temperatures have all been directly linked to health outcomes.


Australia's natural environment is unique, with many places listed as internationally recognised environmental assets. Their environmental value also makes them major tourist destinations. Tourism is an important economic driver and in some regions underpins the local economy. Natural pristine environments have become international drawcards for Australia. From the science available to date, biodiversity changes can have catastrophic consequences for Australia's best-known iconic sites, including Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef, although many other areas are equally at risk.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (17:49):  I rise to speak on the first interim report of the Climate Change, Environment and the Arts Committee's inquiry into Australia's biodiversity in a changing climate. This is an update on the progress of the inquiry itself. We do have additional site inspections planned. I am a  member of the committee and we are continuing to gather evidence. I want to focus briefly on one of the areas that is covered in this first interim report, and that is the committee's visit to Western Australia and particularly into the area of my electorate. Of course, most of us know that the south-west of Western Australia is one of Australia's 15 biodiversity hotspots. It is actually one of only two internationally recognised biodiversity hotspots. Margaret River forms the western extremity of the Gondwana Link—a landscape connectivity project creating wildlife corridors from the south-west forest to the Great Western Woodlands, 1,000 kilometres to the east.


The committee met with the South West Catchments Council, South Coast National Resource Management, the Cape to Cape Catchments Group and Greening Australia. The committee inspected Lake Cave just to have a look at the declining water levels in the cave itself. We saw some excellent examples of riparian rehabilitation along the Boodjidup Brook. Many of the issues the committee heard about during the meetings and site visits related to changing rainfall patterns and the serious issue—and this is an extensive issue in the south-west—of phytophthora dieback. The impact of changing rainfall patterns, reduced groundwater and tree decline are all associated with this very extensive disease in the south-west of WA. 


We also focused in these case studies in biodiversity management on site visits to the Tasmanian midlands and Central Plateau. Several groups focused on the adaptation taking place and that is what we see in the evidence we took about changing rainfall patterns, fire regimes, threats from pests and diseases, cooperative biodiversity conservation approaches and the importance of research and citizens' science. In the New South Wales Snowy Mountains region we heard about feral horse management in the Australian Alps, and that had a great impact on me. There was a constant reference to feral pests and weeds—the real practical issues. The issue of feral pests and weeds is a very serious one. I read recently where weeds cost the Australian economy $4.6 billion per annum. Feral pests and weeds is not a minor issue; farmers spend $1.5 billion themselves to control about 1,000 agricultural weed species. There are another 2,300 weed species that are a problem for natural ecosystems.


The work that this committee will continue to do is a very important body of work on case studies in biodiversity management and Australia's biodiversity in a changing climate. I am looking forward to what will come ahead and working on concluding the committee's work and the recommendations for our final report. I commend this document, Case studies on biodiversity conservation: Volume 1, to the House and I commend not only the secretariat for the work it is doing but also the committee for its application in looking at this issue.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (17:54):  I rise to support the report before us today, Case studies on biodiversity conservation: volume 1. I congratulate all those members of the committee who have made a contribution to the debate. On 2 June 2011, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts commenced an inquiry into biodiversity in a changing climate in relation to nationally important ecosystems. The committee's terms of reference highlight certain areas which I will not go over tonight. I congratulate the secretariat on the work that they have done and the programs that they put together for us. To date, my knowledge in this area has increased immeasurably.


I will not concentrate on the committee's visit to south-west Western Australia, as I was unable to attend those inspections and hearings. But, according to all the feedback I received from those members who did attend, what they learned there was of great importance and significance and has contributed to the overall understanding of the issues that the committee is looking at.


On 30 January this year the committee visited the Tasmanian midlands and the central plateau. The visit focused on sites where climate change is having an impact on terrestrial biodiversity. The committee visited three distinct sites and undertook inspections in rather challenging conditions. It was an extremely wet day, which made it difficult to see the sites in the way we probably would have had the weather not been quite so inclement. But we were provided with insight into the diversity of the Tasmanian landscape and the challenges both common and unique to each of the regions.


We looked at the revegetation of the midlands. The midlands is one of the 15 national biodiversity hot spots. This was quite evident from our visit, as were the impacts of climate change and the changes in rainfall. Tasmania has a Mediterranean climate, receiving most of its rain in winter, but there has been a decrease in rainfall which has had an impact on the climate in that area. It causes significant problems for the environment and for agriculture. It brought home to me both the importance of the climate and preserving biodiversity and the impacts on agriculture in the area. Every single sector of that community is affected by the changing climate.


We visited the Grassy Hut site and received briefings from Greening Australia and the Tasmanian Land Conservancy. We received very important information covering a range of issues such as revegetation, threats to the region and mitigation of threats. We visited the Central Plateau and saw the pencil pines. We saw how there had been changes in the subalpine area above 800 metres and what this has meant for those pines. We inspected some pencil pines near Pine Lake boardwalk and received briefings from the DPIPWE officers on the threats to that species. 


One of the sights which impacted on me enormously was when we looked at the miena cider gums. We could see how these small- to medium-sized woodland trees of the Central Plateau were dying and their sensitivity to the effects of the drought. It was quite an important issue. We concentrated on the changes in rainfall patterns and we learned about and observed the dramatic decline in those cider gums. There were many other aspects of the environment, local ecological systems and biodiversity which have been affected by that decline. We learned about the fire regimes in alpine ecosystems and the threats from pests and diseases and how they change with a change in the climate—changes in rainfall and changes in temperature. On a number of occasions, we learned about invasive—

Ms HALL:
  Prior to the division I was talking about the impact of invasive species as a result of climate change. Our visit to Tasmania also highlighted the importance of the need for research into ways that we can ameliorate the threat of climate change. Our visit to Tasmania illustrated that climate change is a threat to biodiversity and it showed that we really need to take the issue seriously. The central plateau is one of the few alpine areas in Australia and our visit illustrated to us just how vulnerable alpine ecosystems are.


We followed our visit to Tasmania with a visit to the New South Wales Snowy Mountains region, and that was in February this year. We had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the Great Eastern Ranges Initiative and local partner organisations from Kosciuszko to the coast. We were able to see firsthand the unique biodiversity of Australia's alpine regions. It was very interesting to note that the area of ground covered with snow is covered for more than 60 days, but that is predicted to reduce to 38 or 50 days. The last couple of snow seasons have demonstrated that the snow is starting later and thawing earlier. This has an enormous impact on that environment.


One of the threatened species that was mentioned was the pygmy possum. Its habitat has been impacted by the change in climate and the fact that the period of snow is reducing. It is not only the animals that we can see, like the pygmy possum; there are also microscopic insects in the water and the impact that the early thawing of snow has on the survival of some of the insects. It is a whole-of-ecosystem impact. It really is reducing the biodiversity of that area. The rising snow line shows that climate change is having an enormous impact on that area. Climate change in the alpine area of the Snowy Mountains is also impacted on by invasive species. The previous speaker mentioned feral horses, but there are also foxes and they are moving further up the alpine, which is creating problems.


I would like to quickly touch on the Great Eastern Ranges Initiative. That is a wonderful initiative. It is a partnership initiative between the private sector and the national park. It looks at things in a new way. What we saw when we visited the Great Eastern Ranges Initiative was unique. It should be used as a model for other areas. There is a strong need for more research and a strong need for looking at ways of counteracting invasive species such as feral animals and environmental weeds. Community attitude can play a very important role in the development of this. The visit to the alpine area of the Snowy Mountains really highlighted the issues that are important in relation to biodiversity and climate change within the alpine environment.


The other area I would like to very quickly touch on is our visit to Sydney Olympic Park. It was quite exciting to see the number of young people at the park and what had been done there to preserve biodiversity. We saw the extensive ecological restoration and remediation program. There was public engagement at all levels. Once again, that is a model for what can happen when you have a commitment to actually improving biodiversity. It also shows how community engagement is very important. On the day we visited Sydney, we went to the Australian Botanical Gardens at Mount Annan. We were given a brief and visited the site. The aspect of that visit that I found most exciting was the seed bank. We learnt about the activities of the seed bank and saw how important it is in preserving biodiversity. I think all members of the committee were very impressed by the research that is taking place at Mount Annan. We saw the Wollemi pine, which as we all know is a living fossil, and it provided an interesting case study that demonstrated the importance of revegetation and protecting areas to help species survive.


This is a very important inquiry being undertaken by the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, and I think that the information it brings to light will be critical to both this government and governments to come. I highly recommend the case study in biodiversity management to the House. I encourage members to read it and then to read the final report of the committee.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (18:30):  I am very pleased to speak to the motion which I have moved in support of the memory of the 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team who were murdered in a terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. The motion calls upon the International Olympic Committee to honour the memory of those slain with one minute of silence at the 2012 London Olympic Games. The events of September 1972 have been seared into world consciousness. The Israeli Olympic team attended the Munich Olympics with a delegation of 30—16 athletes, two referees and 12 other delegates including coaches. 


On 5 September 1972 at around 4 am, members of the Black September organisation, disguised as athletes, scaled a fence at the Olympic village and made their way into the apartments housing the Israeli athletes. The terrorists broke into the Israeli accommodation and rounded up sleeping Israeli athletes. Two managed to escape, two were killed and there were nine remaining hostages. The Black September organisation then demanded the release of 234 Palestinians and other nationalities jailed in Israel, together with two radicals in German jails. Israel immediately and steadfastly indicated that it would not negotiate. As negotiations continued during the day, the deadline kept being extended. Meanwhile, the games continued and it was not until some 12 hours after the raid that the games were suspended under mounting pressure. 


The terrorists secured the supposed agreement of the authorities to safe passage them and their hostages to a third country. Unfortunately, in the process of this supposedly occurring, the German authorities chose to intervene and the result was a horrific and absolute disaster. There was a substantial loss of life. In fact, all of the hostages ultimately were killed even though heart-rendingly at one point the media were told that all the hostages had been saved. The sad truth was conveyed some hours later at 3:20 am on 6 September when an Indian journalist announced, 'They are all gone.'


It is important that this horrific event is not forgotten and that is the point of the motion before the House today. For some 40 years the families of those killed in Munich and the Jewish community around the world have been asking the International Olympic Committed to observe a minute of silence at Olympic Games in memory of those killed in Munich. To date this is not a request which the International Olympic Committee has seen fit to accede to. Accordingly, the point of this motion is for the Australian House of Representatives to add to the call for the International Olympic Committee to agree to a minute of silence at 2012 London Olympic Games. 


One of those who has been leading the call has been Ankie Spitzer, the wife of a victim of the attack, Andre Spitzer. Ankie has spearheaded a petition and an internet campaign seeking a minute's silence. Let me quote from some of what she has had to say:


Silence is fitting tribute for athletes who lost their lives on the Olympic stage. Silence contains no statements, assumption or beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret.


The Israeli government, I understand, has also added to the call for a minute's silence at London Olympics. In recent weeks a motion in similar terms has been passed by the Canadian parliament. So to date the International Olympic Committee has declined to facilitate such a memorial, either at past Olympics or at the upcoming London Olympics. The evident reason that the International Olympic Committee has taken this position is due to a concern that such a memorial might alienate certain participants in the Olympic Games. In my view this is not a question of creating division or of opening up old wounds; it is simply a matter of recognising the memory of those who lost their lives in the course of participating in an Olympic event. It is entirely appropriate that this should be acknowledged and recognised at an Olympic games and it is entirely appropriate that the International Olympic Committee should facilitate a gesture that allows the memory of the victims of this terrorist atrocity to be acknowledged and for there to be recognition of this event. Accordingly, I commend this motion to the House.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (18:35):  The second week of the 1972 Munich Olympics was meant to be a joyous week. Having just completed seven days of events, many athletes and spectators looked forward to the completion of this event and the celebration of the closing ceremony. The fifth of September 1972 would shatter the Olympic doctrine:


… to build a peaceful and better world … which requires mutual understanding in a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play … 


 On the night of 4 September 1972, Israeli athletes enjoyed a night out watching a performance of Fiddler on the Roof. That night the head of the delegation, Shmuel Lalkin, denied his 13-year-old son's request to stay at the athletes' apartment. His refusal saved his son's life. At 4.30 on the morning of 5 September, eight terrorists from Black September scaled the two-metre fence with the assistance of unsuspecting athletes and with duffel bags loaded with AKM rifles, Tokarev pistols and grenades attacked the Israeli athletes. What followed would be the blackest day in Olympic history. A sporting event that was meant to embrace diversity and had been shaped over the years by kinship, kindness and solidarity was ripped apart with the brutal cold-blooded murder of—I want to remember them by name—Moshe Weinberg, wrestling coach; Yossef Romano, weightlifter; Ze'ev Freedman, weightlifter; David Berger, weight lifter; Yakov Springer, weightlifting judge; Eliezer Halﬁn, wrestler; Yossef Gutfreund, wrestling referee; Kehat Shorr, shooting coach; Mark Slavin, wrestler; Andre Spitzer, fencing coach; and Amitzur Shapira, track coach. 


Australia as a sporting nation was shocked to its core when the Israeli athletes were murdered in 1972. I remember being outraged at the incompetence of the Olympic officials and the German police. Perhaps their reluctance to acknowledge the 40th anniversary of the massacre is not simply a desire to acquiesce to the organisation of Islamic states; perhaps they do not want to remember their own incompetence. My family is originally from Germany. On this 40th anniversary of this gratuitous violence the German press is reporting that Abu Daoud, the organiser of these murders, was assisted in scoping the Olympic sites in Munich by German neo-Nazis. The reliable German news publication Der Spiegel reported on 18 June that Wolfgang Abramowski and Willi Pohl, two neo-Nazis, assisted Black September with fake passports, weapons and transport, and officials in Germany knew about that collaboration. This cooperation says much about that dead-end of Palestinian nationalism which cannot embrace any compromise or, indeed, any future for their own people.


The 2012 London Olympics marks the 40th anniversary of this massacre. The request for a minute's silence at the London Olympics to remember those massacred at Munich is a simple gesture which would acknowledge the fallen athletes. This request has the support, amongst others, of the Canadian parliament, US congressmen, British politicians and, to their great credit, the members for Bradfield, Kooyong and Eden-Monaro and the Australian government and opposition, which are going to have this resolution voted on tomorrow. This event was the darkest hour in the history of the Olympics, and not to remember the 11 athletes who simply came to the games to represent their country and to compete on the world stage is a desecration of all that the Olympic stands for. These slain men were fathers, uncles, brothers, friends, team mates and athletes. They came in peace and went home in coffins, killed by terrorists. The families of the 11 murdered athletes have worked for 40 years to obtain recognition from the IOC but have been repeatedly turned down. These 11 men went to Munich to represent their country. They were happy, enthusiastic and well-liked guys who only wanted to compete at an event of nations. Their political views were not at the forefront of their minds when they trained, competed and qualified for the Olympics. This small gesture would reaffirm the Olympic values of honour, harmony and fraternity—the very values that the terrorists repudiated by their massacre. As Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Andre, said of the Israeli athletes murdered that day:


The 11 murdered athletes were members of the Olympic family; we feel they should be remembered within the framework of the Olympic Games.


The fight to get these athletes remembered will continue.'






It is to our great credit in the Australian parliament that we were right behind them. 


Members of this House, along with parliamentarians from all over the world, will continue to press the IOC to memorialise the fallen. Pheidippides, the great Ancient Greek hero who ran 24 miles from Marathon to Athens, with his last breath upon arriving in Athens was able to pass on to the families of the fallen the message, 'We have won.' We have won simply by raising this in the Australian parliament and distinguishing Australia as a country which has a conscience, even if the rest of the international community, as represented by the IOC, does not.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (18:40):  In 32 days time we celebrate the Games of the 30th Olympiad in London. Two weeks of intense competition and interstate rivalry is sure to provide a lifetime of memories and, in many cases, a lifetime of friendships. But, unless the International Olympic Committee has a change of heart, there is likely to be in London something significantly amiss. 


Some 40 years ago, at the 20th Olympiad in Munich, West Germany, the world was shocked when 11 Israelis, six coaches and five athletes, were murdered by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September. But since that time the international Olympic movement has refused calls to devote one minute of silence before the start of every Olympics to remember the tragic events of 1972. This Olympics in London is the perfect opportunity to right the wrongs of the past. Indeed, the slogan for the 2012 Olympics is 'Inspire a Generation'. Now it is time to live up to these words. Plaques and memorials only go so far. What is now needed is a minute of silence. 


This is what the motion before the chamber today, moved by my friend and colleague the member for Bradfield and seconded by me, is all about. We in the Australian parliament, in a bipartisan manner, Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition alike, join with our parliamentary colleagues in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and Canada in calling upon the International Olympic Committee to at last pay a proper tribute to the innocent lives lost at the Munich games in 1972. To deny this commemoration is to deny the reality of what happened and the urgency of ensuring it never happens again. 


The IOC needs to understand that the terrorists who carried out the attacks of 5 and 6 September 1972 took more than the lives of talented Israeli athletes and coaches, devoted fathers and husbands. They also took with them the innocence of the entire Olympic movement, a movement which from its origins at Athens in 1896 was known as a noble sporting competition devoted to the goal of 'citius, altius, fortius'—faster, higher, stronger. But thereafter it became the scene for a bloody act of political violence wreaked by those with no regard for the innocence of sport and the sanctity of international competition. Ironically it was in Germany too, at the Berlin Olympics of 1936, that an ascendant Hitler turned his back on the victorious American black athlete Jesse Owens, but the events of Munich were of a different scale and nature, with the loss of so many lives. This is what the IOC must understand and acknowledge in the appropriate way. 


The Olympic Charter itself states emphatically in paragraph 1:


The goal of the Olympic Movement is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practised in accordance with Olympism and its values.


Those values are clearly outlined as the rejection of discrimination and the preservation of human dignity. The act of terrorism was a direct repudiation of these values and of the Olympic Charter itself, thereby making it incumbent upon the IOC to step up and do more than it has been prepared to do to date.


It must be remembered there are precedents which have seen the Olympic movement acknowledge tragedies of the past. In 2010, at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, there was a minute of silence following the earlier death of an athlete in training, and at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics there was a special tribute to the victims of September 11. The question therefore has to be asked of the IOC: what is it that makes commemorating the events of 1972 so different? If indeed it is a fear of antagonising countries that are not friendly with Israel then this is even a greater reason for the IOC to take a stand. Sport must be above politics and divorced from political violence of any kind. A minute's silence at the London Olympics for the 11 Israelis and one German police officer killed at Munich will send a strong message to the world. Never again.


I commend all those individuals, including the member for Bradfield, the member for Melbourne Ports and the member for Eden-Monaro; the media outlets, including the Australian Jewish News; and national governments from around the globe who have worked tirelessly to ensure that the Olympic Movement does not forget the victims of Munich. My heart goes out to the families of those lost, particularly to Mrs Ilana Romano and Mrs Ankie Spitzer, whose husbands, weightlifter Yossef Romano and fencing master Andre Spitzer, were killed at Munich. Together, those two women have worked hard to promote this important cause.


I say to you all, on behalf of my many colleagues in this place: we feel your pain and we will do all we can to promote the memory of those who so deserve their one minute of silence.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:45):  I commend the previous speakers and, in particular, I commend the member for Bradfield for having initiated this motion about the 1972 Munich massacre. In doing so, the member for Bradfield has done a very fine thing and I am proud that we can unite in supporting this motion. 


It is a sad day, as the member for Kooyong has mentioned, for the families of the 11 athletes and the German policeman killed by the Black September terrorists. It is as well to remember that some of those victims were survivors of the Holocaust—people like Yaakov Springer, the weightlifting judge, whose entire family was annihilated in the Holocaust but who himself managed to survive it. The Munich massacre was a double tragedy in that respect. The murdered athletes were there in support of the Olympic ideal we have heard referred to. There was one poignant incident exemplifying the attitude of these fine athletes at the games—Andre Spitzer approaching members of the Lebanese team, saying, 'I want to reach out to these people, exchange pleasantries as athletes and build a bond.' To him, that was what the Olympics were all about. That was the spirit in which these athletes entered into those Olympic Games. 


The 1972 games mark a loss of innocence for the Olympics. After that, for many years, the Olympics were regularly used as a platform for politics and they were further perverted by the doping scandals that followed as well. Instead of being a place of coming together, a place of celebration of diversity and common humanity, the 1972 Olympics became a scene or carnage. The irony is that the Black September group which perpetrated this massacre were named after an event in Jordan in September 1970 in which Jordanian forces massacred large numbers of Palestinians—an event Israel had nothing to do with. 


The complicity of other nations in the Munich massacre should be recalled as well. The terrorists trained in Libya—and how appropriate it was that Colonel Gaddafi finally met the same end he had effectively meted out to so many others through his support for terrorist groups over the years. The terrorists were facilitated in their penetration of Europe by the Bulgarian intelligence service, who became the outsourcing mechanism for the KGB in supporting international terrorism. They were also facilitated in their reconnaissance of the village by the athletes on the East German team. For many years, these were the mechanisms of the KGB at work. 


The incompetence of the German authorities has been commented upon. At that time—and what took place was shameful—they rejected an offer from the Israeli authorities to provide a rescue team and they demonstrated a cavalier approach to the operation. In doing so, they failed their own personnel, many of whom were injured—and one was killed—on the night. The athletes could well have been saved by a more effective approach to that operation. The incompetence of the Germans extended to allowing their first attempts at an approach to be filmed by the television channels; to allowing the roads to be blocked, preventing the armoured vehicles from getting there; to positioning their snipers badly; to not being properly equipped; and, ultimately, to the personnel positioned on the aircraft, the one the terrorists and the hostages were moving towards, taking a vote on abandoning the mission because they felt they were too much at risk and walking off the plane a couple of seconds before the terrorists were to enter that aircraft—thus triggering what occurred. As mentioned by the member for Melbourne Ports, that was followed by revelations about the neo-Nazi connection and, after that, by the German government orchestrating a Lufthansa hijacking so that they could hand over the remaining three terrorists with plausible deniability cover. That was a shameful episode—the Germans trying to avoid future terrorist attacks through this mechanism. 


This did give rise to the formation of the GSG 9 and many other counterterrorist units around the world, including ours in 1978 through the assigning of a counterterrorism mission to the SAS. In addition, the Munich experience drove me to try and achieve the reforms we needed for own counterterrorism response in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics of 2000. I am proud to say that the Labor and coalition members of parliament at that time collaborated to produce that result, a result that was opposed at the time by the Greens, saying that Australia would never be a terrorist target and that we would never have to worry about terrorism. So I am proud of the work that we did together and the bipartisan approach to achieve that reform. It also goes to show, of course, that nations must be prepared and ready to face these threats at any time.


We must have a minute's silence in London to remind the world of the loss of these fine Israeli athletes and to inspire our rededication to the implacable fight against terror, the attainment of peace in the Middle East and our pursuit of the Olympic ideal.


Debate adjourned.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (21:00):  I believe that one of the most important roles I have as a member of parliament is to listen to the needs and concerns of my community and then work tirelessly to address these issues and do whatever I can to make Macarthur a better place for all my constituents to live in. This why I recently distributed Macarthur's Biggest Survey to every household in my electorate. I have received a great response from many residents—families, seniors and small business owners—in the Macarthur region. Almost 2,000 surveys have been returned so far, which is great because it means I am able to see and hear firsthand the needs and concerns of my community and do what I can to address these issues. Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has taken the time to fill out their survey and send it back. I would also like to remind other residents that they can still do so.


Along with my staff, we are still working very hard to process all the data from these surveys, but I can safely say that the two major issues raised by residents in Macarthur have been the Labor-Greens toxic carbon tax and the need for better infrastructure in the region. Touching on infrastructure, this includes upgrades to our roads, public transport system, hospitals and recreational facilities; access to education; and more employment opportunities within the region. One of the biggest concerns raised so far is the rapid growth of housing developments in our area, with no accompanying investment to enhance the level of infrastructure, particularly roads, parking and public transport. Locals would also like to see more facilities for youth, such as recreational parks or centres, and more training opportunities for employment. These are great suggestions considering that many of the new housing developments in the region will primarily be homes for young families. The people of Macarthur are on the pulse with these issues and are well aware that the population is expected to double in the next two decades. The Camden Local Government Area alone is predicted to balloon to a massive 390 per cent by 2036, with about 250,000 more residents moving into the area. This compares with 62 per cent growth in Wollondilly and 59 per cent for Campbelltown.


It is vital that the infrastructure required for new and existing residents in my community be provided before the growth occurs so that my electorate remains strong and resilient as it grows. That is why I was very surprised to see that Macarthur had been so neglected in this year's federal budget. But, luckily for the people of Macarthur, the New South Wales state Liberal government is working hard to improve infrastructure in our region to ensure that present and future residents have adequate infrastructure and services to support this growth. This year's state budget included $26.6 million to continue the Campbelltown Hospital redevelopment; $29 million to start the upgrade of Camden Valley between Ingleburn and Raby Road; $9.5 million to complete planning for the upgrade between Raby Road and Oran Park Drive; $900,000 to start the M5 Motorway upgrade between King Georges Road and Camden Valley Way; $393,000 for the Camden Court House upgrade; an upgrade of Picton Railway Station; $37.8 million for a priority sewerage program at Appin, Bargo, Buxton and Wilton; $5.4 million for 85 more nurses in south-west Sydney; $3 million to purchase land for new accommodation for people with disabilities in Campbelltown; $214,000 to build a new entrance to the Dharawal National Park in Appin; $11.8 million for road and program funding; $11.6 million for further Picton Road upgrades; and $6.4 million for more subacute mental health services. You can see that the state Liberal government really are kicking the can. The budget also includes a $30 million boost to its Local Government Infrastructure Renewal Scheme, which helps councils with the borrowing costs on loans to address infrastructure backlogs.


First home buyers in Macarthur will also be $19,245 better off when they buy a new home under the new Building the State package to boost housing construction. This will also promote job creation and stimulate the local economy across the region. With so many homes now being built in Macarthur, this will be a great incentive to help young people buy their first home in my electorate. It will also encourage those from outside the area to build their new home in one of the many new estates in Macarthur such as Oran Park Town, Gregory Hills, Spring Farm, Camden Estate and Ridges Estate in Elderslie.


I thank the member for Wollondilly Jai Rowell, the member for Campbelltown Bryan Doyle, and the member for Camden Chris Patterson, for their hard work to support the people of Macarthur through their budget. It is interesting that all this investment has come after we got rid of a Labor government that invested nothing, or very little, in the Macarthur region over a 16-year period. I know that those local Liberal members fought hard for their communities and it is great to see the Premier and the New South Wales Treasurer funding so many projects across my electorate. Money spent on improvements to Macarthur's roads and public transport will help local communities plan—important, given that more than 75 per cent of Macarthur's population leave the area and commute to work on a daily basis.


I have already mentioned in parliament the need for more employment lands in Macarthur so that people can live and work in what I consider to be one of the best places in the world. Until these employment lands are generated, we need adequate roads and public transport options for residents in my community who spend up to three or four hours a day commuting to and from work.


Macarthur is a fantastic place to live and anything we can do to improve the life of residents in my community, especially when it comes to more time spent at home with their families, is a good thing. That is why I am very pleased to see the New South Wales government pouring so much funding into Macarthur's roads and public transport. The state budget also caters for major population growth in south-west Sydney, with $397 million set aside to continue work on the South West Rail Link between Glenfield and Leppington and $900,000 to kick start the widening of the M5. The South West Rail Link will be a major piece of public transport infrastructure for the south-west growth centre, connecting an existing CityRail network at Glenfield to the new train station at Leppington. This will provide another option for commuters from the Camden and Wollondilly areas who currently use Narellan Road to access train services from Campbelltown. The upgrades to Camden Valley Way and the South West Rail Link will take cars off Narellan Road and help to ease the congestion experienced by many motorists during peak hour times. This was another important issue brought up in Macarthur's Biggest Survey. I am constantly approached by residents in my electorate who want to vent their frustration about our local roads. That is why I think the state government's commitment to Macarthur's roads and infrastructure is a fantastic thing and vital as Macarthur's population continues to grow.


Macarthur faces several high-priority infrastructure projects over the next two decades. These include better connectivity and access on our roads; better public transport, including commuter parking; development of employment generating lands for those that live and work in Macarthur; improved health, education and community facilities and services, such as upgrades to our hospitals, the university, TAFE, ambulance and police stations; better recreational facilities; access to water and sewerage; and better internet connection. The Spring Farm Parkway extension and the connection to the Hume Highway, including on and off ramps to the Hume Highway at Menangle, are also high priority.


The funding provided by the state government towards some of these projects is a great start in dealing with the high-priority infrastructure needs identified for Macarthur, although I am sure many would agree that federal funding is also needed to support this growth. This funding is distinctly lacking. I am sure it can be appreciated that, with a forecast of 300 per cent growth in the next two to three decades, it is vital that a region-wide strategy is developed for Macarthur to deal with the expected population boom. I believe that all three levels of government must work together to establish this plan for our community's future. I am sure that, with good planning and collaboration to secure resources, we can turn the challenges of growth into opportunities for economic prosperity, social equity and environmental enhancement—all crucial in determining our quality of life. A major factor we must deal with as Macarthur's population continues to grow is infrastructure: planning for it, securing the resources to pay for it and ensuring that it is delivered on time in the right place and on budget—something this government has problems with.


Along with many Macarthur residents, I am pleased to see that the New South Wales state government has funded these important infrastructure projects and hope to see more federal funding poured into the region over the next two decades to support this growth. I also look forward to hearing from more residents in my community as returns from Macarthur's Biggest Survey continue to be returned to my office each day. It is vital that I hear from the people of Macarthur first-hand so that I can continue to fight for the infrastructure we need to make Macarthur a great place to live for many generations to come.
