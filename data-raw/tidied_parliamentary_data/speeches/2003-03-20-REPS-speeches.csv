"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, now that the bombing has started and given that every Australian is now concerned about the welfare of our men and women in the defence forces, can you, subject to operational security constraints, inform Australians about the activities and welfare of our troops in the gulf now and in the days ahead?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-03-20,"—For operational and security reasons, which I ask the House and the public to accept and understand, I cannot give any specific details.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—Mr Speaker, I have a question to you which relates to ongoing reports you have given to this House concerning the security of Parliament House. I specifically refer to an article at page 8 of the Australian Financial Review today headed `Funds sought for order in the House'. Firstly, can you advise the House if it is correct that a submission has been prepared for the Joint House Department requesting an extra $7 million to upgrade security inside Parliament House. If it is not $7 million, what is it? Is it $6 million, or some other figure? Secondly, can you advise the House of the additional costs of increased security incurred by the installation of airport-style walk-through screening procedures for all staff and MPs and new boomgates for underground staff carparks? Thirdly, can you advise the House how this expenditure on the security of politicians can be justified when the government has admitted in question time today—
—The member for Batman—
—that it has taken no steps to update the security of ordinary Australians.
—The member for Batman does strain the chair's patience sometimes. I did not hear the latter part of his question. I interrupted him to ask him to repeat it, but of course he had to rush on in case I sat him down. The member for Batman has the call, and I would like to hear the latter part of his question again.
—I like dealing with you, Mr Speaker. 
—Generally it is a good relationship, but the member for Batman is straining things a little when he continues.
—Sometimes you strain it when you throw me out. Mr Speaker, how can this expenditure on the security of politicians be justified when the government has admitted in question time today, to the alarm of the Australian public, that it has taken no steps to upgrade the security of everyday Australians?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Parliament House: Security</title>,Questions to the Speaker,2,1,question
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2003-03-20,"—As the member for Batman would be aware from his experience, it is not proper for me to comment on what are budget submissions but, as he would expect, a submission has been made for the upgrade of security at Parliament House. That would be consistent with what is expected not solely by members, but also by every member of the public, who is entitled to the same sort of security. A submission has been made for an upgrade. It would be inappropriate to comment on the details of the figures. I am happy to talk to the member for Batman—he has asked for more detail than I could be expected to have at my fingertips—about the general security changes that are anticipated.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Parliament House: Security</title>,Questions to the Speaker,2,1,answer
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—I thank the government and opposition people who have made time available in the adjournment debate. We anticipated that the previous debate would last much longer and take us out to about five o'clock. In the event, it did not. The five minutes gives me an opportunity briefly to deal with the introduction of the legislation that the Attorney-General has just placed in the House on the amended powers of ASIO. Of course, I fully realise that, under the standing orders, I am not allowed to canvass the detail of that bill, as that would be anticipating debate. Just as that is not permitted in question time, neither is it permitted in the adjournment debate. However, there are certain features of this issue that stand outside the bill and go to the handling of the bill. Under the standing orders, they may be considered.
There has been a deal of reportage about the motivations associated with the government's intention to reintroduce the bill now. I do not want to go into that or speculate about whether it is a piece of double dissolution legislation. What I want to do is correct some of the historical record associated with it. A bill to give ASIO these powers passed the Senate last year, with different but nevertheless workable provisions that ensured the protection of civil rights. At the same time, it ensured that ASIO ended up with powers greater than those of the FBI—that of course being a body which faces in its day-to-day duties even more serious threats to national security via terrorist activity than we do ourselves. The bill that passed the Senate at that time would have seen ASIO emerge with powers well beyond those of the American FBI. I, for one, regard it as a tragedy that the bill was not accepted at that time.
I emphasise that to emphasise the fact that the opposition does not oppose in principle the extension of additional powers to ASIO in these troubled times. We support it. Indeed, when I was Leader of the Opposition, we called for it. The opposition approaches this particular legislation not from the point of view of obstructionism but from the point of view of wanting to get the balance right. Having had discussions with the various opposition spokespersons who are directly responsible for the opposition's handling of this piece of legislation, I know that that remains the case. I think it is important that, when this legislation finally passes the parliament, it does so in a shape and form that the vast majority of the Australian people can feel comfortable with. That is important for the sense of security of the ordinary Australian citizen. It is also important for the belief that the government is being directed on the basis of not what is there for partisan advantage on security issues but what is there for protection, and ensuring that, in protecting ourselves, we uphold all the principles that make us a worthwhile and democratic nation.
That is our objective. I hope it will be the objective of the government, too. It is the intention of the opposition negotiators—of whom I am not one—that this bill, which we took a positive approach to previously, will be approached on the same basis again. I note without canvassing them that the government has made some adjustments to that legislation, and that is welcome. We suggested at the time that there were other adjustments that we were prepared to wear ourselves, and those adjustments were not taken up in the negotiations that occurred on that very fraught night, as I recollect it—almost the last night of sitting in the course of last year.
The opposition supports in principle that extension of the powers of ASIO. We support it in a context that ensures the rights of people who are not suspects. Remember that this legislation refers to people who are not suspects. If you are a suspect of a terrorist act, considerable civil libertarian rights descend upon you. That is the nature of our laws. However, these are folk who are not suspects. Therefore, this is innovative legislation in that regard. In these circumstances we as a parliament ought to be very careful in the way in which we handle this. As I said, the opposition is prepared to negotiate this on a positive basis. I do not want to see reportage of this tomorrow suggesting that we are not prepared to do that or that we were not in the past.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—Today, a day when in a couple of hours we will see the world at war once again—something that I think is rather tragic—I want to bring to the House's attention an aspect of the war that does not take much prominence. We mouth platitudes but, when it comes to actually doing something about this issue, we seem to be missing in action. The issue I am referring to is the treatment of our veterans when they return. I speak with some authority because my late father was a veteran and my mum, when Dad passed away, was a war widow. It is interesting to note that one of the former ministers for veterans' affairs has wandered in; thank you. The issue is the treatment of veterans and how difficult it is for many veterans to access what I consider to be their due entitlements through DVA. These veterans have served in countries far away. They have left their families, they have put themselves under enormous pressure, they have seen their friends and cobbers killed and, in many cases, they have been POWs and gone through horrific experiences. When they come back, they have to go through the Veterans' Entitlements Act and all its complications. To my mind, we say one thing and we do the other.
A gold card, to my mind, is an entitlement. If you have a medical problem or a mental health problem, DVA should look after you. There should be no questions asked; it should be taken for granted. But we have a situation now in my electorate—and, I know, in many electorates around Australia—where veterans go to the doctor and doctors are saying, `Look, I'm sorry, but I don't accept your gold card. I'm having this philosophical, ideological argument with the government about my due entitlements as a GP. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to make a co-payment.' I think it is bloody disgraceful; I really do. Most of these people are well into their 80s. They have done the hard yards. They have sacrificed many things for our country. As I said, we mouth platitudes as we send them off to war today but, when they come home, they are really pushing it up the proverbial hill. Let us sort out all this philosophical BS between the government and the AMA so that our diggers and our war widows do get their entitlements and these people can live in peace and harmony for the rest of their lives.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Veterans: Gold Card</title>,Statements by Members,12,1,speech
"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 seeks to appropriate moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for the ordinary annual services of government—that is, recurrent services and recurrent expenditure on already established programs. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 seeks the appropriation of moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for purposes other than the ordinary annual services of government—for example, payments to the states and spending on new programs. During this debate, I will be discussing various proposals within both of these bills.
The first point I would like to discuss is the appropriation to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003. It is proposed to appropriate $350 million for Australia's contribution to the International Development Association and Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 also appropriates $108 million for defence spending and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 appropriates an additional $125 million to the Department of Defence. I refer to these particular sections because of the current debate happening in the main chamber as we discuss this here—that is, the debate on the Prime Minister's decision to invade Iraq. I think we need to look at this expenditure and possible other expenditure related to the war on Iraq.
A couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs volunteered $10 million to the United Nations emergency appeal. In this context, the Australian Financial Review has reported that the cost of the military campaign to Australia will be between $700 million and $900 million. So we are looking at the government paying up to $900 million for the war in Iraq, yet contributing only $10 million to the humanitarian program which will need to be put in place immediately after that conflict ends. Australia is only one of three countries providing military might to the war in Iraq. The United Nations have requested about $300 million for humanitarian aid. Put in this context, the $10 million offered by Australia is just three per cent of the money asked for by the United Nations. Three per cent of the money asked for by the United Nations is going to be provided by Australia, yet we are only one of the three countries involved. We should be providing at least one-third of the funds required by the United Nations for the humanitarian effort.
In relation to the amount of money required by Defence in Australia for the war in Iraq—as I have said, it has been reported that it could be as much as $900 million—it was reported just yesterday that the President of the United States, George W. Bush, is going to ask the United States Congress for about $168 billion for the US-led invasion of Iraq. That $168 billion could eradicate poverty around the world, institute health programs around the world, institute programs which would allow for the education of children around the world and institute programs which would allow all people around the world access to fresh water—that same $168 billion being provided by the US to invade Iraq. It is an absolute disgrace. America could be a world leader and a friend to the world by applying those kinds of funds to undeveloped and developing countries to assist in their development and prosperity.
I now refer to another section of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 where there is $245 million appropriated to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The main part of this appropriation is for drought relief. There is $178.6 million net additional for drought relief. I am pleased to see that the shadow minister is here because I want to relate this to the tragic season of bushfires that Australians have gone through in the last eight months or so. Bushfires and drought go hand in hand. When there is drought it is quickly followed by fires. The fires that we have recently seen in my area, in Canberra and in Victoria are the most tragic fires that this country has ever been through. However, is there anything in these appropriation bills for a bushfire strategy? There is not.
Mr Gavan O'Connor, the member for Corio and the shadow minister for regional services, territories, local government and tourism, has announced Labor's national bushfire strategy which would establish national plans for preparedness for, response to and recovery from the ravages of bushfire. It would support the establishment of a bushfire cooperative research centre to coordinate Australia's bushfire research effort. It would establish a national pool of up to 11 leased aircraft. It would establish an Australian interagency fire coordination centre with the responsibility for coordinating the leasing and management of national pooled resources, including aircraft, and national standard operating procedures. The shadow minister has said that by establishing a national pool of leased firefighting aircraft we will be able to provide our firefighters with access to a range of modern firefighting technology that would be beyond the resources of any one state to provide. He goes on to say:
A fire co-ordination centre will make better and timelier use of fire-fighting resources, including aircraft. Our fire-fighting methods, equipment and protocols will be better co-ordinated.
As I said, the government has done nothing to address the issues of bushfires in this country. It needs a national approach and only Labor will be able to provide that national approach. As we have seen in these appropriation bills, there has been nothing to address the threat of bushfires in our country.
I go on to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 which provides $23 million for the meningococcal immunisation program. This appropriation is welcomed by the Labor Party and the Meningococcal Association of Australia. Meningitis is an infection of the fluid of a person's spinal cord and the fluid that surrounds the brain. People sometimes refer to it as spinal meningitis. It is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection and knowing whether meningitis is caused by a virus or a bacterium is important because of the severity of illness and the differing treatment options. Viral meningitis is generally less severe and resolves without specific treatment while bacterial meningitis can be severe and may result in brain damage, hearing loss or learning disability. For bacterial meningitis it is important to know which type of bacteria is causing the meningitis, because antibiotics can prevent some types from spreading and infecting other people.
I refer to this because my constituent Allan Brown has accepted the role of ambassador for the Meningococcal Association of Australia and of assisting in any way towards a better educated Australia with a view to reducing the incidence of meningococcal disease. The Meningococcal Association is a voluntary one with just three objectives: to work towards a better informed Australia and, as such, create a better awareness of meningococcal disease and its symptoms; to work to assist those whose lives have been affected by the disease; and to promote a greater emphasis on vaccinations and attention to research.
Allan's grand-daughter Cassy survived meningococcal disease but will require special medical attention for several years. The General Manager of the Meningococcal Association, Mr Joe MacManamon said:
When I first met little Cassy and her mum I was impressed by their spirit of determination. Cassy realises she is fortunate to have survived one of the most awful diseases on planet earth. Her mum, Donna, is just so very happy that her daughter is alive and for at least the next 4-10 years she is happy to take Cassy to Sydney for the treatment which she hopes will restore permanent mobility to her legs.
I am pleased to say that after some charity events in Newcastle one of the local car dealerships gave Cassy and her mum a vehicle so that they could travel backwards and forwards to Sydney for that treatment. They were finding it very difficult since they had an old car and did not have the resources to purchase a new vehicle. So I congratulate the local community for coming to the assistance of Cassy and her family. I also congratulate Allan on his commitment to the Meningococcal Association and to the cause, and I wish him well and offer him every support in his future endeavours.
I turn now to Labor's amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer on 3 March in the House of Representatives. That amendment has, as the House knows, three parts, and I would particularly like to refer to point (2) of the amendment where the shadow Treasurer states that the House condemns the government for its failures in economic management—in particular, its failings in relation to both income and expenditure policies. Point (2) says:
(2)	it has failed to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people, for example:
(a)	bulk billing has collapsed;
(b)	there is chronic under-investment in our public schools, TAFE colleges and universities;
(c)	the struggle to balance work and family life continues to get harder; and
(d)	entry level housing is becoming even less affordable for struggling Australian families; and
Australian families owe nearly $600 million to the government in family tax benefit debts, and over 670,000 families owe an average debt of $850. Along with, I am sure, everybody else in the House of Representatives, I have had much correspondence and much contact with many constituents who have been affected by this disastrous policy. This one letter to me demonstrates the enormous pressure that families are experiencing in our communities in relation to the family tax benefit debts. My constituent writes:
Dear Kelly Hoare,
Please find correspondence enclosed from Centrelink regarding our Family Tax Bill. This is the first time we have ever received a bill such as this, we find it very hard to understand how we could find ourselves in such a situation as this. Why haven't we in past years been found to be receiving excess payments? It is a startling fact to have to repay $2821.45 so unexpectantly, and we feel that the system must be flawed somewhere.
She is certainly right there. She goes on:
We understand that if we owe the money then we must pay it back, which we have made arrangement to do so. We realise there is not much you can do about government policy but we would like you to protest on our behalf the stupidity of the system.
As I said, that reflects the situation that many of my constituents find themselves in.
In relation to families being under pressure even further, the rate of bulk-billing by general practitioners has decreased by 11 percentage points over the last seven years, with only 69.6 per cent of GP services now being bulk-billed. More than 10 million fewer GP services were bulk-billed this year compared with when John Howard came to office, and the average out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill is now $12.78, up 55 per cent since the Howard government came to office in 1996. It is another area about which I have been contacted by many people in relation not only to the decline in bulk-billing services and the increase in the costs of visiting a doctor but also to the shortage of doctors in regional areas. I have here an example which demonstrates the widespread problem that is experienced by my constituents. This man wrote to me:
Dear Kelly,
I have enclosed a couple of Medicare receipts for your records. You will notice that my Doctor has given her self a pay increase....
My Doctor does not bulk bill all pensioners, they closed their books to new pensioners some years back.
...				...				...
These new fees will mean that the wife and me will get a 68 percent rebate for Medicare, which would put us back to the pre Whitlam era.
Of course, people say, “go to a doctor that bulk bills.” But Doctors are not a homogenous product. In my case the Doctor has a case study of 12 years of an on going chronic complaint, which several other Doctors missed diagnosed.
It is about time the government increased the rebate to pensioners that are not bulked billed. The money could come from those 50000 dollar a year Income pensioners who pushed out low-income aged pensioners like me.
That reflects a general feeling of dissatisfaction right across our community. Another area where families are under pressure is in the area of child care. Up to 30,000 children are unable to get a child-care place out of school hours. This government is spending $800 less per child-care place than it spent seven years ago. Just last week I received an email from another constituent, a working mum in my area. She said:
Dear Kelly Hoare MP,
I am writing to you as my Federal MP regarding the lack of child care places available for under 2 years of age children in our area.
I need help. I have a four month old baby and due to financial reasons have had to return to work. I cannot find any child care in Newcastle or the Hunter for my baby. I have called 26 child care centres in the area and all have a waiting list of approximately 2 years. I am relying on her grandmother at the moment but this arrangement cannot last long due to various reasons.
If I do not find child care soon I will need to leave my job which I do not want to do.
...					...					...
This email highlights the pressure that families are being placed under. None of that pressure is being relieved by these appropriation bills; it should be relieved in the next lot of appropriation bills from this government, which will be brought down by the Treasurer in May. We demand that some of this pressure is lifted. We demand that the financial pressure on the families that we represent is lifted. We will be continuing to apply pressure on the government to do that. If it does not do it then it will reap the consequences at the next election, when all our constituents who have suffered under the past seven years will throw the government out.
In conclusion, I would like to refer again to the shadow minister's amendment which starts: `Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading ...'. We have had many requests to oppose these appropriations to force the sacking of this government. We appreciate the view that there may be some legitimacy in repeating the actions of Malcolm Fraser in 1975 when he manipulated the Senate to block supply and force a general election. The actions of Fraser were then, and are now, deplorable. A properly elected government should not be held to ransom by a hostile Senate. However, Labor maintain that there is a need to reform Senate powers. Governments have repeatedly railed against the Senate's power to block government legislation and particularly budgets. During the last election campaign, Labor indicated a willingness to consider limitations on the Senate's capacity to block supply. Labor oppose the use of the Senate to block money bills because of the affront caused to Australia's fundamental democratic core.
Despite the affront caused to the Australian people by the Howard government, we must uphold the fundamental principles of democracy and fight the government cleanly and await the next election. Appropriation bills such as these, the budget bills that we anticipate seeing in May, the total cost to Australia and the affront to Australian families caused by the Prime Minister's decision to send Australia into a war in Iraq with two other countries—all these issues will be addressed at the next election, whether it be a double dissolution at the end of this year or an election in the full course of time.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—These appropriation bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, afford members the opportunity to canvass issues that are of concern to constituents, particularly those that have wider community implications than the individual concerns of those who raise them. In the context of this debate, I seek to raise several matters of such concern. The first matter relates to the allocation by the federal government of 30 additional beds to the Glenburn Nursing Home in my electorate. I have raised in the parliament on previous occasions the concerns of residents in relation to this particular proposal. It is clear from any cursory examination of the material relating to this development that the 30 extra beds should never have been allocated to the Glenburn facility by the Howard government, nor should the City of Greater Geelong have issued a building permit for the redevelopment and construction of the 30 extra beds at its current location.
With regard to the latter, this multistorey proposal is situated in a heritage precinct in Geelong and, in the view of the Drumcondra heritage group, it is a totally inappropriate redevelopment in a residential area that will compromise the care of residents, impede vehicular access on a busy thoroughfare, destroy the amenity of surrounding properties and pose a clear and present fire danger to clients occupying the facility. What is involved here is the expenditure of public moneys on a private nursing home facility where very significant questions need to be asked about the process by which this particular facility has been granted these 30 additional beds and, in the case of the local government authority, how it obtained the building and planning permits. The point relating to the clear and present fire danger to clients who occupy the facility is one that needs specific consideration by the current minister. Expert evidence has been presented to a VCAT hearing and to the federal government on the danger to residents from a fire accident, and a disaster that would occur in that eventuality is too horrendous to contemplate.
I raised this matter with Minister Andrews in a letter to him in February, following the death of a resident in an aged care facility in New South Wales as a result of fire, as part of my ongoing communication with him over a substantial period of time on this issue. It is a serious matter because the consequences of not taking action now to stop this redevelopment in the face of the evidence would constitute, in my view, a very serious breach of the duty of care to existing and future aged care residents. It is simply not good enough for the federal government or its administering department to handpass responsibility for this matter to a local government planning authority—in this case, the City of Greater Geelong.
In the case of the Glenburn Nursing Home, the federal department allocated the extra 30 beds to Cambrai Pty Ltd. Some directors of that company at the time were common to another company named Jadwan Pty Ltd, which operated the Derwent Court Nursing Home in Tasmania and with which the department was involved in litigation over a range of serious matters at that particular time. There are two serious matters relating to the process that ought to be investigated by the federal government and the City of Greater Geelong respectively. The first matter is how the extra beds ever came to be allocated in the first place. The second matter is how this proposal was ever approved in the first instance by the local government authority—and I refer to the City of Greater Geelong.
With regard to fire safety issues emanating from the proposed development, the matter was addressed in evidence to the VCAT hearing, at which Mr Bob Barry from the CFA outlined in detail the potential human disaster that could occur in certain circumstances should this development proceed. This advice should not be ignored by the minister, as this whole redevelopment has a disconcerting smell about it, from the local government processes that led to the issuance of the planning permit in the first place to the federal departmental processes that approved the bids. I urge both levels of government to thoroughly investigate this matter before the redevelopment proceeds and before a potential disaster occurs.
One of the major components of the federal budget is of course the expenditure on health. In many communities, especially regional communities across Australia, there is a deepening concern at the crisis in the provision of general practitioner services. This is the second issue that I wish to raise in this debate, because in the Geelong community the provision of general practitioner services is in a parlous state. I have received representations on this matter from the G.P. Association of Geelong, and I am indebted to Dr George Golding, the executive director of the aforementioned division of general practice, and his colleagues for their analysis of the current deficiency in the number of GPs in Geelong. I am also indebted to Dr Carl Grace, who has appraised me of the particular problems that he has had in his practice in recruiting suitably qualified doctors within the limitations posed by various government regulations and incentive schemes.
Put simply, the provision of GP services in Geelong is in crisis. It is estimated that in the region there is a shortage of 15 to 20 doctors. This is not only putting an intolerable burden on existing GPs and their practices; it is affecting the provision of medical services to my constituents. In a letter to the Minister for Health and Ageing on 3 June 2002, Dr Golding outlined succinctly the adverse consequences of this situation. Writing about the shortage, Dr Golding stated:
This leads to a number of dire consequences:
·	The increased demand on services particularly after hours for the public hospital Accident and Emergency Department.
This is a growing problem for our community. As bulk-billing has declined and as pressure has increased on GP practices due to the shortages, we are seeing a substantially increased demand for the services provided by our public hospital accident and emergency department. Dr Golding goes on in his letter to list the other dire consequences:
·	The increase in waiting times for patients to see GPs.
·	The closing of GP appointment books for new patients in many areas.
·	The increasingly heavy workload for GPs with consequences on GP and GP Family Health.
·	The non-availability of locum doctors to give GPs some respite from the heavy workload.
·	Time constraints for GPs preventing them from accessing the new MBS item numbers for Enhanced Primary Care and Chronic Disease Initiatives of the Department of Health and Ageing.
Regrettably, the interpretation of statistics presents a picture of the distorted availability of GPs in our region and other regional areas. I do not propose to canvass the complexities of that statistic analysis here today, but I should mention that the full-time effective equivalent GP-patient ratio in Geelong is the disturbing figure of one to 1,428—well above the desired ratio of one to 1,100.
The work force implications of this are serious indeed, the most serious being burnout in the existing work force, people waiting two to three days before obtaining non-urgent treatment, and outpatient appointments taking some three months. There are structural changes in this work force that exacerbate local problems. The cultural change among new graduating doctors has meant that many are unprepared to sacrifice productive family life for long hours at their practice. In addition, the increased percentage of females graduating has impacted on that culture in the split made between work and home. It means also that many female doctors are choosing not to go on after-hours rosters, for family and safety reasons. It is a situation that the government has the power to address, and it must do so in the interests of delivering quality primary health care at the GP level.
Unfortunately, in the program response the government has structured, significant anomalies and inequities are occurring between practices in our region which must be addressed. In the particular case of Dr Carl Grace's practice, Medicaid, which I understand is the last remaining bulk-billing practice in Geelong, Dr Grace has practical difficulties in accessing programs, such as the Approved Medical Deputising Services program and the exemptions that it provides. The barriers are substantial—in many ways, impractical—and are a real stumbling block to the employment of overseas doctors through the scheme, particularly the prohibitive visa requirements for doctors recruited under the scheme. I do acknowledge the attempts by government to address these difficulties, but my plea is for greater flexibility in the administration of the programs and a practical acknowledgment that certain provincial communities are falling between a rock and hard place on these matters.
The final medical issue relates to a potential crisis in Geelong in the provision of specialist medical services—in particular, obstetrics and gynaecology. It relates to the impact of the medical indemnity crisis on the future structure of the medical work force in these and other specialty areas. That crisis has the potential to trigger a mass retirement of obstetricians across the board as they bring forward their retirement plans in response to this insurance indemnity crisis. Once again, I am indebted to local specialist Dr Glen Baker for his lucid analysis of the Geelong situation and the problems that may arise locally if the matter of future litigation against specialists is not addressed and managed correctly. There are eight specialists in the abovementioned fields in Geelong, and several are seriously contemplating their future in practice as a result of uncertainties created by the failure of the government to announce details of its proposed reform package.
With the new medical defence insurance system starting on 1 July this year, the known details of the reform package indicate that the system will change from an incident based model to a claims based model, which may mean that doctors are liable for payout after they retire. As doctors who retire before 30 June this year will avoid this situation, many doctors are contemplating retirement before that date. In addition, there has been little information provided on the level of premium increases which, when combined with the possibility of the retirement payouts, has created real uncertainty in the ranks of those specialists. There are general manpower considerations that will impact over the longer term as an overlay to this immediate crisis. There are already problems with recruiting into these specialties and, given that they are relatively underpaid in relation to other specialties and the current medical legal uncertainties, it all adds up to another potential manpower crisis in the ranks of Geelong's medical profession. The local implications of such a deterioration in the provision of obstetrics and gynaecological services will be increased pressure on public services provided by Geelong Hospital and an ever-contracting choice of services for my constituents.
It is a serious situation and, on the back of these recent representations, I have written to the minister seeking an appointment to present this situation to her. I am disappointed that she is unable to meet with me during this parliamentary session, but I can understand this given the events of this week. I hope that my representations to her, both written and through her advisers, bear some fruit in terms of a solution to this emerging crisis. Doctors are anxious and their clients, my constituents, are feeling the effects of restricted access to, and the choice of, service.
In the remaining time available, I will turn to an issue that is currently before the parliament and will be the subject of quite significant budgetary allocations in the near future. I refer to the war on Iraq. I note that the war will cost Australia around $1 billion, and I also note that our contribution to the humanitarian effort in the aftermath is currently around $10 million—$1 billion to wage war, and $10 million to pick up the pieces. We are on the verge of a massive humanitarian crisis in Iraq. It is important for all Australians, regardless of their feelings about this particular engagement, to know that their government—however culpable it is for that devastation and humanitarian crisis—will not walk away from the moral imperative to provide adequate resources in the aftermath of the damage that this war will create.
I note that, after the 1991 conflict, an international study group estimated that some 50,000 to 70,000 children had died in Iraq as a result of that particular engagement. The medical demands in the aftermath of that war were horrendous. That study group has returned to Iraq and indicates that that community is in an even more parlous condition and more vulnerable than it was in the previous gulf engagement to the devastating effects of war. It expects the death toll of children alone to be in the region of 100,000 to 150,000. These are young lives that will be wasted as a result of this illegal action taken by the Australian government in Iraq.
There is a moral imperative here that has been ignored by the government. The potential humanitarian crisis in Iraq demands that any civilised community walk the extra mile in the cause of peace. No amount of evidence that coalition members on the other side present in relation to the past deeds of Saddam Hussein and the future deeds of that regime will gloss over the fact that staring you in the face is the death of 100,000 to 150,000 children, let alone their innocent parents. The medical and humanitarian crisis will be of such a dimension that we really do not want to contemplate it.
It is imperative that governments walk the extra mile to seek a peaceful solution and disarmament of this regime in Iraq. To the shame of Australia, we have turned our back on walking the extra mile. We have turned our back on the great humanitarian traditions that have been the hallmark of this country since Federation. We have joined, for the first time, in an aggressive pre-emptive act that will stain the good character of this nation for generations to come. Even though we might in our own communities have medical crises of some moment, we cannot walk away from the medical and humanitarian crisis that we will be responsible for in the aftermath of this engagement in Iraq. The Australian government must face its responsibility for constructing the peace, as it must accept its responsibility for the death and destruction that it will cause through this war.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. One of my concerns about the way public policy is developed in Australia is that too often it is done in such a short-term time frame. Public policy is not developed in a way that is sustainable. It is more of a reaction to the need for instant gratification that is dictated by a culture dependent upon that type of short-term, 10-second grab. I wonder why that should be the case in a place like the Australian parliament. Another aspect of public policy that we seem not to have been able to adapt to and cater for is the fact that Australia is a federation. Too often at the federal level we shy away from a national approach on the basis that something is the business of the states. I believe that these are two of the great challenges: having a longer term vision and having a national vision. Australian governments, of whatever persuasion, need to adopt that view and ensure that it is the practice. Regrettably, I have to say that I do not believe the present government really has this focus.
If we look at some of the areas of public policy that require that longer term thought, we could instance the government's attitude to its involvement in Iraq. It would appear that the decisions around the position that the Australian government has got us into are all about the here and now. There is not the great discussion of what may happen afterwards. The honourable member for Corio has just outlined the sorts of dimensions of potential destruction that may occur. Therefore, shouldn't it be a requirement that a government discusses the way it sees matters proceeding after such destruction or what we will be involved in with the reconstruction of a country so devastated? But we do not hear that. We do not hear the context of this change in the way a world order will operate, with the doctrine of pre-emption allowed to go forward. That is probably why I still sit in great comfort with the position the opposition was trying to achieve: the disarmament of Iraq through the aegis of the United Nations. That was a solution that could have been sustainable. That was a solution that had a longer horizon.
We can look at other aspects of public policy. There are plenty of examples of domestic policy that have the same requirement. I always remember that throughout the years of the Hawke-Keating governments attempts were made to ensure that the whole of the work force had access to occupational superannuation. I remember, as we came to grips with the complex nature of that piece of public policy, that the decisions that were being made had horizons of outcome that were 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years ahead. Those measures were being put in place for people's whole-of-life employment. Our opponents found it easy to decry the efforts that we were making because there was no immediate benefit—these were things we should not do because there was no immediate benefit. So there is always this thought that things that do not happen within the horizon of the next election are not things that a government should consider. That is wrong. That is arrant nonsense. We have an obligation as governments to look at that longer-term view of what we should be trying to achieve.
I also make the observation that at the federal level we have a haphazard three-year term. States such as Victoria and New South Wales—New South Wales goes to the polls on Saturday—have four-year terms. The Victorian government was elected on a platform that it would have four-year fixed terms and that it would set the date of an election. The date of the next Victorian state election has already been set, so there is that certainty, and there is a four-year period in which the state government can put in place those things that it wishes to achieve and those things that it presented to the electorate. Whilst the four-year term may not be a perfect period, I think it is a reasonable period to sell to the Australian electorate that we are going about our business in an appropriate way.
But I am not just talking about a four-year period operating in the same haphazard fashion of the present three-year periods. Why not bite the bullet? Why not have a four-year fixed term? Why not at least have the ability for a government, upon election, to know that it has a four-year period to set in place its agenda for action? Often, as I indicated earlier with the example about superannuation, that agenda for action will go beyond one term. That is appropriate, and governments would have to take that risk, but it is the way in which the debate is carried out that will be important. We would hope that all political forces will see that that longer horizon is important, that it is important for us to have that longer view.
I mentioned national approaches. Over 100 years ago, under a Constitution that was hobbled together to ensure that the six colonies signed up, there were certain undertakings made about which sphere of government would look after areas of policy. Another aspect that has caught up with us over the last 100 years is that we would have been unaware of some areas of policy that have developed—the notion of having to worry about civil aviation and the notion of having to deal with various forms of communication technology. We have been able to adapt to those types of things, but we still have a problem in important areas of public policy such as education, health and, to a certain extent, the environment. A national approach requires that the federal government sits down with the states and territories to try to come to an agreement. We have to ask ourselves now, as we are well into embarking upon the 21st century: is that an appropriate way for the Commonwealth of Australia to continue to carry out the business of government?
When we look at the issue of access to a health system, people are not worried about who is footing the bill or whether it is going to be done through a state health system or through the federal health system. In fact, when their taxes are paying for it, does it really matter whether it is done through Commonwealth consolidated revenue or through state coffers? What people want to see is that, when there is a need, that need is catered for. Slowly but surely, we have had to adapt to providing a seamless access to services.
We got over the hurdle about the cost shifting that might occur when a patient left a public hospital and was to be given pharmaceuticals as part of their ongoing treatment. It was realised by the state institutions that they bore the cost of providing the necessary medicines and drugs to patients on their discharge. They even thought of ways that they could cost shift an amount like that across to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which, of course, was a Commonwealth responsibility. On all occasions, because there was this split system, there were things provided by the state system which did not come within the safety net provisions of our PBS. But we were able to get agreement that we could get around that so that the person was not disadvantaged, that there was not this continuing argy-bargy about who was responsible.
So we see that, slowly but surely, initiatives were developed. For instance, in my electorate, the Northern Hospital saw that it had a problem because many of those that presented at its accident and emergency centre were really people that required a visit to their general practitioner out of hours. The way that general practice clinics now work—perhaps it is not nine to five, but it could be eight to six or eight to seven—they do not allow for those sorts of after-hours consultations. So the hospital has a problem where, amongst all those people attending for all the emergency reasons, it has a large group of people attending basically because they want to see a doctor. This then compounds waiting times at the accident and emergency centre. Figures given to me show that 29 per cent of presentations at the emergency department of the Northern Hospital in 2001 were, in the technical term, triage 4 and 5. That is defined as `non-urgent patients who could just as easily be treated by a general practitioner'. It is estimated that in 2002 that figure may have increased to over 40 per cent.
What we saw was that discussion—as I understand it, at ministerial level—led to an agreement that perhaps it was appropriate that an after-hours GP service be provided at the Northern Hospital. In fact, what occurred was that the state government made funding available for a facility. We find that the facility has been built, but now we have continuing discussion about the recurring funding of the facility and who should actually foot the bill. An interesting aside to this is that, as a result of changes after the last state and the last federal elections and a change in ministers, there is some difficulty in getting continuing discussion about the achievement of the proper operation of this facility. But, as I said, that is a small example at a local level of a problem that I suggest is replicated right across the nation; that is, where the Commonwealth government has to come to an agreement with a state government about an approach which, for the person presenting for these services, would mean that they do not have to worry about what sphere of government is actually footing the bill.
We have other national problems, like the fact that in outer urban areas, such as in the electorate of Scullin, we have a low level of general practitioners to population. We sort of fall through the net: we are not remote or rural enough to get the full benefit of the incentives that are being put in place. However, we still have this problem. This is even though, as I have always said and as I have tried to get across to people, the northern suburbs of Melbourne are just as much a region as other places in Australia. They cannot be considered as just part of the four million strong Melbourne metropolis. These are things that will require an approach that is national in nature but can be achieved at the local level.
Earlier I mentioned one area where we have had a change in the relationship between governments: the environment. That was due to the external affairs provisions of the Constitution. It was acknowledged that there were other ways in which the Commonwealth government could have influence over decisions that were made at the state and territory levels. We see the continuing dilemmas of salinity and access to water. The general principle of putting in place a proper water rights policy is characterised by differences between the state and territory administrations. We have an example in the Murray-Darling Basin, where there was a need for all the state governments that were part of that catchment to come together and create a body to apply a whole of government approach to the many challenges of that catchment. In the early years of the Murray-Darling and its administration, Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and the Commonwealth were able to come together. However, the upper reaches of the catchment start in Queensland and that state was a latecomer to the process. This meant that there were impediments to a full catchment view of the way to achieve outcomes. Fortunately, that has changed.
But the challenges are so great that, if there is continuing nitpicking about which administration picks up the tab or which administration is to put in place the proper legislative or regulatory parameters to achieve improvements in the basin, nothing will be achieved. In fact, if we look again at the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin, there is a need for a longer-term view because these are problems that will not be reversed overnight. These problems took many decades to be created and, regrettably, will take many decades to be solved. So there is no use in seeing the horizon as just this budget or the next budget. The horizon has to extend over several decades and must include looking at how we might achieve our goals through different spheres of government coming to agreed positions.
We as a nation have to look at the way we engage in the different international fora available. We have to look at how best to have a national approach to, for instance, greenhouse gas emissions through engaging in the Kyoto protocol. We should not shy away. You can have an independent position while acknowledging that the best way to achieve outcomes is to sign up to collective international action. The Kyoto protocol is a prime example of how the present government has not been able to get its head around those types of matters. Regrettably, it is another example of how, for too long, we have waited for instructions from the United States administration; the United States administration is again playing the tune to which we dance. It is important to have an acknowledgment that, through the Kyoto protocol, we can achieve goals such as limiting greenhouse gas emissions with the agreement of the business community and the states and territories; and the Commonwealth can show great national leadership. I have spoken about the modernisation of parliament in the 21st century. I think we should also look at modernising our constitutional arrangements and modernising our robust democracy so we can have a longer term and a national view of how Australia as a nation confronts the many challenges before it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. Ten years ago last week, on 13 March 1993, I entered this place. Today I want to use the opportunity in my speech on the appropriation bills to reflect on the 10 years that I have spent in this place. Australia in 2003 is remarkably different from what it was like in 1993. Much has changed in my electorate and yet much has stayed the same. Franklin, the southernmost electorate in Australia, is a diverse electorate consisting of broadacre public housing areas, rural townships and Hobart suburbs on the east and south of the Derwent River. My electorate consists of four municipal regions: Huon, Kingborough, Clarence and Brighton. Each straddles the Derwent River yet each has a totally different make-up.
Tasmania back in 1993 was doing it tough. Population predictions forecast that Tasmania would have approximately 320,000 people in the year 2050. Property values were stagnant, small business saw little hope of expansion and consolidation, and our young people were leaving in droves. Tasmania still has problems to solve if we are to take advantage of the feeling of optimism that is currently sweeping across the whole state. It is great to see this sense of optimism. Tasmania really suffers from its small population, currently 476,000, which is spread across three regions. This is compounded by having a unique electoral system which, in my mind, is stifling Tasmania's development.
Unlike other states that have single member constituencies, the Hare-Clark system in Tasmania has multiple member electorates with five members in each of the five federal electorates. Traditionally this has led governments of both political persuasions to focus a disproportionate amount of state and Commonwealth moneys on the three northern electorates of Bass, Braddon and northern Lyons in an attempt to win seats. This political pork-barrelling has seen the duplication of infrastructure unheard of and unseen anywhere else in Australia in a similar population base. There are three university campuses, seven ports, four airports and two world-class cricket and football stadiums for 476,000 people. It is ridiculous. This is a stupid waste of money and has contributed to Tasmanian governments of all persuasions being unable to ensure real equity and adequate service provision in all departmental areas, especially in health, housing, education and employment.
We need a better working relationship between state and federal governments and a realistic nonpolitical spending program. That would, in my mind, see a far more responsive and effective service provision for all Tasmanians. Tasmania, because of its widespread population, requires really innovative approaches to adequately address its problems and alleviate its difficulties. I say that because, in the 10 years that I have been a federal member, the greatest impact on me has been the impact that state and Commonwealth governments in their decision making have had on families. I have 38,000 households in my electorate, which is a lot less than in most electorates in Australia. Over the last 10 years the pressure on families has been enormous. Our wages are less and our employment options are a lot less than anywhere else in Australia. In the 10 years that I have been a federal member, middle management has virtually disappeared from Tasmania in insurance, banking, multinational organisations and Commonwealth government agencies. They have all gone to Melbourne and Sydney. We do not have state managers of Telstra like we used to, or state managers of Qantas and the like—the decision makers are going.
What impact does this have on our young people who wish to get a degree and become middle managers in their later lives? They have realised that in order to succeed you need to leave Tasmania—perhaps do your years 11 and 12 on the mainland or go to university in Melbourne and Sydney and get on the same rung as all the other young aspiring middle managers. So they are leaving and they are not coming back. I have two daughters, both of whom were educated in universities in Melbourne. One is now in London and the other is in Melbourne. I do not think they will come back. The opportunities are not there, nor is the earning capacity. Sarah is 24 and she is earning $65,000 a year as an editor in a publishing company—money unheard of in Tasmanian terms, where you would not achieve that wage until you were 45. We need to look at options. This is putting pressure on families. In my family alone, we have suddenly lost our two kids. Are they ever coming back?
This pressure by state and Commonwealth governments—but more especially by the Commonwealth government—is resulting in less cohesion in families. Our community focus is starting to have gaps in it. There is a sense that families are now on their own. Who is your neighbour? I remember settling in my suburb back in 1977 after I returned from working as a teacher in South Australia. In my whole suburban area there are only two families still there out of the hundreds that were there in 1977. We do not know who our neighbours are. This pressure to survive has been increasing on our families in the last 10 years. Families are now appearing to sense that they are powerless and easily manipulated. These fears are starting to permeate through families, who are worried about what other races and creeds are doing in our society. There is a fear of being burgled and of being threatened. We fortify our houses. I am sad to say that our state governments perpetuate this at election times. I have seen some of these TV commercials on prime time television, where we see handcuffs and promises to be tough on crime. Ever since I have been involved in teaching and politics I have been preaching about early intervention. We talk about and espouse the strengthening of families, usually at election time—lower class sizes, more support for families and for communities—then the elections disappear and the promises are not kept.
I have spoken about pressures on families, such as the 1,000 families in my electorate that cannot access child care. There are enormous waiting lists in my electorate. I have mothers and fathers ring up and say: `Coles have offered me some extra hours. I am desperate for the money. What am I going to do? I cannot get any child care. I need a couple of hours here and a couple of hours there. I need my child cared for after school. Can you help me?' As I said, there are 1,000 families in my electorate that cannot do it. They have to come up with other options—second-class options—that are putting pressure on them. There is a sense of guilt with mum working a couple of hours at Coles or Woolworths, wondering who is looking after the kids and whether they are safe. We used to call them latchkey kids back in the seventies when we had the early disadvantage program. There is this sense of guilt. It stymies parents' job options and it places them in really invidious situations. Because of our low population of 476,000 the big money players in child care do not come down to our state. They are not interested because you cannot make a buck. So we have community based child-care centres, and they are under enormous pressure to provide places for these 1,000 families that want their children to have access to child care. But where is the money? As I said, the big money is not in Tasmania so we do not have the capacity to open new child-care centres. 
There is pressure on families when they want to go to the doctor. I am appalled that in Tasmania we have some of the lowest GP bulk-billing rates in Australia. Michelle O'Byrne in the seat of Bass is, I think, down to about 52 or 54. I have 56, and I have swathes of broadacre public housing areas. It is appalling. I have lots of rural areas. Trying to get a GP is virtually impossible. The only ones we get, for a very short time, are the foreign doctors, and we have a real hassle to keep those. If your kid gets sick in the country you are expected to go up to Hobart. I have private health insurance and yet, a couple of months ago when I thought I had broken my arm, I went to my private hospital and I could not believe it: `I'm sorry, Mr Quick, we have a facilitation fee before we see you, even though you have private health insurance.' That facilitation fee is $150. I managed to pay it on the plastic, but I thought of the low-income families in my electorate—and, as I said, our wages in Tasmania are a lot lower than anywhere else in Australia. Imagine families on low incomes if the little bloke breaks his arm or they think he has hurt himself and they rush him to the private hospital because there is a two- or three-hour wait at the  public hospital. They front up at the private hospital to hear: `I'm sorry, Mr Evans, we need a $150 facilitation fee before we look after your child.' It is another pressure on families.
There is the issue of housing in Tasmania. We have a lower home ownership rate and a larger public housing structure. I must agree that the First Home Owners Scheme was terrific. But I tell you what, the rich are taking advantage of it in Tasmania. We have real problems renting in Tasmania. You cannot rent a house in Hobart for love or money, unless you can afford the $400 to $550 a week for houses in Sandy Bay. The housing department have housing stock which is 50 years of age, I am ashamed to say. They have not got the money, they say, to refurbish the houses so they are selling them. I know a chap in Bridgewater, which is probably one of the most socially disadvantaged suburbs, who owns 14 of them. He is renting them out and making a nice killing. A friend of mine who is a real estate agent had a phone call from a chap in Brisbane who said, `Can I buy 50 of those housing department houses?' 
People are being punished by insurance companies for house and contents insurance by postcode. If you live in certain suburbs in the poorer, socioeconomically deprived areas, you are being punished. In this same suburb of Bridgewater you could buy a housing department house for about $55,000 to $60,000, but the banks require double the normal deposit. The mortgage insurers put the pressure on the banks to have double the deposit. But five kilometres up the road where you can buy a house for $120,000—which is double the debt—you need only half the deposit. What sort of situation is this? What sort of pressure is that putting on families? They have to double their debt because the mortgage insurers are forcing the banks and credit unions to say, `If these people go belly up, we won't get the return on our investment.' 
Child care, bulk-billing, trouble getting to see the doctor, housing, cost of amenities, private health insurance—that has gone up 14 per cent in the last two years—all place an enormous drag on people. Car insurance, house insurance—because of the collapse of HIH and what is happening with Enron and all the other big international companies—put pressure on people. The cost of petrol in Hobart is $1.06 a litre. If you are isolated out in these broadacre areas or in the rural areas, you are getting punished again. Private credit card debt is horrendous; I know how bad mine is. Other families are living on the plastic from week to week, month to month. Do the banks care? No. Dozens have disappeared in the 10 years that I have been in this place. They punish you every time you stand in front of a teller, when naturally you have a conversation about getting your money out.
We have the greatest proportion of aged care people in Australia in my electorate. We do not have the big money Moran group coming down to Tasmania, because you cannot make any money, like you cannot make money in child care, so all our nursing homes and hostels are serviced by not-for-profit providers. They are having real problems financing infrastructure and development of increased facilities for nursing homes and beds for hostels. I have been 10 years in this place; three years in government and seven years in opposition. I know which years I enjoyed the most. Despite the doom and gloom, I have great faith in the Australian people; they are pretty resilient. I am not a native-born Tasmanian; I have only been there since 1961. They are a wonderful group of people; I have a wonderful electorate. I am proud to have been their federal member for four terms. It was a bit of a change because, prior to me wandering into this place, they had a Liberal member, Bruce Goodluck, who was here for 17 years. He is a bit of a character.
What makes Tasmania's House of Representatives members rather unique is the fact that each has to be a little different, a bit of an oddball, because Tasmania has a uniqueness about it. But with only 470,000 people, we do need looking after. We have to have a realisation from Canberra that there are some unique areas of Australia—like, I guess, the electorate of the member for Kalgoorlie—that do need special consideration. It is okay as legislators to form legislation to cover, theoretically, 100 per cent of Australia's population, but there are areas of special need, of special interest and with special character. As I said, we have a population of 470,000—the honourable member for Sydney is here; she probably has that population in some of her suburbs—but we are spread over an island; we are an island state. We do have uniqueness and we do deserve consideration. Our child care, aged care and educational opportunities do need some special assistance. I address this to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as a former veterans' affairs minister: we do need consideration.
I urge the ministers who look after Tasmania, through the various agencies that they represent, to come down and see us. We will make you very welcome. Ten years is a long time. Today is a very decisive day in our nation's history. As other members have said in this debate, it is a time of uncertainty. We are not too sure what will happen. We are about to open Pandora's box. I think we need to look at where and how we spend our moneys and at the priorities. To my mind, Australian families should be the focus when looking at what we do and how we do it, and we need to develop a bipartisan approach to something that is at the centre of our existence.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—It is a significant and terrible day in Australia's history. We all anticipate that we will be officially at war by this afternoon, and many of us have heavy hearts in that respect. Yesterday in the chamber, I spoke about the reasons for my opposition to the war on Iraq. I do not propose to do so again today other than to say that it is with heavy hearts that we think about our soldiers overseas and about the Iraqi civilians who are facing massive bombardment and attacks on all the infrastructure they need just to survive. It is difficult, of course, to move to other issues in that context. However, one of the great tragedies of war is that things are overlooked when our attention is diverted overseas. As representatives, we also have a responsibility to continue to focus on the living standards of people in Australia, particularly the poor and most vulnerable, and to continue to protect and defend those standards. I am certainly doing my very best to focus on the industrial relations legislation that the minister has introduced into the parliament, which will affect collective bargaining for the poorest workers in Australia. I am also doing my best to focus on the decline in bulk-billing and on any number of other issues, including higher education, which I address in this debate today on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003.
We have seen the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, engaging in a number of reviews, some of which he has commissioned and then held onto for months at a time. He has not wanted to share them with his parliamentary colleagues, probably because of what those reviews find, because those reviews indicate that there is indeed a serious problem in higher education in this country. It seems strange to call something a crisis when we are facing this conflict in Iraq, but we have a very pressing decline in standards and in spending in higher education. We, therefore, have a shift in the number of students who are able to go to university and in the types of students who are able to afford it. That concerns me greatly. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee revealed that 53,925 qualified Australian students could not get a university place in 2002. That is a very substantial 33 per cent increase in one year in unmet demand for university places since 2001.
The most recent OECD study found that, amongst young adult Australians, the number of bachelor degree recipients in 1999 was 27 per cent. On the cost of educating those students, under the Howard government, the real value of university operating funds from the Commonwealth, including the HECS contribution, has fallen from $13,013 per subsidised student in 1996 to $11,840 in 2001—a cut in spending of $1,173 per student. If you take the HECS out and look at the government's contribution, it has fallen by $2,325 per student—from $11,687 in 1996 to $9,362 in 2001.
We know the tales of overcrowded lecture theatres. The ratio of staff to students between 1993 and 2001 rose from 14½ students per teaching staff member to 19.9 students per teaching staff member. That places the most enormous workload on those members of teaching staff and of course affects their ability to deliver an appropriate education to their students. It means handing out marks instead of genuinely engaging in the work that students are producing. It is clear that students are suffering from that. Those comments ignore the strain that is placed on the physical infrastructure of universities that we also hear so much about—students sitting on the stairs of lecture theatres or turned away from lectures because courses have been overenrolled. It is true also that university libraries have had to cut the purchase of books and periodicals, in part because of the fall of the value of the Australian dollar, which meant that overseas periodicals and books were much more expensive to publish—but that is not the only reason. The main reason is the significant loss of funding that they are faced with.
Australian students make amongst the highest level in the OECD of personal contributions to the cost of their education. Students now directly contribute a far greater share of the total of overall university revenue. They are contributing 30 per cent, which is made up of 18 per cent through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, two per cent through postgraduate fees and 10 per cent from international students. In US public universities, students contribute about 19 per cent of university revenue. In the US not-for-profit universities, that figure is still lower than the Australian figure, although only slightly lower. But that is in their private universities, the ones that we have come to think of as so expensive and so unaffordable for students—and they are doing slightly better than we are in Australia.
We have, by international comparisons, high student fees and low comparative graduate benefits. We are always told that students get a personal benefit from their university education, and indeed they do—there is no question of that. They are likely to earn higher wages over their lifetimes in general. But when you compare this to the OECD average, university graduates earn 60 per cent more on average than non-university graduates. In Australia, those with university qualifications earn 36 per cent more than those with just secondary school qualifications. While there is of course a private benefit, the earning potential of a person over their lifetime is obviously enhanced. It is not as much enhanced as in countries where students pay a smaller proportion of their own cost of their education. These high costs mean that people from low socioeconomic status backgrounds, people from regional and isolated areas and people from Indigenous communities are still suffering significant educational disadvantage. It does not take a brain surgeon to work out that as university degrees become more expensive people who come from poorer backgrounds feel that they are less able to afford them.
Many of the proposals that Minister Nelson has floated—some of them through leaks, some of them through sounding out his parliamentary colleagues and some of them in parliament—are extremely concerning. I think the whole university sector anticipates that there will be a deregulation of university fees, allowing universities to increase their fees by up to 25 per cent. The gap between the marks needed to get into full fee paying courses and HECS funded courses is already significant. It is up to 25 marks in some degrees; it is commonly around seven to nine marks.
As those full fee paying degrees become more expensive and people can afford them less, people with lower marks will obviously be able to get into those courses. It is a significant problem for the universities that people who are not able to qualify to get in the normal way are able to buy their way into a university course, perhaps without the skills to complete the degree properly. It is possible that students will be able to get a loan to pay the deregulated fees; students will be graduating with $100,000-plus debt at a time when they may be thinking about buying a house or starting a family. It makes their life choices much more difficult and delays their choices to have children and set up a home. Will the loans to pay those fees be subject to commercial interest rates? Who knows. They are in New Zealand, and the New Zealand model demonstrates that there has been a significant effect on the life choices of students. Students are delaying child-bearing and establishing businesses and are not paying for private health insurance—one of the big enthusiasms of this government—purchasing homes or making provision for retirement or superannuation.
As I said, there is the likelihood of the expansion of domestic full fee paying student places, and I have outlined why I think that that is a problem for the educational outcomes that universities are able to provide. Regional universities are facing significant problems as well. The proposed policy changes create a situation where the metropolitan universities—and I have several campuses in my electorate—will become elite universities. Sydney University was probably very happy with this proposal, and it is a very good university. However, the effect on regional universities may be quite disastrous as they become second-class universities with second-class funding. The proposals for specialisation and rationalisation of courses on a state basis or even a national basis will lead to course closures at small and regional campuses. There may be some cases where increased specialisation will be beneficial, but if regional universities become undergraduate universities only, with no research and no postgraduate work, that really will contract options for regional students.
The possible introduction of HECS fees for some TAFE students concerns me greatly as well. We have a number of significant skills shortages in this country at the moment. We have a TAFE system that is in many places very good but that would certainly benefit from increased funding. The minister is saying to students and parents that TAFE is not a second-class option. All of this is true and yet the government wants to make it more difficult for students to go to TAFE, not easier—less attractive instead of more attractive. This comes on top of a continued move by the federal government against student unions and teaching staff unions in universities. I cannot believe that we are once again going to have to battle about voluntary student unionism.
That reminds me that I had a phone call from one of my constituents yesterday who told me she was not going to pay the proportion of her tax dollar that was spent on defence because she did not think it was right that she had to pay for that when she was so opposed to the war. I sympathise with her predicament. However, it is a concern when we start saying that people can opt in and opt out of paying for services which they use—which is the case with student unions; they provide services for the most part, as well as representation for students—and we do it for such base ideological reasons as have been advanced by the government in the past about not training students to become unionists. We have to question the priorities of a government that is prepared to go to war with student unions when we have so many more important things on the domestic agenda and when student unions and tertiary teaching unions do such a good job. In both instances, their aim is to improve the quality of the education that students receive. Both teaching staff unions and student unions are well motivated and provide good services and yet this government, for ideological reasons, has to go after them.
In the final few minutes I have I want to speak about some comments that were made by Australian Democrats Senator Brian Greig a couple of weeks ago in the lead-up to the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Senator Greig was fortunate enough to be in Sydney that weekend and attended the Mardi Gras. He called New South Wales the `antigay state'. Representing the electorate I do, in the middle of metropolitan Sydney, I have got to say that we are probably the most diverse electorate in the country when you are talking about people of different sexualities. The idea that we are antigay is absurd. The idea that the New South Wales Labor government is antigay is absolutely absurd, and any look at our record proves that. 
New South Wales was the first state to amend antidiscrimination laws in 1982 to cover homosexuality. We legalised male homosexual sex in 1984. We funded the first government service for transgender and transsexual persons in 1984. We funded the 2010 youth refuge, the first gay and lesbian housing service for young people, in the 1980s. New South Wales Labor was the first government to assist in funding an AIDS council and to consult on HIV-AIDS in the 1980s. We voted for antivillification legislation in the 1990s. We established the police gay and lesbian liaison unit and funded the antiviolence project in the 1990s. In 1996 we amended a raft of laws to protect transgender persons from discrimination. In 1990 Labor passed the property relationships amendment act to ensure that same sex relationships and same sex carers enjoyed the same rights as heterosexual de factos. Same sex partners can now participate in decisions about a partner's treatment if they are ill, say goodbye to a partner who is dying, claim compensation if a partner dies in an accident, transfer property into joint ownership without having to pay stamp duty, automatically inherit a partner's assets if they die without a will, deal with bail applications, and be notified of a partner's mental illness. 
In 2001 Labor granted same sex superannuation rights to the extent possible under state legislation. Of course, the Commonwealth still refuses to address this issue. Anthony Albanese has had a private member's bill before the parliament for three or four years now about this issue and the Commonwealth still refuses to act. I have got a private member's bill that the government has shelved as well about ending discrimination against same sex partners when it comes to receiving Australian citizenship. In 2002 the New South Wales government introduced the missing pieces legislation, which amends 27 laws where discrimination against lesbians, gay men and transgender persons existed. 
Federal Labor governments funded HIV-AIDS treatment under Medicare and lifted the ban on gays and lesbians in the Defence Force. They were the first government in the world to pass sexual privacy laws through the human rights sexual conduct bill. I think you would remember that debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I do. I remember listening to it; of course, I was not elected at that time. We campaigned against the Tasmanian government's refusal to legalise consenting homosexual sex between adults and introduced immigration laws to allow gay men and lesbians to apply for permanent residency in the same way as heterosexual de facto couples. I think that Senator Greig's attack on the New South Wales government a couple of weeks ago really shows, basically, what is wrong with the Democrats. It is a cheap shot—having a whinge before the Mardi Gras, hoping to get a bid of media coverage—instead of developing a track record like the Labor Party has in reforming this important area of human rights and equality.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2003-03-20,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. As one of the last speakers on these bills, I want to bring the attention of the parliament to a particularly fine environmental and commercial operation that is coming together in my electorate of Hinkler. The fisheries of the world are finite. Edible fish products will run out if they are not protected, enhanced and harvested carefully over coming generations. As Third World countries become more focused on better lifestyles, the pressure on our edible sea stocks will become even greater. This makes the particular project I want to talk about today, Queensland Sea Scallops Ltd, a very attractive one. It is a consortium of 20 trawler owners and fish processors who have come together to build a scallop hatchery and a breeding, processing and marketing chain to enhance and market Australian fish products. Why is it good environmentally? It is good environmentally because it envisages that we will put a new resource into the waters off Australia. How will this be done? The company envisages that it will harvest brood stock from the wild. There will be no genetic modification. The scallop spat will be bred in captivity in a special hatchery, which will be located at Port Bundaberg. It will then be taken to sea in special tanks and placed on the sea floor. It grows to maturity—that is, to a 90-millimetre scallop—in nine months.
The Queensland government have approved two trial areas: one in Platypus Bay, in the centre of the western side of Fraser Island; and the other off Woodgate, which is the seaside resort for the township of Childers in my electorate. This project will give us 9,000 tonnes of scallop meat per year. That is extraordinary. If you want to look at it another way, it means that we will breed 72 million scallops a year. They will be put back into the environment and, as I said, they will be in no way genetically modified, coming as they do from wild brood stock. This is the right way to do it. The areas are going to be carefully monitored by the Queensland government to make sure that the placement is correct and that the environment of the water impoundment of Hervey Bay is kept in as near as possible to pristine condition.
Who put this project together? A number of people have claimed credit for it but my understanding is that Mr Sid McKeown of FishMak, a Bundaberg fish processing works, who is a man with a great deal of expertise in fishing, in marketing and, in earlier days, in the Department of Primary Industries, suggested this to a meeting in Bundaberg some years ago. It has since been taken up by this consortium of Queensland Sea Scallops Ltd, in which there are 20 participants. They then went looking for suitable sites in which to carry out their land based activities, generally in the southern part of central Queensland, eventually settling on a choice between Port Bundaberg and Urangan at Hervey Bay. A few weeks ago the company decided that they would locate the processing works at Port Bundaberg.
This is a great tribute not only to Ted Whittingham, the Chairman of Queensland Sea Scallops, and his partners but also to the Bundaberg Port Authority, which has shown considerable enterprise in this venture. The Bundaberg Port Authority is not a big port authority as port authorities go. Up until recent years, its main products were sugar, molasses, petroleum products and timber. But in the last 10 or 12 years it has spread its wings in the ample land it has in Port Bundaberg and has developed a three-stage marina. Its third stage, which will be completed in the near future, will contain 230 moorings with facilities for 70 to 80 trawlers. It is sad to say, with the member for Dawson here, that it has recently pipped Mackay as the second-highest customs and clearance port in Queensland. It is quite extraordinary that in such a short time it has gone on to become the second major landfall for international yachting tourists. 
But it goes beyond that. In that environment, there is a restaurant and a chandlery. It is also the embarkation point for the MV Lady Musgrave, which goes to the southern Great Barrier Reef; the Spirit of Musgrave, which takes whale watchers to the waters of Hervey Bay to see the extraordinary event of the whales' northern migration; and the Bundy Belle, which is a magnificently restored riverboat that brings people from Bundaberg to Port Bundaberg for dinner. In addition to that, there are three major fish processing works and a tertiary marine campus, the TAFE Queensland Marine Training Centre. These are all situated in this environment of Port Bundaberg.
It is little wonder, then, that on a competitive basis this environment was very attractive to Queensland Sea Scallops Ltd. Yes, there was intensive bidding for this particular project, and I am delighted that the Bundaberg Port Authority was the successful bidder. It has been subjected to some unfair criticism. One accusation was that it used $500,000 to attract this project, which is not true. What it is doing is building a common user infrastructure—an ocean pipeline—which this new firm and existing firms will use in their fish processing and for which they will be paying commercial rates. 
It has been said that the port authority has used a lot of strongarm influence. That is also not true. I am very close to that port authority, and it won this project largely on the quality of its submission—its sensitivity to the needs of this rather unique fish breeding, hatchery and harvesting arrangement. Not only that but it put the submission together with its own resources. It was open to any of the other bidders to bring in consultants if they wanted to and put their submissions together. It is a tribute to the port authority that it was able to put this together in-house and respond positively and sensitively to the needs of this enterprise. The enterprise, as I told you, will produce 9,000 tonnes of scallop meat a year over a period of eight years, or 72 million scallop shells. The total project will cost $126 million, at its peak it will employ 1,500 people and it will return $75 million to the wage structure of the Hervey Bay-Bundaberg environment.
As I said in my opening remarks, sea stocks are finite. We need to do a number of things in marketing our seafood. We must ensure that it is there for future generations, and projects like this—using natural non-genetically modified sea stocks and breeding them—will ensure that that happens. It will ensure that the Australian domestic market is always supplied with high-quality scallop meat. In addition to that, it will mean that Australia will have a top product to market internationally. The stage of this particular project that I have not talked about is the marketing. The whole idea, after having bred the spat, laid it on the seabed and harvested the meat, is to then have a vertically integrated marketing scheme. The trawlers and the fish processing works currently based in places like Gladstone or Hervey Bay will be able to take these scallops to their respective processing works or they can have them processed at the Bundaberg works. Regardless of where they are processed, they will be marketed as a top-quality, state-of-the-art Queensland product into the international market. The Queensland sea scallop, as the member for Dawson will readily know because she has a scalloping area off her port, is in high demand, especially in the Asian market. This vertical integration—from breeding tanks to the ocean floor to the processing works to an international marketing regime—will ensure that we value add at the highest level. 
I would particularly like to compliment Ted Whittingham, the Chairman of Directors of Queensland Sea Scallops, for his leadership and for his vision and the vision of the other 19 partners who brought this thing together. I am sure it is pleasing to environment and primary industries ministers to see the quality of leadership that this group has shown. The Bundaberg Port Authority, as I said, is not a big port authority in the greater scheme of things but it is a very focused one. It remits 95 per cent of its profit to the Queensland government, so it does not have a lot to play with. It has made it a truly fine marine environment and it is little wonder that Queensland Sea Scallops were drawn to this environment. I compliment the chairman of the board, Glen Toll, his fellow directors and particularly his chief executive officer, Phil Mumford, who carried the strain of putting this project together. 
We need to look at areas like Wide Bay—I am talking generically about Wide Bay, not about the electorate, because the Wide Bay area contains the electorates of Wide Bay, Hinkler and a little of Blair—because it has one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. We are generally in the worst three. It is not through any particular fault of this government or the previous one; it is an ingrained problem that will be solved only by government and private infrastructure. This is the sort of private infrastructure that needs to take place.
There has been a little spatting—I was going to use the word `spat', but it is hardly appropriate—at the margins on this issue, with the suggestion that some of the Hervey Bay processors might form a competitive consortium. That is their perfect right and I respect their right to do that. I think it is more important in this day and age to present the Wide Bay area as a corporately sound entity where people can invest with confidence and with deliberation. It is wrong to divide our forces when an opportunity such as this—a $126 million opportunity—is on our doorstep. It will benefit not only Queensland Sea Scallops but also the small fishing community of Burnett Heads, which is the adjoining community to Bundaberg; the Bundaberg district considerably, where there will be a lot of jobs available; the Wide Bay area; and Queensland, through the marketing of a superior product. I commend to the House this product and the people who have put it together.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-03-20,"—in reply—There has been a long and very substantial debate with contributions made by members from both sides of the House on these two additional estimates appropriation bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. The additional estimates bills request a total of $1,454.7 million—that is, $1,191 million in expenses; $69.4 million in payments to the states, primarily under the First Home Owners Scheme; and $194.3 million in capital injections, of which $124 million is required by the Department of Defence primarily for the purpose of acquisitions for operations. This additional funding is to meet the increased cost of inventory and specialist equipment purchases. The cost of the operation in Iraq will be dealt with in the current budget processes.
These bills embody the continuing commitment of the Howard government to sound economic and financial management. The bills seek funding for ongoing Commonwealth activities, including the alleviation of the hardship being experienced by those affected by the drought, sugar industry reform measures and enhancements of the physical security at Australia's overseas posts. It is regrettable that I do not have sufficient time to deal with all of the individual matters raised by honourable members on both sides of the House. But I do, in the time available to me, wish to comment on some of the matters raised by members opposite to set the record straight. 
The honourable member for Fraser claimed that, despite strong economic growth, the Howard government has left the economy extremely vulnerable. This is simply not true. Rather than being extremely vulnerable, Australia is one of the leading OECD economies. The OECD states that Australia's current and recent economic record places it amongst the top performers in the OECD. The OECD also expects the Australian economy to remain one of the top performers, projecting growth for Australia of 3.3 per cent in 2003 and 3.8 per cent in 2004. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics business indicator survey reported a 2.5 per cent increase in nominal gross operating profits of companies in the December quarter 2002. Notwithstanding some high-profile corporate failures during the past couple of years, the Reserve Bank of Australia has indicated that businesses in aggregate are carrying low levels of debt, have strong internal funding and have generally avoided the mistakes of overinvestment that have characterised past business cycles. In terms of the labour market, there have been 1.23 million net jobs created since March 1996, when the government was elected. Employment is growing at an average annual rate of three per cent over the 12 months to February 2003, compared with a 10-year average of 2¼ per cent. The unemployment rate is six per cent, compared with the unemployment rate of 8.2 per cent when the government was elected. This snapshot of some of the more important economic indicators suggests that the Australian economy is far from vulnerable.
The honourable member for Fraser also mused about the government's view on balanced fiscal policy. Let me just say that the government's primary fiscal objective is to maintain budget balance on average over the course of the economic cycle. This is derived from the broader principles of sound fiscal management laid down in the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998. This approach is intended to ensure that fiscal policy is formulated within a sustainable, medium-term framework. According to the OECD, the Commonwealth's:
... medium-term fiscal policy framework safeguards the sustainability of public finances over time ... (and) ... allows policy to react to short-term fluctuations to support growth.
The member for Fraser also accused the government of failing to keep the budget in surplus after a decade of strong economic growth. The government has had a good record in terms of achieving major cash surpluses. In 1997-98 it was $1.2 billion; in 1998-99, $4.2 billion; in 1999-2000, $12.7 billion; and in 2000-01, $5.7 billion. The government estimates that the cash surplus in 2002-03 will be $2.1 billion and surpluses in the order of $5 billion per year are reported in the forward estimates. In 2001-02 the recorded cash deficit was $1.1 billion. The deficit reflects the impact of high priority expenditure to support defence operations in Afghanistan, upgrading of domestic security and the protection of Australia's borders against people attempting to arrive in our country without authorisation. I might also remind honourable members that there was a strong demand for the first home owners grant and a decline in taxation collections in early 2002.
A few honourable members opposite have claimed that this government has imposed the highest level ever of income tax. The historical cash taxation revenue statistics allow an accurate comparison of changes in the Commonwealth's tax burden over time, as equivalent accrual taxation revenue statistics are not available. The decline in Commonwealth general government sector cash taxation revenue, from 23.5 per cent of GDP in 1996-97 to an estimated 20.9 per cent in 2002-03, is a direct comparison of the Commonwealth's tax burden over time. In 2002-03 and the forward years, the Commonwealth's tax share as a proportion of GDP is projected to remain below the minimum level reached in the five years preceding the introduction of the new tax system.
Honourable members opposite have also claimed that this government is responsible for the introduction of the biggest new tax in Australia's history, namely the goods and services tax. However, under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, GST revenue is paid directly to the states and territories. GST revenue is not available for expenditure by the Commonwealth. Consequently, the government considers the GST to be a state tax with the Commonwealth acting as a collection agent for the states.
Honourable members interjecting—
—It is misleading to simply add GST to Commonwealth tax revenue from 2000-01 onwards and compare that with Commonwealth tax levels over time. The members opposite ought not to interject, because we inherited a failed tax system that was unfair and outdated. If the GST were to be added to Commonwealth tax revenue, then all of the state taxes it replaces should also be subtracted in calculating the overall tax share.
The member for Fraser also raised concerns about superannuation being taxed four times and about record high levels of debt. Let me start by saying that research undertaken by the Treasury supports the view that superannuation is a tax preferred investment over a working lifetime for persons in all marginal tax brackets. The government provides substantial tax concessions to superannuation savings to encourage individuals to save for their own retirement, and the 2002 tax expenditure statement estimates the aggregate size of the tax expenditure for superannuation at $10.6 billion in 2002-03. The recent OECD report into Australia has found that although superannuation is taxed at three stages—that is, at contributions, earnings and benefits—it provides a similar result as a system which only taxes end benefits. This is consistent with the findings of World Bank research that Australian superannuation taxes over a working lifetime, while applying at three stages, are not high by world standards.
In terms of debt, at the end of the 2002 December quarter Australia's net foreign debt was $354 billion, or 48.9 per cent of GDP. However, I should point out that the vast majority of this debt is owed by the private sector—at 95.8 per cent, or $333.1 billion, in the September quarter 2002. Since this government has come to office, general government foreign debt has continued to decline significantly. The general government share of net foreign debt has fallen from 17.2 per cent in the March quarter 1996 to its current level of four per cent in the September quarter 2002.
As a proportion of GDP, government foreign debt has fallen from around 50 per cent upon our election to office in March 1996, following the peak of 54 per cent in September 1995, to approximately 8 per cent in September 2002. Additionally, Australia's ability to service its external liabilities is as strong as it has been for some time. The debt servicing ratio—the amount of exports required to pay the interest on net foreign debt—was 8.7 per cent in the December quarter and is well below the peak of 20 per cent recorded in the September quarter 1990 and 11.3 per cent in March 1996. A recent Treasury Economic Roundup, released on 31 January 2003, reported Australian net private wealth at market value grew by 10.9 per cent in real terms through the year to 30 June 2002. The growth rate in real net private sector wealth during the year to June 2002 was the highest for more than a decade. Therefore, despite increasing debt in the private sector, the value of private sector wealth is growing faster. Combined with low interest rates, this gives the private sector an increased capacity to borrow without increasing their debt-servicing burden.
The honourable members for Fraser, Shortland, Hasluck, Greenway and Braddon—to name a few—all made claims that, despite record high revenues, services are declining and the government is not investing in the future. This allegation has absolutely no foundation. The government is forward-looking. It produced Australia's first ever Intergenerational Report, which identified the fiscal implications of demographic change and other pressures over the next 40 years. The government is currently examining policies to address this issue, including measures to increase workforce participation—raising workforce participation builds human capital for the future.
The government has implemented several initiatives to improve labour market efficiency and productivity: Australians Working Together, Job Network and Backing Australia's Ability. Through these initiatives the government has allowed welfare recipients to keep more of their income support payments when they take up work, has enhanced labour market efficiency and has launched a $3 billion science and innovation strategy over five years, outlining increased investment in human capital.
Over the next three years, there will be an additional 6,000 university places, an additional $624 million for competitive research grants, $429 million in project specific and general research infrastructure grants to universities and approximately $230 million for new cooperative research centres. Measures such as the prestigious Federation Fellowships and the establishment of fifteen new major national research facilities are encouraging researchers to stay in Australia. In addition, the government has committed additional resources to increasing regional university places. Further, the government has had great success in improving vocational education and training opportunities for all Australians and the literacy and numeracy of Australian schoolchildren since 1996. In the remainder of this term, the government will focus primarily on initiatives in the area of higher education, which is crucial to Australia's future in a global economy. The government will shortly announce the first set of national research priorities, which will integrate Australia's science and research effort more closely with the community's economic, social and environmental goals and help to address the long term policy issues facing Australia.
The implementation of Australia's ambitious and comprehensive national competition policy over the past seven years has made a substantial contribution to the recent improvement in labour and multifactor productivity and economic growth. The Productivity Commission estimates that Australia's GDP is now about 2½ per cent higher than it otherwise would have been, and Australian households' annual incomes are on average around $7,000 higher as a result of competition policy.
Notwithstanding the member for Fraser's criticisms of the current measures of budget performance, I would like to state that following the successful introduction of accrual accounting in the 1999-2000 budget, the Department of Finance and Administration now compiles and disseminates budget information on both cash and accruals bases. Presenting dual measures of budget performance, the underlying cash balance as well as the accruals based fiscal balance provides a fuller picture of budget performance.
The member for Chifley has claimed that the government is reducing defence expenditure by $1 billion. This is simply not correct. Quite on the contrary, the budgeted statement of financial performance of the Defence portfolio additional estimates statement 2002-03 shows appropriations from the government rising over the next two years, from $18.2 billion at the 2002-03 budget to $19.3 billion in 2004-05. In the white paper the government provided an additional $27.6 million over the 10 years from 2000-01. There are also suggestions from the honourable member for Lingiari that there has been a reduction in funding for Indigenous Education Direct Assistance. Those opposite may be interested to know that there have been no cuts to this program for the Northern Territory. Indeed, the Commonwealth has actually increased the allocation for the Northern Territory by $1.163 million from last financial year. This is an overall increase in funding under the program of more than 14 per cent.
The economic record of this government is one of our proudest achievements. Since 1996, when the Howard government came to office, the Australian economy has embarked on a long term of strong growth with an average annual economic growth of around 3¾ per cent. The OECD gives Australia strong endorsement of its macroeconomic management and notes that the economy's impressive growth performance is the result of sound medium-term macroeconomic policy framework and economic reforms. The OECD notes that structural reforms across a broad front have assisted in making the economy notably resilient to both internal and external shocks. Accordingly, the OECD holds up Australia's commitment to reform, willingness to commission and accept expert advice, and capacity to adopt innovative approaches and build constituencies that support further reforms as things that other countries could learn from.
During this long expansion, inflation has been kept low, the unemployment rate has been reduced and interest rates have fallen to historic lows. The unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 per cent in 1996, when the government was elected, to six per cent in January 2003. Around 1.23 million jobs have been created since March 1996. Official interest rates have fallen from 7.5 per cent in 1996 to 4.75 per cent. The last change in interest rates was up 25 basis points in June 2002, a far cry from the peak of over 18 per cent under the previous Labor government. Interest rates in Australia are around the lowest in 30 years. Despite the drought and the subdued world economy, Australia's economic outlook remains solid. Following growth of 3.9 per cent in 2001-02, the economy is expected to grow by three per cent in 2002-03, supported by robust growth in consumer spending, continued strength in residential construction and strong business investment growth. The GDP grew by 0.4 per cent in the December quarter 2002 and by three per cent over 2002. This outcome is consistent with the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook of around three per cent growth in 2002-03.
Australia is in the midst of the worst drought in 100 years. Farm output is expected to fall by 17 per cent in 2002-03, and this will detract around three-quarters of a percentage point from overall GDP, giving GDP growth of three per cent. In the December quarter 2002, farm output fell by 15 per cent. It fell by 27 per cent over 2002. Non-farm GDP, however, is expected to remain robust and grow by around 3¾ per cent in 2002-03, driven by strong growth in domestic demand. Non-farm GDP grew by 3.9 per cent over the year to December 2002. A return to strong growth is forecast in 2003-04, assuming the end of the drought and a return to normal seasonal conditions. The recent rainfalls are positive signs of an increasing likelihood that there will be a timely end to the drought.
In his contribution to the debate the honourable member for Fraser moved an amendment to the second reading motion on this bill. I have already spoken to most of the issues raised in the amendment, so I do not wish to refer to each component. However, I do want to state that the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003, together with the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, continues the government's fiscally responsible management. Honourable members will not be at all surprised to know that the opposition amendment is not supported by the government. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 supports the government's prudent response to difficult times in the world economy and world security. Together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, it provides funds which are needed in order to maintain government activities and to contribute to the strong performance of the Australian economy. I do thank honourable members for their contributions to this debate and I commend both bills to the chamber.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-03-20,"—Today I want to take the opportunity provided by the adjournment debate to present an important message with regard to the Prime Minister kits that have  been returned to my electorate office. I did intend to go and return these personally to the Prime Minister but, with the events of this week, I suspect that he is a little busy. The people who took the time to return these kits to my office wanted to send a message to the Prime Minister, and I would like to read a few of their comments. The first reads:
Dear Mr Howard
I feel very disappointed in you and your Government.
This publication is full of fear as a direct consequence of your choice to support President Bush.
Fear is a destructive force and can push us into making a wrong choice. Choosing to support Bush is the wrong choice for Australia.
Fear only breeds more fear and violence. Australia is a peaceful multicultural country.
We are unique in the world.
Let us be a peaceful leader—have the strength to stand up for peace.
...			...				...
Please do not support Bush and involve us in another Vietnam.
That was from a mother of four, Susie Sabien. I also have the following message about the kit:
Waste of money. Money could be used for better use. Dental cover for pensioners. 33 months to get a tooth pulled unless hurting or 3 years for false teeth.
The Anderson family have returned a kit, as have the Carrucan family. Leo Rennie has written:
Would you please return the attached document to the office of the Prime Minister.
I do not subscribe to his politics of fear and regard this stunt as another part of his jigsaw to dehumanise asylum seekers, and to keep an element of fear in the Australian population, consistent with his approach to the Tampa crisis.
I was not sucked in then, and neither will the Australian population be sucked in next time around.
Another message reads:
Money could be used for better purposes, like for pensioners instead of taxpayers money.
Another comment is:
Money could be used for better purposes. It is a disgrace for an old age pensioner who had to come up with $350 for an angiogram test. It resulted [in] her daughter and son-in-law having to pay for her. Are they supposed to die if not in health funds. Start looking after the pensioners.
Another one reads:
Dear Mr Howard
Please note that we object to this propaganda being sent to us at great expense. We object to this and to our participation in the war in Iraq.
That was from Bev and Des Beattie from Ballarat. The final one says:
Dear Mr. Junior Vice-President of America,
Thank you for this latest example of your unique version of the old `divide and conquer' principle. However, I find it somewhat disappointing that `illegal immigrants' weren't mentioned anywhere in this document, but I'm sure you'll redress this oversight in the very near future.
I look forward to being kept on edge until the next election.
Tremblingly Yours,
Joe Poley
The Knight family from Doveton Street has returned its kit, as has Mrs M. Tonkin—and the list goes on. Some 30 kits have been returned to my office. I did not put out a call for these to be returned to my office; in fact, I was somewhat surprised that they were, given that I am a Labor member of parliament. I did not expect that I would be receiving them. Many people wanted to return the kits directly to the Prime Minister, but unfortunately we will never know exactly how many because Australia Post have been shredding the returned documents—and we are not sure whether they have been directed to do so or have done it of their own accord. I suspect that quite a lot more than 30 were returned from my electorate.
The politics of fear has been encouraged by these documents. The returning of the kits shows that people in my electorate did not think it was a worthwhile exercise to spend $15 million of taxpayers' money on them. What they want to see, particularly in the current context, is more spending on upgrading our security. Bags are not regularly screened through our airports. We are still not screening a large proportion of containers as they come into the country. There is no screening at some of our airports. The member who represents Burnie airport has certainly made his voice heard in the parliament on this. It is very important that we spend money on upgrading our security and not on just sending out documents—documents which many people in my electorate did not think were worth while. I congratulate those who have taken the time to write messages. I seek leave to table the `An Important Message from the Prime Minister' kits which have been returned by people in my electorate.

The Victorian Sponsors Network Group for Supplementary Services (SUPS) wrote to the Department of Family & Community Services in October 2000 regarding Commonwealth funding for the SUPS program.
On 13 December 2001 correspondence was received by Minister Vanstone's Office from the Local Governments Association of the Northern Territory on behalf of a number of remote Aboriginal Communities regarding Centrelink services.
	(b)	(part 2)
The Victorian State office of the Department has addressed these issues by working in partnership with the SUPS sponsors to:
·	Clarify what the Department expects for the funding a sponsor receives and therefore the role of the SUPS worker;
·	Identify and address the key issues associated with the current funding model; and 
·	Investigate service delivery models that are not solely based on a worker model.
Centrelink conducted a review of what was then the Community Agent Program in 2001, taking into account many of the issues raised in the 1997 Local Government Association of the Northern Territory Report. The letter to Minister Vanstone reflected issues raised in the report. The report stated that Northern Territory local government councils were not being properly reimbursed for costs incurred in the delivery of agency-type arrangements. The key issues raised in relation to the then Community Agents Program were:
1. An increase in payment made under the Community Agent Program to cover the cost incurred by remote local government councils and an expansion of the program to cover all remote communities; and 
2. The establishment of “Centrelink Access Points”.
As a result of this review, Centrelink implemented an Integrated Centrelink Agent and Access Point Servicing Model from 1 July 2002, which combined the Community Agent Program and the National Rural and Regional Servicing Strategy. The new model aligns service expectations to current client agency business requirements and removes remuneration and resource inequities.
