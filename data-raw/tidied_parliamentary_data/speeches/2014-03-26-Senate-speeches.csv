Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (09:31):  The opposition will be supporting the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. I think people in the wider community know that Labor has always believed it is important to have a sustainable private health insurance industry in Australia. We know that over the last few years this has been a contested area. I am not sure, but I think several times in this place we have had private health insurance bills that have been debated quite robustly—I think that is the term we could use. 


The indexation of the private health insurance rebate is something introduced by Labor. It is a budget initiative; it was introduced as a budget process. It is expected to raise about $700 million in savings over the forward estimates. The bill before us does not change that budget position. Basically, the bill looks at the way private health insurers make the calculation to apply the legislation that was previously put through. On that basis, I acknowledge the representations from insurers that the process we now have with the amendment will require less administration. But what is of even more importance is that the rights of policyholders are not undermined. 


Consistently through our debates in this place we have been looking at the rights, the security and the engagement of the consumer. This industry in particular depends on people who make the personal choice to take up private health insurance, and I want to acknowledge the representations from the consumer organisations as well as from the insurers about this process. After all, it is a common goal that we make private health insurance work. The intent of this is that it will require less administration on the behalf of private health insurers and it will be easier to implement. The concepts and the arguments that have been put to us by private health insurers have made it clear that this is something they want. When Labor introduced the change last year there was a debate about whether the indexation should be calculated at the product level, as it was in the original process, at the industry level or at the individual insurer level. One of the principal concerns put by the then Department of Health and Ageing, currently the Department of Health, was that implementing the indexation at an industry level, as is proposed in this bill, would put smaller insurers at a competitive disadvantage. That was an argument that we took very seriously, and I think it is important to note that we have listened to people who have come forward with arguments. In the subsequent months smaller insurers, including the peak body, have put it to the opposition that this amendment will make it easier to implement and will require less administration. 


The intent of Labor's proposed implementation model was that it would create greater competition and transparency for consumers. It is necessary, absolutely, for the government to demonstrate how this bill will increase transparency and competition. Labor will always support measures that enhance competition, which is consistent with our position that there be a sustainable private health insurance sector in this country. We are the party that is capable of improving competition, but standing up always for consumers. 


The government is about promoting competition but sometimes we believe the roll and the absolute importance of consumers can get lost in the argument. So far the government has approved—and it is important to note this, Mr Deputy President—the biggest increase to private health insurance premiums in almost a decade, and this raises concerns about affordability for consumers. The government supports a private health insurance industry having greater involvement in the delivery of health care in Australia, but it is really important that any arguments about further engagement of the private health industry are not about breaking up Australia's system of universal health care and creating a two-tier health system, which exist in places like the United States.


This is an ongoing discussion because there are great concerns about maintaining the integrity of Medicare and a universal health system. We need to maintain the argument, which is more than just yelling at each other or taking entrenched positions; we must ensure that we have the maturity to listen to the arguments carefully to achieve the best possible system. The commitment and the respect that the Labor Party has for Medicare is on record; and that will continue to be part of any future debate. One of the things that colours the discussion is the likely sale Medibank Private. As a consumer of Medibank Private, I always put on the record that I have a personal interest in what is happening to the scheme, which I first joined as a Commonwealth public servant when the old Health Insurance Commission morphed into what we now know as Medibank Private.


In previous debates there has been considerable criticism by the coalition in opposition that the changes the Labor government introduced would undermine the integrity and security of the private health insurance industry and affect the number of people making the personal choice—it is important to acknowledge that it is a personal choice—to take up private health insurance. We know that there are a number of issues surrounding the legislation that encourage that choice; indeed, the legislation states that if you do not take up private health insurance or if you do not take extra cover as you age, there will be taxation implications. Nonetheless, we are always talking about a market industry, and so private insurance agencies and firms need to convince individuals that they have a valuable product to offer and that real choice exists in the market to provide them the options they need in the health system. Private health insurance must always be a market exercise, and that private choice must always be important in anything we do. 


We know that at the moment 47.7 per cent of Australians have private insurance for hospital cover and 55 per cent have general cover. We need to keep those figures in mind, and in any debate we need to know that private health schemes are transparent, accountable and inform people precisely of their coverage. It is not in anybody's interest to have skyrocketing private health premiums; and that is something that this parliament and the Community Affairs Legislation and References Committees will continue to watch very closely. We are supporting this bill and we acknowledge the range of people who have been involved—especially the public servants in the department who have provided many valuable briefings and documentation which manages to explain complex matters. Amidst the debate it is very comforting to know that there are people in the department who are always available to provide information. Sometimes that will be at strange times of the night as, if I remember correctly, when working with the community affairs committee. Nonetheless, they provided the security that we had the information we needed. We welcome the fact that the private health insurers themselves have worked with both our government and the current government to put forward their case about how this indexation process will work. We support the legislation and we welcome it coming into place.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:40):  I rise to support the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. Following Senator Moore, I remind the chamber and those who may be listening that more than 10 million Australians have some form of private health insurance. It is critically important to recall the fact that these people come from all socioeconomic levels in Australian society and from all age ranges. Especially they are young married couples, young families, who have the challenge ahead of them and those at the other end of the age spectrum who will always be needing health services. Therefore, anything that interferes with the integrity of the private health insurance system must be observed with some degree of fear and apprehension. That is why I support the legislation.


Indexing the private health insurance rebate is one of several measures introduced by the previous Labor government which adversely affected Australians taking responsibility for their health through private health insurance. This legislation should help to address that. While the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill will make indexing the government rebate simpler for funds to administer, the reality is that providers have been opposed to indexing because it may lead to a change in decision making by members of funds. Their premiums will steadily increase as the rebate diminishes over time, and that is of concern. It may lead funds to downgrade the quality of service and the level and breadth of protection that members currently enjoy, or people may drop their private health cover altogether, which is inevitably going to adversely affect their own health outcomes and place more pressure on the already overloaded public system.


That brings me to the objective, which is to simplify the current implementation arrangements for indexing the government's contribution to the rebate by amending the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. This creates a single adjustment factor under a legislative instrument, and I am pleased to see that the Labor Party is supporting this thrust by the government. It will be adjusted uniformly across all insurance policies on 1 April each year by a factor to be determined in accordance with the Private Health Insurance (Incentives) Rules. This is an incredibly important feature for administrative purposes and, ultimately, for those who have premiums. The adjustment factor will be a ratio representing the proportion of the increase in the CPI compared to the average private health insurance premium increase. That should give some level of stability. 


It is interesting that at the moment—and this is advice from industry—there are over 34,000 policies on the market. The burden placed on insurers to comply with the application of a unique rebate for each policy type is estimated to be in excess of $15 million in implementation costs alone, and those costs inevitably go back into premiums. That is what we want to see stopped. The industry has advised that, according to minister, the bill will result in administrative savings of around 80 per cent of the cost of implementing the previous Labor government's Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Base Premium) Act 2013. 


All of these factors point to the need for Australians to remain in private health insurance funds and for them to be attracted to do so. Indexing private health insurance rebates has been the wrong way to proceed. This legislation at least improves the circumstance. It will simplify it, get it to a stage where there is a once-only annual change and, at the same time, it will encourage those who are already participating to remain in private health and encourage young people to come into the private health system. 


I, like Senator Moore, hope that we will have a robust discussion about the future of our provision and delivery of health services in this country. I was in the United States during the three months of last year when the Obamacare issue was so hotly debated, and it all turned on young people signing up. As people unashamedly said, it is going to be the premiums paid by young people that will fund the system for Americans into the future. None of us want to see here the debacle that is currently going on in the United States.


I commend the amendment bill to the chamber.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (09:45):  I would like to thank members who contributed to the debate on this bill. The Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 simplifies implementation arrangements of the previous government's base premium measure. 


The previous government's changes would have applied at a product level and would have effectively led to a different rebate for each policy type—cumbersome to administer and difficult for consumers to understand. This bill amends the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to create a single adjustment factor under a legislative instrument. The rebate will be adjusted uniformly across all insurance policies each 1 April by a factor to be determined in accordance with the Private Health Insurance (Incentives) Rules. The adjustment factor will be a ratio representing the proportion of the increase in the consumer price index compared to the average private health insurance premium increase. Industry has advised that this bill will result in a significant administrative saving to the cost of implementing the previous government's base premium act. The bill is also making a minor amendment to clarify the definition of a 'restricted access group'. 


In summary, this bill will reduce the complexity for consumers and alleviate a considerable administrative burden for insurers. The government recognises the importance of private health insurance as a pillar of our health system and respects the sacrifice made by many Australians to provide for their own health care.

 (South Australia) (09:47):  I am sorry that I was not here during the second reading stage of the bill.

Annual report by Productivity Commission



   (1) The Productivity Commission must, as soon as practicable after 30 September in each year, give the Minister a report, for presentation to the Parliament, relating to changes in the composition of the persons insured under insurance policies issued by each private health insurer during the financial year ending on 30 June in that year.


Note: See also section 34C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which contains extra rules about periodic reports.


   (2) The report must include:


      (a) information about the number of persons who have ceased to be insured, and the number of persons who have downgraded their level of insurance, under insurance policies that *cover *hospital treatment during that financial year; and


      (b) information about the number of persons who have ceased to be insured, and the number of persons who have downgraded their level of insurance, under insurance policies that cover *general treatment during that financial year; and


      (c) information about the age and income tax bracket of those persons who have ceased to be insured, or who have downgraded their level of insurance, under insurance policies that cover hospital treatment or general treatment during that financial year; and


      (d) any recommendations from the Productivity Commission for addressing:


         (i) reductions in the number of persons insured under insurance policies that cover hospital treatment or general treatment; and


         (ii) people electing to downgrade their level of insurance under insurance policies that cover hospital treatment or general treatment.


   (3) However, the report must not include any information that would enable an individual to be identified.


   (4) The Minister must publish on the Department's website the report, and a written response to the report, within 60 days after the first day on which the report is laid before a House of the Parliament in accordance with section 34C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.


By way of background, I support the measures in this bill. They are an important move in simplifying the new indexation measures and reducing red tape for private health insurers. I would have liked the government to have gone further and repeal the measures relating to the base premium altogether. I believe it is bad for consumers and bad for insurers, because our health care system does rely on that balance between the public and private sectors.


Part of keeping that balance is having detailed information of what kind of health cover people have and how they respond to changes in government policy and economic fluctuations, because without that information we cannot make informed policy decisions. In 2012, when parliament was debating the former government's private health insurance reforms, I raised concerns that the measures in the bill would lead to consumers dropping their ancillary cover and only keeping the bare minimum required to avoid penalty. In my view, these ancillary services—such as optical, physio, occupational therapy, dental and so on—play a vital part in preventive health measures. If people drop their cover for these services and therefore do not seek treatment, we will be looking at a far bigger health bill down the track when a problem that could have been addressed through physiotherapy, for instance, now requires surgery. 


It is worth repeating some of the comments from the Community Affairs Legislation Committee into the former government's bill. It was estimated that the removal of the Lifetime Health Cover loading from the rebate would be a significant cost to consumers. The GMHBA estimated that the removal of the Lifetime Health Cover loading component of private health insurance premiums would result in a further one per cent to 18 per cent—an average of 10.6 per cent—price increase from 1 July 2003 for those with Lifetime Health Cover loadings. This would impact on approximately 17.9 per cent of GMHBA memberships—approximately 40,000 individuals. In simple terms, the removal of the rebate means a 42 per cent increase in the loading for these members. I think it is fair to say that that was a prediction, but there has been a significant increase in private health insurance premiums. But we do not know sufficiently what the level of ancillary cover drop-out has been. Further, Bupa expressed their concerns about the regulatory burden on providers relating to the base premium, saying:


Bupa is concerned that the Government has not considered the considerable regulatory burden that the proposed implementation of CPI indexation will have on industry. Annual rebate certificate audits will be progressively more complex and expensive, this alone will add significant cost for all insurers, which they have no control over.


They also made some other comments in relation to that.


This feedback is consistent with comments that I have had from other providers. I think it is vitally important that we have an ongoing picture of the changes and shifts between the public and private health systems so that we can have a proper understanding of the impact of health policy. If somebody drops out of their optical cover or their dental cover and they need to go to the public system as a result of their dropping out of the ancillary cover, I think we need to know that, because that begs the question whether the public system needs more funding to deal with that situation.


This amendment that I have moved is similar to an amendment that was moved to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives package of bills by the former government in 2012. This amendment would require the Productivity Commission to collect and report on information from the private health sector each year; to collate the information, including data about the number of people who have changed their coverage or opted in or out altogether; and present it and any recommendations to the minister. The minister must publish the report and a written response from the government on the Department of Health's website within a certain time frame.


When I originally moved this amendment in 2012 the coalition supported it. I am pleased to say that I have had representations from the minister's office and that they still do support the intent of the amendment, although they have some concerns about the specific clauses and wording. To be fair to the government, when they were in opposition they did not have the benefit of having advice from the department in relation to this amendment—which I called the 'Roberts amendment'—named after the ABC journalist, George Roberts, who bailed me up at the Senate doors one morning, asked me a series of questions and then gave me the idea for this amendment. So he is to blame—and I hope he did not have to flee the country to Indonesia as a result of my naming the amendment after him!


So I would like to hear from the government. I have had some constructive discussions with the minister's office in respect of this. I would like to hear from the government whether they still support the intent of this amendment and, if they consider it to be a good amendment in intent and in policy, what they say they will do to try to implement this, and we can progress this. If you want to have good public policy, particularly in an area as important as health, we need the information. Whatever side of the debate you are on—whether the private or public sector or somewhere in between—having that information would be very valuable in framing the public policy debate. So I hope I can get the sort of undertaking that the minister can provide in terms of Mr Dutton's office. If the Assistant Minister for Health can assist me in respect of that, it would be very useful. I think this is a necessary piece of information we need and the information must be obtained, collated and used.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (09:53):  I thank Senator Xenophon for moving the amendment and, indeed, for his contribution. I do understand that we move through speeches with a little more alacrity than he might otherwise have thought. So I do thank you for the comments that you have made in the context of moving your amendment in the committee stage.


While we do not support the amendment as proposed today by Senator Xenophon, the government is supportive of the underlying concept proposed by Senator Xenophon through the amendment. We are supportive of the intent and we do appreciate the discussions that have taken place between the government and the senator. We believe that the increased understanding of the annual changes to the make-up of private health insurance membership is important, especially with regard to those who drop or downgrade their cover. Indeed, Senator Xenophon indicated that the coalition did support a similar set of amendments in 2012, and I do appreciate the comment from Senator Xenophon that, having moved into government, having the support of a significant department can bring out a range of measures that previously had not had the similar level of consideration. I do appreciate you saying that, Senator Xenophon.


The government has identified a number of technical issues regarding the implementation of the amendment, and it is for that reason that we are not supporting it in the current form. We have had preliminary discussions with Senator Xenophon, as he indicated, and I can certainly say to Senator Xenophon that we look forward to working with him and with the private health insurance industry to develop this proposal further in the period ahead.

Secondly, what consultation will there be with both the private health insurers and the public systems in the various states? If there is a drop in some sorts of ancillary cover and it puts pressure on our public system, surely we should know that as well. Secondly, what sort of time frame is the government looking at to implement what it considers to be a reasonable and sensible amendment, or the intent of these amendments, to provide this further information so that we can actually have some better public policy in this space?

The issues around the technicalities are predominantly around the tax bracket and definitional problems around the issue of downgrade. In those technical areas, I think we would need to have some clarity in relation to moving forward with this. As we have indicated, we support the intent of it, and I think we can work through those more technical issues as we go further through this process.


Of course it is always very important, as it is in this case, to ensure we have consultation with the sector. That will take a little time, so I cannot indicate to the senator a particular date by which the consideration may be completed, but I can certainly indicate to the senator that the government's intent is to have the consideration in a timely manner, again recognising the view of the senator and the fact that the intent of the matter is something that is agreed to by the government.

If it is a simple answer that we get from the sector, we would imagine that it would happen in a reasonably short time frame.


So I am not obfuscating, Senator Xenophon, it is just the fact that within this environment we are going to need to talk to industry about how some of those things operate before we can give you any definite time. But when I say 'in a timely manner', I think you would understand, Senator Xenophon, that the intent of the government is to do this in the most efficacious way possible.

There are issues around privacy, and you are aware of that, Senator Xenophon—you have made an effort in your amendment to look at those issues—but we want to be convinced about them. It is an issue raised by consumers all the time and, dare I say, we are also a little concerned about the issues of red tape. How do we make the process efficient, effective and transparent?

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (09:31):  The opposition will be supporting the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. I think people in the wider community know that Labor has always believed it is important to have a sustainable private health insurance industry in Australia. We know that over the last few years this has been a contested area. I am not sure, but I think several times in this place we have had private health insurance bills that have been debated quite robustly—I think that is the term we could use. 


The indexation of the private health insurance rebate is something introduced by Labor. It is a budget initiative; it was introduced as a budget process. It is expected to raise about $700 million in savings over the forward estimates. The bill before us does not change that budget position. Basically, the bill looks at the way private health insurers make the calculation to apply the legislation that was previously put through. On that basis, I acknowledge the representations from insurers that the process we now have with the amendment will require less administration. But what is of even more importance is that the rights of policyholders are not undermined. 


Consistently through our debates in this place we have been looking at the rights, the security and the engagement of the consumer. This industry in particular depends on people who make the personal choice to take up private health insurance, and I want to acknowledge the representations from the consumer organisations as well as from the insurers about this process. After all, it is a common goal that we make private health insurance work. The intent of this is that it will require less administration on the behalf of private health insurers and it will be easier to implement. The concepts and the arguments that have been put to us by private health insurers have made it clear that this is something they want. When Labor introduced the change last year there was a debate about whether the indexation should be calculated at the product level, as it was in the original process, at the industry level or at the individual insurer level. One of the principal concerns put by the then Department of Health and Ageing, currently the Department of Health, was that implementing the indexation at an industry level, as is proposed in this bill, would put smaller insurers at a competitive disadvantage. That was an argument that we took very seriously, and I think it is important to note that we have listened to people who have come forward with arguments. In the subsequent months smaller insurers, including the peak body, have put it to the opposition that this amendment will make it easier to implement and will require less administration. 


The intent of Labor's proposed implementation model was that it would create greater competition and transparency for consumers. It is necessary, absolutely, for the government to demonstrate how this bill will increase transparency and competition. Labor will always support measures that enhance competition, which is consistent with our position that there be a sustainable private health insurance sector in this country. We are the party that is capable of improving competition, but standing up always for consumers. 


The government is about promoting competition but sometimes we believe the roll and the absolute importance of consumers can get lost in the argument. So far the government has approved—and it is important to note this, Mr Deputy President—the biggest increase to private health insurance premiums in almost a decade, and this raises concerns about affordability for consumers. The government supports a private health insurance industry having greater involvement in the delivery of health care in Australia, but it is really important that any arguments about further engagement of the private health industry are not about breaking up Australia's system of universal health care and creating a two-tier health system, which exist in places like the United States.


This is an ongoing discussion because there are great concerns about maintaining the integrity of Medicare and a universal health system. We need to maintain the argument, which is more than just yelling at each other or taking entrenched positions; we must ensure that we have the maturity to listen to the arguments carefully to achieve the best possible system. The commitment and the respect that the Labor Party has for Medicare is on record; and that will continue to be part of any future debate. One of the things that colours the discussion is the likely sale Medibank Private. As a consumer of Medibank Private, I always put on the record that I have a personal interest in what is happening to the scheme, which I first joined as a Commonwealth public servant when the old Health Insurance Commission morphed into what we now know as Medibank Private.


In previous debates there has been considerable criticism by the coalition in opposition that the changes the Labor government introduced would undermine the integrity and security of the private health insurance industry and affect the number of people making the personal choice—it is important to acknowledge that it is a personal choice—to take up private health insurance. We know that there are a number of issues surrounding the legislation that encourage that choice; indeed, the legislation states that if you do not take up private health insurance or if you do not take extra cover as you age, there will be taxation implications. Nonetheless, we are always talking about a market industry, and so private insurance agencies and firms need to convince individuals that they have a valuable product to offer and that real choice exists in the market to provide them the options they need in the health system. Private health insurance must always be a market exercise, and that private choice must always be important in anything we do. 


We know that at the moment 47.7 per cent of Australians have private insurance for hospital cover and 55 per cent have general cover. We need to keep those figures in mind, and in any debate we need to know that private health schemes are transparent, accountable and inform people precisely of their coverage. It is not in anybody's interest to have skyrocketing private health premiums; and that is something that this parliament and the Community Affairs Legislation and References Committees will continue to watch very closely. We are supporting this bill and we acknowledge the range of people who have been involved—especially the public servants in the department who have provided many valuable briefings and documentation which manages to explain complex matters. Amidst the debate it is very comforting to know that there are people in the department who are always available to provide information. Sometimes that will be at strange times of the night as, if I remember correctly, when working with the community affairs committee. Nonetheless, they provided the security that we had the information we needed. We welcome the fact that the private health insurers themselves have worked with both our government and the current government to put forward their case about how this indexation process will work. We support the legislation and we welcome it coming into place.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:40):  I rise to support the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. Following Senator Moore, I remind the chamber and those who may be listening that more than 10 million Australians have some form of private health insurance. It is critically important to recall the fact that these people come from all socioeconomic levels in Australian society and from all age ranges. Especially they are young married couples, young families, who have the challenge ahead of them and those at the other end of the age spectrum who will always be needing health services. Therefore, anything that interferes with the integrity of the private health insurance system must be observed with some degree of fear and apprehension. That is why I support the legislation.


Indexing the private health insurance rebate is one of several measures introduced by the previous Labor government which adversely affected Australians taking responsibility for their health through private health insurance. This legislation should help to address that. While the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill will make indexing the government rebate simpler for funds to administer, the reality is that providers have been opposed to indexing because it may lead to a change in decision making by members of funds. Their premiums will steadily increase as the rebate diminishes over time, and that is of concern. It may lead funds to downgrade the quality of service and the level and breadth of protection that members currently enjoy, or people may drop their private health cover altogether, which is inevitably going to adversely affect their own health outcomes and place more pressure on the already overloaded public system.


That brings me to the objective, which is to simplify the current implementation arrangements for indexing the government's contribution to the rebate by amending the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. This creates a single adjustment factor under a legislative instrument, and I am pleased to see that the Labor Party is supporting this thrust by the government. It will be adjusted uniformly across all insurance policies on 1 April each year by a factor to be determined in accordance with the Private Health Insurance (Incentives) Rules. This is an incredibly important feature for administrative purposes and, ultimately, for those who have premiums. The adjustment factor will be a ratio representing the proportion of the increase in the CPI compared to the average private health insurance premium increase. That should give some level of stability. 


It is interesting that at the moment—and this is advice from industry—there are over 34,000 policies on the market. The burden placed on insurers to comply with the application of a unique rebate for each policy type is estimated to be in excess of $15 million in implementation costs alone, and those costs inevitably go back into premiums. That is what we want to see stopped. The industry has advised that, according to minister, the bill will result in administrative savings of around 80 per cent of the cost of implementing the previous Labor government's Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Base Premium) Act 2013. 


All of these factors point to the need for Australians to remain in private health insurance funds and for them to be attracted to do so. Indexing private health insurance rebates has been the wrong way to proceed. This legislation at least improves the circumstance. It will simplify it, get it to a stage where there is a once-only annual change and, at the same time, it will encourage those who are already participating to remain in private health and encourage young people to come into the private health system. 


I, like Senator Moore, hope that we will have a robust discussion about the future of our provision and delivery of health services in this country. I was in the United States during the three months of last year when the Obamacare issue was so hotly debated, and it all turned on young people signing up. As people unashamedly said, it is going to be the premiums paid by young people that will fund the system for Americans into the future. None of us want to see here the debacle that is currently going on in the United States.


I commend the amendment bill to the chamber.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (09:45):  I would like to thank members who contributed to the debate on this bill. The Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 simplifies implementation arrangements of the previous government's base premium measure. 


The previous government's changes would have applied at a product level and would have effectively led to a different rebate for each policy type—cumbersome to administer and difficult for consumers to understand. This bill amends the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to create a single adjustment factor under a legislative instrument. The rebate will be adjusted uniformly across all insurance policies each 1 April by a factor to be determined in accordance with the Private Health Insurance (Incentives) Rules. The adjustment factor will be a ratio representing the proportion of the increase in the consumer price index compared to the average private health insurance premium increase. Industry has advised that this bill will result in a significant administrative saving to the cost of implementing the previous government's base premium act. The bill is also making a minor amendment to clarify the definition of a 'restricted access group'. 


In summary, this bill will reduce the complexity for consumers and alleviate a considerable administrative burden for insurers. The government recognises the importance of private health insurance as a pillar of our health system and respects the sacrifice made by many Australians to provide for their own health care.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:30):  I thank Senator Xenophon for his courtesy. I just want to place on record the Labor opposition's attitude to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. The chamber may or may not be aware that this is legislation that was first enacted a very long time ago in 1974 and established what has become a well-regarded and successful scheme to support Australian small- and medium-sized businesses exporting to the rest of the world. It is obviously a scheme predicated on Labor's strong view that Australia's current and future prosperity requires a strong trading sector, and it is our strong view that it is important that small- and medium-sized businesses in this country are assisted and facilitated in their capacity to export to the rest of the world. As I said, it was a 1974 initiative of the Whitlam government which established the original grants scheme, which demonstrates Labor's longstanding view of the importance of trade and our longstanding view of the importance of supporting our SMEs in their ability to export to the rest of the world.


We do support the passage of this bill. Some of the amendments contained in it are amendments which were, in fact, proposed by the former Labor government. Our support for this bill does also reflect the economic circumstances of the time. We are in a period of economic transition, as others have noted. We are in a period where our export industries will continue to grow in their importance to our economy. It is critical we continue to open up export opportunities, both for new and for existing export businesses, as part of this transition. 


The bill before the chamber does a number of things. It aligns the EMDG scheme rules to a revised level of scheme funding. It also implements some technical changes and some simplification changes. These include a reduction in the minimum expenses threshold required to be incurred by an applicant from $20,000 to $15,000, a change to the current deduction for the provisional grant amount from $5,000 to $2,500. The bill prevents the payment of grants to applicants engaging an EMDG consultant who is assessed to be not a fit and proper person—I will come back to that shortly—and increases the number of grants able to be received by an applicant from seven to eight.


In relation to the fit and proper person provisions, we note that these provisions largely adopt the provisions previously put forward by the Labor government in the lapsed amendment bill. We note that Senator Xenophon has put forward an amendment to this chamber. I have not had the opportunity to have a discussion with him about the rationale for that, but I do indicate at this point in the debate that Labor is not inclined to support Senator Xenophon's amendment. We think it is not unreasonable for there to be a fit and proper person test, although I am happy to listen to what he has to say on this. My understanding is that there are accompanying guidelines to the fit and proper person test which would enable consultants to understand what the test means for their conduct, and I also understand—and the minister can perhaps confirm this—that any decision of the Austrade CEO in relation to the fit and proper person test would be subject to administrative review.


Although Labor does support the bill, there are some aspects of the reform proposed by the government with which we are disappointed, and I want to come to the broader context of this legislation, to which I referred in my opening statement. We have long recognised on this side of the chamber that Australia's future prosperity will be underpinned by engagement with our region. It is not a new proposition for the Labor Party. Last night I watched something on YouTube which is being tweeted in response to the very modern announcement by the Prime Minister about the return of knights and dames to Australia. He describes it as adding a grace note to our community. I think it is a retrograde note. There was a very good—



An opposition senator:  Dame Penny!




Senator WONG:
  I would never want to be known as that, and I place on record that that is not something I would ever aspire to. I am a person who was born in Malaysia. I have experienced what it is to live in a society where some of the vestiges of imperial hierarchies remain, and I think it is an absolutely retrograde step for this country to be returning to those sorts of outdated notions. But I will leave that to one side.


What I was trying to comment on was the fact that I watched with interest one of the YouTube clips which was tweeted. It had former Prime Minister Keating talking about the cultural cringe of the then opposition and their yearning for the mother country, which is, in many ways, demonstrated by the return of knights and dames. One of the things that Prime Minister Keating spoke about in that speech, but also more generally, was the engagement with Asia. I recall, as a much younger person in Australia, how important that was to public debate and also to our sense of self and our identity. Labor has been talking about opening up to our region and engagement with our region for a very long time. Of course, most recently in government, Labor commissioned the Australia and the Asian century white paper, which was an extraordinarily important contribution to public debate. It laid a framework not just for domestic economic policy but also for how we should think about wide-ranging matters from foreign policy to our education system and our sense of identity. It is a great pity that this government, in an act of petty partisanship, has sought to remove the white paper from government websites. It is also not wanting to talk about it. It demonstrates that it puts tribalism and partisanship ahead of national interests. It always has and always will. That is the hallmark of this government. 


It is such an important aspect of who we are now and such an important part of Australia's future to understand that engagement with our region is critical to our economic prosperity but also critical to our ongoing security and identity. A confident Australia in its region—confident in its openness, confident in engaging with not only our immediate region but also the broader region—is the path to a secure, strong Australia and a prosperous Australia in the decades to come.


One of the aspects of the bill that Labor introduced in government, in the last parliament, was to include the realignment of this grant scheme to those priorities. In realigning this scheme to support small business exporting to emerging markets and to our region, it is disappointing that the Abbott government has walked away from these changes. I would have thought that, regardless of partisan views, there is real merit in leveraging public investment, which is supported in export market development grants, to further our strategic objective as a nation to more deeply engage with our region.


There was a capacity to ensure that these taxpayers' dollars were allocated in a way that leveraged that objective, which Labor believes is critical to Australia's current and future prosperity. The Abbott government's failure to embrace Australia in the Asian century and all that this implies says much about its lack of understanding of the tremendous opportunities that present themselves to this nation and about how important it is for us to fully engage and to ensure that this understanding is very much present not only in our public debate but also in all areas of our policy development and implementation.


I could talk at great length about the approach on trade agreements, but we have indicated support for passage of this legislation, so I will leave that debate for another time and simply indicate that the opposition supports passage of the bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:40):  I will confine my remarks on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014 to the fit-and-proper-persons test because I have been contacted by a number of good people in this industry who advocate for and prepare export market development grants applications and they cannot see the benefit of such a test. They cannot see that it will be dealt with equitably. They are concerned that it is simply too vague, and they worry about its effectiveness. They worry about it being abused and that it will be a retrograde step.


I want to outline that briefly in the course of this contribution, and I have a number of questions to ask the government in relation to this. If the government is about reducing red tape, I cannot see the underlying rationale for this particular test in relation to fit and proper persons. Of course, we expect that anyone dealing with export grants does so with probity and ethics, and there are a number of other sanctions under criminal law that will provide protection to the scheme for those seeking grants. But I cannot see the benefit of what is being proposed here, and I am worried that it will be abused in the way that it has been set out.


I broadly support what is proposed in this bill, apart from the fit-and-proper-persons test. I am concerned that the small exporters, those that are emerging as exporters, will be disadvantaged by what is being proposed. Clause 3.6 of the Export Market Development Grants (Associate and Fit and Proper Person) Guidelines 2004 requires that Austrade, when making a determination as to who is not fit and proper:


… have regard to any matter, not mentioned in section 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5, that it considers relevant to the personal, commercial, financial or professional character, status or reputation of the person or associate.


My question to the government is: how on earth will you develop it, how on earth will that be dealt with and what are the criteria in respect of that? There are some regulations I am seeking to disallow, which I am concerned are simply too vague and imprecise and will cause a lot of concern amongst those who have to work on very small margins in this industry when advocating for those seeking a grant.


What has been put to me by those who work in the industry is that this is quite different from other areas where a fit-and-proper-person test is appropriately required. If you are a customs agent, for instance, you have a certain amount of trust placed in you for the clearance of material goods coming into this country, and it is important that you pass a fit-and-proper-persons test so that you are not allowing narcotics or other prohibited substances or goods into the country. If you are a tax agent, you get certain privileges from the tax office with respect to the late lodgement of returns and the like. There is an element of trust placed in you by the tax office by virtue of your being a tax agent, so I can understand the need for a fit-and-proper-person test with respect to that. But in relation to an export grants scheme, where these people act as agents, prepare applications and submit the applications, there does not seem to be any privileges attached as there is for a tax agent or a customs agent.


The explanatory memorandum to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004—this bill—states that consultants must be excluded for 'behaviour considered inconsistent with accepted community standards'. What does that mean? It may appear on the surface to be reasonable; it has the potential to become unreasonable when applied to the ministerial determination that will accompany the legislation.


Procedural fairness may not be achieved if what constitutes unacceptable action is not sufficiently defined or if external review provisions are manifestly inadequate. The requirement that administrators observe natural justice is protected at a federal level. In relation to that we need to refer to the Administrative Decisions Review Act, but it is my view that the necessary safeguards for that to be achieved are not present in this legislation. Where are the safeguards?


The coalition says it is about reducing red tape and making it easier for businesses to get on with their legitimate work but there are many landmines—so many pitfalls—in this particular test, which is something that the previous government put up. I am surprised that this government is embracing what I think is a bad element of this legislation. How do you determine behaviour considered 'inconsistent with accepted community standards'? Where is the procedural fairness?


My fear is that somebody may be subject to a capricious action under the scheme: 'We don't think you're a fit and proper person; we will therefore make that ruling.' That person could end up losing their livelihood for the next two or three years pending a judicial review. We know what it costs to run a judicial review. Access to justice in this country is a sad joke. When you consider how much money it costs to bring an application in the Federal Court, to retain a solicitor and to obtain counsel to argue the case, you could be looking, at the very least, at tens of thousands of dollars for a simple judicial review application. And that will take a considerable period of time. If there is an appeal to the Federal Court it would cost tens of thousands of dollars more.


The concern is that these export grant agents are not making a killing. They are making a pretty modest living and some of them are eking out a living—particularly in relation to the small exporters that they advocate for. So, I do not understand why the government would embrace this test when there appears to be a vagueness that accompanies it and where there appears to be a potential of abuse of power in relation to its use.


In the explanatory memorandum to the bill in respect of the 'consultants not fit and proper persons' provisions it is stated that this will 'provide the CEO of Austrade a mechanism to deal responsively to the variety and diversity of yet unknown circumstances and behaviours that may arise'. What on earth does that mean? What does it mean to talk about the 'yet unknown and circumstances and behaviours that may arise'? It seams incredibly vague and dangerous to me to be putting that in a piece of legislation or in a legislative instrument.


These undefined obligations may place Austrade in an untenable position. Our system of justice puts the onus on the accuser to establish its case. Under the ministerial determination, however, once an allegation has been made Austrade are obliged to accept the allegation as material and allow the litigation to run its course. The defendant must be presumed guilty until proven innocent. How is that fair in terms of procedural fairness? How is that fair in terms of natural justice? How is that fair to these agents who act for small exporters—the future of this economy when you consider the importance of encouraging small exporters to become medium and bigger exporters and the enormous benefit exports have to our nation?


Those are, in essence, my concerns. My understanding is that under the 'fit and proper person' provisions of this bill once any allegation of impropriety is made against an agent, in the press or otherwise, Austrade must apply to 'fit and proper person' provisions. In the case of a consultant the effect on their livelihood and on their clients would be dramatic. If an applicant has a grant payment denied or delayed this is bad enough; a consultant, on the other hand, may lose everything. For instance, if a start-up company successfully launches a new patented lure for catching large game fish such as marlin, then demonstrates the attributes of the lure and shows that it qualifies for support under the export grant scheme, it would budget accordingly. If an allegation is made that the agent is in some way not a fit and proper person—any allegation can be made—that company can be held up in terms of their grant.


That is the sort of thing that I am concerned about. There are other examples that I could give. For instance, what happens with an EMDG application if someone is charged with something unrelated to fraud or dishonesty—if they are charged with an assault, for instance? Does that mean that they would be held over, under the 'fit and proper person' test? I think that is unfair. You are punishing a person two or three times as a result of that.


There are other examples that have been put to me. I do not want to raise those examples for fear of identifying any of the people that have come forward to me to express their genuine concerns. My appeal to the government is to put this on hold with respect to the 'fit and proper persons' test. I think it has been ill-considered. If you look at the fine details of the test as it is intended to apply and the circumstances in which it is intended to apply and the whole background of what these agents do, compared to what a customs agent or a tax agent does—in fact they would be better referred to as 'consultants' rather than 'agents'—then you would find that it is very dangerous.


To rely on insufficiently defined administrative powers will cause enormous damage to this sector, particularly to small and medium exporters. I think the cost of consultants will go up. Fewer consultants will want to be involved in this and a lot of consultants will say, 'That's hanging over our head—that we can lose our livelihood overnight with an allegation that cannot be sufficiently dealt with or will have to go through the courts.' That is dangerous as well. I would like to hear from the government in relation to why it is proceeding with this ill-considered part of the legislation in terms of the fit and proper person test, which is so ill-defined and so open to administrative abuse.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (10:53):  I thank Senators Wong and Xenophon for their contributions to the debate on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. The Export Market Development Grants scheme has had a very long and important history in Australia. Our government is very committed to ensuring that it plays a key role in the future in opening Australia further to the world and in supporting our exporters and industries to continue to grow their businesses and the wealth and opportunities for all Australians. The EMDG scheme has been in place since 1974-75, with first grants paid in 1975-76. So it has a very long history. Over the last 14 years, the EMDG scheme has helped support SME exports worth more than $60 billion. On average, those exporters have employed some 97,000 employees each year. So it has a proud history; it is a history of creating exports and, in doing that, creating jobs. For every one dollar of cost to the taxpayer, estimates indicate a benefit is received to the nation of some $5.38. It is a significant benefit in return.


Our government is committed to boosting funding for the EMDG scheme—a $50 million boost over four years, starting in 2013-14. This is the longest sustained increase in funding for the scheme in the last 10 years. The long-term nature and certainty of that funding is important because it provides confidence to businesses who want to invest in export marketing in knowing that grants will be available to them. We are proud of those changes as well as other changes that are being pursued which will increase the number of grants able to be received by an applicant from seven to eight. We believe that allowing experienced exporters to claim an additional grant will assist many of the previously successful EMDG recipients to further develop their existing markets, re-enter markets that are now commercially viable again due to reductions in the exchange rate, and diversify into new markets. The overwhelming majority of these mature, successful exporters export to multiple markets, often spanning both the developed markets like the US and Europe and the fast-growing markets like China and South-East Asia. Based on the profile of previous years' applicants, it is estimated that 138 additional exporters will be able to claim each year as a result of this change.


We also supporting changes that reduce the minimum expenses threshold required to be incurred by an applicant from $20,000 to $15,000 per annum. Reducing the minimum expenses threshold reduces the amount of money that small exporters need to spend on their export marketing before they can claim an EMDG. This is particularly important for small specialised services companies and early-stage high-tech companies who are often born globals, with their primary markets being international rather than domestic, and are seeking to sell intellectual property or develop their first market. Through the reduction in the minimum expenses threshold, approximately 143 additional exporters are projected to be able to claim each year.


Further, the government supports changes that reduce the current $5,000 deduction from the applicant's provisional grant amount to $2,500. We recognise that, in the current difficult international trading conditions where exporters have faced several years of pressure on their marketing budget from higher exchange rates and weaker international markets, the ability to have even a modest increase in marketing funds is expected to be very welcome. Research into the EMDG scheme shows that increasing grants increases the export marketing expenditure by more than the grant amount as exporters contribute their own funds to support these activities. This increase in grant funds is particularly relevant now with many small and medium enterprises increasingly eyeing the potential for increased international sales as exchange rates ease and international markets recover. Almost all grant recipients will receive an extra $2,500 per grant due to this change. The number of grant recipients receiving such a benefit ranges from between 2,600 to more than 4,500 exporters each year. We have a very strong commitment to this scheme and a very strong intention to make sure that it is delivering continued growth and benefit to exporters into the future.


Senator Xenophon raised some particular concerns about this legislation, which introduces a fit and proper person test for EMDG consultants. They are people who assist exporters with the preparation and lodgement of their grant application. As Senator Xenophon highlighted in some of his remarks, fit and proper person tests are quite common in Commonwealth legislation. They apply across a range of different roles or activities that people undertake where they interact with the Commonwealth or receive certain responsibilities, powers or funding from the Commonwealth and, of course, are designed to protect the integrity and public perception of the management of programs by the Commonwealth.


EMDG applicants—that is, the exporters applying for the grant—have had fit and proper person provisions in place for more than a decade. These provisions have been widely recognised and the benefits of them have been widely acknowledged. It is not something new or unusual in this case to have a fit and proper person test in place in relation to the operation of the EMDG scheme. It is just that, until now, that has only applied to the applicants. This legislation seeks to extend that application so that it also applies to consultants who make application on behalf of particular applicants.


Austrade, which, of course, is the arm of government that administers the EMDG scheme, has developed significant experience in administering the fit and proper person provisions that apply to EMDG applicants. So I am a little bit surprised at some of Senator Xenophon's concerns in that regard. Given the longstanding history Austrade has in applying these provisions to EMDG applicants, there is no great leap in terms of applying them to the consultants who act on behalf of those applicants as well. Austrade advise that EMDG consultants have not raised any concerns about Austrade's management of the current fit and proper person provisions that apply to applicants. So in relation to some of Senator Xenophon specific concerns about how this will be administered, certainly the history of Austrade's activities demonstrates that, where they have administered these types of provisions in relation to applicants to date, neither applicants nor consultants have raised any particular concerns.


It is important to understand, in terms of why this action is being undertaken, that EMDG consultants do overwhelmingly work on a success fee basis. Our understanding is that, essentially, EMDG consultants in general receive a 10 per cent commission on grants obtained for their clients. Around 60 per cent of applicants work through a consultant. So we do have very significant uptake of consultants in this regard as people pursue grants under the scheme. Around 60 per cent of the time they are using consultants who do receive a significant financial benefit at the end of it. Consultants do have considerable financial interest in the process and they can of course potentially benefit from any unprotected overclaiming of grants. So it is important to ensure the integrity is there, not just in the applicants themselves but in those acting on behalf of the applicants.


The total amount payable to EMDG grant recipients under the scheme is capped. Therefore, any grant that is paid on the basis of false information reduces the amount available to other honest applicants. So it is important to understand that the integrity of this scheme is vital not just for government probity reasons but because maintaining that integrity can stretch the dollars as far as possible. The amounts spent on monitoring and investigating claims reduces the overall amount available, which again is a good reason for ensuring that we have standards of the highest order for the people participating in the scheme in the first instance to minimise the need to investigate, monitor or undertake actions that are simply in the nature of a rectification. Prevention is of course better than the cure in this regard.


It is not feasible for Austrade to fully verify every single application. So on that basis a degree of trust is required in this process, and much of that trust is therefore vested in the consultants who are presenting those applications to Austrade. It is also important that the public perceive the scheme to be operating in an honest and proper manner and that public funds are provided only to fit and proper recipients. That would be something all in this chamber would accept; this is simply a case of how that is achieved. The public perception of EMDG consultants reflects significantly on the scheme as a whole and the government's management of the scheme. Therefore, to ensure we continue to maintain high public support for a scheme that delivers significant benefit it is appropriate that, just as applicants are required to be fit and proper people to receive a grant, the consultants acting on their behalf should meet a similar standard.


Such a provision in the act will also provide a further incentive for consultants not to make false claims and an incidental incentive for applicants not to use consultants with a poor record for financial probity. The proposed provision would assist in protecting taxpayers' funds from fraudulent or excessive claims, ensure the proper operation of the scheme and, importantly, ensure public confidence in the scheme.


Senator Wong asked questions in relation to whether there where rights to administrative appeal. It is important to note that the Austrade CEO making a finding under these amendments that a consultant is not a fit and proper person is significant and appropriate, and therefore such a finding will be subject to the normal rules of administrative law and natural justice. Consultants will have access to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In addition, consultants will be entitled to judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 as well as potential proceedings under common law.


The proposed fit and proper person provisions are very similar to provisions in the EMDG amendment bill 2013, which, due to the calling of the election, was not passed. The fit and proper person provisions in the 2013 bill were considered in quite some detail by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. I note that, at the committee's hearing on 7 June 2013, the Export Consultants Group, which represents the majority of EMDG consultants in Australia, indicated its support for a fit and proper person test for EMDG consultants broadly in line with the test for EMDG clients or applicants that has been in existence since 2004. So those who speak on behalf of the industry in relation to this matter and those who speak on behalf of the broad majority of consultants did indicate last year their support for provisions along these lines.


The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee supported the passage of the 2013 bill, which enjoyed bipartisan support from the then government and the then opposition for the inclusion of these provisions. They were, of course, at the time also considered by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which found that the proposed fit and proper person provisions raised no concerns in terms of the right of people to do their business with the government.


Austrade provided the Export Consultants Group with the proposed operational details of the fit and proper person test in November last year. This was building upon a significant period of consultation conducted in relation to the earlier 2013 bill, including those two reviews by the parliamentary committees. So there has been an extensive range of consultation with those involved in acting as consultants to EMDG applicants, and that has yielded positive responses from those who support these changes and support a reasonable level of standards for their industry. Austrade has indicated that it is open to further consultation if need be. It will of course continue to work with consultants on the detail of the test to be applied, which will be contained in a ministerial instrument under the act.


The government obviously urges support for this bill, especially the fit and proper person provisions but also the provisions which increase the eligibility of SME exporters for a grant. The current difficult international trading conditions and the ability to qualify for a grant or an increased grant make a significant difference to many hundreds of small exporters. The EMDG scheme is a reimbursement scheme. Exporters need to spend money on marketing to qualify for a grant for reimbursement of up to 50 per cent of that marketing expenditure. Delaying this bill will prevent those exporters from having the opportunity to increase their budget this year and to seek partial reimbursement from 1 July this year. We do commend the bill to the house. We appreciate Senator Xenophon's concerns in relation to unnecessary red tape but do not believe that, in this instance, that is the case. I look forward to, if possible, assisting the senator with any questions in the committee stage.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:08):  I have a number of questions further to Senator Birmingham's contribution. I am grateful for his outlining of the position of both the government and the department. Of course I want there to be the highest standards of probity when we deal with these grants; it is taxpayers' money that is at stake. But I am concerned that there are insufficient safeguards in place in relation to what is proposed for the fit and proper person test and that it could be subject to abuse. I want to get a handle on the existing fit and proper person test that applies to applicants for grants. How many fit and proper person determinations have there been since it has been in place?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (11:10):  I regret that I cannot give an exact number. However, I am advised that it is a very small number over the 10-year-period in which that provision has been in place for applicants. As I indicated in my remarks, no concerns have been raised during that time by consultants about the way in which that test on applicants is applied. In relation to your specific question, I am advised that it is a very small number. I take that to mean only a handful, but we can try to get a quick answer back from the department. The officials present do not have that exact number to hand.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:10):  That is entirely unsatisfactory. My amendment, which seeks to knock out this particular clause because of the concerns I have outlined, has been tabled. The department are on notice; they are aware of it. How can they not give us such basic information, because it is supposed to be a continuation, if you like, or an additional feature of the legislation, given the fit and proper person test that has been in place for applicants? If there has only been a handful, isn't that something the department can tell us fairly easily? I would be very grateful if, in the course of this committee stage, we could get that information. I would have thought it was something that the department ought to have been aware of in order to advise Senator Birmingham. I am not being critical of Senator Birmingham, but it seems to me that the department should have been able to provide that information to the government.


Can I continue, pending that information. At the moment, if a consultant becomes subject to a 'not a fit and proper person test' inquiry, what happens to the files of his clients?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (11:12):  I am advised that normal government provisions in relation to confidentiality would apply there and that a client's files would be sealed and not available for any other purposes—if that is the nature of the information you are seeking. Obviously, an applicant working through a consultant would, I am sure, have the opportunity if their consultant were deemed not to be a fit and proper person to then work through another consultant if they so choose or to pursue an application themselves. The fact that a consultant may be deemed not to be a fit and proper person would not necessarily impinge on a company's capacity to pursue an application, unless of course under the already existing terms of the act that applicant were themselves deemed to also not be a fit and proper person.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:13):  I have raised this issue and have put up this amendment because of concerns that have been put to me by a number of people, whom I consider to be quite reasonable. I am constrained in giving specific, identifiable examples because they are concerned for a number of reasons in terms of client confidence and the potential ramifications for them if such a broad test is incorporated. My understanding is that, currently, if an applicant—the client, if you like, of consultants—is the subject of a 'not a fit and proper person' inquiry, then the files basically go into limbo or the abyss. I have to be a bit careful here not to identify the parties, but I understand that some of these 'not a fit and proper person' investigations can take a number of years and keep applications in limbo. If that information is wrong, I would be very pleased to hear that from the minister, and to hear what the department can tell us. That is one question.


The other question is that I would have thought the department could tell us—ought to tell us, given what is involved here—how many applications there have been under the fit and proper person test by the department, and how long those applications have taken. It is only a handful; surely they can tell us: how long do these applications actually take to be dealt with one way or the other?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (11:15):  Thank you, Senator Xenophon; I have asked to get the exact number you have requested. I am advised it is a small number of negative determinations in relation to the fit and proper person test, but we will try to get you the specific details. The process, under the existing terms in relation to applicants and as it is proposed in this bill in relation to consultants, is that if there are concerns the Austrade CEO may seek information from the applicant or, under this bill, from the consultant. The historical information I have been provided with is that the length of time it takes to make a final determination, where there is some question or examination of these issues, ranges from weeks to months; that there are not instances of that being a matter that goes on for years; and, in this regard, that the length of time it takes for an applicant to provide information when requested also has some impact—so, clearly, it is not just a case of how long it takes Austrade to fulfil its end of the bargain. If Austrade requests information from an applicant as a result of a query about their status as a fit and proper person, then of course it is up to that applicant as to how long it takes them to provide that information. But, in the relatively small number of instances where this provision has come into play in relation to applicants, I am advised that it is a matter of weeks or months.


I understand your constraints in relation to examples or information being provided to you on a confidential basis, Senator Xenophon, but I think it is important to acknowledge that, if somebody has been found under the existing arrangements not to be a fit and proper person as an applicant for a grant, then obviously their application would be put on hold. That is the nature of these provisions. So when you ask what happens to a file or whether a file is active or otherwise, clearly, if somebody is found not to be a fit and proper person, it is the very intent of these provisions that that person then does not receive a grant under the scheme. If the person continued to dispute that over a long period of time, I can see how some matters might continue over a longer period of time. Of course, they have the administrative and judicial appeals processes that I outlined available to them to seek recourse and rectification if they believe that the Austrade CEO has made a wrongful determination.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:18):  I would just like to make it clear that the Exports Consultants Group have brought this to my attention. They have given me a fair bit of information. They want the scheme to work. They say they are subject to criminal laws, like everyone else, so that, if someone is involved in a fraudulent grant or other behaviour that could easily be addressed within the criminal code, then these matters can be dealt with in that way.


I have been told that there is a 'not a fit and proper person' investigation, in relation to a 2009-10 application, which is now into its fourth year. I do not know whether the department can confirm that. I do not think that would breach any confidentiality. But the issue is that if the chief executive of Austrade says, 'We don't think you are a fit and proper person,' then in order to deal with that you have to make an application for judicial review in the Federal Court. These guys—and I say that generically; these people—just do not have the funds to do that, by and large. They do not have tens of thousands of dollars to do that. I am concerned as to how it will operate.


The guidelines say that Austrade must 'have regard to any matter that it considers relevant to the personal, commercial, financial or professional character, status or reputation of the person or associate'. What happens if you are a consultant, and you have a black sheep in the family who has been convicted of some serious offences, relating to fraud or organised crime, for instance? Does that mean you would be caught up in and be responsible for the sins of someone else in your family, or someone that you know, even though you have no commercial relationship with them—or no relationship at all with them? It has been put to me that what is being proposed here imposes an obligation which is unduly dependent on insufficiently defined administrative powers. That is my real concern.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (11:21):  Senator Xenophon, in relation to some of the concerns you are expressing here, I think a level of faith needs to be had in the public officials who are empowered to make sure that they are applying the spirit as well as the intent of the legislation. Clearly, the idea that just because there is a black sheep in the family somebody might be excluded is something that I cannot imagine occurring under any circumstances. The word 'associate' obviously has certain understood meanings in that regard.


One would expect that, for somebody to be deemed not a fit and proper person based on an associate, that would relate to somebody who was directly involved in their business activities and dealings and that that association had an impact on the direct trustworthiness of dealing with that consultant or business. I refer you to the explanatory memorandum, which states in relation to item 6 that:


In applying the assessment criteria to be set out in the Guidelines, it is expected that the CEO of Austrade would only form an opinion that a consultant was not a fit and proper person where there was a concern with that person’s capacity or trustworthiness to act as a consultant in the best interests of both their applicant client and the public funds from which EMDG grants are paid.


The EM is making relatively clear there the narrowing of some of the broader scope of possible applications of this that you have expressed concerns about. The only basis on which you would expect the CEO of Austrade to deem somebody not a fit and proper person via the guidelines is where that person's capacity or trustworthiness to act as a consultant in the best interests of both their client and the taxpayer was in some question. That is where we bring the detail back to in this regard.


I am advised that the department and Austrade are not aware of an unsettled or outstanding claim that dates back to 2009, as you have indicated. As I said, it is of course possible that somebody from 2009 who was at some point along the way deemed not a fit and proper person may still be aggrieved or dissatisfied by that. They may have chosen not to go with the options of appeal that are available to them. But I am advised that there has not been an outstanding matter of determination since 2009.


You highlighted that you have been provided with some information by the Export Consultants Group. I appreciate that. The government and Austrade would obviously welcome hearing their concerns in relation to any of the particular guidelines in play. But, as I noted in my concluding remarks in the second reading debate, they provided evidence to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on 7 June last year and indicated their broad support for a 'fit and proper person' test for consultants that aligned broadly with the test that has been in place for clients and applicants since 2004. Certainly it is our understanding that their support for the broad nature of these provisions is not in doubt. But if they have concerns about the detail of how the provisions will operate then we would be happy to work through those concerns sensibly as those provisions are finalised.


I have been given some information about the number of determinations from the department. I am advised that there have been 11 in the 10-year period since 2004-05. In that 10-year period there have been 11. That is noting that there are somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 applications for grants per annum. So 11 businesses or individuals have been deemed not to be fit and proper persons in recent times. There was one determination in this financial year, four in 2012-13 and none, I believe, in 2011-12. In total, there have been just 11 in the 10 years of the operation of that test for applicants.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:26):  I am grateful to Senator Birmingham for providing further information, but can he advise how long some of those matters have taken to be dealt with? How many of those matters took more than 12 months to determine, for instance? Whatever support there may have been previously for the general principle of a 'fit and proper person' test, the concern is the way that it has been set out. The way that it has been set out under the regulations raises real concerns about administrative and procedural fairness. If I could get some further information from Senator Birmingham in relation to that, I would be grateful.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (11:27):  As I flagged before, I am told that the general time line is weeks or months, not years. On the specific case you highlighted before with the suggestion that there was someone outstanding since 2009, that is not the understanding of the department. I do not believe there is a problem here of delayed justice being denied justice, as such. I equally do not believe that there is a problem of excessive use of these powers or provisions in relation to how they have applied historically. Obviously the data I gave before indicates that they have been used very discreetly by officials.


You indicated in earlier remarks that, 'If people do the wrong thing, the government has the recourse of legal proceedings that would apply to people who might be defrauding the Commonwealth.' That is true. But what we seek to do with provisions like this is prevent those problems happening in the first place and thereby eliminate the costs that would accrue to government in having to investigate, pursue, recover and prosecute for misdeeds or wrongdoing.


Ultimately, we need to remember that we are talking about a government grants scheme. It is a scheme that provides people with financial assistance to market their export activities overseas. It is a gift from the taxpayer to certain businesses and individuals, because there is a general acceptance that that gift provides overall economic benefits to the entire country. But it is important that, where the taxpayers' funds are being given, we have confidence that it is occurring with the highest standard and nature.


As I highlighted in my earlier remarks, in a sense it is not possible for Austrade to go through extensive scrutiny of every single application in terms of its complete compliance. Obviously, they do an outstanding job and are doing the best they can in ensuring that everything is above board and compliant. But it is important that we have faith that the records and applications are sound. It has been a 10-year accepted principle that Austrade should have the right to make determinations on the nature of an applicant and whether they are a fit and proper person. With around 60 per cent of applicants utilising the services of a contractor to act on their behalf, it does seem inherently logical to extend that same test with similar provisions to those contractors.


You indicated that support for the principle that I have just enunciated is strong. I am pleased with that and I welcome that. If there are particular concerns about the way provisions as outlined and drafted will be applied then I would be happy to do my best, based on the advice of officials, to work through those concerns and see if we can provide satisfactory comfort to those with concerns to make sure that they are satisfied that the application of this test will meet the intention of the government, which is that it not be used as an impediment to consultants.


We recognise the value of the consultants' work in assisting applicants. We recognise that they have developed skills in ensuring the compliance of applicants with the scheme and making it easier for applicants to access it. So we want to make sure they have continued involvement in supporting as many small businesses and medium-sized enterprises as possible to access this scheme. We need to make sure that it works properly. If there are particular provisions that they have concerns about, which we can try to provide some comfort on during this debate, then I would be happy to deal with them.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:32):  I understand where the numbers are on this. Both the government and the opposition do not support my opposition to the fit and proper person test in the following terms:


(1) Schedule 1, item 6, page 3 (line 16) to page 5 (line 31), to be opposed.


(2) Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (lines 5 to 8), to be opposed.


(3) Schedule 1, item 9, page 6 (lines 9 to 13), to be opposed.


(4) Schedule 1, item 10, page 6 (lines 24 to 28), to be opposed.


I would be grateful if Senator Birmingham could give an undertaking to provide details of the current not a fit and proper person test applications that have been made by the department. What was the average time of resolution, how have they been resolved and were they appealed against or what actually became of those. I get the feeling that a lot of export consultants will think, 'We cannot afford this, so we may as well do something else for a living,' even if that creates a stain on their reputation. In order to clear their reputation, they are going to have to mortgage their homes in many cases.


I wonder why the government did not consider some form of independent adjudicator? This is not a criticism of the CEO of Austrade in any way, but why would Austrade not have not independent adjudicator to look at these matters, rather than having to be a judge, jury and executioner on these sorts of things? I just wanted to raise these issues so that we can wrap this up.


The concerns that have been expressed to me are that the time frame for assessment of the fit and proper person test can be measured in years; that applicants have complained to ministers in the past about their treatment at the hands of Austrade; that there are unrealistic demands for information under section 72, in terms of those provisions; and that there is no right of review in relation to section 72, so that if the CEO of Austrade asks the applicant for further information which they cannot reasonably obtain because it is not within their purview, within their knowledge or within their power to obtain that then that could prejudice that person. These are some of the issues that have been raised.


I understand that my amendment will not be successful. I am grateful for the broad support of Senator Whish-Wilson of the Australian Greens. I know that Senator John Madigan from the DLP has also expressed concerns about these provisions. They are the issues that I raise. I do it genuinely, with a real concern that this may have a number of unintended consequences. My concern is that if a demand for information under section 72—in the context of a not a fit and proper person test matter—is made, it is not subject to any appeal. If you cannot provide that information for whatever reason, even though you may have a good reason, you are pretty well stuffed—to put it colloquially. The applicant may be unable to provide or the consultant may not be able to provide information because they simply cannot access that information. It is not within their purview to do so. So they are the broad concerns; I think I have raised them sufficiently.


I advise the government that I will continue to advocate on behalf of these people, who I think want to do the right thing but are concerned that they could be tied up in administrative actions which could destroy their livelihood unfairly and that there are not sufficient safeguards in the regulations, as they exist. That is why I am seeking to strike out this test in its current form in this bill.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (11:36):  Senator Xenophon, I appreciate the genuine concerns you bring to the chamber and the way in which you have put them in this debate. I will be happy to ask Austrade, through the minister for trade, to provide some information to you in relation to the history of determinations that applicants are not fit and proper persons. There are, of course, only 11 such instances, as we have discussed during this debate. I do not know that we will be able to provide a detailed history for all 11, given that they go back a decade. I will be very happy to make sure that information is made available to you in relation to those decisions taken over the last few years—the one in the 2013-14 financial year and the four in the 2012-13 financial year—as well as any other information that Austrade are able to provide about the time line for those determinations.


I would also ask, if you wish, that a private briefing with Austrade be facilitated for you. Obviously, it would seem that you have an aggrieved constituent or two in relation to some matters. Within proper handling of matters of confidentiality that go to people's business dealings and the like I would be more than happy to encourage Austrade to provide you with a private briefing and discussion in which you might be able to get to the bottom of some of those individual instances and concerns that you have raised during this debate.


In relation to the issue you have raised of whether information that may be requested by the CEO of Austrade under proposed section 79A(2) regarding information requested that an applicant could not reasonably be expected to provide, one would expect that the applicant would be able to make that clear to the CEO of Austrade and make clear the reasons why such information could not be provided. I would trust that the CEO of Austrade would take into consideration in their final determination that, clearly, it is unreasonable to expect somebody to provide something that cannot be provided if it is held by other government agencies, for example, or subject to other matters that require it to be kept private or confidential for some legal or other reason. I would, again, want to provide assurance that it is certainly the government's intention in relation to this legislation before us that the CEO would not be using that provision as a capacity to block people from participating and working as consultants by virtue of the CEO making unreasonable requests or demands for information that, obviously, people would be unable to provide.


It is important to note in the legislation that, yes, the CEO can take into consideration a failure to provide information in making a determination that somebody is not a fit and proper person, but the simple failure to provide information does not automatically result in somebody's determination as a fit and proper person. So, were a request made, and for legitimate and reasonable grounds the person came back and said, 'I can't provide this information, but I can provide other information that might address this,' then there would be no reason why that could not lead to a satisfactory resolution of any complaint within the matter.


As I flagged before we will attempt to come back to you in relation to your request for a more detailed breakdown on the history of determinations that have been made in relation to applicants and the time lines, in particular, for resolution of those matters, whether there have been any appeals and whether there are any that are pending or outstanding. Indeed, we are happy to make sure that that information is provided to you. As well, the offer is there, if you wish, for us to facilitate a personal briefing where you can raise, direct with Austrade, any confidential grievances that individuals may have.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:30):  I thank Senator Xenophon for his courtesy. I just want to place on record the Labor opposition's attitude to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. The chamber may or may not be aware that this is legislation that was first enacted a very long time ago in 1974 and established what has become a well-regarded and successful scheme to support Australian small- and medium-sized businesses exporting to the rest of the world. It is obviously a scheme predicated on Labor's strong view that Australia's current and future prosperity requires a strong trading sector, and it is our strong view that it is important that small- and medium-sized businesses in this country are assisted and facilitated in their capacity to export to the rest of the world. As I said, it was a 1974 initiative of the Whitlam government which established the original grants scheme, which demonstrates Labor's longstanding view of the importance of trade and our longstanding view of the importance of supporting our SMEs in their ability to export to the rest of the world.


We do support the passage of this bill. Some of the amendments contained in it are amendments which were, in fact, proposed by the former Labor government. Our support for this bill does also reflect the economic circumstances of the time. We are in a period of economic transition, as others have noted. We are in a period where our export industries will continue to grow in their importance to our economy. It is critical we continue to open up export opportunities, both for new and for existing export businesses, as part of this transition. 


The bill before the chamber does a number of things. It aligns the EMDG scheme rules to a revised level of scheme funding. It also implements some technical changes and some simplification changes. These include a reduction in the minimum expenses threshold required to be incurred by an applicant from $20,000 to $15,000, a change to the current deduction for the provisional grant amount from $5,000 to $2,500. The bill prevents the payment of grants to applicants engaging an EMDG consultant who is assessed to be not a fit and proper person—I will come back to that shortly—and increases the number of grants able to be received by an applicant from seven to eight.


In relation to the fit and proper person provisions, we note that these provisions largely adopt the provisions previously put forward by the Labor government in the lapsed amendment bill. We note that Senator Xenophon has put forward an amendment to this chamber. I have not had the opportunity to have a discussion with him about the rationale for that, but I do indicate at this point in the debate that Labor is not inclined to support Senator Xenophon's amendment. We think it is not unreasonable for there to be a fit and proper person test, although I am happy to listen to what he has to say on this. My understanding is that there are accompanying guidelines to the fit and proper person test which would enable consultants to understand what the test means for their conduct, and I also understand—and the minister can perhaps confirm this—that any decision of the Austrade CEO in relation to the fit and proper person test would be subject to administrative review.


Although Labor does support the bill, there are some aspects of the reform proposed by the government with which we are disappointed, and I want to come to the broader context of this legislation, to which I referred in my opening statement. We have long recognised on this side of the chamber that Australia's future prosperity will be underpinned by engagement with our region. It is not a new proposition for the Labor Party. Last night I watched something on YouTube which is being tweeted in response to the very modern announcement by the Prime Minister about the return of knights and dames to Australia. He describes it as adding a grace note to our community. I think it is a retrograde note. There was a very good—



An opposition senator:  Dame Penny!




Senator WONG:
  I would never want to be known as that, and I place on record that that is not something I would ever aspire to. I am a person who was born in Malaysia. I have experienced what it is to live in a society where some of the vestiges of imperial hierarchies remain, and I think it is an absolutely retrograde step for this country to be returning to those sorts of outdated notions. But I will leave that to one side.


What I was trying to comment on was the fact that I watched with interest one of the YouTube clips which was tweeted. It had former Prime Minister Keating talking about the cultural cringe of the then opposition and their yearning for the mother country, which is, in many ways, demonstrated by the return of knights and dames. One of the things that Prime Minister Keating spoke about in that speech, but also more generally, was the engagement with Asia. I recall, as a much younger person in Australia, how important that was to public debate and also to our sense of self and our identity. Labor has been talking about opening up to our region and engagement with our region for a very long time. Of course, most recently in government, Labor commissioned the Australia and the Asian century white paper, which was an extraordinarily important contribution to public debate. It laid a framework not just for domestic economic policy but also for how we should think about wide-ranging matters from foreign policy to our education system and our sense of identity. It is a great pity that this government, in an act of petty partisanship, has sought to remove the white paper from government websites. It is also not wanting to talk about it. It demonstrates that it puts tribalism and partisanship ahead of national interests. It always has and always will. That is the hallmark of this government. 


It is such an important aspect of who we are now and such an important part of Australia's future to understand that engagement with our region is critical to our economic prosperity but also critical to our ongoing security and identity. A confident Australia in its region—confident in its openness, confident in engaging with not only our immediate region but also the broader region—is the path to a secure, strong Australia and a prosperous Australia in the decades to come.


One of the aspects of the bill that Labor introduced in government, in the last parliament, was to include the realignment of this grant scheme to those priorities. In realigning this scheme to support small business exporting to emerging markets and to our region, it is disappointing that the Abbott government has walked away from these changes. I would have thought that, regardless of partisan views, there is real merit in leveraging public investment, which is supported in export market development grants, to further our strategic objective as a nation to more deeply engage with our region.


There was a capacity to ensure that these taxpayers' dollars were allocated in a way that leveraged that objective, which Labor believes is critical to Australia's current and future prosperity. The Abbott government's failure to embrace Australia in the Asian century and all that this implies says much about its lack of understanding of the tremendous opportunities that present themselves to this nation and about how important it is for us to fully engage and to ensure that this understanding is very much present not only in our public debate but also in all areas of our policy development and implementation.


I could talk at great length about the approach on trade agreements, but we have indicated support for passage of this legislation, so I will leave that debate for another time and simply indicate that the opposition supports passage of the bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:40):  I will confine my remarks on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014 to the fit-and-proper-persons test because I have been contacted by a number of good people in this industry who advocate for and prepare export market development grants applications and they cannot see the benefit of such a test. They cannot see that it will be dealt with equitably. They are concerned that it is simply too vague, and they worry about its effectiveness. They worry about it being abused and that it will be a retrograde step.


I want to outline that briefly in the course of this contribution, and I have a number of questions to ask the government in relation to this. If the government is about reducing red tape, I cannot see the underlying rationale for this particular test in relation to fit and proper persons. Of course, we expect that anyone dealing with export grants does so with probity and ethics, and there are a number of other sanctions under criminal law that will provide protection to the scheme for those seeking grants. But I cannot see the benefit of what is being proposed here, and I am worried that it will be abused in the way that it has been set out.


I broadly support what is proposed in this bill, apart from the fit-and-proper-persons test. I am concerned that the small exporters, those that are emerging as exporters, will be disadvantaged by what is being proposed. Clause 3.6 of the Export Market Development Grants (Associate and Fit and Proper Person) Guidelines 2004 requires that Austrade, when making a determination as to who is not fit and proper:


… have regard to any matter, not mentioned in section 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5, that it considers relevant to the personal, commercial, financial or professional character, status or reputation of the person or associate.


My question to the government is: how on earth will you develop it, how on earth will that be dealt with and what are the criteria in respect of that? There are some regulations I am seeking to disallow, which I am concerned are simply too vague and imprecise and will cause a lot of concern amongst those who have to work on very small margins in this industry when advocating for those seeking a grant.


What has been put to me by those who work in the industry is that this is quite different from other areas where a fit-and-proper-person test is appropriately required. If you are a customs agent, for instance, you have a certain amount of trust placed in you for the clearance of material goods coming into this country, and it is important that you pass a fit-and-proper-persons test so that you are not allowing narcotics or other prohibited substances or goods into the country. If you are a tax agent, you get certain privileges from the tax office with respect to the late lodgement of returns and the like. There is an element of trust placed in you by the tax office by virtue of your being a tax agent, so I can understand the need for a fit-and-proper-person test with respect to that. But in relation to an export grants scheme, where these people act as agents, prepare applications and submit the applications, there does not seem to be any privileges attached as there is for a tax agent or a customs agent.


The explanatory memorandum to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004—this bill—states that consultants must be excluded for 'behaviour considered inconsistent with accepted community standards'. What does that mean? It may appear on the surface to be reasonable; it has the potential to become unreasonable when applied to the ministerial determination that will accompany the legislation.


Procedural fairness may not be achieved if what constitutes unacceptable action is not sufficiently defined or if external review provisions are manifestly inadequate. The requirement that administrators observe natural justice is protected at a federal level. In relation to that we need to refer to the Administrative Decisions Review Act, but it is my view that the necessary safeguards for that to be achieved are not present in this legislation. Where are the safeguards?


The coalition says it is about reducing red tape and making it easier for businesses to get on with their legitimate work but there are many landmines—so many pitfalls—in this particular test, which is something that the previous government put up. I am surprised that this government is embracing what I think is a bad element of this legislation. How do you determine behaviour considered 'inconsistent with accepted community standards'? Where is the procedural fairness?


My fear is that somebody may be subject to a capricious action under the scheme: 'We don't think you're a fit and proper person; we will therefore make that ruling.' That person could end up losing their livelihood for the next two or three years pending a judicial review. We know what it costs to run a judicial review. Access to justice in this country is a sad joke. When you consider how much money it costs to bring an application in the Federal Court, to retain a solicitor and to obtain counsel to argue the case, you could be looking, at the very least, at tens of thousands of dollars for a simple judicial review application. And that will take a considerable period of time. If there is an appeal to the Federal Court it would cost tens of thousands of dollars more.


The concern is that these export grant agents are not making a killing. They are making a pretty modest living and some of them are eking out a living—particularly in relation to the small exporters that they advocate for. So, I do not understand why the government would embrace this test when there appears to be a vagueness that accompanies it and where there appears to be a potential of abuse of power in relation to its use.


In the explanatory memorandum to the bill in respect of the 'consultants not fit and proper persons' provisions it is stated that this will 'provide the CEO of Austrade a mechanism to deal responsively to the variety and diversity of yet unknown circumstances and behaviours that may arise'. What on earth does that mean? What does it mean to talk about the 'yet unknown and circumstances and behaviours that may arise'? It seams incredibly vague and dangerous to me to be putting that in a piece of legislation or in a legislative instrument.


These undefined obligations may place Austrade in an untenable position. Our system of justice puts the onus on the accuser to establish its case. Under the ministerial determination, however, once an allegation has been made Austrade are obliged to accept the allegation as material and allow the litigation to run its course. The defendant must be presumed guilty until proven innocent. How is that fair in terms of procedural fairness? How is that fair in terms of natural justice? How is that fair to these agents who act for small exporters—the future of this economy when you consider the importance of encouraging small exporters to become medium and bigger exporters and the enormous benefit exports have to our nation?


Those are, in essence, my concerns. My understanding is that under the 'fit and proper person' provisions of this bill once any allegation of impropriety is made against an agent, in the press or otherwise, Austrade must apply to 'fit and proper person' provisions. In the case of a consultant the effect on their livelihood and on their clients would be dramatic. If an applicant has a grant payment denied or delayed this is bad enough; a consultant, on the other hand, may lose everything. For instance, if a start-up company successfully launches a new patented lure for catching large game fish such as marlin, then demonstrates the attributes of the lure and shows that it qualifies for support under the export grant scheme, it would budget accordingly. If an allegation is made that the agent is in some way not a fit and proper person—any allegation can be made—that company can be held up in terms of their grant.


That is the sort of thing that I am concerned about. There are other examples that I could give. For instance, what happens with an EMDG application if someone is charged with something unrelated to fraud or dishonesty—if they are charged with an assault, for instance? Does that mean that they would be held over, under the 'fit and proper person' test? I think that is unfair. You are punishing a person two or three times as a result of that.


There are other examples that have been put to me. I do not want to raise those examples for fear of identifying any of the people that have come forward to me to express their genuine concerns. My appeal to the government is to put this on hold with respect to the 'fit and proper persons' test. I think it has been ill-considered. If you look at the fine details of the test as it is intended to apply and the circumstances in which it is intended to apply and the whole background of what these agents do, compared to what a customs agent or a tax agent does—in fact they would be better referred to as 'consultants' rather than 'agents'—then you would find that it is very dangerous.


To rely on insufficiently defined administrative powers will cause enormous damage to this sector, particularly to small and medium exporters. I think the cost of consultants will go up. Fewer consultants will want to be involved in this and a lot of consultants will say, 'That's hanging over our head—that we can lose our livelihood overnight with an allegation that cannot be sufficiently dealt with or will have to go through the courts.' That is dangerous as well. I would like to hear from the government in relation to why it is proceeding with this ill-considered part of the legislation in terms of the fit and proper person test, which is so ill-defined and so open to administrative abuse.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (10:53):  I thank Senators Wong and Xenophon for their contributions to the debate on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. The Export Market Development Grants scheme has had a very long and important history in Australia. Our government is very committed to ensuring that it plays a key role in the future in opening Australia further to the world and in supporting our exporters and industries to continue to grow their businesses and the wealth and opportunities for all Australians. The EMDG scheme has been in place since 1974-75, with first grants paid in 1975-76. So it has a very long history. Over the last 14 years, the EMDG scheme has helped support SME exports worth more than $60 billion. On average, those exporters have employed some 97,000 employees each year. So it has a proud history; it is a history of creating exports and, in doing that, creating jobs. For every one dollar of cost to the taxpayer, estimates indicate a benefit is received to the nation of some $5.38. It is a significant benefit in return.


Our government is committed to boosting funding for the EMDG scheme—a $50 million boost over four years, starting in 2013-14. This is the longest sustained increase in funding for the scheme in the last 10 years. The long-term nature and certainty of that funding is important because it provides confidence to businesses who want to invest in export marketing in knowing that grants will be available to them. We are proud of those changes as well as other changes that are being pursued which will increase the number of grants able to be received by an applicant from seven to eight. We believe that allowing experienced exporters to claim an additional grant will assist many of the previously successful EMDG recipients to further develop their existing markets, re-enter markets that are now commercially viable again due to reductions in the exchange rate, and diversify into new markets. The overwhelming majority of these mature, successful exporters export to multiple markets, often spanning both the developed markets like the US and Europe and the fast-growing markets like China and South-East Asia. Based on the profile of previous years' applicants, it is estimated that 138 additional exporters will be able to claim each year as a result of this change.


We also supporting changes that reduce the minimum expenses threshold required to be incurred by an applicant from $20,000 to $15,000 per annum. Reducing the minimum expenses threshold reduces the amount of money that small exporters need to spend on their export marketing before they can claim an EMDG. This is particularly important for small specialised services companies and early-stage high-tech companies who are often born globals, with their primary markets being international rather than domestic, and are seeking to sell intellectual property or develop their first market. Through the reduction in the minimum expenses threshold, approximately 143 additional exporters are projected to be able to claim each year.


Further, the government supports changes that reduce the current $5,000 deduction from the applicant's provisional grant amount to $2,500. We recognise that, in the current difficult international trading conditions where exporters have faced several years of pressure on their marketing budget from higher exchange rates and weaker international markets, the ability to have even a modest increase in marketing funds is expected to be very welcome. Research into the EMDG scheme shows that increasing grants increases the export marketing expenditure by more than the grant amount as exporters contribute their own funds to support these activities. This increase in grant funds is particularly relevant now with many small and medium enterprises increasingly eyeing the potential for increased international sales as exchange rates ease and international markets recover. Almost all grant recipients will receive an extra $2,500 per grant due to this change. The number of grant recipients receiving such a benefit ranges from between 2,600 to more than 4,500 exporters each year. We have a very strong commitment to this scheme and a very strong intention to make sure that it is delivering continued growth and benefit to exporters into the future.


Senator Xenophon raised some particular concerns about this legislation, which introduces a fit and proper person test for EMDG consultants. They are people who assist exporters with the preparation and lodgement of their grant application. As Senator Xenophon highlighted in some of his remarks, fit and proper person tests are quite common in Commonwealth legislation. They apply across a range of different roles or activities that people undertake where they interact with the Commonwealth or receive certain responsibilities, powers or funding from the Commonwealth and, of course, are designed to protect the integrity and public perception of the management of programs by the Commonwealth.


EMDG applicants—that is, the exporters applying for the grant—have had fit and proper person provisions in place for more than a decade. These provisions have been widely recognised and the benefits of them have been widely acknowledged. It is not something new or unusual in this case to have a fit and proper person test in place in relation to the operation of the EMDG scheme. It is just that, until now, that has only applied to the applicants. This legislation seeks to extend that application so that it also applies to consultants who make application on behalf of particular applicants.


Austrade, which, of course, is the arm of government that administers the EMDG scheme, has developed significant experience in administering the fit and proper person provisions that apply to EMDG applicants. So I am a little bit surprised at some of Senator Xenophon's concerns in that regard. Given the longstanding history Austrade has in applying these provisions to EMDG applicants, there is no great leap in terms of applying them to the consultants who act on behalf of those applicants as well. Austrade advise that EMDG consultants have not raised any concerns about Austrade's management of the current fit and proper person provisions that apply to applicants. So in relation to some of Senator Xenophon specific concerns about how this will be administered, certainly the history of Austrade's activities demonstrates that, where they have administered these types of provisions in relation to applicants to date, neither applicants nor consultants have raised any particular concerns.


It is important to understand, in terms of why this action is being undertaken, that EMDG consultants do overwhelmingly work on a success fee basis. Our understanding is that, essentially, EMDG consultants in general receive a 10 per cent commission on grants obtained for their clients. Around 60 per cent of applicants work through a consultant. So we do have very significant uptake of consultants in this regard as people pursue grants under the scheme. Around 60 per cent of the time they are using consultants who do receive a significant financial benefit at the end of it. Consultants do have considerable financial interest in the process and they can of course potentially benefit from any unprotected overclaiming of grants. So it is important to ensure the integrity is there, not just in the applicants themselves but in those acting on behalf of the applicants.


The total amount payable to EMDG grant recipients under the scheme is capped. Therefore, any grant that is paid on the basis of false information reduces the amount available to other honest applicants. So it is important to understand that the integrity of this scheme is vital not just for government probity reasons but because maintaining that integrity can stretch the dollars as far as possible. The amounts spent on monitoring and investigating claims reduces the overall amount available, which again is a good reason for ensuring that we have standards of the highest order for the people participating in the scheme in the first instance to minimise the need to investigate, monitor or undertake actions that are simply in the nature of a rectification. Prevention is of course better than the cure in this regard.


It is not feasible for Austrade to fully verify every single application. So on that basis a degree of trust is required in this process, and much of that trust is therefore vested in the consultants who are presenting those applications to Austrade. It is also important that the public perceive the scheme to be operating in an honest and proper manner and that public funds are provided only to fit and proper recipients. That would be something all in this chamber would accept; this is simply a case of how that is achieved. The public perception of EMDG consultants reflects significantly on the scheme as a whole and the government's management of the scheme. Therefore, to ensure we continue to maintain high public support for a scheme that delivers significant benefit it is appropriate that, just as applicants are required to be fit and proper people to receive a grant, the consultants acting on their behalf should meet a similar standard.


Such a provision in the act will also provide a further incentive for consultants not to make false claims and an incidental incentive for applicants not to use consultants with a poor record for financial probity. The proposed provision would assist in protecting taxpayers' funds from fraudulent or excessive claims, ensure the proper operation of the scheme and, importantly, ensure public confidence in the scheme.


Senator Wong asked questions in relation to whether there where rights to administrative appeal. It is important to note that the Austrade CEO making a finding under these amendments that a consultant is not a fit and proper person is significant and appropriate, and therefore such a finding will be subject to the normal rules of administrative law and natural justice. Consultants will have access to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In addition, consultants will be entitled to judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 as well as potential proceedings under common law.


The proposed fit and proper person provisions are very similar to provisions in the EMDG amendment bill 2013, which, due to the calling of the election, was not passed. The fit and proper person provisions in the 2013 bill were considered in quite some detail by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. I note that, at the committee's hearing on 7 June 2013, the Export Consultants Group, which represents the majority of EMDG consultants in Australia, indicated its support for a fit and proper person test for EMDG consultants broadly in line with the test for EMDG clients or applicants that has been in existence since 2004. So those who speak on behalf of the industry in relation to this matter and those who speak on behalf of the broad majority of consultants did indicate last year their support for provisions along these lines.


The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee supported the passage of the 2013 bill, which enjoyed bipartisan support from the then government and the then opposition for the inclusion of these provisions. They were, of course, at the time also considered by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which found that the proposed fit and proper person provisions raised no concerns in terms of the right of people to do their business with the government.


Austrade provided the Export Consultants Group with the proposed operational details of the fit and proper person test in November last year. This was building upon a significant period of consultation conducted in relation to the earlier 2013 bill, including those two reviews by the parliamentary committees. So there has been an extensive range of consultation with those involved in acting as consultants to EMDG applicants, and that has yielded positive responses from those who support these changes and support a reasonable level of standards for their industry. Austrade has indicated that it is open to further consultation if need be. It will of course continue to work with consultants on the detail of the test to be applied, which will be contained in a ministerial instrument under the act.


The government obviously urges support for this bill, especially the fit and proper person provisions but also the provisions which increase the eligibility of SME exporters for a grant. The current difficult international trading conditions and the ability to qualify for a grant or an increased grant make a significant difference to many hundreds of small exporters. The EMDG scheme is a reimbursement scheme. Exporters need to spend money on marketing to qualify for a grant for reimbursement of up to 50 per cent of that marketing expenditure. Delaying this bill will prevent those exporters from having the opportunity to increase their budget this year and to seek partial reimbursement from 1 July this year. We do commend the bill to the house. We appreciate Senator Xenophon's concerns in relation to unnecessary red tape but do not believe that, in this instance, that is the case. I look forward to, if possible, assisting the senator with any questions in the committee stage.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2014-03-26,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I rise today to issue this warning to the owners of Australia's 77,000 cattle properties: examine very closely the international campaign to make you prove you are environmentally sustainable.


Last week, on Monday, 17 March, a document was released that will potentially shape how Australian cattle producers are allowed to operate in years to come. It is a document written overseas, in Holland and the United States apparently, but one that is designed to oblige cattle producers around the world to prove they are environmentally sustainable. I believe it has been initiated and shaped principally by environmental activists. That makes me very suspicious. It is a document which cattle producers throughout Australia should scrutinise very closely. The document is called the DRAFT Principles and criteria for global sustainable beef. It has been produced by the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef.


The global roundtable was initiated by the World Wildlife Fund, based in Switzerland, and the US-based McDonald's hamburger chain. Another prime mover in the roundtable is an environment-related group, called Solidaridad, based in Holland. Producer bodies on the roundtable include the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, the US National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the Cattle Council of Australia. Other members include processors, retailers, restaurants and environmental groups. The organisation was established by the following bodies: McDonald's; WWF; Solidaridad; beef processors and commodity traders Cargill and JBS; pharmaceutical companies Merck and Elanco; and the giant retail chain Walmart. Australia's Woolworths has also since joined.


The draft document on principles and criteria for global sustainable beef anticipates having national or regional standards that must be met by cattle producers. Who is going to verify that those standards are being met? And how much will Australian cattle producers be charged for the privilege? All the attention right now is on establishing a definition for sustainable beef. No-one has an exact definition, and that is the focus of the recently released discussion paper. However, Australian cattle producers should be told not just what sustainability means but also the process for proving it—and the price tag.


The schedule for progressing the current principles and criteria document is as follows. It is available for public comment until May 16. There will be a final review in July. The members of the roundtable are then scheduled to ratify the principles and criteria, later this year. Organisations like this roundtable are really run by the secretariat, the people working full time writing up the agenda papers for meetings, publishing the newsletters, et cetera. The executive director of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef is a guy called Ruaraidh Petre. He is based in Holland, and came to the roundtable after working for eight years for Solidaridad—remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, Solidaridad was one of the original members of the roundtable, along with McDonald's and WWF. Solidaridad has certification schemes in its DNA. According to its website under 'What we do', Solidaridad says it works on 'creating sustainable supply chains from the producer to the consumer'. It does this by helping agricultural producer organisations and industrial producer companies to qualify for social and environmental certification standards. That is where the CEO of the beef roundtable comes from.


As I said, WWF was also a prime mover in the process to establish the Global Roundtable on Sustainable Beef. Imagine WWF sitting down and determining the environmental conditions that our producers are obliged to meet before they can market their cattle! This is the same WWF that waged a campaign against the land- and regrowth-clearing practices of Queensland farmers. It is the same WWF that, less than two years ago, made submissions to Queensland parliamentary inquiries, savagely denigrating the cattle industry's sustainability record. WWF also argued that compulsory standards must be implemented. WWF are no friends of the Australian cattle industry. With the excuse of having to meet so-called international sustainability principles, WWF in Australia would have even greater leverage to continue trying to force our cattle producers down the path of more and more restricted on-farm practices and compulsory standards.


Let us look at the costs associated with sustainability certification for producers. At this stage, we can only get a rough idea of what the costs might be. That is why I say Australian farmers should be told up-front what they might be charged to gain sustainability certification. However, we can gain some indication of costs. One of the other Australian members of the global roundtable is the Australian Land Management Group, a business that already offers what it calls a certified land management plan. Its website says that, to become certified, you begin by listing all your property activities, the aspects of those activities that might have environmental impacts, and what those impacts are. You then do a risk analysis and assign priority rankings to the impacts you have identified. After this, you develop a management plan to address the causes of those impacts. There is also an animal welfare component. To achieve certification, you need to implement your plan, which is then reviewed by an auditor. That review examines how the plan has been implemented and whether the outcomes are being monitored. If there are no problems, the auditor will recommend certification. After this, you enter into an annual review and audit cycle. The website says that the cost of delivery varies.


As a guide, in the first year landholders usually work as part of a group doing a start-up workshop and a review workshop. Each of the two workshops has an indicative cost of $800 per family farm or managed business. So that is $1,600 in the first year for a family owned farm. After this, there is a minimum certification fee of $150 and an annual business fee of $300. Based on 77,000 properties paying $1,750 for the two workshops and certification, that adds up to almost $135 million to be paid out by Australian farming families in one year.


In January this year, McDonald's headquarters in the USA announced its stores across the globe would buy verifiably sustainable beef from 2016. I wrote to McDonald's in Australia and asked a simple question: 'Can you provide me with a written assurance that Australian cattle producers will face no extra costs because of McDonald's future purchasing policy relating to ""verifiably sustainable beef""?' The two-page response from McDonald's included the following paragraph: 'We understand that there is a concern of increased costs and whether McDonald's will pay increased prices for sustainable beef. It is too early to predict if or how beef prices will be impacted in the future but we are committed to working collaboratively with suppliers throughout the entire process and understand the existing pressures producers already face in the production of these animals.' Producers can reach their own conclusions as to what that means. I am sure McDonald's care about the planet. However, their ultimate responsibility is not to the planet but to their shareholders. They examine issues based on the view of improving value and returns to shareholders. Much of what they do is about marketing and money.


I know someone who cares passionately about the environment and livestock—and that is the average Australian farming family. I do not want to see them burdened with more cost, more paperwork and more unnecessary environmental obligations to keep WWF in business and provide a marketing point of difference for the likes of McDonald's.


I have had informal discussions with the Cattle Council president, Andrew Ogilvie, on this issue and I look forward to talking to him again. He is caught between a rock and a hard place. I am sure he is well intentioned and has what he perceives as the best interests of Australian cattle producers at heart. However, he needs to be informed by the widest possible range of views from cattle producers across the country before he goes back overseas to negotiate on these sustainability principles. I appeal to Australian cattle producers: do not take this issue lightly. Do not think it is just bulldust and that, if you ignore the issue, it will somehow go away and not affect you. Speak up now and have your say.


Finally, there is another question—a vital question—that I want answered. What happens if Australian cattle producers do not sign up to the sustainability principles determined through the global roundtable process? If Australian cattle producers do not allow a third party to certify or verify their sustainability, will McDonald's refuse to purchase beef locally? Will environmental activists like WWF campaign to ban the sale of Australian beef in overseas markets? We already see environmental activists campaigning to prevent the sale in overseas markets of Australian timber that was not produced from the sources they sanction. This is referred to as 'green blackmail' or simply 'green mail', something I have warned about in the past.


The apparent growing power of environmental non-government organisations and corporations raises fundamental questions about the future role of government, science and rational resource management in Australian primary production. This goes to the very essence of not simply who is running the Australian beef industry but who is running the country. Who determines how our primary industries are managed and administered? Who decides how our resources are utilised and where they are marketed? Who determines the prosperity of our communities, our industries and our nation? Those are the questions we must have answered.


I believe this issue should be referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. Before I do that, I will discuss this further with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce. I believe it requires forensic examination in a Senate inquiry. We can call witnesses to the inquiry from the main players. We can thoroughly examine who will bear the cost of this sustainability scheme and who will enjoy the benefits. We can investigate what the implications are for rural and regional communities that depend on cattle and other primary production and for Australia's trade sovereignty and its ability to freely trade in primary products we already know to be sustainable.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (14:01):  I thank Senator Bishop for that question. If I may say so, I do not accept the premise of the question. Senator Bishop is perpetuating an absolute falsehood. The government is not proposing to get rid of the best interest duty. The government is not proposing to remove the requirement for financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients. In fact, that requirement is now and will continue to be in section 691B(1) of the relevant future of financial advice laws. In the second part of that particular section, there is a checklist of the things that an adviser has to comply with in order to satisfy that particular best interest duty. It involves making sure that you are across the subject matter, that you are identifying all of the relevant facts such as the objectives of the client, the financial situation of the client and the relevant circumstances. The adviser has to make a judgement on whether or not they are qualified to provide the advice, they have to decline to provide the advice if they are not qualified to do so—and so on. All of those requirements will remain.


What we have said is that the additional catch-all, open-ended requirement that Labor had added at the bottom of the list—that the adviser would be required to do anything else, take any other reasonable step in order to fulfil the best interest duty—was too open-ended; it provided too much uncertainty for consumers and for financial advisers about how this particular best interest duty would operate. Too much uncertainty means too much additional cost, which means that seniors across Australia would have to pay more for advice than they otherwise would have to, and we want seniors to have access to affordable, high-quality advice they can trust.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (14:05):  I hesitate to do this, but let me say: I reject the premise of the question. This government remains committed to improving the financial advice laws in Australia in order to ensure that we restore the right balance between appropriate levels of consumer protection and ensuring that access to high-quality advice that people can trust remains affordable. 


There has been a lot of misinformation and a lot of confusion created by people with a vested interest to create that confusion. We want to ensure that people understand what we are actually proposing to do rather than what people perceive we are doing. Of course, the misrepresentations that Senator Bishop has used as a foundation for his questions is just another example of that.


If there are ways that we can better achieve the policy objectives that we stated in the lead-up to the last election by ensuring more precise language in the regulations, of course we will take those propositions on board. That is the usual process. (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-03-26,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


The minister has come into this place and provided an unacceptable explanation for her failure to answer these questions. These are legitimate questions about how she dealt with a conflict of interest that was at the heart of her office—and I am not surprised that she is leaving the chamber, because it is consistent with the way in which this minister has dealt with this chamber on this issue of the conflict of interest at the heart of her office; and it is consistent with the misleading of this chamber on more than one occasion—from a government that was supposedly going to be transparent and accountable we see, in practice, that this is a government which stonewalls, which obfuscates, which refuses to be up-front and which refuses to be transparent.


The conflict of interest in the minister's office has cast a shadow over the ethical standards of this government. The response of the assistant minister to public concerns has been arrogant stonewalling. Her refusal to account for her actions has made a mockery of the Abbott government's claims that it would be an accountable government. The series of questions on notice to which I referred today were put on notice on 20 February. They ask for simple, straightforward, factual information; information about how the minister complies with the government's ministerial standards and information about how she ensures her staff comply with the government's standards for ministerial staff.


It is simply not acceptable and certainly a little unbelievable that the minister has failed to answer these questions after 30 days. We know that this assistant minister can move very quickly when she wants to. Look how quickly she moved when the Australian Food and Grocery Council asked for the health star rating website to be taken down. One phone call from the food industry lobby and the website was down within hours. There was a flurry of phone calls from her office to the department to get the website down. When it comes to responding to lobby groups' concerns, she is all action. But when it comes to responding to concerns about her conduct, there is no action at all. Everything grinds to a halt. The shutters come down. The lights go out. No-one is at home. This is the opposite of accountability in government. This is a minister who has already been censured by this Senate for refusing to comply with an order to produce documents. Now she is compounding that refusal by refusing to answer questions on notice. It is obstructionist behaviour. It is evasive behaviour. I will submit that it is untrustworthy behaviour. It shows contempt for the Senate and for the public.


What are these questions that the assistant minister finds so hard to answer? Why is she so stumped by them? These are questions for which the answers would be readily available in any government that was functioning properly and that was committed to accountability. The first question on notice, No. 223, seeks details about the process the minister followed in appointing her chief of staff. When did she seek the Prime Minister's approval? Did she advise the Prime Minister of Mr Furnival's interests? On what date did Mr Furnival commence as her chief of staff? Are we in this chamber to believe that the assistant minister's records are in such disarray that she cannot even say on what date Mr Furnival started working for her?


Question on notice 224 asked about the statement of interest required from staff. I asked whether or not the minister required her staff to do what is required under the statement of ministerial staff standards, and that is to submit a statement of interests. I asked when Mr Furnival submitted his statement and what that statement disclosed. One would have thought that she would be able to answer a question about whether or not her staff in fact complied with the standards the Prime Minister has set. It is not complex. It does not require the scouring of hundreds of pages of records or delving back into ancient history. The obvious answer—and I am still waiting for the minister to answer the question—that one could draw is that the minister is simply refusing to answer the question because the answer is, no, she has not ensured that her staff have complied with the statement of standards.


Question on notice 225 asked about the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation in December 2013. These were simple questions about one day and one meeting. These were simple questions about who attended the meeting and why there was a failure to declare the interest in a lobbying firm. The assistant minister chaired this meeting. It appears she is not able to recall which staff were there. She is not able to find her records about one meeting and respond on that point.


Question on notice 226 asked whether or not Mr Furnival, as the assistant minister's chief of staff, received hospitality gifts or sponsored travel in relation to his employment and also asked questions about the assistant minister's current staff receiving such things. These are matters that the government's statement of standards for ministerial staff requires staff to declare. So what I am asking is: under the declaration that her staff have to engage with, can she please tell us what has been declared? One would not have thought that was a difficult proposition. A government complying with its own standards would have no trouble in answering this question.


Question on notice 227 asked whether or not any of the minister's current or former staff have a direct or family interest in the food, tobacco or alcohol industries. Again, that is something that would have to be disclosed in the statement of interests required under the government standards for ministerial staff. I would have thought that, if the minister is properly managing her staff and her office and ensuring that there are no conflicts of interest in this role, she would have had no trouble in answering this question.


Question on notice 234 is a question as to whether or not the assistant minister has agreed to any of her staff maintaining outside employment or involvement in a business or retaining a directorship. It goes on to ask a number of other questions. These are straightforward, factual questions about management of conflicts of interest within the minister's office. A conclusion that can be drawn from the minister's failure to answer is the one which I think is demonstrated by her answers today—that she simply failed to manage the conflict of interest in her office.


I would also make the point that there has been a rejected freedom of information request from me and also a journalist which has been reported. That freedom of information request relates to a letter that the minister gave evidence about at Senate estimates. Let's recall that, in all of the debate, dispute and discussion about this minister's behaviour, her single item of defence has been that she required her chief of staff to give undertakings about how he would address the conflict of interest. She told Senate estimates that these undertakings were set out in a letter from her chief of staff outlining the measures that would be taken to avoid conflicts of interest between his business affairs and his ministerial staff role. This is a letter that is central to the defence that this minister has put to this chamber. It is central to the defence about how she ensured that the statement of standards applicable to ministers and staff was complied with. One of the reasons she was censured was her failure to produce this letter.


I can now inform the Senate, as I flagged, that the minister's department or office have refused to provide access to the letter under the Freedom of Information Act. In a letter to me, the department said: 'The document requested is neither an official document of the minister nor a document of an agency.' So the letter that the minister says sets out arrangements to avoid a conflict of interest at the heart of her office is not an official document. This is the letter that is at the core of the assistant minister's defence. She claims it proves she was managing the conflict of interest in her office, but she refused to produce it and now her own department says that it is not an official document of a minister.


This freedom of information refusal simply casts further doubts on the minister's claims. This is a letter which her chief of staff provided as part of his employment to ensure there was no conflict of interest and to ensure she was complying with the Prime Minister's code of conduct. Now we are told it has no official status. It is apparently in some grey zone, perhaps the same grey zone as all of this minister's other non-responses to questions and all of her misleading statements to the Senate. You have to ask, if it is not an official document, what is its status? Is it written on the back of a napkin? Is it scribbled on the back of a coaster? Why is the minister fighting tooth and nail against producing it?




Senator Bilyk:
  Does it exist?




Senator WONG:
  I will take that interjection. Maybe it does not exist at all and that is why cannot be produced. The Prime Minister promised before the election that he would lead a government that would be accountable and transparent and he is not delivering on that promise. The Assistant Minister for Health's failure to answer these questions is just the latest example of how this is a government that is not doing what it said it would do. It is a secretive government and it is an arrogant government. It is a government that refuses to be accountable to the public for its actions.


We have had the Assistant Minister for Health, with a conflict of interest in her office, misleading the Senate and refusing to answer questions. We have had Senator Sinodinos refusing to explain his involvement in Australian Water Holdings. And we have had the Prime Minister refusing to be upfront about what he knew in both of these matters. One minister has gone, another has been censured and a chief of staff has quit over a conflict of interest. We now have absurdities like the letter which the Assistant Minister for Health claims shows how she was managing a conflict of interest, but which her department says is not an official document.


We have absurdities like the acting Assistant Treasurer, who is also the Minister for Finance, put on hold changes which are the responsibility of the Assistant Treasurer and where the Assistant Treasurer stood aside yet he is still the Assistant Treasurer even though his job is being done by the acting Assistant Treasurer. The Prime Minister is leading a secretive, slipshod and arrogant government.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:17):  I would like to contribute to the debate to pay tribute to Senator Nash, the way she has handled the portfolio and the way she has answered questions. It is so different to the previous government; we are still waiting for answers about Copenhagen and what happened at the climate change conference there. I am still waiting for a number of questions that I put on notice to the previous government. Yet the hypocrisy of the Labor Party shows through and here is a motion moved 30 days after.


I think the record will show that Senator Nash, in responding to the inquiry by the Leader of the Opposition—who I might say read every part of her speech, and I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that she get a new speech writer—explained to anyone who wanted to listen that her office was very busy. I heard her say that they were actually working on the answers to those questions. I also heard her say that most of the questions were asked by Senator Wong at estimates and were either answered there or taken on notice there. Since that time, there have been other questions.


I wanted to put just a modicum of fact into that bile filled speech from the previous speaker about someone who I think is doing a magnificent job as a minister. I have to say as well, it is refreshing how open the Abbott government has been and how accountable it has been in all of the very important and serious matters that it has been involved in. I have been here for a long while now—some say too long. I have sat through the Hawke and Keating governments, I have sat through the Howard government and I have sat through the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. There is a pattern that I have noticed over those years with Labor: how they run the union movement, how they run the Labor Party in New South Wales, how they looked after Mr Thompson and how they looked after Mr Williamson. These two icons of the Labor Party are now facing criminal charges and jail, but they looked after them and kept everything secret even from members of the HSU, the union that was paying for Mr Thompson's theft. Unions and the Labor Party itself were hiding Mr Williamson.


I have noticed over the years that Labor governments follow the New South Wales Labor dictum of keeping everything secret. That way, you never get into trouble. Unfortunately, things do come out, as we have heard. Senator Dastyari will know, because he was around in part of the cover-up, and my namesake—I am embarrassed to say that he is my namesake—will know how the Labor Party looked after these people, covered up for them and were never accountable, not even to their own members and not even to the union members who were paying them.


I have seen this over many years. It is the Labor way to cover-up, obfuscate and never answer a question. We think question time these days is a bit rowdy when you hear the opposition catcalling, but at least at question time now senators are getting answers to questions. I well remember when this matter was first raised with Senator Nash. I thought to myself, having been around for a while, 'Do not say anything, take it on notice, go and look at it.' But immediately Senator Nash got up and gave an explanation on the very first day. I thought, 'That is the sign of a very, very good minister.' A good minister is someone who is across the portfolio and able to deal with all of these issues.


I might say that in the substantive part of her portfolio she is doing excellent work, such as in rural and regional Australia and I guess elsewhere as well. I just want to answer Senator Wong's accusation of 'an arrogant stonewall'. Well, that Labor leader using 'an arrogant stonewall' as a description just fades away to stupidity when you actually hear what the answer was. The department has been very busy. They have had an enormous number of questions through estimates, not about this issue but about real issues in the portfolio, and they are, obviously, giving attention to them. Senator Nash did say that they were working on the answers, so they are going to come, unlike the answers to the questions on Copenhagen which we are still waiting on. As the minister said, she had already answered many of the questions at estimates. I wanted to make sure that anyone who might be listening to this debate is not confused by the tirade that we just heard from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-03-26,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:23):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Singh and Peris today relating to proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.


It has been made clear today that the Attorney-General is more interested in defending the rights of those he refers to as 'bigots' than in defending the rights of minorities. In order to protect what Senator Brandis described in this place as the fundamental right to be a bigot he has released plans to narrow protections under the Racial Discrimination Act and then exempt almost everyone from this law. What is the point of having a law if you are then going to have umpteen exemptions from it? That just outlines the dishonesty that is being put forward in this draft exposure that Senator Brandis provided to the public yesterday.


By the Attorney-General's own admission vilification and hate speech should never be a feature of intellectual debate. So, if that is the case, why does the Abbott government want to introduce such broad exemptions to the law? Under these exemptions even people vilifying ethnic and racial groups in bad faith are protected as long as they can claim it was related to any political, social, cultural, religious, artistic, academic or scientific matter. It is difficult, within that huge list, to think of any public statement that would not be covered by those exemptions, which shows the dishonesty in the proposed changes that Senator Brandis has put forward.


Let us think about what the changes might actually mean. They will mean comments on an online blog or article. They would include a sign threatening a Jewish group at a neo-Nazi rally against immigration. It is hard to imagine any conduct that falls outside these exemptions, which is an observation that was made by Chris Berg from the Institute of Public Affairs who clearly said:


The new exemption makes clear the fundamental importance of free discussion on any matter of public interest, no matter how extreme that discussion is.


Is that really the kind of Australian society we want to live in? What is the point of having Senator Brandis bringing forward these changes of freedom of speech at any cost, bringing forward changes that he claims put forward laws for racial vilification and hate speech, but then exempts just about every kind of activity from them?


Let us take the case of Fredrick Toben—which is a case very familiar, I am sure, to Senator Brandis—who has been found time and time again to have unlawfully produced and published material that denies the Holocaust. He has accused Jews of exaggerating the scale of the murder of Jewish people during World War II and he has dismissed people, who were offended by or disagreed with such outrageous claims, as being of limited intelligence. Is this the kind of display of racial vilification that we want to allow in our community without any recourse? Because, under that huge list that Senator Brandis outlined in section 4, it would be allowed. This is absolutely absurd and is not supported by some 150 community and ethnic groups across the country—some of which Senator Brandis claims he has met but which, clearly, he has also chosen to ignore.


We have been enlightened today by the way Senator Brandis has appeased the IPA. Through his cups of tea and through the IPA's briefing to the coalition it has been made very clear that the IPA are very happy with these proposed changes, as will be Andrew Bolt, because they go very much to the heart of doing exactly what the IPA, I am sure, briefed the coalition on. People in positions of privilege—people in positions of power—like Andrew Bolt have a platform to be racist. They are public commentators. They are journalists. It is not a level playing field. The victims, though, of racial abuses do not have that position of privilege or power— (Time expired)

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (15:28):  In her contribution Senator Singh demonstrates, as occurred all through question time today when Senator Brandis was answering questions in relation to the exposure draft of the amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act, that the opposition is not even prepared to listen. We have put in place a process, and at least Senator Singh did acknowledge that Senator Brandis's answers during question time were that he has had extensive—in fact I think the term he used was 'exhaustive'—consultation with minority groups throughout the development of the exposure draft.


It is important to note that this is part of a process. Senator Brandis has also said that he wants to have a conversation with the Australian community about the shape of these laws, which is why they have been released as an exposure draft—so that the community and members of parliament can comment on the exposure draft that has been released. Rather than just howling from the sidelines and spending all of question time interjecting and screaming at Senator Brandis across the chamber, it might be very useful if those members opposite—who obviously do not want to listen to any opinion other than their own—were to engage with the process.


Senator Brandis has released an exposure draft of this legislation for public comment—for the community to engage, for the community to comment—prior to bringing a final piece of legislation to the parliament. I think that is good process. In fact members of our party who had expressed concern—as part of the public commentary about our proposals to modify the act that was taking place prior to this process—have expressed their appreciation since Senator Brandis brought the exposure draft to the party room. They appreciate that it gives them the opportunity to participate in the public debate and to consult with their communities with that exposure draft in their hand. 


But the Labor Party just do not want to listen. They are not interested in what Senator Brandis has to say.




Senator Tillem:
  You're right.




Senator COLBECK:
  'You're right,' says Senator Tillem. You should be ashamed of that. They are just demonstrating their intolerance. It is surprising how many people who claim to be tolerant show the least tolerance when it comes to public debate. 




Senator Tillem:
  That's disingenuous.




Senator COLBECK:
  They try to howl people down, as Senator Tillem is trying to do at the moment. They try to howl people down. They are not prepared to listen to other perspectives in the debate.



Senator Dastyari interjecting—



Senator Tillem interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  And the chorus starts. They are not interested in what anyone else has to say. They are the ones who know best. They know better than anyone else. They are not tolerant of anyone else's opinion. It is interesting that in this debate, as Senator Brandis said a couple of days ago—




Senator Tillem:
  I am not interested in bigotry. I am not interested in racism.




Senator COLBECK:
  I will take your interjection, Senator Tillem, and I will put on the record that neither am I—and I do not think any member on this side of the chamber is.


What Senator Brandis said, Senator Tillem, was actually quite true. People have the right to be what they want to be. 




Senator Dastyari:
  Do people have the right to be bigots?




Senator COLBECK:
  They do, Senator. They do have the right to be what they want to be—and the community has the right, and should have the right, to decry that. And they should decry that. I am happy to condemn that sort of speech as much as anyone on that side of the chamber. But we are about providing the opportunity for people to speak freely. That is an important part of any community. It is not up to us to tell people what to think or what to say. That is what the Labor Party seek to do. They seek to control what people might want to be, want to think or want to say. You cannot do that. Yes, put parameters around it—which is what the draft seeks to do. 


Importantly, however, the exposure draft gives the community the opportunity to be part of the discussion. As I have said, members of my party who have had concerns about where this might go have expressed their appreciation of the process that Senator Brandis has put in place. (Time expired)

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:33):  I want to applaud Senator Colbeck's statements about the behaviour in this place and I am looking forward to hearing silence from the other side of the chamber during debates from now on. 


One of the problems with having a consultation is that you may hear things you do not want to hear. A second problem is that it is particularly difficult to consult when you have already gone out publicly and committed yourself to making the change—and not just committed yourself to making the change but celebrated the fact that, in the opinion of the decision maker, that change will permit behaviours that many people are quite concerned about. 


We now have a process in place and I am pleased that we also now have an exposure draft. That will encourage more people to come forward to put their views. The exposure draft in itself raises some issues, however. Senator Singh has already pointed out that the definitions in the exposure draft are very narrow and that the parameters for what constitutes a breach have been considerably tightened. That is a major concern. The proposal has very much reduced the range of behaviours considered to be inappropriate under the vilification process.


The implication of this proposal is that our community thinks it would be completely okay for words and actions to 'offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate'. Those are the current words in the legislation. They are the current words the minister has committed to changing. That is clearly on the record. I am sure that there will be a range of organisations, community groups and individuals who will take up the opportunity through the consultation process to remind the minister, the department and the government that we live in a society which has, for many years, operated with the understanding that words or actions that humiliate, insult, intimidate or offend are not appropriate. 


On one side of the argument you have an acceptance that such behaviour is not something that makes people feel safe or secure. It is not something that allows them to feel as though they are respected in our community. After all, that is the intent of the legislation—to ensure that every person in our community is safe, is secure and is respected. On one side you have that. On the other side there is an absolute commitment to free speech.


I think this is an important opportunity for us to weigh up, as a community, what we want Australia to be like. So far, I am pleased to say, everybody in this debate appears to be falling over themselves to openly commit that they are completely opposed to racism in our community. That is a good thing. It has given us a chance to reaffirm that. But the second point is: where in our community and where in each of us individually do we see the balance between our right to free speech—to say whatever we want to say about whomever we want—and the absolute, intrinsic right of people to feel safe, respected and secure?


One of the clear intents of the current legislation is to raise awareness in our wider community and to show everybody in our country and internationally that we have a society that values human beings and that human beings cannot be discriminated against while they are living in Australia. We pride ourselves on that. In fact, we go overseas and tell other countries about how they should operate in this way. What we are saying by opening this debate—by the exposure draft and the consultation in a process where the minister has already made a public commitment that he will make a change—is that, in that area, we are opening up the doors for people to question just how strongly we value these commitments that we have made over many years.


I think it is incredibly important that the whole issue of vilification be understood and that we have a debate about what that means. I also think that we should really see whether we want to limit any kind of threat of people being physically afraid. We have so much evidence, and in so much work we do here in the Senate we find out about the damage that is inflicted on other people in our community. It is not just physical. (Time expired)

Why now, days from a by-election that could alter the government's capacity to pass legislation? Why now, weeks away from a budget in which the government has been sincerely promising since September to make deep and lasting cuts to our social services, to put a blunt axe to foreign aid, to slice the budgets of our public broadcasters and to undermine the assistance that we extend to pensioners, single parents and low-income earners? Why does the senator think now is the time for Australians to be considering the degree of bloviating racism permissible in our public discourse? Why is this the pressing issue of our time? Why, when we have tried so hard to earn a reputation as a country that welcomes people of all races, does the first law officer of the Crown think that, among all the issues requiring urgent attention, the right to offend, to insult and to humiliate someone is worth rising up to defend? Why has the Attorney-General, with heavy heart and after careful consideration, determined that—of all the pressing matters, all the legislation weighing so heavily on the minister's mind and all the freedoms to protect and cherish—the freedom to humiliate someone based on the colour of their skin warrants this?


I would like to assert that, quite frankly, the reason this matter has come to the floor of this chamber is not the careful consideration of the Attorney-General, it is not that it meets the strategic objectives of the government's legislative agenda and it is not that the Racial Discrimination Act in its current form is so outrageously unjust. Of course not. The fact that this is a matter of urgency is simply due to the astonishing conceit, breathtaking arrogance and unbridled contempt that was so evident in Senator Brandis's response in this chamber on Monday. It is not just what the senator from Queensland said but the way he said it that has elevated this issue to a matter of pressing public concern. Senator Brandis's response to Senator Peris's question was delivered in a manner that made no effort to disguise his contempt and disdain for either the question or the questioner. Ladies and gentlemen, we were all here to witness it, but for the Hansard record I will repeat the minister's words:


People do have a right to be bigots, you know.


For the Hansard record, I want to be clear and to use the two other words Senator Brandis proposes to omit from the act: his response was delivered in a manner that was both offensive and insulting. Whether it was a sound bite or a headline, Senator Brandis's response was reprehensible, cringeworthy and ultimately untenable. He left himself with no choice but to try to undo the self-inflicted damage.


So I ask again: why is the right to humiliate someone because of their race a matter of such urgency? The senator can continue to pretend that this is an issue solely about free speech, but it is not. It is more than that. It goes to the heart of this country. It goes to the heart of a multicultural nation. Frankly, the responses that have been given by Senator Brandis are both offensive and insulting in themselves. The unmasked contempt in his response to Senator Peris was simply astonishing. Senator Brandis is not simply defending the rights of the likes of Andrew Bolt. No, he has gone beyond that now. Senator Brandis, through his contempt, has been forced to use this issue to defend himself.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:44):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Brandis to questions without notice. I was not aware of the initial motion when I stood to speak earlier. I am concerned by the level of contribution that has been put into this topic by a number of people. I was pleased to hear Senator Moore's comment that it is good that everyone has the opportunity to say that they abhor racism and that they will do what they can to stop it. But to suggest that to change a poorly drafted piece of Labor legislation is somehow to behave in a racist way is not acceptable. It is not about freedom of speech. It is not about anything that, in my view, should be happening in Australia or within Australian values. It is not reasonable. Senator Brandis has put out an exposure draft which will be available for a month for people to comment on, if they wish. If you do not like the way it is currently drafted—which Senator Singh certainly appears to believe—you are perfectly free to comment to Senator Brandis on the way it is currently drafted and to suggest new drafting. There is no way that there is not the ability for Australia to have legislation that both opposes racial vilification and allows freedom of speech. But it is not going to happen with the sort of nannying behaviour that we have had in the past from the former Labor government.


I do not believe that anybody could possibly see the outcome of the Andrew Bolt case as acceptable in Australia. It is not acceptable in Australia. I certainly share very few of Mr Bolt's views. But I will fight to the death—as would anybody, I would hope, in this place—for his right to express those views. Whether he expressed them accurately or not is not a matter for legislation around racial vilification. One would think that that sort of a problem could be taken to the Press Council if there were inaccuracies in the reporting. That is the body that deals with inaccuracies in media commentary or reporting. That is the body to talk to. To suggest that, because his report contained inaccuracies, it somehow becomes racial vilification is not reasonable in any way, shape or form. I did not like the views expressed in the article that was the subject of the court case involving Mr Bolt, but he has the right, in Australia, to have those views.


Whilst others might suggest that this is a very minor point to be using as the basis for changing legislation, it has the potential to be an extremely important point. I would think that anybody in this place would thoroughly respect and acknowledge that Attorney-General Brandis is someone who has the utmost regard and the utmost respect for law and for a liberal, with a small 'l', interpretation of law and the rights of the individual under the law in Australia. So I cannot believe that this opposition wants to attack this legislation. Well, I can, I am afraid, believe it. Certainly, if there were any penalties for inaccurate statements about legislation within this parliament the entire opposition—the entire non-government side—would stand condemned for the way they have misinterpreted and misrepresented this legislation.


I am a member of a very privileged group within Australia: a white Anglo-Saxon. I cannot begin to know what it is personally like to experience racial hatred or racial vilification. Nevertheless, I would not want to see that happen to anyone in Australia. I certainly have very strong views on disability discrimination. I do not want to see people attacked for their race in the same way I do not want to see people attacked because of a disability or because they are different in any way from anybody else. The opposition have a month to comment calmly and succinctly on this legislation. They should take it. (Time expired)

  The Australian government takes all allegations of human rights abuses and international crime seriously.

The Australian government believes that engaging Sri Lanka, not isolating it, is the most effective way to encourage and advance progress on human rights and accountability and for promoting reconciliation.

Although I believe that Senator McKenzie does have the future of Australian schools at heart, we must remember that it is her government which has stood in the way of achieving everything Senator McKenzie proposes here.


The coalition government has undermined the recommendations of the Gonski review panel at every step of the way. The coalition education minister still maintains that there is no inequality in Australian schools. Australia's thousands of excellent teachers do have a huge impact on students all around the country, but the biggest determining factor for student outcomes in Australia remains family wealth. Until the coalition government acknowledges this and supports genuine needs based funding to give every child a world-class education we will not see the change we need. I urge Senator McKenzie to persuade the education minister to implement the original recommendations of the Gonski review panel in all Australian schools.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-03-26,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:20):  I rise to speak on a matter that is indeed of great public importance. It is Labor's belief that every Australian has the right to be protected from speech that offends, insults or humiliates on the basis of race. By contrast, the Abbott government believes in the rights of the bigots. The Abbott government wants to legitimise, encourage and empower bigotry. The Attorney-General's stated rationale for the government's proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act is to protect the rights of the bigots. As he told the Senate so famously already on Monday of this week, 'people do have a right to be bigots'. Even for a government which seems to specialise in backward-looking policy, in aggressive and bullying politics, this was an extraordinary and retrograde step.


We in this country have built a remarkably tolerant, democratic and free multicultural Australia. But we all know that there are still the bigoted and the prejudiced amongst us. We all know that their conduct can humiliate, belittle, hurt and damage people. That is why, collectively, we have agreed to the protections contained in the Racial Discrimination Act and that is why those protections are needed. It is also why people in leadership positions have a responsibility to stand up to bigotry and prejudice, especially in this place. We in this place have a responsibility to denounce racial prejudice, not to defend it on specious grounds, not to encourage it by our actions or our silence and certainly not to legislate in its interests.


Yesterday, the Prime Minister proclaimed that reinstating the British honours would add a grace note to Australian society. On the same day, the government released legislation to allow Australians to be insulted and humiliated on the basis of their race. That is not a grace note. It is an ugly note—a jarring note of discord. It will encourage bullies and create division and intolerance. It will damage the fabric of our society and, most importantly, it will hurt real people, individuals who will experience real pain.


This week in the Senate, as I have said, we saw the first law officer of the land stand up, loudly and proudly defending the rights of bigots. This really revealed the ethical framework that lies behind this legislation. It reveals the philosophy which is driving this government to seek these changes—a philosophy which prioritises the rights of bigots to say what they will, ahead of the rights of individuals to be free from harassment. It puts the rights of bullies ahead of the rights of victims of bullying. It gives the professional loudmouths, the prejudiced and the ignorant a licence to trample all over the marginalised, the powerless and the vulnerable. This is a warped set of priorities and a walked philosophy. Professor Andrew Lynch, from the centre of public law at UNSW, said today:


Law is an instrument through which a community's values and rights may be given effect. In Monday's debate, Brandis came down firmly on the side of those who would give voice to racially motivated insult and offence, over those who are targeted by such comments.


I acknowledge that there are many good people in the Liberal Party who have taken a stand and who show leadership against racism and discrimination: people such as former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, and people inside the Abbott government who have spoken against changes to the act, such as Mr Wyatt and Mr Laundy. But the Prime Minister and this Attorney-General have, with this legislation, revealed that they are ideological throwbacks. They are prosecuting the agenda of the narrowest of sectional interests imaginable—the sectional interests of a single powerful columnist whose opinions are amplified daily by the resources of one of the world's biggest media corporations and who evidently wields considerable power over this government. His interests are to be put ahead of the interests of so many Australians—ahead of the interests of Indigenous Australians, immigrants and the children of immigrants. One person's agenda is being allowed to trump the interests of Australians who seek to live in a decent and tolerant society.


We have previously seen this failure of leadership on race from the most senior figures in the Liberal Party, because when the Attorney-General responds to criticism of this legislation by saying, 'People do have a right to be bigots, you know,' he is echoing someone we all remember. He is doing exactly as former Prime Minister John Howard did at the time when Pauline Hanson called for multiculturalism to be abolished and claimed Australia was being swamped by Asians. What was the response from the then Prime Minister? When he was asked whether Asian Australians should be protected from people like her, he said:


Well, are you saying that somebody shouldn't be allowed to say what she said? I would say in a country such as Australia people should be allowed to say that.


He defended her right to speak freely, but who did he not defend? He did not defend the rights of those she attacked, to be free of vilification. When senior political figures in this country engage in this kind of manoeuvre it sends a bad message. It sends a message that it is acceptable to rail against those who look different, and that is a point I made in my first speech to this place in 2002.


I am distressed and angry that this is a point that still needs to be made today, because we always need leadership on issues of race. It is not about denying free speech; it is about asserting the harm done by racist speech. It is not just about laws and legal protection; it is about the message influential people send to the community. And the message our Attorney-General has sent is that those who are marginalised, victimised and harassed are not a priority for this government. So when he says to Senator Peris, 'People do have a right to be bigots, you know,' he is empathising with the bullies and showing callous disregard for the vulnerable. It is moral equivocation and dog-whistle politics, masquerading as support for free speech. This remark from our Attorney-General shows he does not appreciate the need for leadership in a society where people experience bigotry.


I have seen bigotry face on and it is not a pretty sight. Words have an impact. They hurt and do lasting damage—not only the words of bigots but also the words of those in leadership positions when they defend the rights of bigots and stand by silent.


As Australia's first law officer, the Attorney-General has a responsibility to show leadership on these issues. Instead, we have seen him fail the test of leadership by bringing forward these retrograde proposals. We have seen him fail the test of leadership in choosing to defend the rights of bigots rather than standing up for victims. We also see him fail that test in the way he conducts himself in public debate, because he has a predilection for getting personal—a predilection for personal attack, denigration and denunciation. We all remember his disgraceful claim in this place about there being a criminal in the Lodge. 


Then, this morning, when he was asked to respond to the shadow Attorney-General's argument that the exemptions in the government's proposed section 18D were so wide that you could drive a truck through them, he responded:


I doubt the Shadow Attorney-General could drive a truck through anything frankly. 


That is personal denigration rather than principled debate, abuse rather than analysis. And I will not even deign to respond to his accusation of me of bigotry. It is extraordinary and false. Frankly, Senator Brandis's predilection for going personal are the tactics of a bully stuck in the sandpit of student politics, not those of the Attorney-General of this country. What is the public benefit in removing legal protection against hate speech? There is no conceivable public benefit in enabling blatant racial attacks. How does it benefit our Australian community to make it easier for people to vilify others because of their race or ethnicity? How does it benefit our community to defend bigotry instead of tolerance? It does not benefit our community. In fact, it damages and divides our community. It is very clear that there are really two sides in this debate. We on this side—the Labor party—stand with the community, the ethnic groups, the Indigenous Australians, and the hardworking migrants who have come to Australia and who helped build this nation because it is a fair and free society. And on the other side of this debate, we have an Abbott government who stands with a powerful journalist, with libertarian ideologues, and with the defenders of bigotry. I have said before in this place: prejudice and distrust cannot build a community, but they can tear one apart.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) (16:30):  I have said before that I am a first amendment type of guy. I have long admired the American culture that values freedom of speech as a critical, non-negotiable and—I think even more importantly—virtually unconditional component of a free society. Senator Wong talks about people being attacked. I should probably declare at this point that I am a longstanding member and a former research fellow of the Institute of Public Affairs. What we have heard from the other side of this chamber—and from my good friend Senator Cameron, who has just left—over and over again is the vilification of people merely by virtue of the institute at which they work. There is a reason why the Greens and the ALP hate the Institute of Public Affairs—it is because it is not part of their public sector mentality. It challenges the precepts that they put up, and it cannot be bowed by the fact that it is not on the public sector drip, the way they wish all civil society was.


What we have just heard from Senator Wong and what we have heard constantly from those opposite, including the Greens, relies on a profound misunderstanding of what our society is. They seem to view our rights, particularly our right to speech and our right to discuss—our right to participate in democracy and in a free flow of ideas—as coming to us via a licence from politicians or judges. They seem to think that, somehow, the laws in this place determine what we are allowed and not allowed to say. That is a profound misrepresentation of our constitutional and legal history. It is only in recent times that there have been such limits on things like speech. This is a profound fissure in what we view as the role of the state, and what we view as the role of the government and its relationship with the citizens of this country. Senator Wong accused Senator Brandis of celebrating the rights of bigots. What I will say is that I condemn the bigot, but I celebrate the rights of every citizen. And that is important, because a commitment to freedom of speech only really counts when it is tested. A commitment to freedom of speech only really counts when it comes to defending something you profoundly and viscerally disagree with—and that is where my commitment to free speech lies.


It is not about the public funding of artists. I do not have to fund someone to support their right to say something. There is a profound difference between the allocation of taxpayers' resources to give someone the right to do something, and the question of whether or not they are allowed to say something. I will defend the right of someone to speak, but that does not entail and should not be confused with the idea that I should resource them to speak.


We have heard the constant complaints of those opposite over the last 48 hours about ethnic community leaders, multicultural community leaders, and their views on this particular proposal. I said at the start that I was a first amendment type of person: I view the proposal put up by the government and Senator Brandis in the exposure draft as a compromise. I accept that my views are not typical of all those in this place, or indeed all those in this country, in supporting a very strong and almost unlimited commitment to freedom of speech. The problem I have is that those opposite seem to see us as a nation of tribes; as a nation where self-declared leaders of communities—communities defined by race—should somehow have a special place in the consideration of legislation that any other Australian citizen should not. Every Australian's view has an equal standing in this place—every Australian's view, no matter what community they declare themselves to be from; whether it be one or many; and whether or not they declare themselves to be leaders of communities. The elected bodies in this country are the elected representatives of the Australian people. We do not believe in a corporatist society, or in one where there are a series of tribes where, somehow, some people have more rights than others.


The ALP and the Greens seek to define this as a debate about racism when it is not. It is a debate profoundly about speech, its limits, and the role of governments, politicians and judges in limiting the rights of our fellow citizens to express ideas. How is it our role to empower certain people in Australia, in this case judges under the current law, to determine whether another opinion is arrived at or expressed in good faith? That is the current provision in section 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act. What happened to Andrew Bolt was that a court said that his opinion was not expressed in good faith. It did not just ban the expression of that opinion; it banned its re-publication. It had to declare an Orwellian moment—that it never happened. The point being that, of all those in this place, it was once the centre and the left of Australian politics who campaigned against censorship, yet it is the left of Australian politics who are now its greatest advocates.


Those opposite are confused between legality and licence. To not make activities illegal is not to approve of them. The great problem with speech being banned is it denies people—community leaders, as Senator Wong pointed out, and people like me, you, and others in this chamber; it denies us the opportunity to repudiate. Some speech should be repudiated. Some speech should be humiliated. Some speech should be ridiculed. But by banning it, it goes underground. In this technological world, where we cannot control the sources of news, that threat is even greater than when these laws were first passed just under two decades ago.


Those opposite confuse this with defamation law. It is an attempt to fudge the point, because defamation law often deals with issues and imputations of fact, not opinion. But this law can ban opinion. They ask why we are concerned that one journalist who they say is powerful had their opinion banned. I say, the idea that a court said that an article had to be stripped from a major newspaper's website, and banned the expression of an opinion, is something we should all be concerned about. I remember the days when we would all have been concerned about that.


The most extreme left-wing activist lawyer in the United States's ACLU would not tolerate this legislation. It shows how far the Labor Party and the Greens have moved from respect for basic individual rights for this law to even be considered, to say nothing of the laws proposed by the former Attorney-General Nicola Roxon which were going to expand the grounds for legal action of one citizen against another to an almost limitless number. Again, she confused our role of setting the boundaries as to what is illegal with regulating and proscribing the expression of opinion and expression of ideas.


I am proud to say I know Andrew Bolt. I would not necessarily describe him as a friend, only because I do not know him that well. The vilification to which he has been subjected by the professional left in this country over the last two years and the use of the law to ban him from expressing his opinion has been unprecedented. It is unprecedented in Australia's past to ban people from expressing political opinions. I know Andrew, and he does not have a racist bone in his body. But those opposite who disagree seek to use the law to suppress his views.


More harm was done to the views of those who oppose racism by this case and the ruling by Justice Bromberg that a member of the victim group shall be the standard by which racism is measured. So there was no arbitrary test that any Australian could be certain of to know when their opinion would be legal and when it would not be legal. More damage was done by the professional left activists and the legal censors who think it is their right to regulate speech in Australia. While I have always opposed these laws, they were not on the public agenda until the laws that those opposite are supporting here today meant for the first time the court was going to ban the expression of opinion. We were going to censor newspapers—and we did, because republication of Andrew Bolt's views was banned.


I was invited a couple of years ago to give a speech to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry on this point. I know Colin Rubenstein and Jeremy Jones. I know their work against racism is profound. I know they have done a lot of good work, but I respectfully disagree with them on these laws. I cannot recount all of my reasons in the time available today, but one is that in places where these laws exist, particularly in the old world of Europe where there are speech codes, there are things such as, for example, the armoured personnel carriers that I saw outside the new synagogue in Berlin just over a decade ago. They are the places with all the racial problems. It is the new world—such as Canada, which has recently repealed some of these laws, Australia, New Zealand and the United States—which has provided a home, refuge and sanctuary for people from all around the world. In particular, the communities that have been oppressed in those countries of Europe have often found refuge in the country with the freest speech on earth—and that is the United States. I have faith in my fellow citizens that we will debate this and come to the right resolution. Those opposite, sadly, do not. I do not know where it went.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-03-26,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:40):  Yesterday I was gobsmacked as I watched the Attorney-General unveil a proposal that he described as 'the strongest protections against racism that have ever appeared in any Commonwealth act'. I was gobsmacked because as I was listening to what he was proposing the reality of the proposal bore absolutely no resemblance to that claim. George Orwell would certainly recognise the doublespeak that we are hearing here: 'Weak is strong. Racism will set you free.'


These proposed changes from the Attorney-General will actually see a fundamental weakening of the laws which prevent racism in our society—and the Greens will have none of it. Firstly, the Attorney-General proposes to take away the current protections in the Racial Discrimination Act set out in section 18C which make it unlawful to 'offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate' a person on the basis of their race. Instead, he will substitute a much higher bar to be met before someone can claim protection from the law. He will require 'vilification', which is narrowly defined to mean only inciting hatred against a person or group of persons. It is about inciting hatred of others; it is not about the effect on the person being vilified. He will require 'intimidation', with that only meaning a fear of physical harm. Therefore, he is leaving out psychological and emotional abuse, which we know from people who experience these things is often much more damaging. In these so-called strongest protections in Commonwealth law such behaviour will not even be caught up as a criminal offence. It will remain a civil offence. So the bar will be higher but the penalties will be no tougher.


Finally, just in case someone may get caught up in this scheme, there will be extraordinarily broad exemptions which will make it virtually impossible to take action against anyone who does meet this high threshold anyway, because the section will not apply to:


… words, sounds, images or writing spoken, broadcast, published or otherwise communicated—


it is hard to imagine how you could communicate words that do not fit within those categories—


in the course of participating in the public discussion of any political, social, cultural, religious, artistic, academic or scientific matter.


I think the exemptions have left no stone unturned.


These exemptions are so broad it will be impossible to distinguish between legitimate debate and hate speech. There is no requirement for reasonableness or good faith. And there is no requirement to consider the effects of the vilification from the point of view of the person being vilified. Without any definition of public discussion, these exemptions could even include a water cooler debate at a workplace. Yet we have the Attorney-General's constantly repeated claim that he is offering the 'strongest protections against racism that have ever appeared in any Commonwealth act'.


The Human Rights Law Centre has said this claim is astonishing and not backed by any basic analysis. They say that 'these changes substantially weaken the existing protection'. That is what the community is also saying. That is why people are up in arms and so are organisations like the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, along with representatives from Australia's Greek, Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian and Korean communities, to name just some of them. That is because they know the experience of racial abuse and discrimination on a daily basis. They know the consequences—eroding of sense of self, wellbeing and worth—in Australia.


Let us remember that Justice Bromberg, in the celebrated Eatock v Bolt case, said that it was significant that young Aboriginal persons or others with vulnerability in relation to their identity may be apprehensive to identify as Aboriginal or publicly identify as Aboriginal as a result of witnessing the ferocity of Mr Bolt's attacks on the individuals dealt with in the articles.


This change would ensure that similar attacks will happen in Australia in the future and there will be many more of them, with devastating consequences for the people targeted. The Australian Greens are proud to stand up with multicultural groups to say no to these proposed repeals. We can reconcile freedom of speech with the freedom to participate fully and safely in our community without being racially abused. The Australian Greens will reject this shameful proposal.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-03-26,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:45):  Last week, many members of parliament celebrated Harmony Day. But this week, this government has given a slap in the face to that day. It has given a slap in the face to multicultural Australia. Why is that? That is through the proposed changes that Senator Brandis has introduced into this place that give people in a position of privilege—people like Senator Brandis and people like Andrew Bolt—a platform to be racist.


Is that really the kind of society that we want to live in in Australia? After nearly six months, the first piece of legal reform that our Attorney-General in this country wants to bring into this parliament to become Australian law is the kind of law that will allow more racist activity and more bigotry in this nation, with little recourse for those who are being abused and vilified to have any resolve.


The victims of racial abuse do not have the same position of power or the same position of privilege that those like Senator Brandis and Mr Andrew Bolt have. They are not in that same position to defend themselves. This is not a level playing field. There is a clear power imbalance and that is why we have the Racial Discrimination Act providing some recourse for addressing that imbalance. The current laws in question, sections 18C and 18D, work perfectly fine. The majority of disputes brought before the Human Rights Commission are resolved through mediation. The law works. It is there working perfectly fine.


I understand that Senator Brandis knows the law all too well. I am sure that his understanding of the law is very fine. But while he may have an understanding of the law, I believe he would have little understanding of racism. If he did have an understanding of racism, he would know how these changes do not provide protection to people from racial abuse. He has narrowed these new racial discrimination amendment proposals so that they are so narrow that anyone being racially abused has little opportunity or recourse for what has occurred to them to be addressed. He has narrowed the laws so that the word 'vilify' only means to incite hatred against a person and that 'intimidate' is narrowed to causing fear or physical harm.


If that was not enough, he has then put a huge range of exceptions to all of that in section 4. Despite the outcry from various sections of the ethnic and broader community—some 150 organisations; some of which Senator Brandis has met himself—he has chosen to ignore them entirely and instead adopt what Andrew Bolt and the IPA have wanted all along.


I am all for freedom of speech but not at any cost, not at the cost of people being racially abused and not when it comes to issues of race. They are some of the views that have also been put forward by a number of those ethnic organisations. They are organisations including the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Chinese organisations, Korean organisations, Arab organisations and the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples.


These changes are before us. I encourage the community to put their views forward and their objections forward, because thus far I have seen no one standing up for any changes that Senator Brandis has put forward to our Racial Discrimination Act other than his mate Andrew Bolt.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (16:50):  I start by agreeing with the remarks of Senator Singh that she made at the end. I encourage the Australian community to participate in the consultation process around these changes too. That is the entire reason that a consultation draft of legislative changes proposed by the government has been released, because it is a consultation draft, it is open for people to give feedback and it is open to improvement. I welcome the fact that that is the process that the government has undertaken. I have confidence that through that process the views of the community will be heard and the right balance will ultimately be found in legislative changes that are brought to this place.


I abhor racism, I abhor homophobia and I abhor religious intolerance. I believe deeply that the vast majority, if not every single one, of the members and senators in this place shares those sentiments. This debate around the Racial Discrimination Act is not a debate about whether or not some views are offensive. It is not even a debate about whether or not we should speak out, as leaders of the Australian community, against some of those views that we find to be offensive. Of course we should speak out, of course we should argue against those views that we find offensive and of course we should take a leadership role in that regard.


This debate is about law. It is about the laws of this country and it is about when it is that someone should have recourse to legal proceedings because of what someone else has said, when it is that someone should be able to engage through legal action purely because of what someone else has said. Ultimately this is, of course, about drawing lines in the sand, and there will always be grey areas in an action like this on either side of those lines. We discovered a couple of years ago that, for much of the community, there was concern that the way the laws were currently structured inhibited political debate to too great an extent. As a nation that treasures its freedoms, we should be respecting the freedom of speech just as much as we respect the right to protect those minority groups, those Australians who may be subject to racism, to homophobia or to religious intolerance from activities that would bring harm to them.


As a believer of free speech, I am one who looks back on the quotes of some of those in the past and at the often misquoted, or misattributed, quote of Voltaire which said:


I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.


As I said, that was a slightly misattributed quote and is, in fact, an interpretation of Voltaire's views. The accurate quote from 1770 is:


I detest what you write, but I will give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write.


In this day and age we recognise that some things cross the line, which are unacceptable to have published, that can indeed incite hatred and can indeed vilify individuals or groups of people. We should rightly draw a line around those issues, but we must make sure that in drawing that line, in providing those protections for individuals against racism—as we should seek to do—we do not do so at the expense of genuine political debate, at the expense of genuine free speech, and at the expense of genuine artistic freedom in this country.


These are matters that we should stand up for. When somebody says something that we, as leaders of Australia, find to be offensive we should speak out against it. We should, as leaders, take up the challenge, which Senator Singh highlighted, in relation to people who may not have the same power of voice and make sure that their voices are heard through this place and through the media, and that we take a strong stand against intolerance. Taking a strong stand against intolerance, setting the right example for the community and trying to drive a change in community attitudes does not necessarily mean that we must always outlaw an action. It does not necessarily mean that we must always provide recourse to the law to do so. Oftentimes we will achieve the cultural change that we seek. We will achieve the change in community attitudes through leadership, through better behaviour, through better arguments, and through a sound adoption of principles and principled arguments against those who may apply racist activities.


Much has been made in this debate about the word 'bigotry' and whether or not bigotry is acceptable. Just as laws are made of words, words have meanings and in law the meaning is exceptionally important. The Oxford Dictionary defines bigotry as:


Intolerance towards those who hold different opinions from oneself.


The Cambridge Dictionary defines bigotry as:


A person who has strong, unreasonable beliefs and who thinks that anyone who does not have the same belief is wrong.


One would be forgiven for thinking, on occasion, that there is much bigotry because people in this place hold very strong opinions and often think that the opinions of others, which are equally strongly held, are emphatically wrong. I think most of us in this place are tolerant towards each other's beliefs and opinions, even if we disagree with them vehemently. But, of course, bigotry itself, though not an admirable trait, is not something that the current laws make illegal nor something that the proposed laws would make illegal, and nor should it be. People should be free to hold views that are different from one another, even where those views may seem to be unreasonable to many others in the community.


We should not allow this debate to be sidetracked by the misinterpretation of a word like 'bigotry' or by misunderstanding of what a word like that may mean. We should be clear that this debate is about that extreme level of unacceptable conduct, behaviour and language that we decide is appropriate to write laws about, to draw that line around and say, 'That is too far for the Australian community to accept and for the parliament of Australia to accept.' In doing so we must ensure that we balance that against the free speech objectives that we should, as a nation, seek to stand by.


As I emphasised at the outset, the government has released for consultation draft changes to the Racial Discrimination Act. Those draft changes have what some in this debate should all be warmly welcoming. The changes have, for the first time, prescribed racial vilification as being inappropriate behaviour. The changes have singled that out as an activity that will never be acceptable in this country. We should welcome the fact that there will be, over the coming months, a proper debate about racial vilification, about how it is defined, about whether it is appropriately defined in current law or about whether it is appropriately defined in the proposed law. Of course, it is not defined at all in current law. It is not even mentioned in the current law. But it is mentioned and it is defined in the proposal that is being released for public commentary.


I hope that all members of the community with an interest in this topic do actively participate in this debate. I hope they do so by looking very precisely at the words in the proposed laws, at those laws themselves and at the effect they will have. I hope they do so under the guiding principle of ensuring that we are as tolerant a nation as possible—but with as much opportunity for free speech as possible. That is a line that will be drawn somewhere at the end of this debate. I hope we draw it successfully in a manner that meets those dual objectives and ensures we end up with a law that is more workable than the one we currently have has proven to be.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-03-26,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (17:00):  Before we pass any law in this place, we should ask ourselves a pretty basic question. I am sure my colleagues on the coalition side will be pleased to hear me put this proposition. The question is: what is the problem we are trying to solve? Let us not waste the parliament's time. Let us not pass more legislation—which is what is being proposed here—if we are not solving a serious problem.


I do not remember being bombarded with lots of correspondence about the need to get rid of section 18C from the Racial Discrimination Act. I do not recall, over the past 20 years, people protesting in the street because they felt their freedom of speech was being impinged upon. I do not remember seeing protests about this issue. Most people understand that it is not appropriate to hurl racist insults at people and that, if they do, there are consequences.


The only clamour for a change to this law is coming straight out of Holt Street, straight out of News Corp, whose version of free speech is, 'Anything I say is okay and we will be the arbiters of what is right and wrong in this area.' And News Corp's poster child is that right-wing wacko Andrew Bolt. That is where the clamour is coming from to change these laws. 


We need to understand what these laws actually do. I listened to an esteemed presenter on the ABC this morning implying that people who express an extreme bigoted opinion should be sent to jail. That cannot occur under these laws. It is not a criminal offence to express such an opinion. I think people do not understand how this legislation actually works. If you use racist, hateful language that has an impact on another individual, they have the right to seek mediation. That is a good thing. Most of these cases are settled through mediation and someone learns a valuable lesson about the impact of hate speech on other people. Occasionally, as in the Bolt case, it can end up in court. What does the court do in those situations? They might order an apology, which is what happened in the Bolt case. He was issued with a court order to apologise, he was forced to retract his article and he was ordered not to publish it elsewhere. That is a small price to pay when you consider the impact of this behaviour on other people.


All of us in this place support freedom of speech. But what about the freedom of a young Muslim woman on a tram—being free to travel without having people hurl racist insults at her? What about the right of an Aboriginal man to be served at a venue without having racist insults hurled at him? What about the freedom of a young Asian boy in the classroom to get about his business without being the subject of racist taunts? That is what this legislation is about—nothing more, nothing less.


Senator Brandis talks about the 'chill effect' as though there are teams of writers and lawyers poring over work that cannot be published because—God forbid—there might be something in it that might be racist towards others. He says that without being able to cite any evidence of it occurring. If these laws give journalists pause to think that the impact of what they are writing may in fact cause harm to others, that is a good thing. If they are forced to apologise because they do cause harm to others, that is a good thing. 


Far from having a chilling effect, this action by the government will have a heating effect. It will flush out the racists and the bigots and give them, to use the Prime Minister's words, the 'green light' to use their hate speech against others. There has been a lot of talk about green lights, amber lights and red lights, but this government is putting this sign up in flashing lights—'Racists and bigots, you are welcome in Australia'. Well, you are not. These laws exist because we as a government have a role in protecting people from hateful speech.

Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (17:05):  I rise to speak in support of this matter of public importance. This issue highlights the difference between Labor and the Liberals. Labor believes racial abuse and hate speech is never okay. The Liberals believe, as the Attorney-General said, that the rights of bigots need to be protected.


On Monday in this house I asked whether his changes to the Racial Discrimination Act would facilitate vilification by bigots. In response the Attorney-General, the chief law officer of Australia, said 


People do have a right to be bigots, you know. In a free country, people do have rights to say things that other people find offensive, insulting or bigoted.


It was a disgraceful statement and it is disgusting. His statement is a green light to racism and hate speech. What message does this send to our young Australians at a time when we are trying to stop bullying? This is an admission from the Attorney-General that his changes to the Racial Discrimination Act will provide for bigotry.


For the record, I am not against free speech, not at all. What I am against is promoting hate speech. I am extremely disappointed that we are even having this debate. It upsets me that we are having a debate about whether the law of the Commonwealth of Australia makes it okay to be a bigot. We are having a debate about whether it is okay to attack someone based on their race or religion. I thought we had moved on. What happened to, 'In history's page, let every stage advance Australia fair'?


You do not have to be Aboriginal or from one of the many international cultures that make Australia so fantastic to be appalled by the Attorney-General's position. You do not have to have been personally subjected to racial abuse to oppose his views. You do not have to be a victim of hate to be offended by the changes proposed to the Racial Discrimination Act by the Abbott government. But I have been personally vilified by bigots. It is a horrible feeling, it is shattering and it hurts to the core of your existence. I played sport at the highest level and at times I was exposed to a mentality that anything that happens on the field stays on the field. But I really thought we had moved on in society. But some of the language I have heard from the Attorney-General in his attempts to defend his position remind me of the attempts by some people 20 years ago to defend racism on the sporting field. In relation to this debate in this parliament, he said:


… we offend and, I dare say, we insult each other every day. That is part of the robustness of the discussion of public issues.


But we are not attacking or offending or insulting each other every day based on race, religion or ethnic background. The Attorney-General simply does not understand or get racial abuse. He does not understand how much it hurts. Racial vilification and political criticism are two completely different things. The Australian of the Year, Adam Goodes, an AFL champ, could not care less if people criticise or abuse him for the way he plays football, but we have all seen the devastating effect racial abuse has on people. They are not the same. During my sporting career, I did not care if people attacked or criticised me for my performance on the field, but I did care when I was attacked and criticised for the colour of my skin and called a 'nigger' by my own Aussie team mate, and I took action against it. Racism hurts.


The changes announced yesterday by the Attorney-General water down the Racial Discrimination Act. Pretty much anyone and everyone can say anything at any time. All they have to do is claim that it was part of public discussion. It is shameful. Darwin, my home town, is a wonderful multicultural city and I know many people will be appalled and personally hurt by these changes. Tony Abbott said he would be the Prime Minister for Aboriginal people. As an Aboriginal Australian, I urge him to listen to Aboriginal people and abandon his changes to the Racial Discrimination Act. Listen to Adam Goodes, our Australian of the Year. Listen to Warren Mundine, the man who heads up his council. Listen to the people in our community who are fearful that these changes mean that they will be subjected to more abuse, more insults and more humiliation.


The Prime Minister says he is opposed to racial vilification, but you cannot be opposed to racial vilification while supporting the right to bigotry. I condemn the comments of the Attorney-General, George Brandis; I condemn the changes to the Racial Discrimination Act; and I condemn those opposite who support the Attorney-General's comments and his backward legislation.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (17:10):  This is an important debate. It goes to the heart of how far we think we have progressed as a democratic nation. It goes to the heart of how we balance those freedoms that set us apart from so many other citizens in our global community. It is clear from today's debate that there are a variety of views, and that is why the government's decision to have an exposure draft, to invite community opinion and to encourage community discussion on this is a good process. It would have been very disappointing—it would have been indefensible—if the government had come to a position and not provided an opportunity for the community and the parliament to debate it in a calm and measured way.


I do not doubt for a moment that the views of others that are different from mine are genuinely held, and I give them great generosity, because I understand that my lived experience will be very different from the lived experience so far of many others. I cannot comprehend the shattering hurt that people may have felt over their lived experience so far as a result of racism. From my own personal experience, I know the shattering hurt that can come from homophobic thoughts and actions. But my lived experience means that I will be listening carefully to the views of many Australians—not just elected representatives but others across the community—on this sensitive issue.


But I start from the position of supporting freedom. I start from the position of trusting Australians. I start from the position of saying that bigotry, homophobia and religious intolerance should be pulled out of the darkness and put in a public place and that we should educate with speech and discussion to deter people from those ill-founded thoughts. Of course, in a nation as big as ours, we will not always be able to put hand on heart and know that 100 per cent of Australians are free from ignorant or ill-considered thoughts, but the debate that we are engaging in is one about whether or not we think the community can step up, the government can step back and, as a result of that, our democratic fabric can be strengthened over time and not weakened. I am sure I speak for many, many Western Australians who believe that racism is not tolerated in our country and should be combated, but many will argue that part of our democratic evolution is for government and laws to step back so that communities can step up to the challenge.


I believe that this matter of public importance is based on a false premise. If I understand the opposition's position correctly, it is that racism is festering and contagious throughout Australia and the only thing holding it back is section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.

  That's a straw-man argument. Nobody said that.

At their core, I do not believe they trust humanity; I do not believe they trust human progress.


Why is Australia a tolerant and open society today? I would argue it is because Australians are of themselves open and tolerant, are decent to their core, do not need to be told by bureaucrats or politicians that they need to introduce— (Time expired)

 (Victoria) (17:15):  I rise to address a pressing matter of public importance—that being the Liberal Party's determination to open the door to racial vilification in this country. I have a message for Senator Brandis: you should not be the cheerleader or the poster boy for racial vilification in this country, particularly under the unconvincing guise of freedom of speech. We have heard Senator Brandis claim this week that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act fails to protect individuals or groups from vilification on the basis of race. This is not true.


We have heard that he intends to demolish this section of the act and, perhaps most alarmingly, that everyone has the right to be a bigot. Our history is littered with moments we can look back on and wish had not happened. This is one of those moments. On an issue as vital as this, it is critical that the government show some leadership. Perhaps Senator Brandis's comments were a slip of the tongue or a deliberate dog whistle to the ugly face of Australian society. Either way, Senator Brandis and his party have been exposed for what they are. They keep talking about an exposure draft, but they themselves have been exposed. They have been exposed as grotesque apologists for racial hatred and as defenders of racism under the thin and tiresome veneer of their misguided interpretation of free speech.


Senator Brandis's claims that the Racial Discrimination Act fails to protect people from racial vilification are false. Section 18C makes racial vilification unlawful. It provides those who need it a necessary recourse under the law. This is exactly what happened in the Federal Court case against Andrew Bolt a couple of years ago—he failed to take the opportunity to appeal that decision. Considering this, it is obvious that Senator Brandis has misled the Australian people. He has been condescending to senators who have asked legitimate questions about his intentions to dynamite section 18C, arrogantly acting as though anyone asking a question does not know what they are talking about. As the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis is the highest law officer in this country. He should not be fanning the flames of jingoistic nationalism and racism or offering platitudes to a handful of coalition sympathisers.


As someone from an ethnic background, from a minority and from a group that has been persecuted in this country, I know what racism is all about. Coming from Victoria, the most diverse state and place in the world, we know what it is like, but there are thousands upon thousands of success stories of multiculturalism which have undeniably enriched our community. The fabric they have woven throughout the community is strong and has endured. It is strong because it was woven through adversity. Language barriers, social exclusion and economic disadvantage were all mountains that people have overcome. Each fibre of this fabric is a testament to the challenges that these people have faced and overcome to make a better life for themselves. It is a story of determination. Theirs is a story of finding a piece of Australia through honest hard work and a can-do attitude, yet what Senator Brandis is proposing to do will unravel this.


Despite the shining success of Australia's multiculturalism and steps taken to reconcile our past with our first Australians, there are still disturbing elements of racial hatred in this country. It is incumbent upon this parliament—this Senate and those in the other place—to show leadership. That is not what has come from those opposite. Racial vilification is intellectually flawed, morally bankrupt and socially divisive. Australia deserves better from this government.

The speeches read as follows—



CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (CLASSIFICATION TOOLS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2014


The Classification regime in Australia is complex. The current National Classification Scheme has been in place since 1996 and technology and the sheer volume of content have evolved considerably since then. The current scheme is difficult for the community to understand and even more difficult for industry to comply with. This Bill introduces changes which will provide consumers with more classification information and simplify the scheme by removing complexity and reducing costs for business.


The National Classification Scheme (NCS) is a cooperative scheme under which the Classification Board classifies films, computer games and certain publications. The Scheme is designed to provide consumers with information about publications, films and computer games to allow them to make informed decisions about appropriate entertainment material. It is based on the principle that adults should be able to read, hear, see and play what they want while recognising that minors should be protected from material likely to harm them and that everyone should be protected from unsolicited offensive material. 


Procedures for the classification of publications, films and computer games are set out in the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (Classification Act). States and Territories are responsible for the enforcement of classification decisions and provisions regulating the sale, demonstration and advertising of this material are contained in State and Territory legislation.


Apart from the introduction of an R 18+ classification for computer games, the National Classification Scheme has not had any significant changes made to it since it was established in 1996. Yet, since its introduction, classifiable content and the way in which it is delivered to consumers has changed dramatically. For example, consumers now have ready access to classifiable content on a variety of platforms, such as the delivery of computer games on mobile and other online devices.


Given these developments in technology, media convergence and the global availability of media content, the National Classification Scheme was reviewed by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) in 2011.


The ALRC handed down its report in March 2012 and made 57 recommendations for fundamental changes to the regulatory framework and structure of the Scheme. 


Reform of the Scheme is being approached in stages, commencing with a ""first tranche"" of reforms that was agreed by Classification Ministers at a meeting of the Standing Council on Law and Justice.


The first phase of agreed reforms includes: 


broadening the scope of existing exempt film categories and streamlining exemption arrangements for festivals and cultural institutions; 


enabling certain content to be classified using classification tools (such as online questionnaires that deliver automated decisions); 


creating an explicit requirement in the Commonwealth Classification Act to display classification markings on all classified content; 


expanding the exceptions to the modification rules so that films and computer games which are subject to certain types of modifications do not require classification again; and


enabling the Attorney-General's Department to notify law enforcement authorities of potential Refused Classification content without having the content classified first, to help expedite the removal of extremely offensive or illegal content from distribution.


These reforms will deliver benefits to industry including streamlining administrative processes and reducing the regulatory burden whilst ensuring that consumers continue to receive useful and accurate classification information. 


Several of these reforms are particularly significant. 


The first significant reform is the introduction of classification tools. Classification tools, such as online questionnaires, might be developed by Government, industry or other classification bodies overseas. These tools represent an effective and efficient way to classify the significant volume of unclassified online and mobile computer games that is available in the market today. 


Currently, the Classification Board does not have the capacity to classify the vast amount of content that is available on mobile devices and online. As an example, last year the Classification Board made over 6,000 classification decisions across all forms of content. However, the digital market offers hundreds of thousands of computer games to consumers—which presents significant practical, logistical and compliance challenges for the current National Classification Scheme. 


This reform will facilitate innovative and technology-based solutions for classification in line with initiatives being considered elsewhere by classification bodies that are dealing with the same classification difficulties. 


Enabling the use of such instruments will support and complement the work of the Classification Board, provide certainty to industry and increase compliance with Australian classification laws. Most importantly, this reform will mean that the Australian public will have access to more classification information than is possible under the current system. 


There are a number of safeguards built into this reform. For example, a classification tool can only be implemented following its approval by the Minister. In deciding whether to approve a particular tool, the Minister will consider a range of matters including whether it delivers decisions that are consistent with Australian classification requirements. The Bill also provides the Classification Board with the opportunity to classify content even after it has been classified by an approved tool, if it considers that the decision is problematic. As a final protection, if there are concerns about the effectiveness of a classification tool, its approval may be suspended or revoked at any time. 


Another important ""first tranche"" reform involves changes to the current modification rules. This will reduce the regulatory and financial burden on industry, the theme of today's bills, by removing the need to have classified content classified again when certain modifications are made to the content, providing that the modification does not affect the original classification. 


For example, currently the 2D and 3D versions of the same film must be classified separately (incurring two classification fees) because the format change is considered to be a modification. It will no longer be necessary for both 2D and 3D versions to be classified, where the only difference is the changed format. In these instances both films must carry the classification marking assigned to the original film classified by the Board. Existing safeguards, such as the Classification Board Director's power to call in content, will remain in place. This means that the Director may call in content to be classified by the Board where a modification has changed a product to the extent that it would likely change the classification, and the product is therefore unclassified. 


The third key reform will expand the definition and scope of exempt film categories and streamline exemption arrangements for festivals, special event operators and cultural institutions. 


Many of the existing exempt film categories currently state that a film must ""wholly comprise"" particular content in order to be exempt from classification requirements. These categories have been expanded to also include films that ""mainly comprise"" particular content—similar to the New Zealand exempt film categories. Two new exempt film categories have also been added. Broadening the scope of existing exempt film categories to better reflect contemporary film content will improve the utility of these exemptions by accommodating a range of documentary-style content that it is appropriate to exempt. 


The reforms will also simplify exemption arrangements for festivals by establishing a consolidated set of rules in the Commonwealth Classification Act—replacing the convoluted and inconsistent provisions that are currently set out in each State and Territory's classification legislation. Most importantly, the reforms will rationalise the administrative and regulatory requirements for festivals and cultural institutions by removing the mandatory requirement to apply to the Director of the Classification Board for a formal exemption. Instead, exemptions will continue to be available to support the arts and cultural sector but on a self-assessed, deregulated basis. 


Safeguards, similar to those currently in place for festivals, will ensure that the public is being protected—particularly children. For example, exemption conditions will include restrictions on the screening, exhibition or demonstration of unclassified content to particular age-groups if it is strong or high in impact; require that patrons be provided with warnings about the content that they are about to see and prohibit content likely to be X 18+ or Refused Classification. Training and registration facilities will be established to support Officers of the Classification Liaison Scheme who will monitor the operation of the reformed arrangements as part of their routine compliance and educational activities.


This Bill also makes a number of minor and technical amendments to the Classification Act to improve the clarity of certain provisions, address legislative anomalies and enhance the administrative efficiency of the National Classification Scheme.


For example, amendments will be made to the Classification Act to align the provisions relating to the Authorised Assessors Scheme for Computer Games with the provisions relating to: the Additional Content Assessor Scheme; the Authorised Television Assessor Scheme and the Authorised Advertising Assessor Scheme. These amendments will ensure that there is a consistent approach in the regulation of these assessor schemes. 


In addition, the Bill makes several minor consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. 


These reforms represent the first step towards modernising the classification scheme and demonstrate the Government's commitment to a scheme that is better equipped to meet the needs of industry and consumers in the digital age. Consistent with the Government's broader deregulation agenda, these reforms will help to ensure that our classification system continues to be effective, efficient and relevant in the 21st century.


 


DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT BENEFITS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAIR INDEXATION) BILL 2014


This Bill gives effect to this Government's election commitment to fairly index Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (DFRB) and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) pensions for recipients aged 55 and over from 1 July 2014.


This legislation amends the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act 1948 and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 to deliver the Government's commitment.


The Government's fair indexation commitment, as reflected in the Bill, addresses a long-standing grievance of the veteran and ex-service community about differing – and inequitable – indexation arrangements that apply to DFRB and DFRDB pensions compared to age and service pensions. The Bill recognises the Government's commitment to ensure that age and service pension indexation arrangements apply to members of the DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation schemes.


The Government recognises the unique nature of military service. The Government's commitment to address this long-standing grievance of the veteran and ex-service community is underpinned by this belief.


The Bill will also exempt DFRB and DFRDB members from the Division 293 tax for the one-off capitalised value of the benefit improvement relating to past service as at 1 July 2014. This will ensure members with significant past service, but modest superannuation pensions, will not incur a taxation liability resulting from the changes to indexation. However, superannuants on high annual incomes will not be excluded from an ongoing annual liability under this provision.


The new fairer pension indexation methodology is to apply to DFRB and DFRDB pensions from 1 July 2014. The measures extend fair indexation provisions to invalidity pensions, reversionary pensions and pensions for those associates in receipt of a pension as a result of a family law split, who are aged 55 and over on the current relevant indexation date.


Under the new fairer indexation methodology – which mirrors the two-step indexation process for age and service pensions – the first step would be to calculate the pension that would result if it were increased in line with the better of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLCI). Then the second step would be to compare the resulting pension to the Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE). If the calculated pension is greater than the specified floor percentage (27.7% of MTAWE for the single pension), then no further adjustment is made. If the resultant pension is less than the floor percentage of MTAWE, it is increased so that it equals the floor percentage of MTAWE. 


It is important to note that the new fairer indexation methodology will not result in a DFRB or DFRDB pension that is currently less than the MTAWE floor percentage increasing to the floor percentage (and conversely, that a pension that is currently in excess of the floor percentage reducing to the floor percentage). The proposed changes will have an immediate impact on some 45,000 current DFRB and DFRDB pensioners where the originally entitled member was aged 55 or over at 1 July 2014. 


This Bill gives effect to many years of advocacy by this Government for fair indexation of DFRB and DFRDB superannuants and their families. It delivers a key election commitment and addresses a long-standing grievance of the veteran and ex-service community.


This Bill recognises the unique nature of military service and ensures that recipients of DFRB and DFRDB pensions have their pensions indexed in the same way as age and service pension are indexed.


I commend the Bill.

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (18:19):  Pursuant to order, I present the report of the Environment and Communications References Committee on the Direct Action Plan, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. 


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator THORP:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I am grateful for the opportunity to speak today as the chair of the Environment and Communications Committee on the inquiry and report into the government's Direct Action Plan. This is an important report because it addresses what may be the single greatest environmental issue facing the planet today—climate change.


Climate change is an issue that will test the mettle of the human race and our ability to work together to find solutions to reduce carbon emissions and ensure we pass on a healthy planet to our children, our grandchildren and all the generations that will follow. While there is enormous value in individual and group efforts to effect change in local areas, the heavy burden of responsibility for solving this problem must lie with governments. There is absolutely no doubt that governments across the globe must act—and we must act now.


Over the past months the Environment and Communications References Committee has heard from experts across the country about the government's proposed climate policy, direct action. We did not hear just from environmentalists, but also from academics, investors, scientists, doctors, farmers, economists, think tanks, business groups, and climatologists. And almost to a person, they told us the same thing: direct action is expensive, inefficient, and, more than likely completely unable to address climate change in any meaningful way. In fact, not one witness was willing to support direct action as a credible stand-alone means of addressing the climate change crisis that may soon be on our doorstep.


Many told us that direct action is little more than a government gift to polluters and that it will do little, if anything, to reduce Australia's emissions. Others pointed out that direct action throws away the well-established legal and ethical principle of 'polluter pays' in favour of setting up a taxpayer funded slush fund for big emitters. This approach is particularly bizarre when you learn that environment minister Greg Hunt wrote an award-winning graduate thesis entitled A Tax to make the polluter pay, which championed this very cause. Pollution is a waste output of business just like any other. Just as we would not expect someone else to pay to dispose of the skip bins of rubbish that a construction company might generate, it is quite unfair to require the taxpayer pick up the tab for big business and their carbon outputs.


The committee also heard that Direct Action is riddled with design issues. Establishing baselines will be difficult and administratively onerous, not to mention the fact that it will be virtually impossible to determine if a project would happen anyway, potentially opening up the scheme to be gamed by companies who could charge the taxpayer for emission reduction projects they were going to undertake anyway. Perversely, companies that have acted early to invest in emissions reductions may be penalised because they will be starting from a lower baseline.


Also, many witnesses pointed out that soil carbon sequestration, which is the major abatement strategy in Direct Action, is highly inefficient. In a hearing in Canberra, the CSIRO confirmed that it is likely to take a land mass two-thirds the size of Australia to achieve the sort of abatement the government says it will get from soil carbon. Other witnesses pointed to the extremely short time horizons as a threat to business confidence and investor certainty. For these and many other reasons the report recommends that the centrepiece of Direct Action, the emissions reduction fund, is fundamentally flawed and, thus, should not proceed. Another overriding message we got from submissions to the inquiry was that Direct Action will be an expensive and unnecessary burden on the taxpayer.


To meet our commitment of reducing Australia's carbon output by five per cent by 2020, the government has allocated $1.55 billion over three years, but independent work done by SKM MMA and Monash University shows this falls $4 billion short, even using the most generous modelling parameters. The government has been very clear that there will be no more money in the bucket, so it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the government will fail, probably spectacularly, to meet our emissions reduction target. This is not surprising when you consider evidence from the Climate Institute that, if other countries were to follow the Abbott government's policy lead, the world would be on track for a catastrophic rise of up to 6.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. For Australia, this would mean a five-fold increase in droughts in southern Australia, the virtual destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, forced abandonment of many coastal communities, and a 90 per cent reduction in agricultural production from the Murray-Darling region. In fact, the government has virtually admitted failure already by removing the national cap on carbon emissions, because Mr Hunt and Mr Abbott both know that, if no goal is set, it cannot possibly fail to meet it. This is an outrageous omission and one which the committee strongly recommends be rectified immediately.


On the subject of targets, the committee was also convinced by the weight of evidence toward greater reductions, and supports the adoption of the targets recommended by the Climate Change Authority, namely that Australia's 2020 emissions target be set at 15 per cent below 2000 levels in addition to the four per cent carryover from the first commitment period of the Kyoto protocol. So it is clear that Direct Action is undeniably the wrong way to go about effecting meaningful carbon emission reduction.


What did the experts recommend as the most effective solution? What has been most notable about the inquiry is the consistency of evidence we have heard from witnesses in this regard. Again and again the committee heard that the single most effective and efficient means of achieving carbon abatement is to put a price on carbon. Carbon pricing provides a positive incentive for businesses and consumers to change their behaviour and embrace low-carbon alternatives. It provides a boost to renewable industries and encourages investment in low-carbon technologies. It also encourages business to invest in areas that will ultimately make them more efficient and profitable as energy costs grow in the future.


Of course, it is not just the witnesses and submitters to the inquiry who understand the importance of pricing carbon. There are currently more than 30 countries across the world and many subnational jurisdictions that already have a price on carbon. These schemes cover the enormous number of 880 million people. In fact, while countries across the globe are embracing market based mechanisms to address this global challenge, Australia stands alone as the only country in the process of dismantling carbon pricing. Not only that; the Abbott government is also systematically trying to abolish each and every tool Australia has to protect ourselves from the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. This irresponsible action is not supported by today's report. Instead, it unreservedly recommends that Labor's clean energy package remain and that Australia move to a fully-flexible carbon price under an emissions trading scheme on 1 July this year.


The report notes that Labor's package 'presented a comprehensive set of policy instruments to reduce Australia's carbon emissions, invest in renewable energy and provide assistance for businesses and households to transition to a clean energy economy'. It also recognises the 'significant time and effort' that was spent on 'ensuring that Australia adopted an effective and credible way to address climate change in the long-term'. The committee concurred with many witnesses that the institutions that sit under the clean energy package should be maintained. This includes the Climate Change Authority, which is a crucial means for the government to obtain independent and transparent advice on climate policy. The committee was also convinced by the arguments of witnesses that the profit-making Clean Energy Finance Corporation needs to stay. This organisation has clearly succeeded in its goals of encouraging private sector investment in the renewables sector and reducing carbon emissions while still returning a healthy multimillion-dollar profit to the Australian taxpayer.


Likewise, we need to retain funding for ARENA, and the Renewable Energy Target must be maintained in its current format. If the government persists in its perverse determination to adopt an expensive, inefficient policy solution at the expense of the considered, effective and forward-thinking policy framework that we already had, it risks relegating Australia to become an environmental and economic backwater, unable to compete in the low-carbon global economy of the future. It also threatens not only our international credibility but our ability to take a leadership role in the global climate change response. This is an alternate future that we simply cannot risk and I urge the government to consider the findings of this inquiry very seriously.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Before I call you, Senator Ruston, I understand that informal arrangements have been made for you and Senator Milne to speak for five minutes to enable other committee reports to be tabled.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Environment and Communications References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,20,1,speech
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2014-03-26,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (18:30):  I rise to speak on the Environment and Communications References Committee report into the Direct Action Plan. While we utterly reject the recommendations of the Labor Party and the Greens in this report, one of the things that has been most disappointing is that this inquiry was supposed to be into the Direct Action package. A precursor to the Direct Action package was the very loud and clear policy platform on which the coalition went to the last election, and that was that we were intending to abolish the carbon tax.


They may well have a majority report, but the greatest endorsement that any of us in this place can get is to have the majority support of the Australian people, and that is what we received in September last year at the election. The coalition was told very clearly by the electorate, as were the opposition and the Greens, that the electorate wanted the carbon tax abolished. Notwithstanding that, I think one of the most important issues that we need to put on the table right here and now is that this debate has actually been about climate change. It has not been about Direct Action; it has not been about the abolition of the carbon tax. It seems to have become a debate about climate change.


The fact of the matter is that the government differs from the opposition and the Greens in the way that it believes that climate change can best be tackled. Our view is that, instead of imposing a $7.6 billion economy-wide tax that hinders business and does nothing for the environment, there is an alternative way in which we can achieve the outcomes that all of us in this place seek to achieve—that is, to have a cleaner energy future, to have a low-carbon future and to make sure we deal with the obvious impacts which we all talk about and that could potentially occur because of climate change.


Turning specifically to the Senate inquiry, there were many, many submitters who represented hundreds of thousands of businesses and employees. I noted that in the majority report there was some suggestion that no-one supported Direct Action as a credible means to deal with climate change. I would beg to differ. I think there were a number of people who supported Direct Action and I also think it is very premature for us to be making comments about what Direct Action can achieve, how much it is going to cost and what it can deliver, because nobody has actually given it a chance. I think we need to put on the table that this is not a debate about climate change; it is a debate about how we are intending to address the issues and the consequences of climate change.


I put on the record some comments from the submitters who gave evidence during the Senate hearings. The Australian Industry Group said that they, 'Do not support any decision on additional targets at this time.' The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies provided evidence saying:


The burden borne by Australian industry under the previous Governments Clean Energy package placed Australian mining and exploration industries at a significant disadvantage to our competitors. For the exploration and mining industry it was a financial penalty without any meaningful opportunities to contribute to Australia's response to climate change.


The National Farmers Federation said:


The NFF does not support the carbon tax due to the significant flow-on impacts to agriculture.


I have to put on the record some comments of Professor Ross Garnaut when he was responding to Senator Williams, who asked him about the implications of increasing the carbon tax to cover diesel fuel and the fact that diesel fuel would add an extra $515 million to the costs of road users. He asked Professor Garnaut if he supported that policy, and Professor Garnaut responded that he did. The truckies of Australia will be delighted to hear that!


In conclusion, we were very disappointed that the debate really did not focus on the potential positives and benefits that could be achieved by the direct action policy. I think that, if we had actually focused a lot more on trying to work our way through the potential benefits instead of focusing on the fact that we were having a debate about climate change, who believed in climate change and who was a climate denier, we may well have ended up with a report that we all possibly could have agreed with.


I would like to thank the secretariat for the huge amount of work that they put into this; it was a big hearing and a big inquiry. They had to do a lot of travel. I would also like to thank them for their outstanding work and their diligence during this inquiry. I would also like to say that the deputy chair of the committee, Senator Williams, endorses my comments in thanking them.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-03-26,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:35):  I rise tonight to respond to the tabling of the committee report on direct action. Suffice to say, this report absolutely exposes direct action as simply a slogan. There is no substance to this policy, and that was revealed throughout the inquiry. In response to Senator Ruston's remarks about the so-called positive benefits not being discussed, the reason for that was that nobody through all the inquiries could put any facts on the table whatsoever about direct action. The fact of the matter is that the inquiry demonstrated that it is narrow, will not create any lasting transformation across the economy and is unfinanceable because the grants are so small, contracts are limited to five years, prices on offer are so low that they fall far short of being investment-grade and finance institutions and banks will not waste their time on direct action.


It is an optional—in other words, it is a voluntary scheme—so there is no incentive for polluters to participate. Therefore, it is very difficult to see who on earth is going to be part of this so-called emissions reduction fund. It is costly because it is going to require a huge bureaucracy to administer it, and the taxpayers are going to have to pay. In other words, so much for the slogan 'great big new tax'. In fact, communities are now going to be taxed to pay the polluters through this emission reduction fund, and there is going to be no absolute ability to determine whether there are any emission reductions additional to what companies would have done anyway. So additionality is a real issue. The assessment of the baselines is a real issue. No detail was provided and the department could not answer any of the questions. Remarkably, there is no detail about Direct Action whatsoever. 


In fact, not a single economist who came before the committee supported Direct Action, because they rightly said that it is expensive and it is charging the taxpayer to pay the polluters for no guaranteed outcomes in achieving even five per cent, let alone the 40 per cent to 60 per cent emissions reduction trajectory that is going to be required by 2030. As well as statements of support from the Business Council of Australia, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and so on, and their disgraceful efforts as a cheer squad for a policy which has no substance, we had Professor Garnaut and Ken Henry commenting in the media recently. We also had Bernie Fraser appear before the committee. All of them said that Direct Action demonstrates no real commitment to addressing the climate, no consistency with what the science requires for emissions reductions and, what is more, that the direct action policy had no substance. In fact, it will fall short of its five per cent emission reduction task and will cost a great deal of money. Billions of dollars will be required, on top of the existing $1.55 billion that is allocated.


As Direct Action unravels we are simply going to see a repeat of the failed Howard government program. It did not achieve emissions reductions and had to be abandoned because, essentially, it was a gift to companies that hung out to get the money to do what they otherwise intended to do. We need serious emissions reduction in Australia. The advantage of the emissions trading scheme that we currently have is that it can be scaled up to achieve that trajectory of 40 per cent to 60 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. That is the scale of the task. We are living in a climate emergency. You have to put in place a mechanism that will deliver.


It is recommended that the Climate Change Authority stay, and so it should, to do the assessment of the renewable energy target, not the shonky assessment that is currently underway. We need to maintain the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. That is an absolutely critical part of rolling out utility scale renewables in the time frame.


I thank the committee secretariat for the work they did and my colleagues on the committee. I thank Senator Lin Thorp, chair of the committee. I thank everybody involved, including all those who made submissions. The overwhelming majority of submissions were opposed to Direct Action. You could hardly find one there supporting it, to the point where some senators from the coalition side kept asking, 'Why is everyone so negative?' It is because there is no substance to the policy. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (18:19):  Pursuant to order, I present the report of the Environment and Communications References Committee on the Direct Action Plan, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. 


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator THORP:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I am grateful for the opportunity to speak today as the chair of the Environment and Communications Committee on the inquiry and report into the government's Direct Action Plan. This is an important report because it addresses what may be the single greatest environmental issue facing the planet today—climate change.


Climate change is an issue that will test the mettle of the human race and our ability to work together to find solutions to reduce carbon emissions and ensure we pass on a healthy planet to our children, our grandchildren and all the generations that will follow. While there is enormous value in individual and group efforts to effect change in local areas, the heavy burden of responsibility for solving this problem must lie with governments. There is absolutely no doubt that governments across the globe must act—and we must act now.


Over the past months the Environment and Communications References Committee has heard from experts across the country about the government's proposed climate policy, direct action. We did not hear just from environmentalists, but also from academics, investors, scientists, doctors, farmers, economists, think tanks, business groups, and climatologists. And almost to a person, they told us the same thing: direct action is expensive, inefficient, and, more than likely completely unable to address climate change in any meaningful way. In fact, not one witness was willing to support direct action as a credible stand-alone means of addressing the climate change crisis that may soon be on our doorstep.


Many told us that direct action is little more than a government gift to polluters and that it will do little, if anything, to reduce Australia's emissions. Others pointed out that direct action throws away the well-established legal and ethical principle of 'polluter pays' in favour of setting up a taxpayer funded slush fund for big emitters. This approach is particularly bizarre when you learn that environment minister Greg Hunt wrote an award-winning graduate thesis entitled A Tax to make the polluter pay, which championed this very cause. Pollution is a waste output of business just like any other. Just as we would not expect someone else to pay to dispose of the skip bins of rubbish that a construction company might generate, it is quite unfair to require the taxpayer pick up the tab for big business and their carbon outputs.


The committee also heard that Direct Action is riddled with design issues. Establishing baselines will be difficult and administratively onerous, not to mention the fact that it will be virtually impossible to determine if a project would happen anyway, potentially opening up the scheme to be gamed by companies who could charge the taxpayer for emission reduction projects they were going to undertake anyway. Perversely, companies that have acted early to invest in emissions reductions may be penalised because they will be starting from a lower baseline.


Also, many witnesses pointed out that soil carbon sequestration, which is the major abatement strategy in Direct Action, is highly inefficient. In a hearing in Canberra, the CSIRO confirmed that it is likely to take a land mass two-thirds the size of Australia to achieve the sort of abatement the government says it will get from soil carbon. Other witnesses pointed to the extremely short time horizons as a threat to business confidence and investor certainty. For these and many other reasons the report recommends that the centrepiece of Direct Action, the emissions reduction fund, is fundamentally flawed and, thus, should not proceed. Another overriding message we got from submissions to the inquiry was that Direct Action will be an expensive and unnecessary burden on the taxpayer.


To meet our commitment of reducing Australia's carbon output by five per cent by 2020, the government has allocated $1.55 billion over three years, but independent work done by SKM MMA and Monash University shows this falls $4 billion short, even using the most generous modelling parameters. The government has been very clear that there will be no more money in the bucket, so it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the government will fail, probably spectacularly, to meet our emissions reduction target. This is not surprising when you consider evidence from the Climate Institute that, if other countries were to follow the Abbott government's policy lead, the world would be on track for a catastrophic rise of up to 6.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. For Australia, this would mean a five-fold increase in droughts in southern Australia, the virtual destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, forced abandonment of many coastal communities, and a 90 per cent reduction in agricultural production from the Murray-Darling region. In fact, the government has virtually admitted failure already by removing the national cap on carbon emissions, because Mr Hunt and Mr Abbott both know that, if no goal is set, it cannot possibly fail to meet it. This is an outrageous omission and one which the committee strongly recommends be rectified immediately.


On the subject of targets, the committee was also convinced by the weight of evidence toward greater reductions, and supports the adoption of the targets recommended by the Climate Change Authority, namely that Australia's 2020 emissions target be set at 15 per cent below 2000 levels in addition to the four per cent carryover from the first commitment period of the Kyoto protocol. So it is clear that Direct Action is undeniably the wrong way to go about effecting meaningful carbon emission reduction.


What did the experts recommend as the most effective solution? What has been most notable about the inquiry is the consistency of evidence we have heard from witnesses in this regard. Again and again the committee heard that the single most effective and efficient means of achieving carbon abatement is to put a price on carbon. Carbon pricing provides a positive incentive for businesses and consumers to change their behaviour and embrace low-carbon alternatives. It provides a boost to renewable industries and encourages investment in low-carbon technologies. It also encourages business to invest in areas that will ultimately make them more efficient and profitable as energy costs grow in the future.


Of course, it is not just the witnesses and submitters to the inquiry who understand the importance of pricing carbon. There are currently more than 30 countries across the world and many subnational jurisdictions that already have a price on carbon. These schemes cover the enormous number of 880 million people. In fact, while countries across the globe are embracing market based mechanisms to address this global challenge, Australia stands alone as the only country in the process of dismantling carbon pricing. Not only that; the Abbott government is also systematically trying to abolish each and every tool Australia has to protect ourselves from the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. This irresponsible action is not supported by today's report. Instead, it unreservedly recommends that Labor's clean energy package remain and that Australia move to a fully-flexible carbon price under an emissions trading scheme on 1 July this year.


The report notes that Labor's package 'presented a comprehensive set of policy instruments to reduce Australia's carbon emissions, invest in renewable energy and provide assistance for businesses and households to transition to a clean energy economy'. It also recognises the 'significant time and effort' that was spent on 'ensuring that Australia adopted an effective and credible way to address climate change in the long-term'. The committee concurred with many witnesses that the institutions that sit under the clean energy package should be maintained. This includes the Climate Change Authority, which is a crucial means for the government to obtain independent and transparent advice on climate policy. The committee was also convinced by the arguments of witnesses that the profit-making Clean Energy Finance Corporation needs to stay. This organisation has clearly succeeded in its goals of encouraging private sector investment in the renewables sector and reducing carbon emissions while still returning a healthy multimillion-dollar profit to the Australian taxpayer.


Likewise, we need to retain funding for ARENA, and the Renewable Energy Target must be maintained in its current format. If the government persists in its perverse determination to adopt an expensive, inefficient policy solution at the expense of the considered, effective and forward-thinking policy framework that we already had, it risks relegating Australia to become an environmental and economic backwater, unable to compete in the low-carbon global economy of the future. It also threatens not only our international credibility but our ability to take a leadership role in the global climate change response. This is an alternate future that we simply cannot risk and I urge the government to consider the findings of this inquiry very seriously.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Before I call you, Senator Ruston, I understand that informal arrangements have been made for you and Senator Milne to speak for five minutes to enable other committee reports to be tabled.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (18:30):  I rise to speak on the Environment and Communications References Committee report into the Direct Action Plan. While we utterly reject the recommendations of the Labor Party and the Greens in this report, one of the things that has been most disappointing is that this inquiry was supposed to be into the Direct Action package. A precursor to the Direct Action package was the very loud and clear policy platform on which the coalition went to the last election, and that was that we were intending to abolish the carbon tax.


They may well have a majority report, but the greatest endorsement that any of us in this place can get is to have the majority support of the Australian people, and that is what we received in September last year at the election. The coalition was told very clearly by the electorate, as were the opposition and the Greens, that the electorate wanted the carbon tax abolished. Notwithstanding that, I think one of the most important issues that we need to put on the table right here and now is that this debate has actually been about climate change. It has not been about Direct Action; it has not been about the abolition of the carbon tax. It seems to have become a debate about climate change.


The fact of the matter is that the government differs from the opposition and the Greens in the way that it believes that climate change can best be tackled. Our view is that, instead of imposing a $7.6 billion economy-wide tax that hinders business and does nothing for the environment, there is an alternative way in which we can achieve the outcomes that all of us in this place seek to achieve—that is, to have a cleaner energy future, to have a low-carbon future and to make sure we deal with the obvious impacts which we all talk about and that could potentially occur because of climate change.


Turning specifically to the Senate inquiry, there were many, many submitters who represented hundreds of thousands of businesses and employees. I noted that in the majority report there was some suggestion that no-one supported Direct Action as a credible means to deal with climate change. I would beg to differ. I think there were a number of people who supported Direct Action and I also think it is very premature for us to be making comments about what Direct Action can achieve, how much it is going to cost and what it can deliver, because nobody has actually given it a chance. I think we need to put on the table that this is not a debate about climate change; it is a debate about how we are intending to address the issues and the consequences of climate change.


I put on the record some comments from the submitters who gave evidence during the Senate hearings. The Australian Industry Group said that they, 'Do not support any decision on additional targets at this time.' The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies provided evidence saying:


The burden borne by Australian industry under the previous Governments Clean Energy package placed Australian mining and exploration industries at a significant disadvantage to our competitors. For the exploration and mining industry it was a financial penalty without any meaningful opportunities to contribute to Australia's response to climate change.


The National Farmers Federation said:


The NFF does not support the carbon tax due to the significant flow-on impacts to agriculture.


I have to put on the record some comments of Professor Ross Garnaut when he was responding to Senator Williams, who asked him about the implications of increasing the carbon tax to cover diesel fuel and the fact that diesel fuel would add an extra $515 million to the costs of road users. He asked Professor Garnaut if he supported that policy, and Professor Garnaut responded that he did. The truckies of Australia will be delighted to hear that!


In conclusion, we were very disappointed that the debate really did not focus on the potential positives and benefits that could be achieved by the direct action policy. I think that, if we had actually focused a lot more on trying to work our way through the potential benefits instead of focusing on the fact that we were having a debate about climate change, who believed in climate change and who was a climate denier, we may well have ended up with a report that we all possibly could have agreed with.


I would like to thank the secretariat for the huge amount of work that they put into this; it was a big hearing and a big inquiry. They had to do a lot of travel. I would also like to thank them for their outstanding work and their diligence during this inquiry. I would also like to say that the deputy chair of the committee, Senator Williams, endorses my comments in thanking them.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:35):  I rise tonight to respond to the tabling of the committee report on direct action. Suffice to say, this report absolutely exposes direct action as simply a slogan. There is no substance to this policy, and that was revealed throughout the inquiry. In response to Senator Ruston's remarks about the so-called positive benefits not being discussed, the reason for that was that nobody through all the inquiries could put any facts on the table whatsoever about direct action. The fact of the matter is that the inquiry demonstrated that it is narrow, will not create any lasting transformation across the economy and is unfinanceable because the grants are so small, contracts are limited to five years, prices on offer are so low that they fall far short of being investment-grade and finance institutions and banks will not waste their time on direct action.


It is an optional—in other words, it is a voluntary scheme—so there is no incentive for polluters to participate. Therefore, it is very difficult to see who on earth is going to be part of this so-called emissions reduction fund. It is costly because it is going to require a huge bureaucracy to administer it, and the taxpayers are going to have to pay. In other words, so much for the slogan 'great big new tax'. In fact, communities are now going to be taxed to pay the polluters through this emission reduction fund, and there is going to be no absolute ability to determine whether there are any emission reductions additional to what companies would have done anyway. So additionality is a real issue. The assessment of the baselines is a real issue. No detail was provided and the department could not answer any of the questions. Remarkably, there is no detail about Direct Action whatsoever. 


In fact, not a single economist who came before the committee supported Direct Action, because they rightly said that it is expensive and it is charging the taxpayer to pay the polluters for no guaranteed outcomes in achieving even five per cent, let alone the 40 per cent to 60 per cent emissions reduction trajectory that is going to be required by 2030. As well as statements of support from the Business Council of Australia, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and so on, and their disgraceful efforts as a cheer squad for a policy which has no substance, we had Professor Garnaut and Ken Henry commenting in the media recently. We also had Bernie Fraser appear before the committee. All of them said that Direct Action demonstrates no real commitment to addressing the climate, no consistency with what the science requires for emissions reductions and, what is more, that the direct action policy had no substance. In fact, it will fall short of its five per cent emission reduction task and will cost a great deal of money. Billions of dollars will be required, on top of the existing $1.55 billion that is allocated.


As Direct Action unravels we are simply going to see a repeat of the failed Howard government program. It did not achieve emissions reductions and had to be abandoned because, essentially, it was a gift to companies that hung out to get the money to do what they otherwise intended to do. We need serious emissions reduction in Australia. The advantage of the emissions trading scheme that we currently have is that it can be scaled up to achieve that trajectory of 40 per cent to 60 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. That is the scale of the task. We are living in a climate emergency. You have to put in place a mechanism that will deliver.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:52):  In December last year, following the release of MYEFO, the Treasurer said in his speech to the National Press Club that taxpayers' dollars should be better respected. Further, the Treasurer said that:


The days of just handing out cash, helicoptering money out, is just not possible.


With the budget fast approaching, I and many of my colleagues are taking a particular interest in the money churned through large taxpayer funded organisations.


One such organisation which might need a reminder about the ethics associated with being employed by the taxpayer is the ABC. Keep in mind that the public broadcaster receives over $1 billion a year from the taxpayer, where a reported $465 million of that is allotted to wages, super and entitlements alone. We should not forget that the $223 million 10-year contract for the Australia Network—which was twice recommended by bureaucrats be awarded to Sky News, only to be overruled by the Gillard and Rudd governments—was given instead to the ABC. So there is no shortage of money available to the public broadcaster.


Those on a good salary from the public purse should not have a problem with showing some transparency when taking it. I might add that the remunerations of senior Commonwealth public servants and, indeed, politicians are there for the world to see and any additional money or income that we earn from forays into paid journalism also have to be disclosed to the public.


That is why I read with interest last week a report in The Australian which alleged that a number of high-profile ABC employees were not being transparent at all by not disclosing income made from commercial entities. On March 17, Lara Sinclair wrote:


THE ABC’s most senior journalists are failing to disclose payments of up to $15,000 from major corporations to speak at functions, despite legal requirements for the public broadcaster to be free from commercial influence. 


Ms Sinclair went on:


Some of the ABC’s most high-profile talent—Tony Jones, Emma Alberici, Fran Kelly and Barrie Cassidy—are charging between $5000 and $15,000 to speak at private events run by big global and Australian corporations, industry groups and government departments.


Neither I nor the coalition have any problem at all with that; in fact, we encourage individuals to work hard for an income that is legitimately derived. Good luck to those ABC presenters who are able to command those sorts of salaries. Do not detect in my speech any envy that no-one has ever approached me with a $5,000 cheque to make a speech! Indeed, this does happen to people who have notoriety through their well-known existence courtesy of ABC programming across Australia. However, given the significant celebrity of these presenters—which, as I say, comes on the back of being employed by the taxpayer—I believe there should be some clarity about where any additional income comes from, particularly if it comes from commercial interests.


As The Australian reported:


Lateline host Emma Alberici was paid $15,000 to host a two-day Wesfarmers Insurance leaders conference in October 2012, which at the time was part of the Wesfarmers group, which includes Coles, Bunnings, Kmart and other high-profile companies.


Alberici has since interviewed Wesfarmers executives on Lateline, including chief executive Richard Goyder …


Then there is Q&A host and Lateline presenter Tony Jones. Ms Sinclair writes that:


Jones, who is already paid by the taxpayer to the tune of $355,789 a year, according to ABC salary data leaked last year, charges between $5000 and $10,000 for an appearance, according to the Ovations site.


That is a speakers bureau site. Platinum Speakers and Entertainers agency founder Helene Greenham told The Australian that:


Tony Jones is pretty popular …


“We might have had five or so jobs with Tony.


""(He) is awesome at panel facilitation.


Some quick research also reveals that other notable ABC personalities not mentioned in the report are popular on the speaking circuit. ABC News Breakfast co-host Michael Rowland is listed by Saxton as having been used as a facilitator by a superfund. Annabel Crabb, ABC News Online's chief political writer and star of The Drum, is also used by speakers bureaus, including Claxton Speakers International. Then there is the darling of the left, columnist for The Australian and long-time presenter of Radio National's Late Night Livefour nights a week, Phillip Adams. The Celebrity Speakers website lists numerous testimonials for Mr Adams, including from a finance group, a council and educational institutions. All of those testimonials are very enthusiastic, I might say. Veteran ABC broadcaster Mark Colvin is also listed as a speaker on the Ovations website—but no fee is disclosed. Tony Eastley, formerly of AM but now on News 24, is listed by Claxton. ABC sports journalist Debbie Spillane features on the Celebrity Speakers website. It does seem that prominent ABC personalities are in great demand on the corporate speaking circuit.


Sinclair wrote in her report that:


The ABC says there is no need for its on-air talent to publicly disclose the payments, arguing all engagements are cleared with a journalist’s manager beforehand.


I wonder about the ethics of the ABC declaring itself commercial-interest-free if its star presenters are accepting these speakers fees and not subsequently declaring them.


Australians should be reassured of the impartiality of the ABC. Declaring such interests are part of that reassurance. After all, the taxpayer is forking out hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay annual salaries to some of these presenters, who, I might add, are building their profile and boosting their commercial speaker's fees that they no doubt demand courtesy of their national platforms across Australia. Do not forget, this is across the region, thanks to the multi-million dollar Australia Network deal.


I am not alone in seeking for the ABC to be more transparent. Friends of the ABC have raised concerns about the same issue. I would hope that the ABC can concede that a little clarity is needed. Perhaps the taxpayer should be demanding a bit more of their money's worth from our ABC presenters as well, given the time that they have to take up these commercial offers. I am told that some of these presenters do not even log a five day working week. Maybe someone like Tony Jones could be sent to some of our neighbours in the region—where the Australia Network no doubt rates through the roof—to speak to people smugglers, giving them the government's message that their game is up.


Either way, the ABC should be instigating a better process—one of transparency—when it comes to the commercial income that their impartial presenters receive. The public purse should be respected, especially at this time of a difficult budget. I want to make it clear that I am not against ABC presenters selling their balance, their expertise, their wit, their general all-round knowledge and their opinion. Good luck to them. I have no problem with that, provided that they do that in their own time and provided that it does not interfere with the work for which they are paid by the taxpayer.


I do say that everybody receiving the taxpayers' dollar, including ABC presenters, should be transparent and accountable in their roles. The monies that they receive from these private engagements should be made known to the public, as they are in the case of senior public servants and politicians who receive additional income over and above their taxpayer-funded salary.
