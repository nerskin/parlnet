"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-02-22,"—by leave—I move:
That government business orders of the day no. 2 (Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2]) and no. 3 (Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2]) may be taken together for their remaining stages.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-02-22,"—I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. May I start by saying that, just like with many other things about this government, the Australian public were certainly not told about a hike in the Medicare levy surcharge before the last federal election. These two surcharge bills, together with the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2009 [No. 2]—which, interestingly, will be conditional on the surcharge bills—set up a framework for hitting the Australian public with another big new tax. It is now very clear, as if we did not already know, that this government cannot be trusted because it will say one thing and do another. This government is a fraud, and that is just as evident in health as it is in many other areas.
These bills go against all the commitments that Prime Minister K Rudd and Ms Roxon gave to the Australian people before the election. They lied to the Australian people before the election and they have lied since. Look what they said in 2007. It is important that we take the Senate back to what this government and the now health minister said then. In September 2007 she stated:
On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.
Then in a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association the Prime Minister stated:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.
He went on to state:
Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for full approval of premium increases.
This letter is not worth the paper it was written on because it is very clear that the Prime Minister, on 20 November 2007—there he is—was prepared to tell the Australian Health Insurance Association in writing, no less, that he was not going to change the system and here we are for the second time with the Prime Minister pushing for these changes. So not only did they make these hollow promises before the election, but after the election Kevin Rudd and Nicola Roxon confirmed Labor’s position, sometimes in quite spectacular form. In February 2008 in the Australian the Prime Minister said:
The private health insurance rebate remains unchanged and will remain unchanged.
In May 2008, on Macquarie Radio, Nicola Roxon stated:
… we continue to support the 30 per cent, 35 per cent and 40 per cent rebate for those Australians who choose to take out private health insurance.
And then, in October 2008, in a speech to the Australian Health Insurance Association conference, Nicola Roxon stated:
Private health insurance consumers will still be able to claim the 30 to 40 per cent rebate, and the Lifetime Health Cover incentives will remain in place.
In February 2009, in the Age, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, stated:
The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.
On Channel 9, with Laurie Oakes—this was later in the piece, when the Prime Minister had finally confessed that he was going to break another election promise—to try and justify the broken promise that these bills represent the Prime Minister drew on what at that time was the unpublished Intergenerational report. He told Laurie Oakes:
What the intergenerational report tomorrow will reveal for the first time is that the cumulative impact of knocking that major reform back is in the order of one hundred billion dollars over the next several decades.
He plucked a figure out of the air of $100 billion. Our Prime Minister is very good at doing that, plucking figures out of the air. As everybody knows, there was no $100 billion in the Intergenerational report. We all looked for this magic figure, and guess what? It was not there. It was nowhere to be found. The Prime Minister was, yet again, caught out lying and then he had to fudge it a bit.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. Senator Fierravanti-Wells has twice this morning accused the Prime Minister of lying. It is unparliamentary and I ask her to withdraw.
 (Senator Hurley)—Yes, indeed. Senator Fierravanti-Wells.
—I withdraw it now. I will replace it with ‘untruth’. I will replace it with ‘misleading’ or I will replace it with ‘very big porky’ if you like, Senator Stephens, but the fact remains that what he said before the election is very different to what he is now trying to push through this parliament. It does not change it, but it is very clear that the Prime Minister’s position is very different to before. On health and a whole range of other things, his position has changed.

Senator Forshaw interjecting—

—Well, Senator Forshaw, that is all very well. The Prime Minister said and did whatever he had to do to get into power. Now he does not give a damn because he is out there changing his position on just about everything. Health is the most spectacular. At last week’s estimates we were waiting for this grand plan from the Prime Minister, the famous K Rudd plan to fix our hospitals. What did the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing tell us? ‘There is no plan.’ They could not even find a back-of-an-envelope scribbling that said, ‘K Rudd’s grand plan for the hospitals.’ Why? Because there is no plan. There never was a plan and there is not one now. That is the truth, Senator Forshaw, and the sooner you get used to hearing that sort of stuff then the better off we will all be as we go towards the election.
We have this mythical $100 billion. When Ms Roxon initially introduced the bills in the earlier part of last year, she told the parliament that they would provide savings of $1.9 billion over four years. This is the figure that has been repeated by the minister and repeated to the parliament and to the media. But, later in the year, the Prime Minister—a serial offender, I must say, in the field of exaggeration—was putting another figure out there. On 10 September, when he was asked about Labor’s changes to private health insurance on the 7.30 Report, he said:
... in the case of that one measure, PHI, that you mentioned, that’s worth some $9 billion in the decade ahead.
We have got $100 billion that was not in the report and we have got the $9 billion that Minister Roxon and the Prime Minister mention. It is $100 billion now and it was $9 billion then. When you change so often you forget which one is the actual, true position.
The Prime Minister was saying that the savings from the rebate means test—this new tax—will be directed at additional investments in health. In August last year Minister Roxon, at a CEDA Health Reform Forum in Sydney, showed that she is on a different page because she told CEDA that the private health changes alone will save enough to fund the commission’s proposed e-health investments. She means the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. Three months later, the minister was quoted in the Age as saying:
This measure is part of the government’s reform of the health system, will save about $1.9 billion over the next four years, and allow the government to invest more in better services, new medicines and improved technology ...
The same $1.9 billion over four years has suddenly become this magic pot for different uses. The Prime Minister says one thing and the health minister says another. The Treasurer, when he foreshadowed these bills at the last budget, made it very clear where the savings measures were to go. He said that they were to support the long-term sustainability of the pension system. If you believe the PM, it is health generally; the health minister is on a frolic of her own and saying it is going to be used for e-health; and the Treasurer says it is to be used to fund the pension system changes.
Quite frankly, given the untruths and deceptions, you cannot believe any of them. The Treasurer was questioned by Malcolm Farr at the National Press Club on this and the Treasurer gave this answer:
It is true that the private health insurance means testing that we put in there along with a number of other measures we had in the budget offset the cost of the pension increase right out past the forward estimates and well into the future.
The changes that this government wants to bring about, quite frankly, have absolutely nothing to do with investments in health but they have everything to do with an ideological agenda. The Prime Minister and the health minister have absolutely no hesitation in misleading the Australian public about this whole thing.
This is simply bad policy. Firstly, if these measures are passed, there is no doubt that there would be further pressure on our public hospitals, because, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, there is this grand plan to fix the hospitals. If these bills go through, there will be even more pressure on hospitals, particularly those in New South Wales. Can the hospitals in New South Wales get any worse than they are at the moment? The answer is yes, because if these measures are passed there will be absolutely extraordinary pressure on New South Wales hospitals and all other public hospitals around Australia. Secondly, if these measures are passed, they will increase the cost of private health insurance for millions of Australians, including those on lower incomes. It was very clear from answers given in estimates in June last year that there are 11 million people that have private health insurance, and 9.7 million of these are single people on less than $75,000 a year or couples on less than $150,000 a year. They are the people that do take out health insurance and that this Prime Minister and this health minister want to screw into the ground.
Labor just cannot get it into their heads that this is not about ideology. This is about people insuring themselves because they know how bad the hospitals are. That is why they take out private health insurance. If you force those people out of the private health insurance system, particularly the younger ones, and they leave that pool, of course it makes the insurance more expensive for those who remain. So, by driving people out of health insurance, particularly younger people, you are leaving the burden on older Australians, as well as the millions of people who have private health insurance who are on very low incomes of $26,000 or less, and driving up their premiums. Families who continue to have private health insurance will, under the proposed new tax on private health, face higher premiums. Families will face higher premiums as a result of these changes.
Let us just look at some of those families, because I think it is time for the government to look Australians, particularly Australian families, squarely in the eye and tell them what the repercussions of this new tax on private health insurance will be. For example, let us look at the federal seat of Bennelong. Perhaps Ms McKew might like to go out and tell her electors—
—Ms Who?
—Ms Who?
—That is right. Ms Who? As patron senator of Bennelong I have not actually seen her out and about.
—I have not seen her.
—You have to make an appointment, Senator Cormann, to see her—by appointment only, between two and four on certain days of the week. But perhaps, on the odd days when her constituents actually get the opportunity to see her, she might like to explain to the 72 per cent of people in the federal seat of Bennelong who had private health insurance as at 1 January 2009 that, with these changes, Labor is going to hit them with higher premiums. Or, if they do not take out private health insurance, they are going to be hit by a higher Medicare levy surcharge. That is what this is about: a very little carrot and a lot of stick—a lot of stick. Bennelong is an electorate where the median individual income is just over $27,000, the median family income is just over $79,000 and the median household income is just over $61,000. These are the sorts of people that Labor is going to really hurt—those 72 per cent in the seat of Bennelong.
Let me look at some other Labor seats. For example, in the federal seat of Banks, as at 1 January, 56 per cent of voters had private health insurance. Go tell them how much extra it is going to cost them to have private health insurance and that, if they opt out of private health insurance, they are going to be hit with a huge increase in their Medicare surcharge. Go and tell the people of Barton, for example. Sixty-one per cent of the people in Barton have private health insurance.
This government is ideologically trying to portray this change as somehow hitting the rich. It is not. It is going to predominantly hit people on low to medium incomes—ordinary Australians who know that if they have to subject themselves to the rigours of the public health system, particularly in places like New South Wales, they are going to be waiting and waiting and waiting. Therefore, many of them make sacrifices to take out private health insurance, many senior Australians in particular because they know that they are going to have to call on the system. But this government is about to slug them with higher premiums or, if they do not take out private health insurance, a higher Medicare surcharge.
Let us look at other seats, such as in the Illawarra, where my electorate office is—working-class Labor areas like Cunningham and Throsby. In the federal seat of Cunningham, 55 per cent of people have private health insurance. In the federal seat of Lowe, it is 72 per cent. Try the federal seat of Macquarie: 41 per cent. In the federal seat of Watson, Minister Burke’s seat, it is 50 per cent; in Werriwa, 41 per cent. These are the ordinary Australians that Labor is prepared now to slug—and slug very, very hard.
Labor will turn around and say, ‘Oh, yes, but it’s only a very small number of people who will actually be affected.’ Last time we had this debate, Senator Ludwig had to come into this chamber to correct the record and tell us that it was over a million people—from memory, 1.7 million people—who would be affected by these changes. Catholic Health Australia have commissioned research by Access Economics which shows that the number of people who will quit private health insurance could be significantly higher—much, much higher.
These bills introduce three new tiers to the health insurance rebates. As a direct result of the changes in these bills, the cost of private health insurance, as I have said, will increase for millions of Australians by between 14 per cent and almost 67 per cent. These are people who earn above $75,000 as a single or $150,000 as a couple. Many thousands of the people in Labor’s heartland that I referred to are going to be affected. What sort of spin or argument is the Prime Minister going to run to fudge his way out of this one? The plain and simple truth is that this is a new tax on private health insurance that millions and millions of Australians are going to have to face.
What does this mean for our health system? It will increase the number of patients, treatments and costs on the public side of the ledger. Of course, this is at a time when the Prime Minister is professing he is going to fix public hospitals. It is very clear that all we have seen is lots of rhetoric and not much action from this government.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-02-22,"—Earlier this year in the Senate the Greens successfully moved to split these fairer private health insurance incentives bills so that we could talk about the increase in the Medicare levy surcharge and means testing the rebate separately and allow a separate vote on the bills. This is because we have a different opinion on the bills. We have flagged that we do support means testing for the Medicare rebate—and we will talk about this in more detail when we debate that bill—because we did not support the rebate in the first place. So a move to remove at least some of it and generate more income for the public health system, in our minds, is at least a step in the right direction.
However, the government’s Medicare levy surcharge is a stick to compel people to take out private health insurance, forcing people who are not on high incomes—$75,000 for singles and $150,000 for families—to purchase a market product that is expensive and over which the government has no true and proper legislative control. Health insurance premiums are again about to rise by an estimated six to seven per cent, which is around $195 per family. People often buy the cheapest product available even though it does not service their needs, because they feel compelled to.
The Medicare levy surcharge, we believe, unfairly penalises people who make a conscientious choice about private health insurance. As departmental officials at the recent Senate estimates hearings on 10 February pointed out, people on higher incomes who do not have private health insurance are not influenced by either the rebate or the levy surcharge. Those on high incomes who do not take out private health insurance—estimated at around 130,000—who pay the surcharge were described by officials as ‘unpredictable’. In the past people have described them as not making an economically rational decision. These people have not been included, we were told at estimates, in the Treasury modelling.
These people make a choice not to take out private health insurance for not just economic reasons. In other words, they are not being forced into it by the surcharge. These people take care of their health costs themselves. The Greens believe that this group should not be subject to extra financial penalties for no obvious financial gain to them, as they are unlikely to take out private health insurance and, if they did, they would probably take out basic packages that they would barely use.
The Medicare levy surcharge was introduced by the Howard government following their election in 1996. The Medicare Levy Amendment Act introduced a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge for individuals with a taxable income above $50,000 and for families with a combined taxable income of more than $100,000 who did not have private health insurance cover for themselves and all their dependants.
It is impossible to consider reform of the Australian health care system without considering the role of private health insurance. The government makes a significant contribution to the cost of private health insurance through the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, or the PHI. It also provides other incentives for people to take out private cover, including Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare levy surcharge, which is what we are debating now.
The government progressively introduced these policies in the late 1990s in response to dwindling private health insurance membership. The Medicare levy surcharge was introduced in 1997, the Lifetime Health Cover in 1999 and the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate in 2000. These policies increased private health insurance membership from 30 per cent in 1997 to 44 per cent in 2000, although most of this occurred in the six months before June 2000.
The introduction of these measures by the Howard government was accompanied by a concurrent reduction in the level of expenditure provided by the federal government to public hospitals. A fall of about $1 billion each year pushed public hospitals to crisis in most states and territories, amid claims from the federal government that the state and territory governments were misusing the funds and counterclaims by the states and territories that there was underfunding from the Commonwealth—the classic state versus federal debate. The point here is that these policies were introduced in the then government’s philosophical belief that private health insurance would save our hospital system and public health system. The Greens do not share that belief.
While the Private Health Insurance Administration Council collects a large amount of data on the operations of the private health insurance industry, there is little in the way of performance information. This is in contrast with recent efforts to improve accountability and transparency of performance in the public hospital system. If the government is to continue subsidising the private health insurance industry by nearly $4 billion a year, it must take steps to demand more accountability and transparency from the private health insurance funds and private hospitals. Despite the fact that we will be debating means testing the rebate over the coming day, we are currently debating the increase in the Medicare levy surcharge. The fact is, here the government is still supporting the private health insurance industry and will still be channelling millions of taxpayers’ dollars into private health insurance.
The stated intention of the then government’s policies was to increase private health insurance and, supposedly, to take pressure off the public system. We do not believe there is evidence that these policies have done that. We do not believe it has reduced the burden on our public hospitals, and in fact the situation continues to worsen. There is also evidence to suggest that the policy has led to a preference for privately insured patients to use the public system. This is detrimental for the people without private health insurance and does little to take pressure off the public health system, which is what the philosophy of the government of the time was supposed to achieve. The Medicare levy surcharge is, we believe, a clumsy way of taking money from people on high incomes if they do not have private health insurance and it penalises those people that are in fact trying to take care of their health insurance costs themselves and do not believe in private health insurance. There are easier ways, we believe, to fund the public hospital system—that is, get rid of the rebate.
The Medicare levy surcharge is now set at a level where it applies to those who are most likely to have the means to pay their way in a private hospital and pay for ancillary services without the need to depend on insurers. In fact, those people have consciously made that choice. People do not necessarily buy private health insurance because it represents good value for money. Indeed, in most cases we do not believe it does. Many people will avoid declaring their private health insurance on admission to hospital to avoid paying the large gaps and out-of-pocket expenses associated with many private health insurance plans. In fact, when the Senate inquiry looked into the previous bills concerning this matter we took evidence which suggested that those rates were going up. In other words, more people with private health insurance were still using public hospitals. That undermines the previous government’s assertion that private health insurance encourages people out of the public hospital system and takes pressure off the public hospital system.
The surge in membership following the introduction of Lifetime Health Cover shows people buy only if there is a sufficient threat associated with failing to do so, not because it necessarily delivers good health outcomes. Health economist and National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission Commissioner Stephen Duckett, and others, estimated back in 2000 that if all government subsidies to the private health sector were redirected to public hospitals an additional 1.5 million cases could be treated in Australia’s public hospitals.
Why do federal governments believe it is their responsibility to boost private health insurance membership? If the industry was selling something that represented good value, perhaps they would not have had the same level of difficulty in maintaining fund membership. The policy of subsidising private health insurers undermines Medicare and takes funds away from public hospitals. Consumer advocates Choice have said that the antagonistic response of the private health industry to any changes to the status quo shows how dependent they are on government policy to force customers to take up private health insurance, arguing that if the industry provided a product that offers customers value, it would not require a government subsidy. The loss of members from private health insurance may be a loss for private health insurers but is unlikely to have profound impacts on public hospitals as many of those affected are young people who are less likely to need hospital care, and if they do need hospital care they are likely to use a public hospital rather than bear the surcharges and excess payments associated with private health insurance products. Thus the viability of private hospitals is not threatened by the decline in the number of people with private health insurance; it is threatened by the private health insurance companies failing to provide insurance products that people want.
The Greens have repeatedly expressed our concern about this surcharge and the fact that it is impacting on people that have made a conscious decision not to take out private health insurance. We believe that the money this surcharge would raise should be invested directly back into the public system, and specifically into mental health programs. There is compelling evidence that proper investment in early intervention mental health services can have dramatic health and financial benefits, for example, reducing the estimated $10 billion to $30 billion costs associated with mental ill health in young people. In other words, if we invest early we can (a) provide a much-needed service to young people and (b) we actually save on those longer term health costs. There are many early intervention mental health programs which could benefit from immediate funding, and I suspect that if people knew that the extra money they were being forced to pay through the surcharge was being directly invested in helping to pay for mental health programs they would be more supportive of that particular program. We believe that $145 million that the government say that they are going to raise over four years from the Medicare levy surcharge—and, by the way, we could not get access to the modelling for that—
—Surprise, surprise!
—Exactly, surprise, surprise! We have no way of knowing how the $145 million was calculated. Our calculations are unable to come up with the same amount of money. It is also important to point out that those 130,000 people that do not take out private health insurance—those unpredictable 130,000 people who make a conscious decision not to take out private health insurance—were apparently not included, as I said earlier, in the modelling.
However, that rubbery $145 million over four years, we believe, needs to be invested in mental health programs and we are suggesting some very concrete proposals, such as the Communities of Youth. Thirty million dollars per annum should be invested in the program that was proposed by the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. We are proposing that further money be invested in Headspace. This is an excellent program that has been running now for some time. It is desperately underfunded and needs to be expanded to the areas that it does not cover at the present time. That service has been highly praised and delivers much-needed services to young people.
The third area we believe needs to be invested in is other early intervention services, again recommended by the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. We believe further investment in early psychosis prevention and intervention services would provide an excellent way to help those suffering from mental illness. Also, and importantly, we believe we need to be investing in a suicide hospital discharge and treatment program. This is an area that is underfunded, and that has been highlighted in the media recently. Investing in these programs is a way the government can prove that they are genuine about their desire to increase the surcharge to raise funds. Those funds are supposed to be directed to public health. This is a concrete way those funds can be directed to public health. We believe it is a fair way to ensure that services are genuinely delivered for improving the public health system in an area that is much needed, the area of mental health.
We still have concerns around the increase in the surcharge. We believe that the government has not justified increasing the surcharge—other than to keep people in private health insurance. We do not believe that is an appropriate measure to keep people in private health insurance. We do not believe it is the government’s role to keep people in private health insurance. The government should be investing those resources in places other than private health insurance rebates. It should be directing all of that money to the public health system. We do not believe that the private health insurance sector is delivering good health outcomes for our community. We believe, as I said, that it would be better if the government focused more on the reform of the public health system.
We have a number of problems with the government’s arguments and we are extremely concerned that the modelling around the impact of the measures on the public health sector is not conclusive. In particular, the modelling around the Medicare levy surcharge is incomplete. The government says so itself because it cannot model the people who do not take out private health insurance. We do not believe that the purchase of private health insurance is an objective, rational or measurable act. It is highly subjective, and evidence given to several Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiries by people like Dr Tim Woodruff from the Doctors Reform Society and Ian McAuley from the Centre for Policy Development has shown that cost, as a premium or as a tax incentive or disincentive, is rated lower than perceptions of security and safety. In other words, the basic premise the government is using to do its modelling is flawed. This simply means that the removal of the surcharge would have less of an impact on people’s choices about private health insurance than their age, their general health and their perception of risk and security in general and in relation to their health and wellbeing. In other words, the foundation on which the government is making its decisions is flawed.
The Greens have concerns with the government’s Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] because it is a ‘stick’ to compel people into taking out private health insurance—forcing people who are not on high incomes into purchasing a market product which is expensive and over which the government has no legislative control. And the Medicare levy surcharge also unfairly penalises people who make a conscientious choice about private health insurance.
However, the Greens do believe that any funds raised from the Medicare levy surcharge should be directed towards mental health programs. We believe it is a worthwhile investment and would deliver real outcomes. We believe they are outcomes that not only are essential to our community but also would be supported by people who are essentially what we call ‘conscientious objectors’ to private health insurance.
According to Dr Lesley Russell from the Menzies Centre for Health Policy, the increase in the Medicare levy surcharge suggests we are moving towards a new policy with regard to the role of the private system in health care. The increased surcharge imposed on high earners seems to indicate that the government expects or at least requires these people to have—if not to use—private health insurance cover. We agree with Dr Russell’s observations that it is a confused approach from a policy perspective. It would appear that the case for budget savings has won out over the drive for better health policy.
This is the bottom line here. In this case we do not believe it is about delivering better health outcomes; it is about trying to appease the private health insurance industry—arguing that means testing the rebate is not going to have such an impact on private health insurers because the government is raising the Medicare levy surcharge, thus forcing people into private health insurance. We believe the government is taking two contrary positions. On the one hand it is means testing the rebate; on the other hand it is saying to insurers, ‘It’s okay. We are going to slug the higher earners who do not have private health insurance and try to force them into taking your product, which we actually do not really like.’ But the government is going to do that to appease the private health insurers, to make them feel better so that they will not oppose the means testing of the rebate. The government has taken two contrary positions. This is confused policymaking. At its heart it is not delivering good health outcomes. That is the concern for the Greens. The government needs to be more upfront about what its position is. It needs to be more upfront about investing the funds from the surcharge into real policy outcomes, and it needs to present its modelling on how it came to its figures for the surcharge. The modelling has not been presented to us. We could not get it through the chamber or through estimates. We do not believe the figures. The government seems to have plucked them out of the air. The modelling does not include the 130,000 people who do not have private health insurance.
I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
and the Senate calls on the Government to invest the full amount raised by the Medicare Levy Surcharge (approximately $145 million over 4 years) into mental health programs:
Communities of Youth, Mental Health ($30 million per annum) proposed by National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission;
Headspace (30 new services at $1 million per annum or $30 million);
early psychosis prevention and intervention services ($26 million per annum); and
Lifeline suicide hospital discharge and treatment plan ($15.39 million as a total package over 3 years) and a new Lifeline freecall number ($17.5 million per annum).",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-02-22,"—In reviewing the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2] put forward by the Rudd Labor government, I realise that the government are confronted with a great moral challenge. You may be excused for thinking I am referring to last year’s great moral challenge of our time—the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which somehow has been relegated to the backblocks of the legislative agenda for 2010. That is just another example of the failure of this government to implement any substantive policy that is actually in accordance with the best interests of the Australian people.
We could talk about the whales and how the government is going to sue people and take the Japanese to court. That has been on the backburner for a couple of years but has reappeared now in an election year. We could talk about the government’s environmental promises with a CPRS and other nonsense that it has put forward as the greatest moral challenge of our time. That has gone. We could talk about its fiscal conservatism before it blew $150 billion of taxpayers’ money on nonsense. We could talk about its failed education revolution where it has not introduced a laptop per student as it promised before the last election. Now we are into a new realm of broken promises. In this instance we are talking about the Medicare levy surcharge, another broken promise by the Rudd government, which in spin worthy of a whole troop of whirling dervishes it has called the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill—more nonsense because there is nothing fairer about what the government is proposing here. The government is proposing to increase taxes for those people who previously wanted to take care of their own private health insurance needs but who will be forced to drop it because of the consequential action the government is proposing to take in removing the private health insurance rebate. It is more nonsense, more empty rhetoric and more spin from the most loquacious and disingenuous Prime Minister that this country has ever seen.
Let me remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, of why I can say that this is more empty rhetoric from an empty vessel in the Prime Minister who makes a heck of a lot of noise. He has said repeatedly that the government—federal Labor—will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare levy surcharge. There is your get-out-of-jail-free card for the Prime Minister because the word ‘maintain’, he would maintain, could be interpreted as ‘increase’, because increase tax is what these bills will do. They will increase the taxation burden on ordinary Australians and Australian families. They will increase by 0.25 per cent and 0.5 per cent the Medicare levy surcharge for individuals and couples. They will be increased because the government is pursuing an ideological vendetta against private health insurance. It is just another vendetta that this government pursues in relation to private ownership, private industry and private enterprise, and private thrift—anything that does not place the government at the economic centre of how the country is running and that does not place the government at the centre of family life or the education system. This government is opposed to anything that does not have it at the very core of almost every event in Australia.
Australian families do not want that. Australian families want to be able to take care of themselves. They want to be able to look after their own health needs by taking some responsibility, by having affordable private health insurance. They have private health insurance so that it maintains options for them but also relieves the burden on the public health system. And it is very hard to argue against that. Something along the lines of 56 per cent of operations are now undertaken in the private hospital system. This is the very system that this government wants to undermine. It wants to undermine it by removing the private health insurance rebate, which would make private health insurance more expensive for certain individuals. I am sure any number of those individuals will drop out of private health insurance because they will no longer be able to afford it as their electricity bills go up 16 or so per cent and their gas bills rise and their mortgage costs rise as a result of the spendthrift ways in which this government is throwing cash around.
As the cost of living goes up, people have to make discretionary decisions and private health insurance, as important as it is, is not regarded as important enough by this government, which is making it unaffordable. So there is a stick for this government to beat private health insurance out of people. As people are reliant then on the public health system, as they fall into the Medicare safety net, this government wants to beat them again by increasing the Medicare levy surcharge. For a high-income earner—and a very big question is what is a high-income earner in this day and age—living in Sydney you will need substantially more money to be a high-income earner and to maintain a certain lifestyle than if you live in, say, Hobart or Adelaide. The government is going to beat you with more tax. More tax is some sort of incentive. Apparently the logic is this: ‘We are going to make you drop out of private health insurance and then we are going to tax you more for putting extra pressure on the public health system.’
It strikes me as a duplicitous, irreconcilable objective. The government wants to reduce the pressure on the public health system, yet it wants to provide disincentives for people to maintain private health insurance. The government, of course, knows the consequences of its actions. Basically, it means it will reap more money from the Australian taxpayer. It is going to rip cash out of households that, in many instances, really cannot afford it and is doing so in order to buttress its own coffers—the coffers that have been run down not into just an empty vault but into negative territory. This government has wasted so much money. It has been irresponsible with taxpayers’ money; it has been irresponsible with its ideological agenda that is seeking to pit ordinary Australians who are seeking to take care of their own needs and requirements against their own government. What a shameful thing! I know there are many on the Labor side who share my disdain and contempt for the way Mr Rudd is going about his business.
—They do, too.
—I know they do, Senator Cormann; they tell us all the time. They provide us with this information. They see the failed policies. They see these extraordinary interventions in the private marketplace with, quite frankly, hideous consequences. We see no-one prepared to take responsibility for the failings, and this is the great shame of this government. They are shameless in distancing themselves from all their policy failures. It is always someone else’s fault—it was the last government’s fault. The last government had the highest level of private health insurance participation. We had shorter waiting lists in our hospitals than there are now. That was another broken promise by Mr Rudd and his government. I wonder if the people of Australia remember that one: ‘We will take over the hospital system in 2009.’ They have not managed to achieve that. In fact they are washing their hands of it and doing the Pontius Pilate in saying: ‘No, it wasn’t us. It was the states. We now have to come to a reasonable agreement with them.’ I am sick of it and my constituents are sick of it. The Australian people are getting very tired of listening to the empty vessels in this government making all sorts of unsubstantiated claims and never bearing account for them.
We are going to hold them to account today by voting against these bills. This government said that they would not be messing with the Medicare levy surcharge. On 20 November 2007 the Prime Minister said:
Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.
He went on:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
Clearly that is more nonsense because they have already introduced the bill. It has been rejected and now they are going to reintroduce it to change those rebates.
How can this government hold their head high? This is the great moral dilemma facing this government now. How can they backflip, twist, spin, somersault, pirouette—how do you want to describe it—flip-flop on a core election commitment and then have the audacity and the hide to go on public television and come into this chamber and the other place and say: ‘We are honouring our election commitments’? It is absolute nonsense but they hope that, if they speak for long enough and use enough long words, the public and the commentariat will get confused and will not actually know what they said.
The Australian people and the commentariat, the observers, those who are absolutely interested in politics and those who are just observers of it or even casual acquaintances with what goes on in this place, are waking up to the fact that we have the most dysfunctional government that I can recall in my lifetime. Of course there was one parallel, but I was only a boy, and we thank Sir John Kerr for his contribution to democracy on that occasion because he saved Australia from a terrible fate. We are about to have a very similar fate befall us under this government, which has completely lost control of its financial capacity. It has lost control of taxpayers’ money. It has even lost control of its own programs.
This government received warning after warning about the failure of its programs and about the dangers of some of its programs and it ignored those warnings. In fact it beggars belief that departments would receive warnings for a minister and not give them to him. They prepare warning after warning, and they get independent warnings about the dangers of some of the programs and the inherent flaws in them, yet they do not bring them to the minister’s attention. There is a grotesque failure of policy process somewhere. Who is going to wear the responsibility for it? According to the Rudd government ministers and to Mr Rudd, who endorses as first-rate the minister who has prevailed over that particular disaster, no-one is going to wear responsibility. It is a shameful day.
These bills exemplify once again the lack of substance, the bluster, the falsehoods, the misleading promises and the empty rhetoric that this government has come to typify. In fact, I think it actually represents a disdain in many ways for the Australian people. When it comes to an election the Australian people render their choices based on what politicians say and on their track record. Unfortunately in Mr Rudd’s case they did not have a great track record to assess. They had his track record in Queensland which was hushed up. I remember when Senator Joyce tried to table some documents regarding Mr Rudd’s contribution in the Heiner affair in Queensland. The Labor Party would not allow us to do that because they did not want Mr Rudd’s track record to come under scrutiny.
The Australian people believed in what Mr Rudd said because he was Kevin and he was from Queensland. We have discovered that Mr Rudd does not have the same integrity as many of my colleagues from Queensland. We have found that Mr Rudd was prepared to do anything and say anything and blame anyone just to get into power. When he got into power he did not know what to do. He honestly has not known what to do, so he has stumbled from one failure to another. He has presided over one policy failure to another, from one broken promise to another broken promise, and the Australian people are getting very tired of it. Some of the programs that, of course, Mr Rudd has implemented—and I have spoken about a couple of them—have been mired in abject failure, yet he then has the hide to try and blame the opposition, or the minor parties or the states. It is always the blame game. He is always going to blame someone else. I seem to recall some more rhetoric in the wind about ‘the buck will stop with me’. It is time to end the blame game, particularly in health.
Not content with failing to implement the programs he said he would, the Prime Minister now wants to implement policies that he said he would not. This is the very crux of this matter. Mr Rudd and his team have an ideological hatred of private health insurance. They want to get people out of private health insurance and onto the teat of government because that means there will be a bigger bureaucracy—bigger government with people reliant on that government. It is the wrong way to go, but that is what this legislation does. This is another stick—a stick which will beat families in this country. It is going to cost them a lot of money every single year, for what purpose? So that this government can continue to spend irresponsibly. Deep in your heart, Madam Acting Deputy President Hurley, you know I am right. You know I am right and the Australian people know I am right. We have never seen such an abject waste of money and such wanton expenditure with so little to show for it. I should now say, Mr Acting Deputy President McGauran, deep in your heart, you too know I am right.
This government is now struggling to make a positive agenda for the Australian people. It is clearly only seeking to prop up its own re-election. How can it do that? The government’s attitude is: ‘Let’s target those people who don’t support our ideology,’ meaning those who do not support big government. ‘Let’s target those people who want to get on with their own lives and want to take responsibility for themselves. Let’s target those people who have built Australia, let’s penalise and punish them. Why do we do it? So that we can take money into our coffers and hand it out to those we deem worthy.’
The Australian people are worthy of a fair go. They are worthy of being given incentives to do the right thing and when we have a hospital system which is so clearly struggling—and it is struggling—why would we be pursuing any sort of measure which will increase demand on the Australian hospital system? Make no mistake: these bills, which we are discussing now, and a bill which will come up later, are absolutely related. These bills are trying to pre-empt the consequences of their own policy, which they are going to introduce later today or perhaps later this week. It is time for this government to come clean with the Australian people. It is better to fess up and say, ‘We really haven’t got a clue what we’re doing. We’ve spent far too much money but now we’re in a big hole and we need to get ourselves out of it. Can you help us?’ Who knows? The coalition might help the government to try to rectify the mess.
The greatest help we could give the Australian people would be to be re-elected later this year because another term of the Rudd government means another three years of waste, of dysfunction, of ego and of hubris unforeseen—you cannot imagine how they strut the corridors of power in this place, strutting around thinking they are the masters of the universe. They are not the masters of the universe. They are servants of the Australian people and they are failing the Australian people at every single turn. It is time to restore some balance and harmony into this place. It is time to restore some balance and harmony among the Australian people so that those who need help will get it, but the government are not intent on helping anyone except themselves.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-02-22,"—I have said it before and I say it again: the Rudd Labor government has been an absolute failure in the health portfolio. The Rudd Labor government has been a complete and utter failure in the health portfolio. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, is a very lucky lady. There is so much incompetence in the Rudd Labor government right now with Minister Garrett and Minister Conroy and all the incompetence around that she is able to hide under this carpet of incompetence. If it were not for Minister Garrett and Minister Conroy and if it were not for some of the others who are performing disastrously in the administration of public policy, surely Minister Roxon would be under some very serious pressure.
Before the last election, the Rudd Labor government promised the world in health. They promised the world and they have delivered next to nothing. They overpromised; they have underdelivered; it was all talk and no action. Before the last election, we were told that only Labor had a plan to fix public hospitals, yet after the election did we see the implementation of any semblance of a plan? No, we did not. We got a 20-month review and even after that review made recommendations, we now have a review into the review and a series of photo opportunities around Australia for the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister. There has been not one decision, just bureaucratic reviews into the never-never. No doubt, just as we now have the promise to take Japan to court in November over whaling, we will get an announcement in the next little while as to what Labor would do should the Australian people be unfortunate enough for Labor to be re-elected to government at the next election.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I put you on notice. You should take a very careful look at what comes out of the Rudd Labor government in the next few months. I would not be surprised if we get another promise and the Australian people are asked to take the government on trust moving forward. Our message to the Australian people is that you cannot trust a single thing that is being said on health by the Rudd Labor government. With federalism on health we were promised that the buck would stop with the Prime Minister, but what have we seen? The states and territories have been giving the Rudd Labor government the run-around. Kevin Rudd is now using the states and territories as an excuse as to why they are not able to follow through on some of the premises they made before the last election.
We had the most emphatic promise from the Rudd Labor government that it would maintain the existing private health insurance policy framework. The Rudd Labor government told us and the Australian people that it would retain the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 45 per cent rebates for older Australians. Kevin Rudd must have thought this was a pretty important promise to make in order to win the election in 2007 because, four days before that election, on 20 November 2007, as the then Leader of the Opposition, he wrote a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association and gave an absolutely ironclad commitment. He must have thought he needed to do that in order to win some votes. Why else would the Leader of the Opposition bother to write a letter to a gentleman called Dr Michael Armitage, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Insurance Association? If Kevin Rudd did not think it was important to win some votes and if he did not think the people of Australia thought it was important, why would he have bothered to write the letter four days before the last election? Of course he thought it was going to help him win votes and to conduct what we now know to be an absolute deception.
Nicola Roxon, the shadow minister for health and ageing, not to be outdone, confirmed the opposition’s commitment to the private health insurance rebate and then went a step further. She accused those of us who were questioning the sincerity of Labor’s commitment to the private health insurance rebate of running a scare campaign. She put out a press release in the lead-up to the election, on 26 September 2007, which stated:
... Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
                         …                   …                   …
The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.’
Then came the clincher:
The Howard government will do anything and say anything to get elected.
We know that it was the Rudd Labor opposition, now the Rudd Labor government, that was prepared to say and do anything in order to get elected. There has very clearly been a fraud committed on the Australian people, the voting public, across Australia.
The deception of Labor has continued in government. After the election of the Rudd Labor government, we thought we had better check that what it said before the election was indeed what was happening after the election. The officials sitting in the advisers’ box would well remember that at estimates after estimates we asked questions of the government, trying to find out whether it was committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. As late as 24 February 2009, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, said that the government was ‘firmly committed’ to retaining existing private health insurance rebates. We found out that, while the minister was making that statement on the public record, officers of her department, at her instruction, were working up the proposal that we are debating in this chamber today. This is deception at its worst. The government is taking the Australian people for mugs. This is bad public policy—and I will get to the argument about why it is bad public policy. However, what is really offensive about this legislation is the absolute brazenness of the Rudd Labor government in setting out in a premeditated way to deceive the Australian people.
We are debating this legislation the wrong way around. I understand why the government now wants to deal with the Orwellian named Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. These bills are nothing more and nothing less than consequential bills to try to mitigate some of the impacts of what the government’s legislation is really about. What the government really wants to do is reduce or scrap the private health insurance rebate for millions of Australians. What the government really wants to do is run its ideological attack on private health insurance irrespective of the pressure this will put on public hospitals, irrespective of what it will do to our health system, irrespective of what it will mean in terms of fewer people having private health insurance and irrespective of what it will mean for private health insurance premiums moving forward. The objective that the government is pursuing is to reduce or scrap private health insurance rebates.
We are dealing here with an attempt by the government to stop those people who will see significant increases in the cost of their private health insurance as a direct result of this legislation from leaving private health insurance. When we were in government, we introduced a package of carrot-and-stick reforms to support Australians taking additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance. The government wants to reduce the value of the carrot and to increase the cost of the stick. As Senator Fierravanti-Wells said, this legislation is nothing but an additional tax hike—something that the government never said before the last election that they would do.
This legislation comes on top of previous changes made by the government to private health insurance policy arrangements. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would remember that Labor made changes to the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds in its first budget, even though it said before the election and then confirmed after the election that it would not. In its first budget, it went ahead with changes to the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds. The Rudd Labor government’s initial proposals were for a reduction of about $960 million in expenditure on private health insurance rebates on the basis that it and Treasury had expected 644,000 fewer Australians to have private hospital insurance than would have been the case before those changes. I remind the chamber that, a year and a half ago, the government set out with those changes to take $3.2 billion out of the health system. The government aimed to save $960 million in private health insurance rebates because rebates would no longer have to be paid to people who walked out of private health insurance or who did not take it up. There was going to be $3.2 billion less in resources for our health system as a direct result of what the government was doing.
The opposition did not support the decision that was ultimately made by the Senate, but at least the Senate forced the government to water down those changes somewhat. Still, according to the government’s own figures, that initial change was going to result in a $740 million saving over the forward estimates in spending on the private health insurance rebates. So the government already has to spend significantly less on the private health insurance rebate compared to what it promised before the election and compared to what would have been the expected expenditure when it decided on making its commitment to retaining the existing rebates. Furthermore, by saving $740 million on not paying the rebate to those people who will leave private health insurance or those people who will not take it up, the government has already taken $2½ billion out of the health system as a result of about 500,000 fewer people having private health insurance.
We have got to remind ourselves at this point that, while this is going on, the government is doing nothing to fix public hospitals, other than having reviews that go for months and months and pursuing broken promises. The government is spending billions and billions of dollars recklessly, whether it is $2½ billion on pink batts or $14 billion on Julia Gillard memorial halls—you name it. Billions and billions of dollars of reckless spending and who is being asked to pay the price? It is people across Australia who need timely and affordable access to quality hospital care and people across Australia who are making a sacrifice every year by taking out private health insurance, by taking additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs. They are the people that this cold-hearted government wants to pay the price for its reckless spending on ill-fated and dangerous insulation across Australia, for waste and mismanagement as part of the Julia Gillard memorial halls program and for $900 cheques to people overseas, to dead people and to people in jail. That is what this government is all about.
As I have mentioned, the effect of this package of bills very clearly will be that fewer people will have private health insurance. There will be upward pressure on the cost of private health insurance, which again will see more people leave. All of this will put additional pressure on our public hospitals, and of course we go back into this old-fashioned, Labor Party induced vicious circle in our health system. I just remind the chamber, as I have reminded it before, that the Labor Party have got form on this. When the Labor Party get into government, they attack people with private health insurance. In so doing, they put our health system out of balance. The policy challenge for us is to ensure we have got a health policy framework and a health system in which all Australians can have timely and affordable access to quality hospital care, and the best way to achieve it is through a well-balanced, mixed health system with both a strong and well-funded public system and a strong and well-supported private system. When Labor were last in government, they did exactly this sort of stuff. They pulled these sorts of stunts and the proportion of Australians with private health insurance went down from about 63 per cent to about 30 per cent before we were able to turn it around.
Labor today will tell you: ‘It has not happened. You said all these terrible things would happen last time.’ Never mind that it was Treasury estimates which predicted that 644,000 fewer people would be in private health insurance as a result of these changes. Never mind that these changes do not happen within 24 hours of legislation having being passed through this chamber, as much as Labor might like it to be otherwise. When we got into government in 1996, it took two or three years before our changes started to take effect too. What I am concerned about is that, if this Senate were to allow the Rudd Labor government to continue with these sorts of terrible broken promises, which will make it harder for Australians to afford private health insurance, then we will see very, very bad consequences for our health system moving forward—maybe not immediately, within 24 hours of passing the change, but over time, because that is what happens with social policy changes.
Of course, we did propose a better alternative to this. We proposed to increase the excise on tobacco by 12½ per cent, which would have raised about $2.2 billion over the forward estimates, according to Treasury evidence at estimates, which is about $300 million more than the $1.9 billion the government is trying to save through this measure over the forward estimates. This happens to be consistent with one of the recommendations from the National Preventative Health Taskforce—another one of those reviews that the government has left in a cupboard somewhere, which it received at the end of June last year and which nothing has happened with since. It is one of those many reviews that the Rudd government is so good at instigating but without taking any action as a consequence. Has the government taken on board that very constructive suggestion that we have made? Of course not—silence.
This is not about saving $1.9 billion. If it were about saving money, the government would not have been out there wasting billions and billions of dollars on dangerous home insulation programs; they would not have wasted billions and billions of dollars on Julia Gillard memorial halls to replace school buildings that were perfectly functioning and perfectly okay. This is about an ideological war which the Labor Party has been pursuing for decades against people with private health insurance. It is about an ideological war against those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs. It is about wanting to put the health system out of balance. It is about destroying private health insurance; that is what this is all about. That is why the Rudd Labor government never even entertained the alternative that we put forward.
Here we are, with the first piece of legislation to come back after the House of Representatives passed legislation relating to the greatest moral challenge of our time, the flawed ETS, and we are dealing with this broken promise instead of dealing with the emissions trading scheme. Where is the emissions trading scheme on the list? It is way down, and I suspect that the Labor Party, in its caucus, is getting increasing uncomfortable about the lack of popularity and the fact that people across Australia are starting to understand what a dog of a scheme the ETS is, that great big new tax which Labor wants to impose on everyone.
Why are we dealing with this now, even though the government already knows that it does not have the support of the Senate for it? The reason we are dealing with it is politics as the government just wants to collect another double dissolution trigger. This is not about health, this is not about doing the right thing by our health system and this is not about making sure the people across Australia can have timely and affordable access to quality hospital care. This is about the Rudd Labor government’s political strategy. It is about covering up that it is all talk and no action; it is about running away because it wants to try to get away from the impact of the emissions trading scheme. I am sure that right now behind the scenes in the Prime Minister’s office there are people—the hollowmen of the Prime Minister’s office—plotting and scheming how they can get their heads out of the noose as far as the emissions trading scheme is concerned.
We are dealing with a blatant broken promise. We are dealing with a bad, bad, bad public policy measure which will be bad for our health system. We are dealing with something that the Rudd Labor government promised emphatically before the last election it would not do. At the same time, the government has done absolutely nothing to deal with the many challenges of our health system. I say it again—and I conclude on this point: before the last election the government promised the world in health. Only Labor, according to the Prime Minister, had a plan to fix public hospitals. Prime Minister, where is your plan? When are you going to start implementing it? When are you going to start making decisions that will actually improve things in our public hospitals rather than pursuing this blatant, offensive, broken promise which will make things worse in our health system, not better? We are all waiting to see it. When you finally get around to making a decision about the review you had better make sure that there is some tangible action—some real decisions—rather than yet another bureaucratic process on the never-never. The people of Australia were promised that there would be some tangible improvements to our health system. So far, all they have had will make things worse. It is time that we got some real action rather than talk in the health portfolio.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-22,"—I am pleased to join my colleagues in this debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2] to strenuously oppose this latest cash grab by the Rudd government. The Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, in a letter he wrote on 20 November 2007, just a few days before the last election, said to Dr Michael Armitage, the CEO of the Australian Health Insurance Association:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
That seemed to me to be a rock-solid guarantee, in writing, that Mr Rudd would not be doing what he is doing in this bill. I ask Senator Sherry, representing the government in this debate, what it is that allows Mr Rudd to make a rock-solid written promise like that and break it with impunity.
On the first day back in this sitting of parliament we are debating a broken promise, a broken commitment, by Mr Rudd. Instead, one would have thought we should have been debating the greatest moral challenge of our time. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will remember that Mr Rudd called his Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme the greatest moral challenge of all time. Yet, if it is such a challenge, why are we not debating that this week? Why are we instead debating a broken commitment, a commitment made in writing by the Prime Minister just before the last election? I note in passing that the list of speakers is pretty short when it comes to the participation of Labor senators in this debate. I can well understand their reluctance and reticence to get involved in this debate. Which Labor senator would want to promote a bill that is a direct breaking of a written promise by their leader just a couple of days before the last federal election? I can well understand why Labor senators are running for cover in this debate. It seems incredible and improbable to me that, instead of debating the greatest moral challenge of our time, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, we are here today debating the breaking of a direct written commitment by Mr Rudd just before the last election.
Labor’s manifest inadequacies in health administration are many and varied. Wherever you look around the public policy area you can see Labor has failed in health as it has failed in economic management. During this debate I want to mention to senators an experience I have personally had in the way the Labor government has messed up pathology tests. You will recall that in the last budget the government took $180 million off pathology tests. Senators may know that in 1996 I had open-heart surgery and had my aortic valve replaced with a plastic one. To keep my heart operating and to keep me alive, I have to keep my blood thin, which means I take Warfarin every day. To make sure the Warfarin is properly adjusted, I have regular pathology tests. For the last 13 years I have had a pathology test every three or four weeks at no charge. Now under the Rudd Labor government it is going to cost me $40 a time to stay alive. That is not too bad for me—perhaps I can afford it—but there are many of my constituents who simply cannot afford the $40 a time under Labor.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2010-02-22,"—I seek to add to an answer that I gave to the Senate today in question time concerning the hiring practices of the NBN Corporation. I have to apologise to Mr Quigley for misrepresenting the evidence that he gave in Senate estimates. As is common industry practice, senior roles at the NBN Corporation have been sourced through a combination of searches by recruitment firms and referrals. As Mr Quigley told Senate estimates, 40 per cent of NBN staff have been hired on a referral basis. I am advised that no-one has been hired without an interview—for example, as I have stated publicly, Mike Kaiser was interviewed three times before he was offered the position, twice by the head of human resources and once by Mr Quigley.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Minchin) and Senators Fisher and Ronaldson today relating to the proposed national broadband network and to the proposed commercial television rebate.
Only in a government led by Mr Rudd could two ministers who have so clearly demonstrated their incompetence, carelessness and confusion continue in office. We all know now that Mr Garrett should not be in the position that he is in. But quickly Senator Conroy is overtaking Mr Garrett as the minister who should do Australia and his government a favour by resigning from office. Today we have had a very clear example of Senator Conroy’s unsuitableness for the job that he currently holds as the communications minister.
Can you imagine the minister, who of course employed Mr Quigley as the NBN chief, sidling up to Mr Quigley and saying: ‘Oh, look, there’s a mate of mine in the Labor Party in Queensland who might be good for the job of government relations person. I don’t know what you’re offering for the job, but perhaps you should have a talk to him’? Can you believe that Senator Conroy did not have any idea of what the salary might be when he recommended Mr Kaiser for the job? Certainly no sound or reasonable person could possibly believe what Senator Conroy has said about that.
In spite of Senator Conroy’s clarification after question time, it is incredible that a government with this sort of operation would allow 40 per cent of its jobs not to be advertised—not to be open to selection in the normal manner. As Senator Minchin pointed out with his question, this company is paying wages on average in the $350-$400,000 market, and the people being appointed are not being properly assessed, unless you class membership of the Labor Party—membership of the upper echelons of the Labor regimes in Queensland and New South Wales—as a qualification for the job.
It interests me why a government company wholly set up by the government needs a government relations man at a $450,000 salary. The company is the government. Why does it need a government relations person? I would love Senator Conroy to explain that. In addition, not only has Senator Conroy failed with those insider jobs in NBN Co. but the NBN is grossly out of time. Nothing has happened apart from a sod turning up in Mount Isa that will mean nothing. The legislation that Senator Conroy told us was so critical to deal with before Christmas last year did not even reach the Senate chamber last year. We are in the third week of the Senate’s sitting this year and still we have no indication of when that bill will be brought before the Senate.
We then saw the scandal almost of Senator Conroy’s ski holiday in a flash resort in the United States, where he met with one of the major free-to-air television networks and not long after that, low and behold, there is a $250 million gift to those free-to-air TV companies. For all these reasons, one would think that Mr Rudd would have some concern, some real sense of risk, about the efficacy of this minister, as with Minister Garrett. It seems that the NBN saga goes from bad to worse. Senator Conroy promised us the implementation study before the end of February this year. We are waiting. We are getting close to the end of February. We learned just recently at Senate estimates that that study—which will explain everything, as Senator Conroy has said before—may not ever be made public. On all these grounds, Senator Conroy should do the right thing by his government and by Australia and resign.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Broadband</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2010-02-22,"—I find it unbelievable that here we have the coalition raising the issues of incompetence, carelessness and confusion on the floor of this chamber in a debate to take note of answers at question time when we have the most incompetent, careless and confused economic spokesperson that we have ever seen in this place, appointed by the Leader of the Opposition, in Senator Barnaby Joyce. Do not come here talking about incompetence, carelessness and confusion. How about your leader handing over the reins of the public purse to the National Party? What an absolute joke.
—Mr Deputy President, a point of order on relevance: the question was clearly directed to answers given by Senator Conroy today. Senator Cameron is way, way off the mark.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: firstly, it is the custom that debates do range widely on these questions in take note debates. Secondly, the argument put is an attack on the proposition put initially by Senator Macdonald and therefore relevance has been established. I understand there may be some sensitivity but, frankly, the questions raised in relation to competence of a minister can be answered in this debate by questioning, alternatively, the competence of a shadow minister.
—I have been listening very carefully to what Senator Cameron has been saying. I take your point, Senator O’Brien, that we do allow the debate to range quite widely. But, Senator Cameron, I remind you that we are taking note of answers given by Senator Conroy today and I will listen carefully as you continue. There is no point of order.
—Thank you. This is quite clearly part of the attack by the coalition on the government’s stimulus package—a package that was put in place and of which NBN Co. is an integral part and a package that underpins 210,000 jobs in the Australian economy. NBN Co. is part of an initiative that will bring high-speed broadband to this country—high-speed broadband that the coalition could never deliver, high-speed broadband that is important for the productivity of this country and high-speed broadband that is being delivered by Senator Conroy and this government. The key issue here is whether we can deliver real improvements in productivity to this country and do it in a manner in which you were never able to in 11½ years of government. Your economic incompetence left this government a clean-up job of monumental proportions.
You failed on broadband, you failed on productivity, you failed on environmental issues and you failed to make sure this country was equipped to deal with the challenges of international competition and international downturns like we have had in the global financial crisis—a mob of failures across the chamber. You can change your leader, but you were a rabble before Christmas, you have a new leader now and you are still a rabble after Christmas. There is absolutely no way attacking NBN Co. is going to give you any credibility, because your credibility on economic performance is down the tubes.
Australians know that those opposite sat back for 11½ years and failed to deliver. They failed to deliver on the economy, they failed to deliver for young people and they failed to deliver for the future of this country. That is their record. And yet, when we are faced with the global financial crisis, and we take steps to make sure that we are in a position of strength for the future, including establishing broadband throughout this country, what do we get? We get carping about the wages of the executives of NBN Co. I never hear any carping from the other side when it is your big business mates taking $10 million a year out of their shareholders’ back pockets. I don’t hear any of this hypocrisy and argument then; it is all very quiet. Remember, you were also very quiet until your leader, Tony Abbott—
—Mr Abbott.
—Mr Abbott, sorry—had a meeting with Rupert Murdoch. Then we hear what is going on. It is all quiet on the Western Front from the coalition. Then along comes Rupert—knock, knock: ‘Mr Abbott, come and talk to me.’ And what do we get? The next day we are in here defending Mr Murdoch’s interests! Look after the big end of town. We know how you lot perform: look after your rich and powerful mates; don’t worry about the people in Tasmania who are going to get high-speed broadband for the first time— (Time expired)

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2010-02-22,"—I rise to take note of answers given in question time today by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy—in particular, the minister’s failure to convince the Senate and the Australian people of the government’s capacity to deliver on its $43 billion promise to build a National Broadband Network. After all, why should we doubt Minister Conroy’s say so? Why should we and the Australian people doubt it, when all that the Rudd Labor government has done so far is bungle their spending programs? NBN round 1, worth some $4.7 billion—abandoned; $30 million wasted on a bungled tender process, $17 million of it from the public purse and $13 million of it from the private purse. NBN round 1: abandoned.
Then we have $2.7 billion spent on the home insulation program, which Minister Garrett, until last Friday, hailed as a success. Of course, last Friday Minister Garrett suspended the supposedly successful program. The home insulation program—HIP—becomes decidedly un-hip: $2.7 billion on a now-suspended home insulation program. It was decidedly un-hip expenditure of Australian taxpayers’ money. And there was the $175 million proposed for the Green Loans Program. The Green Loans Program was rewritten.
So why should Australians have gained any confidence from Minister Conroy’s answers in this place today as to the government’s capacity to deliver on the $43 billion National Broadband Network, when NBN round 1, worth $4.7 billion, was abandoned; $2.7 billion on the home insulation program was suspended; and the $175 million Green Loans Program was rewritten? How on earth are the Australian people expected to have any confidence that the government will deliver on a $43 billion taxpayer spend? That is particularly so when, as Senator Macdonald reminded us, in estimates Senator Conroy failed to tell the Australian people that the government will release and make public the much-awaited implementation study for the National Broadband Network—the implementation study to which Minister Conroy has shot home the answers to life, the universe and everything.
Who is going to get what? When are they going to get it? How are they going to get it? How much will they have to pay for it? And now, what confidence can the Australian people have that the technology, once delivered, will not be outdated? After all, the recent results from Telstra show that Australians are moving more quickly than even Telstra could anticipate from fixed-line services and fixed-line broadband to something else. And yet we have a proposal from the government that no, in about eight to 10 years time they will deliver fixed broadband, in the main, when the rest of the world, including Australians, are voting with their hard lines and going mobile. As Alan Kohler said:
Telstra’s revenue from its copper network is collapsing faster than anyone expected, and faster than the company can make up …
Simon Molloy, analyst, commented in the Australian Financial Review last Friday:
You never know where the turning points are until they’ve gone past.
            …         …         …
Communications users are voting with their dollars for mobility.
That means wireless.
So, Minister, please commit to making the implementation study public, for the sake of the Australian people’s belief in this government’s capacity to deliver anything substantial with respect to their promised $43 billion National Broadband Network, particularly in the face of the aborting of NBN round 1 and the suspension of the so-called home insulation program.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2010-02-22,"—I rise to take note of answers provided by Minister Conroy in today’s question time, specifically in relation to the commercial television broadcaster licence fee rebate. The position that has been put by those opposite today makes one wonder whether they do not actually understand the pressures facing the Australian free-to-air television sector and the importance of the sector or whether, in reality, they just do not care.
The rationale for the commercial television broadcaster licence fee rebate in 2010 and 2011 is the protection of Australian content on commercial television. A rebate of 33 per cent will apply to licence fees payable on revenue earned during the period 1 January to 31 December 2010 and a rebate of 50 per cent will apply to licence fees payable on revenue earned during the period 1 January to 31 December 2011.
The government makes no apology for saying that it will protect Australian content on commercial television. This will be done by offering licence fee rebates to broadcasters in 2010 and 2011. The rebate recognises the importance of the Australian content standard in ensuring TV audiences have strong levels of Australian programming. The rebate is also a recognition of the current level of licence fees in Australia compared with those in other countries such as the US, the UK and Canada and of the new technology and commercial challenges facing the sector, including the switch to digital television. This initiative builds on the government’s increase in funding to national broadcasters ABC and SBS in the 2009-10 budget to fund more Australian content. The Australian content standard requires commercial television broadcasters to produce and screen a certain percentage of Australian content, including 55 per cent of total transmission between 6 am and midnight seven days per week. It also provides for the production of Australian drama and children’s programming.
As Australia commences the switch to digital television this year, the commercial television broadcasters will play a key role in delivering the full suite of digital services across Australia. The rebates are just one part of a package of measures designed to address the structural changes facing free-to-air television at a time when media consumption habits are changing because of the rise of the internet and we are making the switch to digital television. The government’s decision to offer a temporary rebate on licence fees recognises the pressures facing free-to-air television broadcasters. Analysts have recognised that free-to-air television is undergoing a significant structural decline. In the face of structural changes and the arrival of the converged media environment, it is important that the government protect Australian content.
As the minister said today, local production is expensive; it costs around $800,000 to produce an hour of Packed to the Rafters or Underbelly. In contrast, it costs only around $100,000 to buy an hour of Two and a Half Men. PBL Media’s chief executive noted in today’s Australian newspaper that local production is expensive and that it can be turned on and turned off. He says:
We can definitely say the licence fee relief has contributed to Nine planning more confidently for more local entertainment and drama production this year and next and in 2011-12.
It will also ensure jobs for Australian actors. It is significant that in Australia we are providing for those skilled performers who will put their faces on Australian television.
Broadcasters will be required to meet their legislated local content quotas in order to receive the rebate. (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-02-22,"—I rise to take note of answers from Senator Conroy. In doing so, I refer to Senator Conroy’s actions in January, when he had a personal holiday in Colorado. He said on the public record that it was a private holiday ‘which was fully paid for by me’; yet it was revealed in the media yesterday, thanks to the good investigative journalism of Ellen Whinnett at the Sunday Herald Sun, that Kerry Stokes, billionaire businessman and part owner of Channel 7, actually provided Senator Conroy with a free lift pass. Of what value that was, I do not know, but it was paid for by Mr Stokes. Of course, this was just a month before Senator Conroy, on behalf of the federal Labor government, announced a $250 million tax cut to the free-to-air television operators.
Let’s put it on the table, let’s come clean: let’s say exactly what happened, when it happened and why it happened. What was Mr Stokes trying to gain by offering this free pass and what was Senator Conroy doing in accepting a gift of this nature in the ritzy resort in Colorado? These are questions that need to be answered, and Minister Conroy should come clean. We have already seen the example of Mike Kaiser’s $450,000 special deal as ‘government relations advisor’ for the rollout of the government’s new entity, NBN Co. In my view, it smacks of cronyism. It smacks of special deals; it smacks of special jobs for special mates.
This is the type of government we have in Australia today. It is not good enough. The public do not like it. So many promises have been made that have now been broken. We have seen so much waste of taxpayers’ money. The public are now starting to see through the spin and that there is no substance. This is the minister responsible for $30 million in a botched NBN rollout tender. The tender process went on for months and months and in the end had to be cancelled. Seventeen million dollars of that, of course, was directly in taxpayers’ money and the other $13-odd million was the tenderers putting in their best effort. The minister knew early on that the process was flawed but allowed it to continue, again abusing the process and abusing taxpayers’ money.
We have had the examples of GROCERYchoice, with nearly $10 million wasted, of the Fuelwatch debacle and of the NBN rollout tender debacle, with $30 million wasted. We have had promises like, ‘Let’s fix the public hospital system by 30 June 2009’—and what has happened? Nothing. No delivery on that promise. We have had the GP superclinics promised; they have not been delivered. The childcare places in schools have not been delivered. This is a government of empty promises. You have had the promise to cut back on consultancy fees. They are now at a record of over $1 billion over the two years of the government. They promised to cut it back $400 million. This government is a disgrace and the waste and mismanagement must stop.
On the NBN rollout in Tasmania, Senator Conroy said they were on time. What a joke! He was in Georgetown, Northern Tasmania in April last year with the full fanfare and the Premier announcing that broadband was to be rolled out in July 2009. They are one year late, and he is trying to make the case that they are on time. It is a joke. There is no business plan for Tasmania. They say it is an estimated $700 million, but they will not come clean. They are not answering questions I have on notice in the Senate demanding that they say who is paying for that $700 million—whether it is the state or federal government. We still do not know the cost to the user or the consumer. We do not know the take-up rate. There is a lack of consultation with businesses and local government on which towns will be benefited and which ones will be kept out. Ninety-five per cent of the aerial connections will be above ground. We have no contracts with the ISP; they were meant to be announced by March, so they have got eight days to do that; and there are no offers to the public. Really, the government have to come clean and advise the public or this is clearly more waste and mismanagement. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-02-22,"—It gives me a deal of pleasure to speak to this, although I have to say it gives me a deal of concern that we have to deal with an issue as serious as the government’s process of changing the protocols to allow beef imports from countries that have had mad cow disease. As we heard during question time and as we have heard over the last week or so, the manner in which the government goes about its process of dealing with reform and the inadequacies of that have been clearly demonstrated again through this process. Right from the commencement of this process the government was asking industry to keep this a secret. The government did not want its constituency to know and it desperately did not want the opposition to know what was going on. In fact, it asked industry not to talk to the opposition about it and industry, disappointingly, was compliant. I think that it has lived to regret that because it has been proven since, through revelations during the Senate inquiry, that the industry was largely being led by the nose by the government on this.
It has been put to the parliament, the industry and the Australian people that this is an issue about food safety and the safety of Australia’s food supply. That is clearly a very serious and legitimate concern that all Australians should have. We heard a range of evidence during the Senate inquiry about the potential impacts—some concerns were raised as late as this morning—but what we really know about this is that it is about trade. We know that it has been driven by the Trade portfolio, we know that countries have been pushing Australia to change its protocols through the Trade portfolio for some period of time and we know that countries, particularly the United States, desperately want to take part of our market share—particularly markets like Japan and Korea.
Prior to the initial outbreak of BSE in the United States in 2003, Australia shared, by roughly one-third, the beef market in Japan. It was shared between Australia, the United States and the Japanese market itself. About one-third of the beef came from Australia, one-third came from the United States and one-third came from Japan. A little bit of it came from New Zealand, which has a similar reputation to Australia. What happened when the BSE outbreak occurred was that 50 per cent of that market went to Australia, 50 per cent went to Japan and a little bit remained with New Zealand.
The performance of the industry representative groups through this process has been abysmal. The performance by the Cattle Council of Australia this morning was one of the worst I have seen at a parliamentary inquiry for a long time, and I have seen a lot of Senate inquiries in relation to the beef industry in my eight years here. The performance this morning was really very disappointing, but the performance of the government was too. As I have said, it has tried to keep this quiet. Nobody has seen the provisions yet. This measure is supposed to start on Monday. We still do not know what the protocols are going to be for importing beef into Australia. We were told this morning that, hopefully, we will find out this afternoon or perhaps tomorrow. Tell me: under what circumstance is that a reasonable period of time for this parliament to scrutinise it or for the industry itself to scrutinise it?
The government has gone to every possible measure that it could find to avoid putting this through a process that has scrutiny of the parliament. It is using a measure that does not go to the Senate and does not go to the House of Representatives. It cannot be disallowed by this parliament if it is proven that it is a problem, and yet industry leaders this morning said, ‘We just hope that the government does what we’ve asked it to do.’ That is what they are saying: ‘We trust that it’ll do what we want it to do.’ I do not know how you could actually trust the government to do what the industry has asked it to do. This whole process has been cloaked in secrecy. If you look at what this government has done to the agricultural sector since it has been in government, you would have to seriously question whether it would actually do what the industry has asked it to do. We have seen it buying water, but it will not put any money towards upgrading infrastructure; we have seen an abysmal performance with respect to releasing its drought review; we have seen it taking grasslands off farmers without consultation. It has done a whole range of things and yet the industry has been quite happy to sit there and say, ‘We hope that the government will do what we have asked it to do.’ The industry has not seen the regulations. None of us have seen the regulations. We have asked; we asked this morning. The way that this has been managed is an absolute disgrace. This is all about creating the perception of equality in Australia’s primary produce with other countries and them attempting to attack our markets.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2010-02-22,"—I wish to make a contribution to the debate today. Before I start, I just want to take Senator Colbeck to task on his accusation about an abysmal performance by the Cattle Council. I have to be really honest: the abysmal performance was from opposition senators on the attack—like hyenas hunting in a pack, screaming and carrying on. There was the calling of names and interjecting while witnesses were trying to give answers—not you, Senator Colbeck, but your colleague’s performance was damn disgraceful.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Sterle, address the chair, please.
—I will, Mr Deputy President. I apologise. Through the chair, I was certainly not aiming those accusations at Senator Colbeck, because Senator Colbeck does not stoop to such low performances in Senate hearings as some of Senator Colbeck’s colleagues are renowned for. The attack on Mr Greg Brown from the Cattle Council was absolutely pathetic. We are talking about—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Sterle will be heard in silence.

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—Got a guilty conscience, have you? You’ll get your turn.
—Order! Most of those interjecting on my left I see are on the speakers list, so I would ask them to wait until their turn comes.
—As I was saying, when I asked Mr Greg Brown from the Cattle Council if he had been a producer for long, he said, ‘All his life.’ He is fourth generation. To suggest that Mr Brown or others representing the beef industry are going to destroy a multibillion dollar export industry I find abysmal. What we have had is an absolute scare campaign run by the opposition. There has been so much misinformation out there in the media. Every time we have a hearing or something, we see certain reporters from a certain paper in New South Wales called the Land and—lo and behold!—out echoes all the opposition senators’ comments and statements. The scare campaign is absolutely amazing.

Senator Nash interjecting—

—If you have a problem with that—through you, Mr Deputy President—the chair of the committee, Senator Nash, will make her contribution later. We need to get back to the facts.
Back in 2001 the Australian government—the previous Howard government—introduced the blanket ban on the domestic sale of beef and beef products from any country that had a confirmed case of BSE. We know that. The policy was implemented with the best available science at the time. The science was conservative, to say the least, and the need for the policy to be reviewed was certainly acknowledged. Since 2001 the science has improved significantly and our understanding of BSE has developed enormously. It is now scientifically evident that BSE cannot—I repeat, cannot—be introduced into Australia simply through the importation of beef. This means that the risk to human and animal health can no longer be the reason to prevent the importation of beef. The Australian beef industry understood the new science and it, the industry, has urged the government to make the change in policy. The government went through a very rigorous and thorough consultation process—
—Bulldust! You’re joking!
—including with key representatives of the Australian beef industry and the relevant major health organisations. It is very clear that the vast majority of the Australian beef industry support the change in policy—the vast majority.
—Three hundred out of 200,000 have been consulted!
—Senator Heffernan!
—The Red Meat Advisory Council, known as RMAC, is the peak body for the Australian beef industry. RMAC has as its members the Australian Meat Industry Council, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, the Australian Lot Feeders Association and the Australian Livestock Exporters Council. RMAC, the peak body, said:
The Federal Government’s decision to modernise Australia’s import policy as it relates to beef and beef products is scientifically justifiable and supported by industry.
They went on to say:
Until this change, Australia stood out from the international trading community as having an outdated policy developed at a time when scientific knowledge was significantly less than it is today. With the rigorous application of the new rules Australia will continue being recognised as a Negligible BSE Risk country and enjoying the level of trade this has traditionally brought.
There you have it. The peak industry body, RMAC, has put in on the record that they have written to relevant ministers supporting the policy change. They have also issued media releases and written pieces for the rural papers. The industry’s position represents the vast majority of the industry.
—Garbage!
—There is one very small body that does not represent many people.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Through you, Mr Deputy President, those on the other side of the chamber will have their turn here and they will continue the mistruths and the misrepresentations and say how they are the gatekeepers to everything rural and agricultural in Australia. I find it amazing: about the only time the coalition come together is when they are going to attack a government policy. I would like to be in the party room and hear what really goes on in there. As I said, the peak bodies were consulted.

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—Order, Senator Heffernan! Senator Sterle has the call.
—As I said, RMAC will be consulted while the protocols of the importation of beef are being developed.
The health and safety of the Australian population was at the centre of the review and policy change. That is why a significant review has been undertaken by Professor Mathews, an eminent scientist with over 40 years experience. In his report, Professor Mathews explained that the science has improved significantly over recent years. He found that:
… an estimate of the absolute risk to Australians from UK beef imports, if this was to be allowed, is found to be—
I want to make sure those opposite really understand, because I do not think they quite get it. The absolute risk to Australians is:
… 40 million times less than the risk from road accidents.
The Mathews report, written by an expert, was also peer reviewed by expert scientists under the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—Order! Senator Heffernan, I see you are on the speakers list. You will have a chance to make all of your points, hopefully without interruption. Senator Sterle should be allowed to make his contribution without interruption as well.
—Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Jim Bishop, was also consulted. In summary, Professor Mathews concluded that there was a theoretical and negligible risk to human health.
I did table this at the hearing today—the Australian Red Cross Blood Service has put out a press release. It is also satisfied that the change in policy will not impact on Australia’s blood supply. In a media release the Red Cross has rejected claims that blood donations could be hindered by the government’s decision to allow imports of beef from countries previously affected by mad cow disease. This policy change does not mean that we will open the floodgates—far from it—to beef imports from any country wishing to export their beef to Australia. Under this new policy, beef from other countries must still meet country-by-country science based risk assessment processes. This includes, as necessary, in-country inspections to verify other countries’ risk mitigation systems.
—No import risk analysis, mate!
—The government is not changing its policy towards the importation of live cattle, hence this is not a viable pathway for introducing BSE into Australia. It is important that I say this: BSE is not a contagious disease, and its only significant route of transmission is through feeding cattle meat and bonemeal produced from BSE infected cattle. Australia has a ban on the importation of this risk material. We also have a ban on Australian cattle domestically being fed bonemeal. There is therefore no viable pathway for Australian cattle to contract BSE from safe imported fresh beef.
Despite the opposition’s claims, the policy change from 1 March—next Monday—does not mean that beef from other countries will start arriving the following day. We have to make that very, very clear; some mistruths have been put out that at one minute past 12 the gates would be opened.
—We know all that!
—Senator Heffernan interjects. Why put out mistruths that the floodgates are going to open at one minute past 12? That is how untruthful, devious and deceitful this argument has become. What is does mean is that countries must then undergo a rigorous process—
—No import risk analysis is required!
—to meet the high standard that is set by Food Standards Australia New Zealand.
—No import risk analysis required!
—Senator Heffernan, I have asked you to cease interjecting! You will get your chance later.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. The beef industry is significant in both its domestic and export value. There is no argument about that. Approximately 60 per cent of the total $7.1 billion of beef produced in Australia each year is exported. Trade is crucial for our beef industry, and this trade occurs under a rules based system. As members of the World Trade Organisation, Australia is bound to follow these rules and we have to follow these rules. We need to ensure that our rules are based on the best science in the world. Australia is entitled to implement rules to protect human, animal or plant life but must ensure these rules are based on international standards.
There would be adverse ramifications for our beef export trade if the policy remained unchanged or a WTO dispute was brought against Australia, and I think you could relate to that, Mr Deputy President. In particular, the continuation of the 2001 policy under the previous government may have resulted in retaliation, with major markets closing down trade in response to our ban on beef from those markets. Australian beef producers benefit from the access they gain to export markets around the world, and that has been made very, very clear to us in the committee on a number of occasions. The former policy risked our markets being shut down. It risked our industry being devastated.
The Howard government saw the need for change, but simply avoided it because it was all too hard. They had the scientific evidence and they sat on it—two reports, I believe: one in 2005 and one in 2006. The Howard government risked the future of our beef industry because they insisted on a BSE beef policy that was outdated, dangerous and wrong. If there was a single cow found with BSE, all Australian beef would come off the shelves—a blanket ban with no exceptions. If that did happen, imagine what that would do to jobs in rural Australia. Imagine what it would do to our beef industry. The beef industry called on the government to guard against this sort of calamity. The policy change protects Australian farmers and it protects Australian jobs; it protects Australian beef. Now that they are in opposition, that lot over there are running the classic scare campaign: disregarding the science and disregarding the facts. It does not suit them to have the science or the facts. It does not suit them to work in conjunction with the industry.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-02-22,"—In Australia, we are in the lucky position of being able to control what imports we allow into our country. Our position as an island means we have a natural barrier protecting our livestock and crops from pests and diseases that affect other countries—that is, unless they slip past our quarantine protection or we make a decision to risk it. And this is about making a decision of needlessly risking such a vital industry and our health. We know that BSE causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. We know that outbreaks of BSE cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the beef industries of affected countries. And we know that, so far, Australia is one of the few countries in the world to remain BSE free.
I strongly believe that people have the right to make informed choices about the food they are consuming. This is evident in the bills I have put to the Senate in relation to food-labelling laws in conjunction with my colleagues Senator Joyce and Senator Bob Brown. Currently, under the Food Standards Code, beef products can only be exported to Australia if they are from animals that are BSE free. Under the new standards, countries will be able to export beef products to Australia if they are assessed as having appropriate controls in place to ensure that the products exported are BSE free. This means that countries previously banned from exporting beef products to Australia because of their BSE status will now be able to. But consumers will not know what products come from which countries. Under current labelling laws, they cannot even reliably know which ones are Australian. And we know we have the farcical and, I think, dangerous position where a meat pie, for instance, could be categorised as being made in Australia because of the substantial transformation rule, where over 50 per cent of the value of the product is made in Australia—it could be the packaging or the pastry—but 100 per cent of the meat could come from a BSE affected country and we would be none the wiser under our current food-labelling laws.
We should not be relying on other countries to do the right thing. We should be actively and aggressively protecting our country and our beef industry and, above all, the health of our citizens. Let us put this in perspective: if you want to donate blood to the Red Cross and you lived in the UK for more than six months between 1980 and 1996, you cannot because of the risk posed by BSE. I know that a former president of the South Australian medical association, Dr Andrew Lavender, is in that category and he said so publicly. He has been quite vocal because he has seen what happened in the UK and he does not want it to happen here in Australia. In fact, you are deferred—that means banned—from donating blood for good. But the government feels it is safe to allow beef imports from BSE affected countries. As we saw with the equine influenza, just because we have never had the disease here, it does not mean it cannot happen. And it certainly does not mean we should take a chance. I think the fundamental question here is: what is more important—a free market or a safe market? I know which side I am on, and my colleagues in the coalition and the Australian Greens are on that side as well.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-02-22,"—It gives me absolutely no pleasure at all to speak on bovine spongiform encephalopathy. As a veterinarian for most of my career working in the livestock industries, I am absolutely amazed and aghast to think that we are even confronting this question. More importantly, the fact is that we will not be debating this matter in the Senate and the reason is simply that there is no capacity for the Senate to scrutinise it. Because there is no legislation, there are no regulations. This new arrangement will come in on 1 March and this place has no capacity to assess it. The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee was told by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry today, in a submission, that the updated policy announced on 20 October does not require a change to the Food Standards Code or to control measures. Therefore, there is no amendment to any act or subordinate legislation required to bring this into place. I think this is a perversion of the parliamentary process. We have seven days and we simply do not have any capacity to act.
Why have we been so concerned about this for as long as we have—since it was announced, spuriously, on 20 October? The reasons are twofold: the protection of the community, which is our role, and the protection of beef producers. One would have thought that in a circumstance like this there would have been certain measures put into place. There have not been. They are not yet evident to us. Let me advise the Senate that at this time Australia is free of BSE or, more particularly, under a change that none of us knew about, we went from being free to being at negligible risk. We have now been told, with this change of policy in a week’s time, that the risk will not change. I am at a loss to know how the risk will not change when in fact we are now going to allow and invite beef to come in from countries that have had BSE. In that particular event I would have thought we should go and have a look at it and ask what will the protocols be that Food Standards Australia New Zealand will impose. This announcement was made on 20 October by ministers for health, agriculture and trade—four months ago. As of this moment, as of the third public meeting which the committee had this morning, we still do not know what those protocols are going to be.
Secondly, we have no guarantee that there will be a trace-back system. Again for the benefit of the Senate, we in Australia, alone in the world, expended considerable sums of money with an enormous amount of angst and disagreement some years ago to have a national livestock identification system so that in the event of any untoward disease or other factor we could go back to the farm of origin and immediately determine where that particular disease originated. Let me give you a quick analogy—the case of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK. Imagine the enormous effect on security requirements had they been able when the UK first had foot-and-mouth disease to go straight back to the farm of origin and detect and determine where it had come from. The problem would have been nowhere near as great. Similarly, with BSE in the United Kingdom, again there was no trace-back. So Australia says that is fine, we must not under free trade and other restrictions and legislation impose on other countries that which we do not impose on ourselves. And that is fair—but do you think we could get a guarantee out of government that we will impose those same restrictions on countries who want to import into Australia? The answer, unfortunately, is no.
First of all I was told that there would be an equivalence, so I asked the President of the Cattle Council of Australia this morning whether he knew of any system equivalent to that that Australia has, and he assured me that he did not. I then went to the Red Meat Advisory Council, commented upon by my colleague Senator Sterle. What he did not say was that there were three factors upon which the council would give their support. The first was good science—and I ask where is the good science at this moment to be able to examine beef offshore and be able to guarantee that a consignment of beef is free of BSE? I will tell you the answer: we do not have the science of that testing. The science is not there. Secondly, he said that there had to be a trace-back system at least equivalent to that in Australia. We have already been told publicly and today that we will not be requiring that. The third criterion by RMAC and others concerns the whole question of protocols. Seven days out, and we do not know the protocols. This is a nonsense.
So we go to the industry itself, the producers. A point I have made before and will labour again is that five or six years ago we had similar changes in the pig industry when the vast majority of pig meat consumed in Australia was produced here. At Christmas last year, 75 per cent of all pig meat consumed on Australian Christmas tables was imported. I am inviting producer groups and others to tell me how different they think the situation will be for the Australian beef industry if this change is made. I cannot get any answer out of them. We are an island. We can protect ourselves from and we can contain that which comes in. Regrettably, many of the countries who will be importers under these changed conditions cannot. For example, we have the American-Mexican border. We may have all the faith in the world in inspectors in the United States but how do we know that meat has not come across the border from Mexico, where there is no BSE status at all, into the United States, where there is a controlled status, and then into Australia? Remember, we do not have the science of the testing to be able to deal with this. The final point is secrecy—why was there secrecy?",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2010-02-22,"—I rise, in following my colleagues, to outline our concerns about the relaxation of the importation of beef from countries that have had BSE or, as people would more commonly know it, mad cow disease. Firstly, I take exception to Senator Sterle’s comment about the comments coming from this side being scaremongering. It is anything but scaremongering. We are actually trying to get the facts of this out into the community, out into the public arena, so people can know what is going on. There is no parliamentary oversight of these changes—absolutely none—and there is no legislation and there are no regulations required, which means that the Parliament of Australia has no ability to have any input into the decision to make these changes. It is a decision of Minister Burke alone. It is about time that people around Australia had the opportunity to hear what is actually going on. This has been brushed under the carpet. As my good colleague Senator Back has just asked in his comments, why the secrecy? This has only started to come out because my colleagues Senator Heffernan, Senator Back and I, as a committee chair—and Senator Colbeck, Senator Williams and other very interested coalition senators—know that this should not be going ahead. If it were not for us the Australian people would not even know that these changes were going to come in on 1 March.
We are being told that there is negligible risk of an outbreak of mad cow disease if the importation rules are relaxed. The people that I am talking to about this are not at all comfortable with ‘negligible risk’ because ‘negligible’ means that there is a risk. I do not think anybody wants to walk into a restaurant with a sign out the front saying ‘Negligible risk of getting mad cow here’. That might sound a bit extreme but nobody can tell us otherwise. Nobody can look us in the face and say, ‘This will not occur. We will absolutely guarantee that we will not get mad cow disease in Australia.’ Under these changes they simply cannot do that. They absolutely cannot do that. This is being done purely on the health impacts. There is no import risk analysis whatsoever on the impact on the beef industry, absolutely none, and we are being told that that is fine and that is okay because there will be a negligible risk and there will not be a problem at all. That is just rubbish. It is not right and it should not be going ahead. This disease has a dormant period of 40 years. How can we possibly know that we can really say, ‘Yes, this is safe and this is fantastic’? It is just not right. This has been rushed; there has been undue haste.
We have the reputation of being a clean, green exporting nation. Why on earth would we risk that? We are being told by industry bodies that it is about the risk of trade retaliation if we do not move to the same level playing field, because the science now says that it is okay. That might be their view but there is still this risk attached to it. It is interesting that we have been told during the process that our trading partners have been pushing for years to try to get access to our market because they feel they are being unfairly precluded. Yet on the other hand at the same time we are being told that there is really not going to be any great increase at all in the importation of beef into this country. Doesn’t that then lead to this question: if our trading partners are so keen to get access to our market, why do they want to do that if they are not planning on supplying it? There must be a very good reason. I would imagine, as Senator Colbeck said before me, that it has something to do with the markets that we already hold. Interestingly, it was put forward this morning by MLA that indeed when this was announced there were concerns from Japan about our existing markets. We already export into Japan. What is this going to do in terms of creating a risk for our existing markets in places like Japan? If all of a sudden we now have relaxation of the rules that are going to allow imports from the US, for example, into Australia, what does that say about our standing in terms of our clean, green, top of the range—top of the level, if you like—status as an exporter? I would ask this: what is going to be the reaction of those countries if there is an outbreak after this all happens—and we hope it does not go ahead—in the US? What does that then do to our exporting relationship with Japan? Is it going to put us in the same basket as the US because we have been letting their beef come into this country? Of course it is.
This whole argument that the science is now okay simply does not wash. It absolutely does not wash. We know that the protocols have not even been drawn up yet. Those very guidelines that are the only things that are going to determine how, why and when countries that have had mad cow disease can send beef here are not even finalised—and this is starting on Monday morning. While we might not have beef coming in through the doors on Monday morning, their ability to apply to export absolutely starts on Monday morning and we do not even have the protocols. We do not have anything in place that says by what measure they are going to be allowed to do this. This is an absolute farce. The minister should simply be changing his mind, along with that of the departments, right now in the best interests of Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-02-22,"—I wish to make a few brief remarks in relation to this matter of public importance. The Greens have long been supporters of the precautionary principle that ought to be applied when it comes to the natural environment or human health. What is going on here is we are abandoning the precautionary principle in favour of a calculated risk. We have no risk at the moment because there is no importation, but we are moving to a calculation by which we are taking some action which will have negligible risk—but that has very little to do with this argument. The only argument that we have here is to do with the World Trade Organisation, and that is what I want to focus on today. The fact of the matter is that the old doctrine of free trade under the WTO is just riven with hypocrisy, with court cases and with bullying of all sorts. The reality is the rest of the world has moved on and Australia is clinging to an absolutely religious view about free trade which has gone out the window in Europe all over the place. I was in Copenhagen at the end of last year and I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the big issue in Europe is food and energy security. The Europeans are locking up Europe as fast as they can in terms of being self-sufficient in food and self-sufficient in energy, because they can see the way that the world is going. They will find all manner of ways by which to continue to subsidise their own growers to maintain their own food security regardless of what the WTO might have to say or what anyone else might have to say.
We have been fighting exactly the same fight time and time again, whether it is salmon from Canada, apples from New Zealand, bananas from the Philippines or, now, whether it is beef from BSE countries. We will fight it over and over again. The simple reason is that, if we want to export our product into other markets on the basis of negligible risk, they want to export their product into Australian markets on the basis of negligible risk. If we want to say ‘No risk’ to them, they will say ‘No risk’ to us and therefore reject our product. This is all this is about. It is a fight about the WTO rules and whether you apply the free trade rules to maximum benefit to the home country. That is what is going on here.
If there is no import risk assessment, how do you know what the real risk is to the beef industry here? If there is no traceability, that is inexcusable—and at this stage I understand that is the case. There are no protocols in place as yet. I can tell you why there is secrecy. It is because the Australian community would hate it if they knew this was going on. They were terrified by the BSE outbreak in the UK. There is nothing more frightening than the concept of getting mad cow disease and it being in the population. That is why the community did not want it, will not want it and will not like it. The government wanted to change it to satisfy the WTO rules because of the negligible risk requirements, but they did not want the community to know because the community would not want it and the community would want the precautionary principle and say, ‘Why would we want to do something like that when we are safe in Australia, when we still have a beef industry?’
We know that, with globalisation, globalisation of trade and multinational corporations, what we will get here is a massive import of carcasses. And what is going to happen to our own beef industry in the long term? Let us get real about who is going to be producing beef, who is going to know what is on their table and how you are going to know what you are eating and where it comes from. That is a big concern out there in the community now. It is why people are going to farmers’ markets. People are shifting. They want local, seasonal, fresh, regional products. They are getting more and more suspicious of what is being imported, the lack of controls and the lack of labelling laws. I think the government has really made a serious mistake here—but so has the coalition. You cannot cling to free trade, to the WTO, and then complain about these outcomes, because they are consequential of a belief in the WTO free trade system.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2010-02-22,"—In some respects, I could not agree more with Senator Milne on this matter of public importance on the importation of beef products, because there is a bit of a two-faced approach to this question from the coalition. Having been in this place during the years that my party was in opposition, and having been part of the committee process that examined this matter, I have been party to examining issues on the importation of salmon, apples and pork—those issues which have troubled Australian farmers where there has been an argument put by Australian farmers and their representatives that the importation of those products would pose a risk to their industries because the importation of those products was increasing the risk of the introduction of a particular disease.

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—Senator Heffernan interjects again, but I listened to other senators in silence. If he is going to behave here the way that he behaves in the committees and disgrace himself, let that be on his head. For many years the coalition in government—and now the Labor Party—supported an appropriate level of protection which does not involve zero risk. The reason we do that is that if we have that issue for one product we have to have it for all. The examination of the risk assessment and the challenge to our risk assessment process on the importation of Canadian salmon failed because we did not apply the same standard—
—There was no import risk analysis!
—and this was under your government, Senator Heffernan. Would you put a stopper in it and behave properly? If the chair is not going to assist me, then I will have to take it up—
 (Senator Trood)—Senator Heffernan, you will have your moment to speak in 10 minutes.
—I am just pointing out there was no import risk analysis.
—Senator Heffernan, it is disorderly to interrupt, as you know.
—With salmon, we lost a challenge at the WTO. Whilst we were concerned about the introduction of particular fish diseases with salmon, the Canadians and New Zealanders were all keen to point out that we did not apply the same standards to other products, and we lost that case. Salmon can be imported to this country now, and some is. We have had various propositions put for the importation of pork and they have been resisted by industry on the basis of identifiable animal diseases coming from that product. The position of this government on foot-and-mouth disease remains that, if there is an outbreak which poses a serious risk, we will not allow meat from a country where that outbreak exists to enter this country.
The evidence has been unclear for some time about the chances of introducing BSE by means of the introduction of animal meat. There are parts of an animal that are a greater importation risk than others, and I am not going to touch upon that. Suffice to say that if one can exclude those parts of the animal then the chance of introduction of the material which might carry the disease is reduced. The second thing we know from the science is that if we do not feed animal products to animals then the chance of introducing BSE to animals is basically nonexistent. For the last 13 years we have had a rule applying around the country which prohibits the feeding of animal product or blood and bone, or anything connected to animal waste, to animals such as cows, sheep, goats and the like. The reality is that we have had in place a protocol going back years to effectively minimise any chance of any such disease being introduced.
What are we faced with here? The process which was followed in coming to this decision was full and detailed, and the safety of the Australian people and our food supply, as well as animal health, were utmost considerations. A comprehensive range of meat industry and health stakeholders were consulted. An independent expert, Professor John Mathews—an eminent scientist with 40 years experience who has had a longstanding interest in this issue—provided a report that indicated that the risks to human health of a change in policy were negligible, provided the appropriate risk mitigation strategies were in place. The report was peer reviewed and endorsed by expert scientists under the National Health and Medical Research Council. The three lead departments—Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; Health and Ageing; and Foreign Affairs and Trade—have worked closely together to ensure that all aspects of the change have been carefully dealt with.
Some questions have arisen as to whether the appropriate risk assessment for beef import purposes will be carried out. Food Standards Australia New Zealand has indicated that it will finalise its protocols before 1 March 2010 and has confirmed it will consult with industry in the development of those protocols. The Red Meat Advisory Council will act as the contact point for those consultations. Food Standards will undertake rigorous assessments, on a country-by-country basis, of countries that wish to export fresh beef products to Australia. In addressing fully the human health issues through the FSANZ food safety risk assessment process, the animal health issues related to BSE will also be appropriately dealt with.
The two ways that BSE could flow to animals are addressed in this process. The first way, through live animal imports, is not an issue because we are not allowing live animal imports into this country—so that is not a way that the disease could be introduced. The second way, through cattle eating fresh beef, as I indicated earlier, will not be an issue either, because no imported beef cuts or bone meal or canned meat are or can be fed to Australian cattle. That ban has existed, as I said, for 13 years. So there is no viable pathway for Australian animals to contact BSE from safe imported fresh beef. Therefore a separate import risk analysis process for animal diseases is not necessary, and that is the reason one has not been carried out. Aside from having met the requirements of a rigorous BSE assessment, any country wishing to export beef to Australia will need to meet all other quarantine requirements related to fresh beef imports, including the strict import conditions for animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease. In other words, any arrangements in relation to this BSE matter will not allow a country to skirt around other issues that are raised in relation to the introduction of these—
—How do you do that without an import risk analysis?
—I just explained, Senator Heffernan. Perhaps you were not listening because you do not want to listen. The fact of the matter is that Senator Heffernan has been running a scare campaign. He has been behaving in what I consider is a most inappropriate fashion at committee hearings. He has been harassing witnesses, interjecting and trying to put pressure on people because he does not agree with this decision. It is his right not to agree with it, but I think he should behave a bit better than he is today.
I want to talk about some of the evidence we have had. I think everyone has got the right to come along to a Senate committee and give evidence and put their point of view. I have supported the process of Senate committees examining issues all the time I have been in this place, and I continue to do so. I do not support parties coming along and using the process to spread alarmist or untrue information. One of the matters which I raised with Senator Heffernan during a hearing was a proposition which was put by a representative of the Australian Beef Association. They were trying to, in effect, whip up a bit of a fear campaign that somehow we were about to be deluged with US beef if this decision went ahead. The proposition was put that somehow you only had to look at the price of beef in the US compared to the price paid here to see that, if we allowed this decision, suddenly we would be getting steaks out of US feedlots and they would be replacing Australian steaks. Prices were quoted. Mr Bellinger said, at a hearing on Friday, 5 February:
Choice-grade sirloin in the United States is currently selling for $13.86 a kilogram. In Australia it is selling from anywhere between $30 and $50 a kilogram at retail.
Point No. 1 is that ‘choice’ grade, under the USDA, is the second-grade steak and ‘select’ is the top grade. He gave us the prices for the top grade Australian steak as a comparison with choice grade. Point No. 2 is that, on searching the web that very day and looking at prices available on the web for the product that he mentioned, I could not get any price within a bull’s roar of the $13.86 a kilo that he was talking about. I could for a pound, but I could not for a kilo. In other words, I suspect—and I will give him the benefit of the doubt; he might have just made a mistake—that he quoted incorrectly the figure of the price per pound for USDA choice-quality sirloin steaks, that he misinterpreted it and put it on the record as $13.86. The fact of the matter is—you only have to do your own research—for anyone buying anything but ultrabulk cuts, the price comparison that Mr Bellinger gave to the committee is utterly wrong. It is part of the scare campaign that some people are seeking to mount. I guess, with their moment in the sun, they like to make the best they can of it and, if they exaggerate a bit or if they make a mistake, well, who is to know? Frankly, I think it is incumbent on people representing organisations that want standing in the community to get their facts right.
That point highlights one of the problems that we have had with this debate. There has been an attempt to scare people about this issue. There has been an attempt by the coalition to forget the fact that, all the time they were in government, they supported the principles that underpin the decision this government has made. Now they are in opposition it is their chance to try and make hay while sun shines, to forget about all the principles they had for 12 years in government and to run as if they do not support a limited-risk regime in terms of quarantine. They did for the 12 years they were in government. Frankly, it is something which we have to be part of because we export a lot more food than we will ever import. We export 378,000 tonnes, give or take a bit, to the United States. It is a market we could not afford to lose. I would not like to be in a position to have to say—if this government had not acted—that we might lose some or all of that market because we did not obey the rules. That is what is being proposed to the government. (Time expired)

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2010-02-22,"—It is not hard to tell that there is no-one—not a single solitary soul—in the government in this parliament who lives and makes a living in the bush. This is the biggest ambush by a government of an agricultural industry in Australia’s history. It is a whole-of-government decision driven by the trade department. That is what I am informed by the bureaucrats and the ministerial staff. Simon Crean is very angry. He has been to America, as has Minister Burke. They put the hard word on them. They have come back here and said: ‘We’ll swear the industry to secrecy. We’ll sign them up to no discussions.’ We were given evidence this morning that their consultation process was three meetings with about 300 people out of 200,000 levy payers in Australia. That was the biggest. There have been 37-odd pieces of correspondence putting pressure on the government from Canada and the United States. There has been no scrutiny by parliament. If we had not raised it in that committee we would not be having this debate today. The 200,000 cattle growers—the levy payers—of Australia should sack RMAC and the Cattle Council, because they have absolutely distracted, destroyed and betrayed the industry. It is a disgrace.
Why there is no IRA, I do not know. We cannot even get the bureaucrats, let alone ministerial staff or the government, to tell us whether there ever has been an import risk analysis on the importation of beef into Australia. I believe there has been. No-one can tell us. The bureaucrats say: ‘I’ve only been in the job five years. You’d have to go and ask someone else.’ DAFF says to go and ask DOHA; DOHA says to go and ask Austrade. They have no idea; they are dodging the truth. Just so people know, we heard evidence today from the CJD Support Group that, sadly, if you are a person who has surgery for CJD in a hospital there is no way to sterilise the instruments. They have to destroy the instruments that they use on you because they cannot sterilise them.
So here we are, after no grower consultation and absolutely no scrutiny by parliament. There has been no import risk analysis. There are no protocols in place at this point. The government said, ‘We’re going to kick it off on Monday, and we’ll know before then what the protocols are.’ Both the Cattle Council and the MLA said, ‘They’ve talked to us about what the protocols might be, but we haven’t seen them yet.’ The government are not going to let the industry see them; they are not going to let the rural and regional references committee look at them; they are not going to test them for human failure, when the committee that I proudly sit on has tested the protocols for apples, pears, fish, bananas and lots of other things that you might think of. All of those things we have tested and gloriously the government ticked off on them.
And we were as big a critic of our government as we have been of this government in terms of the import of beef from Brazil, where the bureaucrats said, ‘She’s right’ to the government. ‘Bring her in, because there are foot-and-mouth disease-free zones in Brazil.’ The OIE says, ‘We’ve got a bit of paper here that says it’s okay, because there is a tick in that box and that box.’ But there was no such thing.
There is no answer to the fact that there is no traceability. There is no equivalence—do not ask me why. Australia’s cattle growers should go and tell the Cattle Council and their representatives to go and get another job. The Cattle Council said, ‘We really don’t want to worry about national status or herd status; we only want to worry about animal status.’ Unfortunately, there can be no such thing as a BSE-free herd, because there is no live BSE test. The only time that you know the cow has the disease is when you kill it. So here we have an industry that is saying: ‘We won’t worry about an import risk analysis, because it takes too long. The process takes two years.’
We have moved from the precautionary principle to risk analysis. The way that they did that was very tricky. This government did not tell anyone. It did not tell the Australian public. It did not tell the growers that we were going to change our status. But by agreeing to move Australia’s status from ‘free’ to ‘negligible risk’ they moved from the precautionary principle to risk analysis.
We have been betrayed. There is absolutely no way that Australia should be going through this process, because at the present time anyone who is a cattle grower—and unfortunately there is no-one on the other side who has any idea about this—is under siege now. They talk about what happened back in the 1990s when only 35 tonnes came in and the dollar was at 48 US cents, not near parity. They are saying that not much will come in. That is what they said about pork.
There has been no answer given to us. There has been no defence made. And nor do we have any way under the free trade agreement to compete with the $100 tonne subsidy per beast in a feedlot in America, because of the grain subsidy. There is no way that we can compete when labour in Australia—the people who work in the feedlot industry—costs three times as much. We cannot do anything about the fact that the average return for an American cattle person in their market over there is 50 per cent more than that of an Australian. We cannot do anything about the fact that the supermarket consumer pays 40 per cent less. There is no way that we can do anything about that.
We have been absolutely ambushed. Australian cattle producers are, in real terms, receiving less money now than they have received in the last 40 years except for the period of the 1972 to 1974 cattle crash. Australia’s cattle producers are getting $1.65 in the Wagga saleyards today for export beef. It is a joke. This is another impost. The one thing that we had in the marketplace was our clean, green and free status. And this gives that away. This is not about how much beef is coming into Australia. Those gooses on the other side do not care, because they have been stirred up through the free trade agreement. This is about us losing market share in Korea and Japan, because we are now saying to the Americans and the Canadians, ‘We’ll surrender to your status, so if you get another reactor, Australian producers will not have a premium in the market.’ They will say to the Koreans: ‘The Australians take our beef. They are negligible. Therefore, you should take it.’ We will lose market share. This is a disgrace. Australian consumers should rise up in anger and tell the government to go to hell.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2010-02-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement on Closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, together with the Prime Minister’s report 2010.
I seek leave to speak briefly to the statement Closing the gap, presented to the House of Representatives on 11 February 2010.
Leave granted.
—First, I acknowledge the Prime Minister’s statement on Closing the gap. I think it is a very important statement and I certainly commend the Prime Minister on his good intentions. I also commend the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, on the work she has done on closing the gap and particularly acknowledge all the staff who have been working in her department to ensure that the targets are met and that the Australian people have a range of measures with which to measure the promises and the work from both sides of parliament in this very important matter.
I caution the Prime Minister, however, on a couple of issues. As part of the apology the Prime Minister very clearly indicated that on the very first day of parliament its very first business would be to consider the Closing the gap report. As part of the apology, a symbolic gesture was made that we thought the business of closing the gap was so important that we would put it before any other business of parliament. Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, and I am not sure exactly of the reasons, on both first days of parliament after the apology he failed to do exactly that thing. It was not considered on the first day of parliament; it was a week later or a few days later. I urge the Prime Minister on the next occasion to meet the requirements of the apology and, even if it is only symbolic, ensure that the Australian people understand that this parliament—not this government but this parliament—considers the Closing the gap report as a priority on the very first day it sits.
I also acknowledge the work of ex-Prime Minister John Howard and Mal Brough, the former Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. In effect, many of the programs we are looking at in the Closing the gap report and many of the statistics refer back to the fantastic work that was done by those two men. I also acknowledge Noel Pearson, Warren Mundine, Galarrwuy Unupingu and so many other Indigenous leaders who have provided a lot of leadership in this matter, particularly the way they have indicated that communities and individuals must also take up their own responsibilities and that it cannot be left entirely to government. It has been fantastic to see the leadership they have provided in that regard.
I will go quickly to some of the targets that have been set. We now have some clear targets that had been laid out in closing the gap. A very important and significant one is life expectancy. There used to be a 17-year differential in the life expectancy of somebody in mainstream Australia compared with an Indigenous Australian—of course a terrible gap. I understand that the gap is now 11.5 and 9.7 per cent for males and females respectively. I think everybody acknowledges the sudden drop in that number is not due to anything wonderful we have done but due to the way the measurements are taken and to the far more sophisticated application of those.
If we set intergenerational targets, if we say, ‘We will achieve this in an intergenerational sense,’ that is terrific, but what is a generation? You cannot say, ‘We’ll have a look at it in a generation’s time,’ because it is simply not going to get the consideration it needs. So it is very important to break that down. If you break it down, you will find that it is a 2.3-year gap in 10 years time. So in five years time—which is a good indication—it should be a bit over a year. In 2013, when we look at the life expectancy of Indigenous Australians, the gap should have closed by at least a year. We cannot just leave these targets out there. We have to be able to hold all parliaments and all governments to account on this matter.
The figures on infant mortality have been tremendous. I think infant mortality is getting a lot better. Again, we have to look at the trend line, at least in 2013, and then make whatever adjustments we think necessary. But all indications are that we are going to meet that target. On early childhood education, again there is a concerning trend: a nine per cent differential in metropolitan areas, a 16 per cent differential in provincial areas and a 31 per cent difference in remote and regional areas. I suspect that this is simply about the allocation of resources. It is very hard to get an early childhood education if there are simply no facilities there. In many of the places I visit in my own electorate of the Northern Territory and as I move around Australia, there is a complete difference in the amenities providing for early childhood education. That is one of the fundamental differentials that need to be filled.
When these things are measured, it is said that this is a measurement of enrolment. Tragically, I suspect that the circumstances are in fact far worse. It is not hard to measure enrolment on a given day when everybody runs around and asks, ‘Is your kid enrolled?’ Enrolment is fantastic, but the real target and the real measure is attendance. You can be enrolled, but enrolment does not give you an education. The only thing that gives you an education is attendance. We urge the government, if it is tweaking the report, to include attendance. That would be a very important change. The standards attained on literacy and numeracy reflect about a 30 per cent gap, but the gap gets wider as soon as you get away from urbanised Australia and wider again from provincial. Again, I suspect that that says a lot about the level of amenities, whether it be the teaching staff or the infrastructure of the schools themselves.
But as I travel around Australia the biggest problem with reading, writing and numeracy that I see is attendance. I would never have learned those fishing down the creek—which is why the local police officer and I had a very close relationship, when I was going to school! Most people in the business would agree that the problem in terms of reading, writing and numeracy is simply about attendance: you cannot learn if you are not at school.
On the issue of halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12: there is now a 50 per cent gap in attainment levels. I was in Wadeye last week. There are a huge number of people who should be at year 12 who are simply not at school. Why? Because there is no school. A boarding school was promised by the current government. It was going to be built in 2009 in Wadeye. Well, I was there on Friday—and nothing has started at all. That gap is not going to close unless you get a bit fair dinkum.
On halving the gap on employment outcomes: we have something like a 21 per cent gap. That is on average. I am quite sure that in rural and regional Australia it would be a lot worse. Saying you will address all of these issues is terrific. As I said, I commend the Prime Minister for having the best intentions. But best intentions are a bit like good blokes—the pubs are full of them. Best intensions are simply not enough.
Tragically, we have seen a series of disasters in these programs on which Closing the Gap so much relies. SIHIP has delivered two houses in two years—with $43 million invested in consultancies. I understand the issue was that we have to engage with Aboriginal people to see what sort of houses they want. I actually went and saw the first two houses open—terrific houses. I asked the Aboriginal people: ‘Are you pretty happy with these houses?’ They said, ‘Well, we actually wanted one with a breezeway, with outside access for a toilet for visitors’—and they went through everything they wanted. They said, ‘They’re just building the same ones they’ve always built.’ So I cannot see that $43 million being much of an investment.
We have heard now of refurbishments in Ali Curung. They consider refurbishments the fact that a bloke has a new stove, a few stainless steel rails, a sink and a fan—and, the taxpayers out there will be overjoyed to hear, it cost $75,000 per house. I am sure it is going to average out, but I tell you what: we will want to be spending on a lot more houses to make that effective. This was all part of the apology. It is absolutely fundamental, whether it is for health or any of the outcomes that we want, to ensure that people have a roof over their heads.
On employment, I think we need to have special considerations for Indigenous people in terms of some of the breaching provisions. There is no doubt about that. The reason is not their ethnicity; it is simply that they come from a very disadvantaged demographic, with very low socioeconomic backgrounds, and many times have very low levels of opportunity. But we need to treat them equally as Australians. Without these breaching provisions I can see us simply having two demographics—one that is levered into work and one that is not. Again, good intentions are simply not enough. These programs need to be run far more effectively if we are going to close the gap. Sadly, I can see us, this time next year, at the beginning of parliament, having a look at a series of data sets that show we are not closing the gap fast enough—and that is simply not good enough. Again, I commend the Prime Minister, but there is far more work to be done.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Ministerial Statements,12,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-22,"—I rise to speak on the motion moved by my colleague relating to the report Closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Mr Acting Deputy President, you have just heard from someone who really understands the difficulties for Indigenous Australians. We are very fortunate in the coalition to have someone of Senator Scullion’s calibre and knowledge as our spokesman on Indigenous affairs.
I want to contribute—ever so briefly, I might add, for my colleagues’ benefit—to the motion taking note of the Prime Minister’s statement on Closing the Gap, just to highlight again the problems of Indigenous people in Cape York. Over many years those Indigenous people, through long struggle, have achieved ownership of a lot of the lands in Cape York, and they have big plans for those lands. But the Queensland government have come along with this ridiculous Wild Rivers legislation: legislation that was brought into play in Queensland in a grubby deal between the Queensland Labor Party government and the Queensland Greens political party to lock up the so-called wild rivers. That has meant, in many instances, that the plans and visions that the Indigenous people of Cape York had for their own future—a future not relying on government handouts but dealing with their own lands and making wealth, jobs and self-fulfilment from their lands—have been shattered by the Queensland Labor government’s wild rivers legislation.
I was delighted to stand by Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, when one of his first announcements as leader was to indicate that he was going to take the fairly bold, very courageous move of overturning Queensland state legislation with federal legislation to effectively nullify the Queensland government’s wild rivers legislation. Why did he do this? It was not out of any particular animosity to the Queensland government—although, I might say, most Queenslanders these days, according to the opinion polls, have a great animosity to the current Queensland government. That was not Mr Abbott’s reasoning. He was doing that because he is a guy who, like Senator Scullion, has actually lived amongst Indigenous peoples. For several years past now, Mr Abbott has been up in Cape York—not with a media contingent, not for a photo opportunity, as the Prime Minister is so good at, but up there actually acting as a teacher’s aide for a couple of weeks in an Indigenous community. He has a feel for them. He has spoken to Indigenous leaders like Noel Pearson, who are just ropable, absolutely furious, at this Queensland government legislation. He has spoken to other Indigenous leaders—Deon Creek was among several who attended Mr Abbott’s announcement in Cairns—of his intention to try to overturn the Queensland government’s wild rivers legislation. All the Indigenous leaders that we have spoken to are totally incensed by the Queensland government’s action in depriving them of a future. That is why I am so glad that Mr Abbott has introduced that private member’s bill.
I am saddened that Mr Rudd has not, in his statement today, wholeheartedly endorsed Mr Abbott’s legislation. I had hoped he might say, ‘I’ll take over Mr Abbott’s legislation and introduce it myself.’ That would have been acceptable, because I know Mr Abbott does not want the glory of doing this; he just wants something done for Indigenous people. He wants to close the gap with practical action—not with words, great statements, huge media opportunities and hoopla. He actually wants to get in and do things that will assist. I am not saying the Labor Party deliberately go out to make things worse for Indigenous people. I know they are trying, in their incompetent way, to do their best for Indigenous people. But they have no understanding. They are skilled in thoughts from the ivory towers, one might say, in all the textbook things that could be done to help Indigenous people. None of it works. You need to get out on the ground, as Senator Scullion does, and talk to the communities at Wadeye to understand what the housing problems really are.
Expectations have been built up by Mr Rudd which, as Senator Scullion was saying, will never be delivered on because the Rudd government are incapable of delivering any program on time, effectively and on budget. They are brilliant at the spin. They are brilliant at the promises. But, when it comes to delivering on the ground, they are completely hopeless. I only regret that Mr Rudd has not taken on more of the initiatives that Mal Brough started, and which Senator Scullion often talks about, in doing something positive and proper for our Indigenous brothers in Australia.
Whilst I welcome Mr Rudd’s statement, I regret that it is simply another Ruddism, it is all talk and no action—it sounds good, he will get a headline tomorrow and then, as usual with Mr Rudd, he will do nothing about it. Hopefully by this time next year there will be a new government that will be making statements about Indigenous people that actually mean something and practically advance their lot. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-02-22,"—The coalition will be asking that the question be put separately on the first procedural element of that motion that these bills may proceed without formalities. I wish to speak very briefly to that procedural motion. The opposition was consistent when the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme suite of legislation was last introduced. We wanted the bills put separately at that time. We are seeking that the same happen again. We believe that, like the first two times we asked for this, the bills are of a complex nature—they are certainly of a contentious nature—and we wish them to be put separately in order of the magnitude of the legislation before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2010</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2010-02-22,"—I understand that under the standing orders there is an automatic division of these questions. Therefore, the only issue for the opposition is, presumably, a pursuit of its case. I am getting further advice as to whether or not there will be divisions on this issue. It is clear that the opposition’s position on these questions is quite spurious. It is not as if they do not know the contents of these bills. It is not as if they do not know the intent of the government. It is not as if they do not know their own minds because they have already declared their position on all of these questions.
These bills give effect to the amendments to the previous set of bills that were dealt with in the Senate. Those amendments have been put into legislative form. The amendments entered into by the Liberal Party in December—the Liberal Party as it was in December under the leadership of the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull—give effect to the agreement and commitment made after wide consultation on those matters. What we have here is a position where the opposition is effectively seeking to repudiate those previous arrangements. The long and the short of it is that the previous decision the opposition took on these matters should now not be followed through in this chamber. It cannot be said that this is because of the complexities of the bills. Purely and simply, this is a political stratagem being pursued by the opposition to give effect to the political statements that Mr Abbott has made repeatedly that the opposition does not support action on climate change and it will be opposing the bill. We understand that.
The effect of this is to formally recognise the opposition’s view that it should defeat these bills. But they are not going to be straight with us and say that this is clearly the position they are going to put. They are going to provide every possible tactical instrument they have to frustrate consideration of these measures. I think the opposition should be honest with this chamber. They are not going to vote for these bills. They are going to seek to have these bills defeated and they will clearly vote against them. But to go through this device, this ruse, which is so unusual in the Senate, is clearly a measure of the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition. He says he wants to be the straight shooter. He says he wants to be the plain man’s politician. What we have here are old-fashioned Liberal Party tricksters up to it again. They do not want to state their position, as clearly as they have publicly, in this chamber. They ought to just vote against the bills. We will be dividing on this measure. I am not going to waste the time of the chamber. We will be dividing on this question, and we will be calling you the hypocrites and frauds that you are.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-22,"—In the five minutes I had before question time interrupted this debate, I was expressing some amazement that the great moral challenge of the century, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010, had not been put first on the program today and that we were instead dealing with the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2], a bill that highlighted a broken promise by Mr Rudd. I quoted from Mr Rudd’s now quite famous letter of 20 November where he gave a rock-solid written guarantee that he would retain the existing private health rebates which this bill is all about knocking off, in direct contravention of Mr Rudd’s rock-solid written guarantee.
I then made the comment that Mr Rudd and his party have been very poor managers of the whole health debate. We know that Mr Rudd said the buck stops with him and promised that, by a date just recently passed, he would have all the hospitals in Australia fixed and that otherwise he would take them over. Of course, it was just another example of Mr Rudd’s good spin before an election that people believed, and, as we have come to expect with Mr Rudd, it did not work.
I also mentioned how Labor’s knocking off $180 million in the last budget from the pathology support through Medicare had impacted upon me personally as someone who has had open-heart surgery and has a plastic valve in his heart to keep him alive. Some might hope that, with these pathology cuts, perhaps I will not be here! To keep myself alive I have to keep my blood thin; to keep my blood thin I have to be permanently on warfarin; and to make sure that it is kept at the same level I am supposed every three or four weeks to go and get a pathology test. I have been doing that now for 13 years. It only takes a second to get out the blood and make sure that it is somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5, and that will keep me alive by keeping the blood flowing through my heart. It is essential that it be done—that is, it is essential from my point of view because I want to stay alive.
Yet I went along to my pathologist the other day and they said, ‘I hate to tell you this, Ian, but this is going to cost you $40.’ I said, ‘It can’t cost me $40; I’ve been doing it for 13 years and it hasn’t cost me a cent.’ They said, ‘Mr Rudd’s knocked so much off this that the pathologists are now not subsidised in the way they used to be, so they are recovering their costs from their patients.’ I tell that story because I am one of those—although we are relatively poorly paid as politicians—who can still afford that. But there are many Australians who simply could not afford the $40. I am not talking about pensioners and people on welfare benefits; I am talking about ordinary Australians in employment. If they have to pay $40 a month just to check to keep themselves alive, it becomes very unfair on those who simply do not have the money to pay for it.
That is the sort of thing that Mr Rudd does. He wants to save $180 million, but he is spending $43 billion. We just wasted $20 million on Senator Conroy’s request for tender in the National Broadband Network. It did not achieve a thing. It was just wasted. Was it $20 million? I think it might even have been more than that.
—Seventeen million.
—It was $17 million. That is okay! Thanks, Senator Conroy. Only $17 million was absolutely wasted and it did not achieve a thing. If Mr Rudd wants to save some money, he should get rid of Senator Conroy. We could have saved $17 million and we could save ourselves a fair share of the $43 billion that is allegedly going to be spent on this NBN once Senator Conroy sorts out Telstra. Or so he thinks; I know who will end up sorting out whom, because we know that prior to the election Senator Conroy and Telstra were very, very close—almost as if they were holding hands. Remember where you got your $4.7 billion from, Senator Conroy.
 (Senator Moore)—Senator Macdonald, I should not have to remind you that you should not address senators across the chamber in that way.
—I should not, either.
—I should not have to remind you, Senator Macdonald.
—No. It is Senator Conroy’s interjecting that is encouraging me to respond, unfortunately. There are so many ways that the pink batts scheme has now become a national scandal. If we wanted to save $180 million from pathology, why didn’t we think of that before we embarked upon the complete waste of money that this batts scheme is going to be? It is not just that that is a complete waste of money; it is the millions and millions of dollars that are going to be needed to put right what Mr Garrett has bungled with that program.
I do digress. We are so passionate about opposing this new tax by Mr Rudd because it will again put increased pressure on public hospitals. Any of us who have had to deal with public hospitals know how difficult it is, currently, to get in. Fortunately, I have private health insurance. I, as all of us do, continue to get complaints from constituents—ordinary people—who have some horrific stories about the queues at hospitals and very ill patients sitting in corridors and, worse still, in ambulances, until a bed is free. It is atrocious. This bill will put more people into that public hospital system and it will cause even greater problems. I know that Mr Rudd and the Labor Party hate private health insurance. It is a great shame. It is a bit of the old class warfare. It is so wrongly directed. We have to encourage people to look after themselves and save a little bit to get private health insurance. We do not need to do what is being proposed here and make it more difficult for people to achieve good health care in Australia.
We oppose this for the right reasons and on sound economic and health principles. We also oppose this because it was a direct promise—a direct, written guarantee—given a few days before the last election to swing votes. How can Mr Rudd, with any credibility, have us in the Senate tonight again debating a bill that is a direct contradiction of his written promise on this issue? I would hope that Labor senators who have an interest in good health care and honesty will cross the floor and join with us in rejecting this bill yet again and give real encouragement to the health system rather than try to demolish it as Mr Rudd appears to be doing.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-02-22,"—At the outset, I would like to share a story with you, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore. I was talking to a primary school teacher a little while back. She told me about a homework project that she had set her students. The project was for students to go home and ask their parents what two plus two equals. She told me about three students in particular. The first student went home and asked her father, who was an economist, what two plus two equals. He said, ‘Darling, for two plus two the answer is within the range of three to six, with a probability that the answer is four.’ The second student went home and asked her father, who was an accountant, what two plus two equals. The accountant said, ‘Darling, that’s easy. The answer is four.’ The third student went home and asked her father, who was a politician, ‘Dad, what does two plus two equal?’ The politician parent answered, ‘Darling, that depends. What do you want the answer to be?’ That was very much Prime Minister Rudd’s approach at the last election: tell the public what you think they want to hear, tell interest groups what you think they want to hear, tell industry groups what you think they want to hear and, in this case, tell health insurers what you think they want to hear and tell holders of private health insurance what you think they want to hear.
The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] before this chamber is the legislative embodiment of a lie. It is the legislative enactment of Labor hypocrisy. Before the last election Peter Garrett, that well-known paragon of public sector virtue and capacity, indicated the government’s approach to election commitments. He indicated what the Labor Party’s approach would be to honouring election commitments. I recall, as all senators would, that radio host Steve Price asked Mr Garrett if Labor’s promises could be believed. Mr Garrett replied, as we would remember: ‘When we get in we’ll just change it all.’ He was right. The coalition at that time elected to believe Mr Garrett rather than Mr Rudd in terms of how Labor would operate in government. That is why we asked the then Labor opposition time and again in this chamber, in the other place, in debates, on radio and on TV: will Labor commit to not altering the private health insurance rebate in any way, shape or form? Every time we posed that question, Labor confirmed that there would be no change to the private health insurance rebate. Labor laughed at the very suggestion—how could we possibly ask that; this was new Labor, economically conservative. Labor were in fact now lovers of private health insurance.
Mr Rudd even sent what you might call a policy love letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association. It was a truly charming letter. It was a declaration of love; it was a declaration that psychologists would call unconditional positive regard; it was a declaration of policy, fidelity and commitment. It was a letter which you would have been absolutely delighted to receive as head of an industry association. I will quote from it. It was directed to Dr Michael Armitage, Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association. In the letter the current Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, said:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
That was a lie. Mr Rudd goes on. As if that was not reassurance enough, he says:
Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance …
That was a lie. Mr Rudd goes on, because he appreciated that this was a great concern to the private health insurance industry, a great concern to Australians who hold private health insurance. He knew that this was a matter of serious concern—this was a matter upon which thousands of Australians, if not tens of thousands, if not more, would determine their vote. He says in the letter:
I trust this allays your concerns.
The purpose of this letter was to allay the concerns of the private health insurance industry, to allay the concerns of Australians who held private health insurance and to allay the concerns of Australians for whom this is a very important matter—to allay the concerns of Australians who may well have determined their vote on this issue. Mr Rudd continues in this letter:
Federal Labor values its relationship with the private health insurance sector and we look forward to this continuing regardless of the election outcome on November 24.
We know the election outcome and, sadly, federal Labor did not continue to value that relationship after it took office. The positive relationship is no longer there. Labor did what Mr Garrett predicted. Mr Garrett predicted, ‘Once we get in, we’ll just change it all’—and that is exactly what happened. We know that the government introduced legislation into the parliament to means-test the private health insurance rebate and the parliament rejected that legislation upon its first introduction. It was a broken promise. The parliament was acutely aware of the fact that the government was seeking to break a solemn election promise. The parliament held Labor to its commitment and it quite rightly defeated the bill. On this side of the chamber we did so not just for reasons of keeping faith with the Australian people, which is important—after all, the coalition committed to the Australian people that we would not change the rebate, and we could hardly go back on that; apart from keeping faith with the Australian people there are also extremely good public policy reasons for defeating this legislation and for defending current arrangements.
On this side of the chamber we believe in a mixed health system and we believe in choice. We believe in a strong public system and we believe in a strong private system. We believe in a strong private system because it frees up capacity in public hospitals and because it takes pressure off public hospitals. We know that if this attempt to break a problem is successful, if this attempt to means-test the rebate is successful, people will give up private health insurance. It stands to follow: if you make private health insurance more expensive, some people will give it up and others who might have taken it up will not. And as the pool of people in private health insurance shrinks, fewer people paying premiums will mean higher premiums, which means more people will give it up, premiums will further increase and so it goes. This means as a matter of inexorable logic that there will be more people in the public health system, more people seeking to avail themselves of limited resources. It is a recipe for damage to both the public and the private health sectors. It is clear that Labor hate private health insurance so much that they are prepared to damage the public hospital system in the ideological crusade against the private health system and against choice.
Those on the other side of the chamber are not so silly as to not know that this is bad policy. Those opposite know this is bad policy. Those opposite also know that this is an attempt to break an election promise. Because of those two reasons, which those opposite are acutely aware of, the government needs a cover. The cover for this legislation is that it is all really a part of budget repair. Labor put the budget into deficit, which is another broken promise, and the solution for that broken promise of putting the budget into deficit is apparently to break another promise.
On this side of the chamber we do not actually believe that it is our responsibility to pay off Labor debt. That is the government’s responsibility. They are the government; they are responsible; they ran up the debt; it is their job to pay it down. It is not our job to find the solutions to the problems that they cause—unless, however, we are elected to government, in which case we will again do what we always do: clean up Labor’s mess. But that is not our job from this side of the chamber. Labor’s mismanagement of the budget is not a reason for the coalition to break a commitment that it gave to the Australian people on private health insurance. Budget repair is a false premise for this legislation.
The other part of Labor’s strategy in relation to this legislation is a threat of thoughts—the same threat that the government tried with the ETS. Labor are dropping hints about a double dissolution election on the private health insurance rebate. If you read the newspapers over the last week or so you would see that there are a number of journalists who have been briefed to write that a double dissolution election on the private health insurance rebate is a possibility and the government is actively thinking about it. The PM has also played a more direct role in relation to putting that furphy out there. The Prime Minister on Sunrise on 19 February, when asked about the private health insurance rebate and the timing of the election, said:
Now, as for election timing, what form an election takes, well let’s wait and see.
Very coy. He continues:
My intention, as I’ve said many, many times is for our Government to serve its full term. But let’s just see how this one unfolds.
I have bated breath, I am shivering in terror at the prospect of a double dissolution election on the private health insurance rebate—a double dissolution election on a broken promise. Bring it on! Make our day! Have a double dissolution election on the basis of the private health insurance rebate means test, a breach of a solemn election promise. If the Prime Minister is trying to spook us into supporting this legislation because he thinks we are scared of an election, he had better think again. We are not scared of an election. We are in opposition. The only way for an opposition to get back into government is through an election. As far as we are concerned, the more elections the better, the sooner the better. Bring it on! We would love to fight an election on the private health insurance rebate.
The timing of the reintroduction of this legislation is curious for another reason. We know for all of last year that the greatest moral challenge facing the world was climate change and the need for an emissions trading scheme. There was not a moment to lose. We could not wait another week; we could not wait another month; we could not wait to vote on the ETS legislation until after Copenhagen, let alone after Christmas—there was not a moment to lose. This parliament had to decide; this parliament had to pass the ETS legislation to save the world. We were told that time and again. There was no rationale as to why we could not wait until after Copenhagen or wait to see what the rest of the world might do. We had to get on with it—we had to pass it—and the very first thing the government was going to do after parliament returned, on the very first day of parliament this year, was reintroduce it. It was going to get it through the House as quickly as possible, without a moment to lose. But then, at the earliest available opportunity, when the Senate resumed, the government forgot about that. Now the most pressing matter facing the nation is a means test of the private health insurance rebate and we, the Australian public and the press gallery are meant to sit back and say, ‘Okay, fine, we recognise it now: the private health insurance rebate, yes—great moral challenge.’
This legislation, to means test for the private health insurance rebate, is a great moral challenge, but it is a great moral challenge for those opposite. The moral challenge is for them to honour their election commitment, solemnly given at the last election. This is perhaps the most breathtaking and cynical hypocrisy I have seen in this place. I have never seen so much hand wringing over any piece of legislation as I have seen over the ETS—never. And it had to be put to this parliament and passed through this parliament as quickly as possible. And what happens? We are not going to debate it this week: not for one day, not for one hour, not even for a minute this week are we going to be substantively debating the ETS legislation. No, we are going to be debating a means test on the private health insurance rebate.
You will forgive us if we get a little confused sometimes on this side of the chamber about what constitutes a real and genuine priority, because this government has had so many No. 1 priorities—everything is a priority; everything is a great moral challenge; everything is a test of our great political morality on this side of the chamber. Nothing is ever just a straightforward policy debate, with the parliament debating the relative merits of a piece of legislation. No. With this government every piece of legislation is a great test of the integrity and morality of this side of the chamber. What rot. What utter, utter bunkum. This government is seeking to break an election commitment that it was asked about time and again at the last election. It was asked: would it guarantee that it would not alter the private health insurance rebate in any way, shape or form? And we were mocked when we asked that.
We know Labor well. We know that you do not listen to what Labor say; you look at what they do. We know Labor will seek to break this election commitment. We on this side of the chamber are going to honour the faith of the Australian people. We undertook to defend private health insurance; we are going to do exactly that. We are going to vote against this legislation. This legislation should be defeated, and it is my hope that it is.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2010-02-22,"—I want to follow on from my colleague Senator Fifield and talk about the promise both the Prime Minister and the current Minister for Health and Ageing made to Australians prior to the November 2007 election. Once again, we face a broken promise. Let us have a look at the promise that was made to the Australian people. The media release was titled ‘Liberal Scare Campaign on Private Health Insurance Rebates—Federal Labor to Retain Rebates’. It goes on to say:
On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
                …            …            …
The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates.
This is absolutely untrue.
That was a quote from Minister Roxon in September 2007, prior to the election. Australians are getting quite familiar with broken promises from this government. We had the promise to put downward pressure on grocery prices, and what did we see? A website called GROCERYchoice, and a waste of $10 million—a total farce. We saw the promise to put downward pressure on fuel prices. We have not seen that either, especially with world oil prices at US$70 a barrel and higher. We have seen a promise to be economic conservatives, and in this current financial year alone I think the federal government will borrow $52 billion. That is not very conservative. We have seen the big promise to fix our hospitals by mid-2009 and, if not, they will take them over and the buck will stop with the government.
All this fairer private health insurance legislation is going to do is to put more pressure on our public hospitals. How many will leave private health insurance because of this legislation? Let me quote some figures. The Australian Health Insurance Association, the industry group representing health insurers, argues that as a result of these changes significant numbers—up to one million—will abandon or downgrade their cover, and this will lead to rises in private health insurance premiums as health insurers seek to recoup higher costs. It is as simple as that. What we are doing is putting a tax on private health insurance. As John Laws often used to say on the radio when I would be out in the sheep yards drenching sheep or in the shearing shed or whatever, the more you tax something the less you have of it—a good saying. Here is a situation where the government is simply going to tax private health insurance more. Forget about the promises to the Australian people prior to the election—they are going to change the rules now. They do not care about what they said to the Australian people prior to the election, like with many issues; they are going to put in this means test and increase the tax on private health insurance.
The Australian Private Hospitals Association argues that Treasury estimates that 99.7 per cent of people will retain their private health insurance as a result of this measure cannot be trusted, due to the complexity of the proposed arrangements. They are saying those figures cannot be trusted. So, the more we tax people for private health insurance, the more that people will leave private health insurance. That will simply put more pressure on an already overloaded public health system. I was talking recently to doctors in Inverell, the magnificent country town I am fortunate enough to live in. We have got doctors running their surgeries there in the local community who are pulling their services out of the local hospital. Why? Because they are simply working too hard. They have every day in their surgery booked up seeing patients, then they get a call to accident-emergency at the hospital, then they cannot service their patients in their surgery. Then they are working late into the nights and on the weekends, so they are withdrawing their services because they are simply being burnt out.
Now we risk seeing so many leaving or downgrading their private health insurance because of this legislation, and that will simply put more pressure on our public health system, our public hospitals, and place more work on these already overloaded, overburdened doctors along with nurses, many of whom have to work double shifts when other nurses call in sick. Budgets are also getting burnt out because there are too many desks and not enough beds, with the level of bureaucracy in the health system in New South Wales. What the government is doing here will add more pressure to those hospitals. This is simple stupidity. It will achieve nothing. The only thing it will do is tell the Australian people that Prime Minister Rudd and Minister Roxon cannot keep their word—they cannot be trusted. They gave a guarantee to the Australian people and now they are going back on their word. That is a simple fact—no argument anywhere; that it is the fact of it. All the quotes are there.
As I have said, this is a tax on health. And, when this tax comes into effect, where is the money going to go? Mr Rudd has said that the money is needed for health reform. But Minister Roxon has said that the money will be used for e-health. Then she said the money would be for new medicines. Then Treasurer Swan put a spanner in the works by saying the money would be used to pay for the increase in the age pension. How confusing is it when we have the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the health minister all giving a different view on where this money, this saving, is going to go. Then we have the exaggerated spin that the health system is going to cost the country up to $100 billion by the year 2050. It is a wonder they did not do the forward estimates out to perhaps the next century—it might have been $200 billion, and that could be used in the media as political spin. It is simply farcical to say what it is going to cost by 2050. I am sure there will be a lot of changes in budgets and all sorts of things by then, unless the government really believes it will still be in government by 2050. With broken promises like these and many others, it will be lucky to be in government come the year 2011.
In summary, the real problem here is that, when you take away the incentive for people to participate in private health insurance, more are going to drop out. The big problem we have then is that those who stay with private health insurance are going to have to pay more. There will simply be fewer people paying the bills for our private health insurance companies. They have their fixed costs all the time; those who remain with the system will have to pay more. So all you are doing is passing on the cost. The 30 per cent rebate was a fair rebate system put in by the previous government to encourage people to join private health insurance. For every dollar they saved, they actually contributed two dollars or more to the health system. That is what happens with the system as it stands now. But the government wants to change that. Now they are arguing about where the money that they intend to save is going to go. Surely the Senate has an obligation to keep people in this place honest. The Senate’s job is to make sure that the Prime Minister and Health Minister Roxon keep their word. They cannot simply lie to the Australian people before an election and change their minds after the election and go back on their word. Is it any wonder that people become cynical about politicians when you have these core promises and then great backflips when they simply change their minds?
The changes to the private health insurance rebate are the latest phase in Labor’s unrelenting war against private health insurance. Labor hates private health insurance. The coalition introduced an open-ended private health insurance rebate because for every rebated dollar a privately insured person contributes two more dollars to our health system as a whole. We all know the cost of health is huge. No matter where you go in Australia, the biggest issue that people are concerned about is health, whether it be a hospital system, our aged-care facilities or whatever else, even CAP packages for home care facilities. One thing Australians want is a good health system. But this legislation is going to give us a worse health system. It is going to put more of a burden on our hospitals, more of a workload on those people who work in those hospitals and more costs on those hospitals already pleading for money, and encourage more people to leave the private health insurance system. As I said, this was a core promise in the last election along with many other promises that the Rudd government made. Now they wish to change their minds. I, for one, will not be supporting this along with all my colleagues on this side. Why? Because a promise is being broken and that is simply wrong in itself.
If you make a promise to the Australian people, you should keep your word, not just do a backflip on it and say to the people, ‘Well, we don’t care about what we said to you before the election. We are going to now change the rules so that those who earn more will pay more.’ This is the old Labor strategy: penalise success and reward failure. I am sorry, but that does not work well in a free-enterprise system. You do not make the poor rich by making the rich poor. We need to encourage business. We need to make the most effective use of the dollars that the government has to spend. We need to honour our word. We need to encourage people to remain in private health insurance. Otherwise we will simply overload the hospital system.
My colleague Senator Fifield touched on that great moral challenge that faced us, the emissions trading scheme, and how it was so urgent that it be passed last year before Copenhagen, before the rest of the world acted, while Australia was producing 1.4 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gases—and we were going to reduce that by five per cent come the year 2020. Thank goodness the Senate did not pass it. We said at least wait until after Copenhagen. Imagine if we had passed it and locked our nation into that great enormous tax for generations while the rest of the world was doing nothing. Would we have cooled the globe? Would we have reduced the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere? Would we have lowered the sea levels? We would not have done any of that. We would have put a $115 billion tax on industries in our nation that would have been passed on to the average Joe Blow in the street. So the Senate did its job and did it well on the emissions trading scheme.
The spin was put out that we had to act now to save the world. But, as Senator Fifield said, where is it on the agenda today? Where was it three weeks ago, when we had the first week of sitting? It was not back here. It was being stalled and talked about for a few days in the other place. Now it is not here for us to look at. Instead we are here to debate a broken promise. As I said, we cannot support broken promises. We cannot support encouraging people to leave private health insurance or downgrade their private health insurance. We cannot support overloading an already overloaded and stressed hospital system right throughout Australia. Hence we shall be here as one voting this legislation down, as we should. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-02-22,"—The private hospital system in this country treats 40 per cent of all patients, being over three million annually, and performs over 60 per cent of all surgery in Australia each year, on over a million patients. The Productivity Commission looked into public and private health care and found that private hospitals treat patients more cheaply than public hospitals in this country. As we know, we have an ageing population. We have been told, and we do not disagree, that it will more than double the demand in hospital admissions by 2030. Why would the government be wanting to discourage participation in private health cover? The further one examines the question of providing health care in Australia the more obvious it becomes that the cost sharing of this burden is critical if we are to at least maintain, if not improve, health care for Australians.
It is no wonder that the Labor Party, prior to the last election, committed itself to continuing the rebate for private health to Australians. The Prime Minister, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, did this by media release, as has been referred to, by speeches and in writing. Why is Labor going back on an election promise in a climate that would surely be encouraging greater participation, not less, in private health care? If the Productivity Commission is to be believed, then the government should be encouraging the more cost-effective and efficient private hospital and healthcare systems. If the statistics available to me, as I have mentioned, are that 40 per cent of Australians are treated privately and 60 per cent of surgery is done privately, what is this telling us about the desires and actions of the community? Clearly, they want to see a strong private health system and they want to see a well-funded and reasonably accessed public health system.
I turn to young people. What is going to be the impact of these legislative changes that are before us, if approved by the Senate, on young people? What is the message that we are sending to younger members of the community at the very time when we should be saying to them, ‘Given your earning capacity, you should be looking to your own resources to provide your medical and hospital cover into the future’? Naturally, from a systemic point of view, this is the very group that we actually do want to be funding private health cover because we know that they will draw less upon it than their parents’ or their grandparents’ generations. This is called, according to the documentation, a fairer health insurance incentive. I do not see the incentive and I do not see where it is fairer.
I turn from younger to older members of our community. We are living longer and we are healthier than our parents’ and grandparents’ generations. Participation in private health cover by older members of the community must be a decided health advantage, from an administrative perspective, and I cannot see the rationale of the government wanting to put this at risk. We must encourage older people in the community to stay in private health insurance for their own good and for that of the overall system.
The Productivity Commission shows that costs for patients in the private hospital system are lower. The system provides safer treatment and costs the taxpayer less money. Figures available to me from Health Expenditure Australia indicate that the government spent $30.8 billion on public hospital services in 2007-08 in this country, and we know the figure grows annually. By contrast, the government spent $1.7 billion on private hospitals through private health insurance. The figures look very attractive to me. If they are accurate, then I am at a loss to understand why the government is hell-bent on forcing private health insurers out of that system, to become more reliant on the public health system.
We are all acutely aware that the health budget is assuming an ever-increasing proportion of our revenue base at the national level and at the level of the states and territories. When I commenced work in the early seventies, there were some 10 people working to support one who was not working. At the moment, that ratio is around four to one, and the Treasurer told us recently it will diminish to fewer than two people working to support each who is not. Given the predominance of health as a cost burden to the economy, surely logic dictates that we must encourage people to take responsibility for their own health needs, to invest in their own private health insurance and to remove themselves from being a burden on the public system. Further pressure on the already overloaded public health system will surely cause it to implode. From the perspective of one who does contribute to the private health system and who has the primary care responsibility for an aged parent, it is blindingly obvious to me that every effort must be made to protect, preserve and encourage participation in private health for as many members of the Australian community as can afford it.
The point should not be lost that it is taxpayers who fund the public health system, through our Medicare levy. As this government went to the last election promising to leave the levy unchanged from that of the Howard government, it is incumbent on this government to go to the people in a general election and seek a mandate to interfere with a process that is delivering a well-balanced, if under funded, mix between private and public service provision in this country. The government has this opportunity during 2010 or 2011—when the next general election is held—to put this question to the people of Australia, rather than waste the Senate’s time in trying to push the legislation through the Senate.
I turn to the administration of rebates. The current rebate—as we all know, because we put in our tax returns—is simple, transparent, easy to understand and easy to audit. I have been informed that, under the new proposals, there will be no fewer than 10 levels of entitlement or surcharge depending on a person’s income and age. How will people work out where they stand in this? It is another huge administrative burden, another cost to government and another cost to the private health funds. If the government proposes that it will enjoy savings as a result of its amendments to the private healthcare rebates, then what costs have been factored in for the administrative burden that it will create? If history is any indicator, I suspect the savings will be minimal and they will be more than taken up in administrative costs for the government and the private sector.
I would like to refer to funding in the health system as a health pool of money—and to the effect. Senator Williams made reference to the 30 per cent rebate. Think of it in these terms: when the government pays 30 per cent rebate to a privately insured person, it pays 30c of each dollar into that pool, but, more importantly, the privately insured person pays 70 per cent or 70c into that pool. When that person leaves private health insurance, the government gets its 30c back, but the pool loses the other 70c that the privately insured person was previously willing to contribute. This fact should not be lost. The pool loses more than the government gains. Where the sense is in reducing the rebate and discouraging people is absolutely beyond me. I have not yet seen a cost-benefit analysis that points to this being anything other than another tax on health insurance and a cost burden on—guess who?—middle income earners in this country. But as my colleague Senator Fifield said, this comes as no surprise, as this Labor government’s ill-conceived attack on middle Australia can scarcely be concealed.
The interesting point to be made, whilst the government is attacking middle Australia, is that more than one million households earning less than $26,000 per annum take out private health insurance, on what we would regard as a minimal family income. You might immediately say, ‘Yes, but they will not be impacted by the government’s tax grab.’ Of course, they are. Despite the fact that they are under the threshold, they will be adversely affected, in two ways. The first, is the size of the pool to which I have referred. The pool gets smaller; they are disadvantaged. The second is that they will be heavily impacted, as more people queue at public hospitals and outpatient facilities. So do not think this is only an attack on middle Australia—those who this government seems so keen to pull down. It is an attack across the board.
What does the government itself say will be the impact of attacking private health insurance in this way? The government estimates that tens of thousands of people will drop their cover. It recognises that, as people drop out of private health insurance, then premiums must rise for those who remain. And what happens to the pool? It rapidly becomes a puddle. In my own state of Western Australia, the impact will be greater. Why? Because a higher proportion of people in WA carry private health insurance, so therefore a higher proportion of people will be at risk. But this comes as no surprise. There will be no defence on the other side from Western Australian Labor senators or others, because they too seem to have forgotten the state of Western Australia.
I have spoken about the young and I have spoken about older members of our community. What do young families do? We all know, particularly those of us who have had young families, that people starting families or adding to their families are the very ones who need to be covered by private health insurance. Interest rates are rising and capacity to meet mortgage commitments is being stretched even further. Private health cover is an easy cost to give up. The very people who should not be giving up private health insurance will be those who are forced to do so.
The Prime Minister, having repeatedly told the Australian electorate that he would not alter health insurance rebates, now proposes to do so. This is the person who was going to fix public hospitals around Australia by June last year. As I remember, it was his intention to take over the administration of public hospitals if they were not, to use his expression, fixed. This is another broken promise. All we have seen is a deterioration of the confidence which the Australian community has in the public health system, the Prime Minister and his Minister for Health and Ageing.
This in no way reflects on the excellence and commitment of those who provide health and hospital services, private and public, in this country. Nobody in this chamber would deny or dispute their professionalism. Like most Australians, I am open in my admiration and appreciation of the doctors, the nurses, those who provide complementary medical services, the other paid providers and the army of volunteers who worked tirelessly in our public and private hospitals to render what must be the world’s best health service.
Anyone who doubts the excellence of our service need go no further than to talk to young doctors, nurses and health providers from the UK system. They say to me: ‘Why is this being done? To work in the Australian public health system compared to that of the UK is like going on a holiday.’ I have been asked why we are attacking private health cover when we have got the balance right in this country. As we know, it will only lead to breaking an already stretched public health system by encouraging those in private health insurance to divest themselves of their cover.
As a person who has served on the boards of both private and public health facilities in two states of Australia, I can assure the chamber and the Prime Minister that any effort to centralise control of the public health system in Canberra will be a total and unmitigated disaster. I recall my experience in a public health facility in Western Australia during the transition from local board membership of public facilities to centralised management in the metropolitan area of Perth. And no—to answer those who ask the question—the board was not dominated by Liberal or coalition parliamentarians. It was dominated by local members of the community with a passion for the provision of health services in that community, a group who absolutely and utterly felt disenfranchised when the decision was made to go across to the metropolitan area.
I can assure you, Madam Acting Deputy President, the experience of those who used that system was that, following its centralisation in the metropolitan area, the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of that service deteriorated rapidly. I can also assure you that central management now not a few kilometres away but rather some thousands of kilometres away from the locations in which the services are rendered will undoubtedly lead to a further deterioration in the quality of those services.
If this proposal has no basis in the provision of high-quality medical and hospital care, if it does not stack up economically, from a cost-benefit point of view, if it is not supported by the medical profession or other health service providers, then I am left pondering: what is this government’s motive to break an election promise and impose added costs on an already stretched system? The answer, I fear, is that it is nothing other than a new tax. And why do we need the new tax? We have heard the variety of answers by an earlier speaker, by the Prime Minister, by his health minister and by his Treasurer. The Treasurer spelt it out during his budget speech and subsequently as being the need to increase the age pension support. But surely it has not been lost on others that the aged are the very group who are going to be further disadvantaged by more pressure on the public health system as those in private health insurance leave it and add to the burden on public health care provision.
Following the budget in 2009, the coalition proposed to this government an increase in the excise on tobacco as an alternative to this flawed tax proposal. The advantages are obvious to anybody: lower tobacco consumption, less pressure on the entire health and hospital system and, obviously, less cost to the taxpayer. But we saw Labor fight and refuse to accept what was an entirely sensible measure.
We have been faced with the national embarrassment of yet another failed government scheme in the last week, being the $2.3 billion roof insulation program. This is yet another example, regrettably, where inexperience, incompetence and arrogance—this time by Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett—has further eroded taxpayers’ money and confidence in public administration. We are all lumped into this failing of confidence. It is ironic that the cost to the Australian community of this failed program will probably equal the so-called savings to be made by this government in its changes to the private health insurance rebate.
In conclusion, if this Prime Minister wants to reverse his own strongly stated and frequently repeated election commitment of 2007, then this bill should be withdrawn from this chamber and the Prime Minister should have the intestinal fortitude and the common decency to go back to the people of Australia in an election and allow the community to decide their own position on private health insurance.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-02-22,"—I will confine my remarks this evening to this particular bill, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. Then I will have more to say in the context of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. As I indicated during last year’s debate on the fairer private health insurance incentives package of bills, I do not believe that there is adequate evidence to support changes to the private health insurance rebate nor changes to the Medicare levy surcharge. This package of bills effectively penalises those Australians who choose to have private health insurance, by making it more costly, and then seeks to make them retain their more expensive coverage because, if they cancel their policy, they will be penalised with a higher Medicare levy surcharge. It is almost a case of lose-lose. And it reminds me of that great song by the Clash—I know that Senator Conroy was a fan of the Clash—Should I stay or should I go, which had the following lyrics:
Should I stay or should I go now
If I go there will be trouble
An’ if I stay it will be double
That reminds me of what these bills are about.
The government concedes that Australians will be impacted if the private health insurance rebate is means tested and that many will choose to drop their cover as a result. But it claims the numbers that will be insignificant and says increases to the Medicare levy surcharge will deter this occurrence. Those assertions are worth analysing. Treasury estimates, in fact, that 2.3 million Australians with annual incomes above $75,000 for singles and $150,000 for couples will be impacted by means testing the rebate.
The Australian Health Insurance Association forecasts that up to one million Australians will abandon or downgrade their private health cover. The issue of downgrading health cover is key here. Indeed, what the government is not accounting for in their assessment of the numbers—which they call insignificant—are those who will reduce their level of cover in response to these measures. If this package of bills is passed, many Australians will reduce their private health insurance cover to just the bare minimum so that their premiums stay low but they are not subject to the Medicare levy surcharge. The effect of that will be that you will have people with ancillary cover no longer taking that out. There will be pressure on the public system as a result of that and it will cause an upward pressure on premiums for private health insurance.
The one per cent Medicare levy surcharge was first introduced in 1997 and, in line with other measures, including the private health insurance rebate, was designed to ease the pressure on the public hospital system by encouraging greater uptake of private health insurance by those who could afford to do so, based on their annual incomes. Changes to the Medicare levy surcharge passed in late 2008 saw the first change to the income thresholds in July last year, increasing them for individuals from $70,000 to $73,000 and for families from $140,000 to $146,000, and increased them by $1,500 for the second and each subsequent dependent child. The proposed changes were much more significant, effectively in line with inflation. I acknowledge the negotiations that I had in good faith with the minister to bring the changes to the initially proposed thresholds to a more realistic level. The thresholds were introduced back in 1997, when Peter Costello was Treasurer. Initially, the they were $50,000 and $75,000. Clearly, there needed to be change. I thought that a satisfactory compromise was arrived at to allow for CPI increases. It was agreed that the Productivity Commission should look at the whole issue of the public-private hospital mix. That final report was handed down in December of last year. I propose to go into further detail in the context of the other package of bills relating to this issue. Now is not the appropriate time.
The government seeks to increase the Medicare levy surcharge by 0.25 and 0.5 percentage points based on a three tier system. I do not believe there is adequate evidence to suggest that increasing the Medicare levy surcharge percentage now will encourage more Australians to take up private health insurance cover and I believe that means testing the rebate will only result in those with insurance policies reducing their levels of coverage to just ancillaries cover in many cases.
I admire the intent behind the second reading amendment moved by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Australian Greens, which was that the moneys raised by these changes to the Medicare levy surcharge, if successful, should be invested in mental health programs. But that begs a bigger question about the funding of mental health services in this country. Funding mental health services should be a priority for any government. We as citizens should expect to have a system in place so that if anyone needs assistance with a mental problem they can get the standard of care that is necessary and deserved. My concern is that hypothecating this revenue would be a get-out-of-jail card for the government. Seeking this pool of money absolves them, in a sense. This is money that should come out of consolidated revenue in the context of mental health programs. I agree that mental health is an area which needs more funding and improved services. However, seeking to do that through this mechanism and through what I consider to be a flawed piece of legislation, given the impact that it could have on the mix between the public and private systems, is not the appropriate way to go.
The potential for unintended consequences from these bills is quite significant. Either way, neither these proposed changes to the Medicare levy surcharge nor means testing the private health insurance rebate will effectively assist our heavily pressured public health system. As such, I cannot support this package of bills.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2010-02-22,"—I rise to make some comments on the changes the government is proposing to the private health insurance rebates. The chamber would be well aware that after the introduction of Medicare in 1984 membership of private health funds fell. By 1998, only 30.4 per cent of the population was covered by private health insurance. We know that, following coalition measures—and very good measures they were—private health insurance climbed up to around 45 per cent of the population or 9.7 million Australians. This was as a result of the recognition by the coalition that there needed to be a greater incentive for people to invest in their own health care where they could. The increases to those rebates certainly provided that incentive for many people across Australia. We saw an increase of around 15 per cent in the number of people taking up private health insurance.
The government now wants to make some significant changes to that private health insurance rebate system, which can only be described as absolute stupidity on the part of the government when we look at the situation we find ourselves in with health. There is absolutely no doubt that health is the key issue—the priority issue—for Australians right across the country, no more so than in regional areas. My very good colleague Senator Joyce travels and knows exactly what I am talking about. In regional areas, the impacts are felt even harder.
What we are seeing from this government with the changes to the rebate is, as I said, incredible stupidity. The changes are going to do two significant things. It is going to increase the pressure on the public health system. How stupid is that? Anybody who is paying any attention at all to the affairs of this nation knows that the public hospital system is under siege in being able to provide the necessary level of care that it needs to give people. I take the opportunity to give enormous amounts of credit to the doctors and nurses who work in that health system. The incredible degradation of the system is by no means the result of the work and care that those health professionals put in but purely a result of state Labor governments.
And what does this government want to do? It wants to change the private health insurance rebate system to put more pressure on hospitals. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that if you take away the incentive for people to continue with their private health insurance they are going to cease that contribution and look to the public system to support them. It is going to put on the public system a significant amount of pressure that currently does not exist—pressure on a system that is already at breaking point. How stupid is it for the Rudd Labor government to do that? At the same time, by taking people out of the system—out of paying for their private health insurance—the costs are actually going to increase for those remaining members within the private health insurance system. It looks as though the premiums will increase by around 10 per cent, possibly more, by 2010-11.
Where is the sense in making those two incredibly significant changes within the health system? For this Labor government to make a decision that is going to put increased pressure on the public hospital system and increase the premiums for those who want to contribute to private health insurance is beyond belief, but it is just another example of the complete dislocation of this arrogant government from the people out in the streets in this country—the mums, the dads, the working families whom this Prime Minister purportedly represents. They are the ones who are going to be hit by these changes, and they are going to be hit hard. And what for? We know that the existing measures are providing the incentive to ensure that a decent level of health care is provided in this country. We know that that level of incentive encourages so many people to invest in private health insurance, which takes away so much of the pressure that is about to be put on our public hospital system.
What is quite extraordinary about this particular issue is that it is yet another example of the Rudd Labor government’s broken promises. It is starting to sound like a broken record, because the hits—those broken promises—just keep on coming. But the Australian people are starting to wise up. They are noticing exactly how many of those promises that the Rudd Labor government made before the last election have been broken, and the list is never ending. There are hundreds of broken promises. Sitting on the side of the chamber; we know that—we live it every day. But it is not just us now; the people of Australia are starting to pay attention and they are noticing Rudd’s broken Labor promises. This one to do with the private health insurance rebates is an absolute corker. I quote Nicola Roxon, who on 26 September issued a press release as the then shadow minister for health. She said:
Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the private health insurance rebates. The Liberal Party scare campaign this morning reared its head in South Australia. On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
The Rudd Labor government made it crystal clear that it would not be changing those rebates, yet what do we see now? An extraordinary broken promise by this government. What I find incredibly sad is that the people of Australia believed Kevin Rudd when he said he was going to fix our hospitals. They believed Nicola Roxon when she said that they were committed to retaining the rebates. The Australian people believed the Rudd Labor government when they said those things. And what do we see now? Just a string of broken promises. It is worth bringing to the Senate’s attention the list of the promises that the now government made on private health insurance. Take the one I have just indicated to the chamber. I quote a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association by the Prime Minister on 20 November 2007:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.
Hello? Haven’t we got in front of us, right now, the taking away of those rebates? So what are the people of Australia supposed to think? What are they supposed to think when they heard, before the last election, that the government was ‘committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates’, and now they want to rip them away? I will tell you what they think: that this government is full of nothing but broken promises and that they cannot be trusted. People are starting to realise what a phoney this Prime Minister is, because this string of broken promises is starting to become endless. In February 2008 in the Australian the Prime Minister said:
The private health insurance rebate remains unchanged and will remain unchanged …
Well, it is starting to look as if it is trying to be mightily changed now.
So do we assume that the Prime Minister just thought, ‘Gee, it might be a good idea to break that promise; let’s give this one a whirl—I’ve got a few others on the go at the moment; I might as well add another one to the list.’ And they use this rubbish about it being to ‘make sure we’ve got the funding to cope with the global financial crisis’ every time there is a broken promise. Every time this government fall off the rails, they try to hide underneath the whole existence of the global financial crisis. It is not on. The Australian people are not buying it; they are not believing it now for one minute—because the government have form when it comes to broken promises.
In May 2008, on Macquarie Radio, health minister Roxon said:
… we continue to support the 30 per cent, 35 per cent and 40 per cent rebate for those Australians who choose to take out private health insurance …
In October 2008, in a speech at the Australian Health Insurance Association conference, Minister Roxon said:
Private health insurance consumers will still be able to claim the 30 to 40 per cent rebate, and the Lifetime Health Cover incentives will remain in place.
On 24 February 2009, in the Age, again, health minister Roxon, said:
The Government is firmly committed to retain the existing private health insurance rebates …
Do you know what this says, Mr Acting Deputy President? This says that this government cannot be trusted, not for one moment. They are a government of spin, and the people of Australia are seeing through it. And what they are seeing is this: if they cannot trust what Labor said before the last election—which now they obviously cannot, with this string of broken promises—how on earth are they going to trust anything the Labor government say running up to the next election? The thing is: they will not. They simply will not trust the government, because they know they have form. There is a string of broken promises.
As my very good colleague said earlier: if the Prime Minister thinks it is all very scary to threaten an election on the private health insurance rebates, bring it on! Bring it on, because I can tell you right now that those people out on the ground across this country have wised up to this Prime Minister and his broken promises. Does he really think we do not want to go out on the streets and ask the Australian people, running up to an election campaign, ‘Do you really trust Labor on health?’ Do you think that? Let’s just cast our minds back to what the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, said before the last election—and this is what they will be saying during the campaign. What was it that he said? That’s right, he said: ‘Kevin Rudd will fix our hospitals.’ Isn’t that amazing, Senator Joyce: ‘Kevin Rudd will fix our hospitals’.
—Unbelievable.
—Not only that; he said that, if state governments had not improved services by 2009:
A Rudd Labor Government will seek to take financial control of Australia’s 750 public hospitals …
That was to be by mid-2009. What is it now? I think it might be February 2010. He broke his promise to the Australian people; he misled them. He hoodwinked the Australian people into believing that he would actually fix the public hospitals, that he actually cared enough to fix the public hospitals, that he actually wanted to fix the public hospitals. And guess what? He is the Prime Minister, and he can make the decisions—and he can, but he chose not to; he broke his promise to the Australian people. This very issue, health, is the most important issue to people across Australia, and he simply turned his back on the Australian people and said, ‘Too hard; can’t do that one.’ What was it he said? He said something about a compromise with the state governments. So he has gone from being all hairy-chested, beating his chest before the last election campaign saying, ‘I’ll fix the hospitals; the buck will stop with me’—
—‘After I cool the planet.’
—Thank you, Senator Joyce. I will take the interjection: after he cools the planet, of course! He is now saying, ‘Oh, there might be a compromise,’ and now he wants a referendum. ‘Gosh, what will I do next, I wonder?’ says the Prime Minister, because he certainly did not do—
—He’ll shake that sauce bottle, I’m sure!
—He will certainly shake that sauce bottle, Senator Abetz—probably in consternation that he does not have a clue about health and does not have a clue how to even think about attempting to fix the problems in health.
The people of Australia have absolutely wised up to this now, because they can remember—they know. So if the Prime Minister wants to have an election on health: bring it on! Bring it on tomorrow; bring it on the day after—we will have it whenever he likes. This is about doing the right thing by the Australian people, and he has not—not for one moment—because he has simply broken the promises he made to the Australian people.
Isn’t it interesting that, with all the huff and bluster and hype that goes on, Justine Elliot, the member for Richmond, has not said boo in the other chamber about health? It is just a phoney government. It is so full of spin; it is quite extraordinary. It says one thing and does another. It is all talk, no action. It is all about words, words, words and spin, spin, spin and, ‘Gee, I wonder if I do something with this hand over here, and then something with this hand over here, they won’t notice that I’ve broken this promise over here, and they won’t notice that I, the Prime Minister, have not done this particular thing—I’ll just try to trick them with a sleight of hand.’ The Australian people are too smart for that. They are much too smart for that, and without doubt they are noticing what an absolutely phoney sham is this government, which has not delivered a single thing for the people of Australia. It is all talk, no action. You cannot trust this government. That is obvious. You cannot trust it to keep its promises. You certainly cannot trust it to manage money. What was all of that about—
—You can’t trust them in your roofs, either.
—You can’t trust them in your roofs, either—thank you, Senator Abetz. What was all that talk before the last election? I remember now—Kevin Rudd was an economic conservative, wasn’t he? How on earth can you trust them when on one hand he says he is an economic conservative and on the other hand he runs up $120 billion worth of debt? It is easy to shout the bar when you are spending somebody else’s money, and that is exactly what this Prime Minister is doing. He cannot be trusted to keep his promises. He cannot be trusted to manage money. It is an absolutely appalling indictment that he is not reeling in shame, having said to the Australian people that he would fix our hospitals and that the buck stopped with him. The buck obviously stopped right next to him and then kept on going; it certainly has not stopped anywhere near him at the moment. He has just flicked it to some kind of compromise and now he needs some kind of referendum to ask the Australian people their opinion, after he promised them that he would fix the hospitals. Goodness knows they need fixing.
In regional Australia, as I said at the outset, it is worse than it is anywhere else. In New South Wales, we had the situation recently where Dubbo hospital had to borrow bandages from the local vet to be able to provide services. We had another situation at a north-western hospital where they had to stop giving their patients meat because the state Labor government had not paid the butcher’s bill. That is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the appalling standard of our public hospital system, and it was this Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who said he would fix it. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to see that he has not.
If there is one thing that the Prime Minister should probably take on board, it is that when you make a promise you keep it. If you are going to make a promise—especially one as big as fixing the public hospitals—you had better keep it. The people of Australia are going to come after you, Prime Minister, because of this broken promise. Now that they do not trust you on this, they are not going to trust you on anything. You are not fair dinkum; they know that. The Australian people see every broken promise and they know he is not fair dinkum. They know he is phoney. They know he will not keep his word.
Now we have legislation to change the private health insurance rebates. It is so interesting, as my good colleague Senator Fifield said earlier, that one minute it is the ETS: ‘We’ve gotta cool the globe; it’s absolutely, vitally, incredibly important!.’ When we finished last year, the minister, Penny Wong, said: ‘We’re going to bring this back straight away; it’s so important—
—The moral issue of our time.
—it’s the moral issue of our time.’ And now, first thing back, we have private health insurance rebates. What happened to that moral issue of our time? Mind you, there are probably a few different moral issues of our time, depending on what the Prime Minister happens to be talking about—the issue of the day. It is just so phoney and unbelievable.
On this side of the chamber, we know that this government is all talk and no action. But this is not just about this side of the chamber; this is about the Australian people, who are now saying to the Prime Minister, ‘You promised to fix our hospitals; you let us down.’ They believed you before but, Prime Minister, they are saying they are not going to believe you anymore. They are not going to believe your promises because they know that you cannot be trusted.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-22,"—It is an absolute delight to follow Senator Nash. What an excellent contribution she has made in highlighting the hypocrisy of the government. Four days before the 2007 election, Mr Rudd said:
More than ever, Australia needs a government that will help the nation fulfil its promise rather than a government which makes promises it cannot fulfil.
Today in this Senate, 813 days after Mr Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister, we as a Senate are being asked to clear the path for him to break yet another one of his many election promises. I, for one, and the coalition will not be party to allowing the Prime Minister to break yet another one of his election promises.
Wasn’t it galling before the last election to listen to the pomposity, to see the licking of the lips and the flicking of the hair—the caricature that he has now become? It was sincerity writ large! Hand on his heart, he said: ‘I’ve always been an economic conservative. It’s so vital that a government doesn’t break its promises, that a government doesn’t make promises it cannot fulfil.’ This is a promise that Prime Minister Rudd can fulfil; he simply does not want to because he is still engaged in the old concept of class warfare from 50 years ago. That is what this is all about—it is to hit the aspirational classes of Australia. It is to try to cause division within our community.
It also highlights that the Prime Minister is on track to break yet another election promise. Remember his hand-on-heart promise in relation to whales? He was going to take Japan to the International Court of Justice. He sent the Oceanic Viking into the southern seas to gain evidence. Now, all of a sudden, it is: ‘We are going to take Japan to the International Court of Justice in November this year.’ I will make this wager: the federal election will be called before November 2011 and Mr Rudd will seek to escape from that election promise. We then had the fuel tax promise, the GROCERYchoice promise, the GP superclinics promise, the computers in schools promise, and so the list goes on. Broken, broken, broken—every single one of his promises is now simply empty air.
What about the biggest of them all, the ‘greatest moral challenge of our time’? What was that again? That’s right—climate change. He said 22 times before the last federal election that climate change was the ‘greatest moral challenge of our time’. He said it 22 times! It was a lot of hot air, yet again; a lot of blah, blah, blah; a lot of blather; a lot of talk and absolutely no action. Indeed this was ‘the greatest moral challenge of our time’. It was so important that it was going to be a double dissolution issue and was going to be brought back first thing when the parliament resumed this year.
After a couple weeks of sitting and having been through the House, I had a look at today’s order of business in the Senate and was surprised that the government that orders the business in this place thought that the greater moral challenge for this place was not to deal with climate change but to help Prime Minister Rudd break an election promise. This is now Mr Rudd’s version of moral challenges. The great moral challenge for him is no longer climate change but the breaking, yet again, of an election promise. What we have here on the Senate order of business is the private health insurance legislation, then the crimes amendment, then trade practices. You then turn over the page and there are messages from the House of Representatives. Even the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill is a lot more important all of a sudden than the climate change policies.
If it is the greatest moral challenge of our time, I simply ask Mr Rudd: with all his moralising, why does private health insurance and a breach of an election promise all of a sudden increase in status and stature? The answer is that he knows that the opinion polls have shifted on him on this issue. We now know that the barometer for Mr Rudd, with his great moralising, is not what he believes in but what he thinks the opinion polls are telling him at any given time. That is why this great moralist said during the election campaign that he had always been an economic conservative, yet in his first speech bagged out Margaret Thatcher’s economic policies. Go figure. How do those two match? A classic example was when he first got into parliament: Mr Rudd thought the ticket to ride to make him popular would be to bag out Margaret Thatcher. Then, when economic conservatism had won the day, all of a sudden he had been an economic conservative all his life.
A man who changes his spots so willingly, who switches and changes so unashamedly, is hardly one to try to moralise—yet that he did. Twenty-two times before the last election, the greatest moral challenge of our time was climate change; more recently, it did not even rate a mention in one of his Australia Day speeches. But breaking an election promise on private health insurance is now undoubtedly the great moral challenge of his time. I indicated at the commencement of my remarks that four days before the 2007 election Mr Rudd said:
More than ever, Australia needs a government that will help the nation fulfil its promise rather than a government which makes promises it cannot fulfil.
It just happens that, also four days before the last election, one Mr Rudd, federal Labor leader, wrote to Dr Armitage, Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association. In his second paragraph, which I quote in full, he said:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per rebates for older Australians.
Nothing could have been clearer than that. It was a cast-iron guarantee. Indeed, he condemned the Liberal and National parties for running an unprincipled scare campaign on this issue. The Australian people today know that our scare campaign was not a scare campaign but a correct character assessment of the now Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition. We knew that he would not be supporting private health insurance. We knew that he would not be supporting the aspirational classes of Australia. We knew what he was up to. Yet he was able to skate through, make these promises and reassure the Australian people. But now he has to be brought to account, and brought to account he will be by us as an opposition and by the Australian people.
The Australian people are now sick and tired of this legacy of broken promises, of all this talk and of all this moralising. Everything is put in moral terms. If you do not agree with Kevin Rudd on climate change, you are somehow immoral. If you do not support him now on his broken promises, I wonder what his explanation would be. Undoubtedly, he would have some moral construct within which to frame his assertions. But the simple fact is that this is a broken promise pure and simple and nothing that he says will be able to get him out of it.
Let us keep in mind that 11 million Australians have private health insurance and each one of them can expect to pay more for their private health insurance premiums because of what Mr Rudd wants to do. That is particularly bad for low-income families and it is bad for older Australians. It is also very bad for the public hospital system. As you and I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the more people that get out of private health insurance, the greater the burden on the public hospital system will be, meaning that that system which is supposed to genuinely look after the needy will not be able to look after them as well as they otherwise would be because fewer people will be in private health insurance.
I still recall the days of Mr Paul Keating when he required some hospital treatment and, miraculously, he got in the front of the queue. I understand that it is now occurring in the electorate of Robertson as well—that certain people are assisting people to the front of the queue. That is all very good for some people if they have Labor Party connections in the state of New South Wales, but that should not be the basis upon which our health system operates, and that is what Mr Rudd seeks to engender with these changes.
Senator Xenophon, when this was first discussed—around the time of the budget last year, so it would have been about May 2009—described it as a significant breach of trust by the government which had long promised to retain the rebate. That is what it is. You might say that a coalition that is very supportive of private health insurance might say that a Labor government would behave in this way, but Senator Xenophon is on that page. All the political commentators are recognising that it is a fundamental breach of promise. This is a government that now claims it needs the extra money. I must say, the figures are very rubbery by any analysis. The government says it is a savings measure. This is from a government that has hocked this nation to the tune of $125 billion. I do not accept the government’s figures—let’s get that straight—but, for the sake of the argument, what Labor says it will save on this measure has already been blown, and more, on the pink batts fiasco. So you ask yourself, in setting the priorities for the government: ‘What is more important—keeping an election promise and keeping the health system at least somewhat functional by maintaining support for private health insurance or junking that in favour of this ill-considered pink batt program?’ We now know that Mr Rudd’s priorities are pink batts over private health insurance rebate support. That is his priority. What is more, he deliberately breached an election promise in relation to private health insurance so he could find the moneys for the pink batt program. That is the reality.
If Mr Rudd thinks that somehow the private health insurance issue will give him a better double dissolution trigger than the climate change issue, I say, ‘Bring it on,’ because we will then be fighting a double dissolution on the government saying, ‘We should have a mandate to break our election promises. Sure, we gave you a solemn guarantee that we wouldn’t, but that naughty, naughty Senate, which road-blocked parliamentary democracy, is actually making me keep an election promise. We can’t have that. We’ve got to clean out this Senate and bring in a new Senate that will simply rubber-stamp every broken election promise that I want to force through the Senate.’ I say to Mr Rudd, ‘Bring it on and let’s see what the people of Australia will say,’ because they will not only remember the broken promise on private health insurance but also remember the uber-hyping of climate change—and that is what it was. It was the greatest moral challenge of our time that has now just disappeared from any part of his—what is his term—conversation with the Australian people. It sounds so good, doesn’t it—having a conversation with the Australian people. It was misleading the Australian people that he was engaged in. There was no conversation. It was just a torrent of words with no substance behind them. Today the Australian people are recognising that. It is not only this private health insurance breach; it is a breach on the GP superclinics and it is a breach in relation to public hospitals.
Mark my words: a very bad parliamentary week will be finalised by Mr Rudd throwing in a circuit breaker. You wait: on Thursday or Friday this week, Mr Rudd will hold a press conference and announce that he is going to do something on health—what’s the bet—or something else to try to stop the cycle that it is now enveloping Mr Garrett, himself, Mr Swan, Ms Gillard and Mr Tanner.
Then we have other promises: the whales, Fuelwatch, GROCERYchoice, computers in schools—the list just goes on and on. This is a Prime Minister who is good on the blah, blah, blah—all talk and no action. When he finally does act on something, like in this legislation, it is actually a breach of his solemn election promise, and that is why the Australian people are fast losing faith in Labor and in Mr Rudd in particular. Mr Rudd was the one who made the promise—he signed the letter on 20 November 2007—and Mr Rudd is the man trying to force this through the parliament. Why should we as a Senate allow Labor to breach its election promises? We as a coalition will not. We will expose not only the breach of an election promise but also the deficit of this in public policy terms. This is bad for the public health system and it is bad for individual people’s health, especially those who genuinely rely on the public hospital system.
In brief, what we have is a litany of broken promises and now a request for us to somehow clear the path for him to break this promise as well. We as a coalition will not stand for it. We believe what we had in place was good, sound public policy—and that is why Mr Rudd embraced it at the last election. He knew how popular it was. He knew that it was good policy. But he now thinks that he can do a backflip. He has something else coming. I simply say to him: if he wants a double dissolution on a broken election promise, bring it on and bring it on with climate change—that which was his greatest moral challenge at the time, which is now fallen down the order of the parliamentary timetable. I simply say, your great moral challenges, if they are such, are not determined by the opinion poll of the day; they are actually cast in moral terms. But that is what exposes the nonsense of the Prime Minister: everything is cast in moral terms until the opinion polls change on him and then all of a sudden it is no longer such a burning moral issue. That is where, if I might conclude, he is so different to the person that he claims was a mentor—namely, Dietrich Bonhoeffer. That was a man who knew what the moral challenges of his time were and was willing to face the consequences. Mr Rudd has no idea about standing by genuine convictions.

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2010-02-22,"—I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. The introduction of these bills is one of the best examples of the dishonesty of this Labor government and why Australians should not believe anything the Prime Minister or his Minister for Health and Ageing minister says. These bills represent a broken promise.
During 2007 the Prime Minister and his then shadow minister for health and ageing, Nicola Roxon, looked Australians in the eye and said: ‘We will not change the private health insurance rebate. We will not take the private health insurance rebate away.’ They said this on numerous occasions and gave Australians their word in return for votes at the 2007 election. The Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, even wrote to the Australian Health Insurance Association, making it quite clear federal Labor would not tamper with the private health insurance framework and that Labor was committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. Mr Rudd said that federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare levy surcharge and that Labor valued their relationship with the private health industry. I wonder if they think that today.
In her speech to the annual Australian Health Insurance Association conference in Melbourne on 10 October 2007, then shadow minister Nicola Roxon said:
This is why we have committed to the current system of private health insurance incentives—including the package of rebates, the Lifetime Health Cover and the surcharge.
Labor understands that people with private health insurance—now around 9 million Australians—have factored the rebate into their budgets and we won’t take this support away.
When the coalition questioned the sincerity of that emphatic pre-election commitment, we were accused of running a dishonest scare campaign. The then shadow minister for health and ageing, Nicola Roxon, said on 26 September 2007:
Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the Private Health Insurance rebates ... The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.
Of course, we now know that this is exactly what Labor are proposing for more than two million Australians—to take away their private health rebates. Labor did not keep their word. The Prime Minister’s promises to Australians with private health insurance and reassurances to the private health sector have turned out to be meaningless words. The Prime Minister and his government just cannot be trusted. The Hon. Peter Garrett’s comments during the election campaign now ring true: ‘When we get in, will just change it all.’ As with so many of the Prime Minister’s other broken promises, that is exactly what he has done. He gave Australians his word, asking for their vote in return. Then he got into government and changed it all.
The millions of Australians whose Medicare surcharge levy will increase if these bills are passed should be incensed at the duplicity of this government. All people who have taken responsibility for their health and taken out private health insurance should be extremely annoyed and disappointed that the cost of private health insurance for everyone will go up. If these bills are passed 11 million Australians with private health insurance will have to pay more as a direct result of this policy. One million of these people live in households with an income of less than $26,000 per annum. These are hardworking Australians, retirees and pensioners who make and have made large sacrifices in other areas of their lives in order to take out private health insurance and not have to rely solely on the public health system, which is already under so much strain. With the removal of the private health insurance rebate, premiums will go up. Everyone will have to pay more, including those people on lower incomes, as I have discussed. This will be the outcome of bad policy decisions like this.
As a direct result of these changes the cost of private health cover is going to increase for more than 2.3 million Australians by between 14.3 and 66.7 per cent. How does anyone cope with that? People of all ages with private health insurance in the first income tier will see their rebate reduced by 10 per cent; people of all ages in the second tier by 20 per cent; and people in the third tier will be treated differently, depending on how old they are. The older you are, the steeper the increased cost you will face, as a result of this legislation. This is a poor outcome for the self-funded retirees and pensioners who have taken responsibility for their own health care in their retirement years. It is completely unfair that older Australians are going to suffer financially if these bills are passed. Our population is ageing and, as the baby boomers enter retirement, hospital admissions for patients are expected to more than double by 2030. I ask: how are these people going to manage the increased costs as a result of these proposed increases?
While 2.3 million Australians with private health insurance will see a direct, immediate and automatic increase in the cost of their private cover by up to 66.7 per cent, all of the 11 million privately insured Australians are going to face additional increases in private health insurance premiums because of these proposals. These bills are effectively nothing more than an enormous tax on the healthcare industry—not a tax on emissions trading or the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme but a tax now on the healthcare industry and the millions of Australians who have chosen to take responsibility for their health requirements. The coalition supports lower and middle-income earners. By keeping the private health insurance rebate intact, private health insurance will remain affordable for everyone, including the millions of lower and middle-income earners. If the rebate is removed for higher income earners, the cost of premiums for everyone else will go up. The private health sector handles well over half of all Australian hospital procedures and Labor simply fails to accept this fact. Many of these procedures are highly complex and each could be carried out in a public hospital at full public cost. The public health system is already overloaded and would be unable to cope.
In Western Australia, my home state, people with private health insurance acknowledge the important role private health plays in our health system and the impact these measures will ultimately have on our hospitals: longer queues and longer waiting times. The flow-on effect of these measures will cause everyone with or without private health insurance to be affected. In Western Australia, this includes 56 per cent of the electors of Hasluck, 67 per cent of the electors of Brand, 74 per cent of the electors of Fremantle and 64 per cent of the electors of Perth—all of which are Labor held seats. I wonder how these people who voted for the Rudd Labor government feel about what has happened with the broken promise. The 7.4 million Australians who now have private hospital insurance and incomes below the ‘rebate reduction’ thresholds will be confronted by increased premiums which will arise to cover the cost flowing from people who downgrade their cover or leave private health altogether. Those people who do not have private health cover will now be competing for access to public hospital care with an increasing number of those no longer covered by the private system, as a result of these proposals. The government itself has already admitted that thousands of Australians will be dropping out of private health insurance. This will put more pressure on the public health system.
As far back as 2004, it was stated that each dollar spent on private health insurance rebates saved $2 of federal and state outlays. In the past, by providing incentives to people through the private health insurance rebate system, we have attracted revenue into the system to fund billions and billions of dollars in private hospital care which the public system could not have managed. The private hospital system treats over three million patients per year, representing 40 per cent of all patients. Private hospitals perform 60 per cent of all surgery, which amounts to over one million patients. The Productivity Commission has also found that private hospitals treat patients more cheaply than public hospitals.
These figures demonstrate just how important the private sector is to our health system. It has developed into an efficient cornerstone of the system and employs hundreds of thousands of Australians. We need to be doing what we can to encourage people into private health insurance and once they are there to keep them there. These measures do nothing to fix the health system—another of those great prime ministerial pledges but failed actions. They are an ideological, good old fashioned Labor attack on private health. It is an attack on people who choose to take responsibility for themselves. But Labor wants big government and big bureaucracy and for the Australian population to be chained to a public system.
How can this government be trusted to improve the public system? They have not delivered on their promise to fix public hospitals. All we are hearing at the moment is that Mr Rudd is going to fix our public hospitals. I do wish him joy to come to Western Australia to try to fix the public hospitals. I am a strong supporter of hospital boards and I do hope that eventually we can have hospital boards with skilled community members controlling the health dollars. I have been a board member of the Princess Margaret-King Edward board, which is a women’s and children’s hospital board, and also a member of the Metropolitan Health Service Board, which very successfully ran health in Western Australia—we had four years before the Gallop Labor government came and removed the board. And every one of those years we balanced the budget. It was due to the very diligent, independent board members and an excellent chair that we were able to achieve that result. Since then that budget has never been balanced, so boards certainly play a part and I support the coalition’s move to go back to having hospital boards with community input. It is terribly important.
As far as the Rudd government’s $2 billion pink batt program is concerned, how can it be trusted to manage $31 billion spent on our public hospitals? It is a really frightening scenario. All it is doing is forcing responsible people out of the private system and onto the public hospital waiting lists. With this legislation, in one hit the Labor government is taking away a carrot and replacing it with a big stick through increases to the Medicare surcharge levy. Australians in higher income brackets will either have higher private health premiums or be punished if they do not take it up. This is fundamentally just another tax and attack on the millions of Australians who have worked hard and strived to get ahead to increase their earnings and improve their livelihoods. Labor hates this. They want people shackled to government and bureaucracy so that they can take away incentives and take to using a big stick in the form of a new tax on hardworking, aspirational Australians.
It will also be an attack on Australians living in rural and regional areas. Many families in the farming and mining sectors will be hit. I am sure my colleague Senator Joyce would agree entirely. Having been a farmer for a long long time, I know that private health insurance was one of the most important aspects of our family budget. We just had to have it, living in a rural area with health services centred on the metropolitan area. If something went wrong we really needed that private health insurance. It was an insurance that was paid before anything else, but the problem was that we could not always use private health insurance in our rural area, so, unless someone really needed it, it was looked upon as a cost we did not need to bear. But, for our children, it was terribly important that, as a family, we were all insured just in case something went wrong. So private health insurance is very important to rural people. What really upsets me is that while it is not uncommon for a farming couple to draw an income of higher than $150,000 they also have a much higher cost of living. These extra living costs have to be deducted, and now they will be penalised even further by the Rudd government’s legislation. They already have to contend with a less adequate health system in country areas and now they will be hit with either higher health insurance premiums or a higher Medicare levy.
The Prime Minister made a promise—a hollow promise—to fix the health system. He has failed to do that. And now he is embarking on ripping the heart out of a cornerstone of the Australian health system, through a massive backflip on a solemn promise he and his then shadow minister made to the Australian people. The coalition will not support this bill because we believe in enabling hardworking Australians to take care of their individual responsibilities where they are able and choose to do so. We encourage them to do so. That is why we created an incentive to do so. Private health gives people choice and better health services. The purported savings and extra dollars that the government claims these measures will create for the public health system will be nowhere near the savings that the private health system already delivers to public hospitals through a spread of resources, which means shorter queues and waiting times.
If the Labor government is so intent on finding savings for the health system, perhaps it should pay a little more attention to its other programs and improve its management skills. The billion dollar blowouts and wasteful spending in other areas make these new tax measures pale into insignificance, yet leave retirees and hardworking Australians having to dig deeper into their own pockets. If the Labor government wants to cry a savings argument, then please give us some better explanation for the mismanagement and rorting of other multibillion dollar programs, such as pink batts, Julia Gillard memorial halls and squandering money on Labor mates in the over-inflated broadband project. The Labor government should be condemned for reintroducing these bills. They are not the least bit fair and take yet another swipe at hardworking aspirational Australians who have taken on the responsibility of looking after their own wellbeing and not relying on governments and the public purse. This is an attack on every Australian’s future health.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2010-02-22,"—When I spoke on 15 September 2008 on the fairer health insurance legislation I mentioned that Australia was said to have the best worst health system in the world. I was quoting Jim Hoggett, from the IPA Review. Everybody in the world thinks their health system is the worst in the world because everybody has a story about someone’s grandmother who did not get treated quickly in a casualty department or a child who was not seen immediately by a doctor or something like that. In reality, when you look around the world, the Australian health system really is very good.
If we look at the two extremes, we see that the United Kingdom—which has a national health service, a socialist health service—has its problems. There are long waiting lists, overcrowded hospitals and the buildings are old. The services are often very good, but the people work under very difficult circumstances. A key problem with national health services is that governments never spend enough money on health. For some reason they are prepared to provide some facilities but are not really prepared to put in the kind of money that is necessary to make those services very good. In the United States they have a private health system, and if you do not have private health coverage in the United States, if you turn up to the hospital gasping for air with a pain in your chest and you do not have your Blue Cross card, then you will be told to go somewhere else. It is a very tough system.
In Australia, no matter who you are and no matter what your income level is, no matter what is wrong with you, whether you need a toenail removed or a heart transplant, you can get it done in either the private system or the public system, and no Australian is disadvantaged because of health matters. That is why Australia has the best worst health system in the world. What are the twin pillars of our health system? The first of the twin pillars is something called community rating, which is a system under which our private health insurance system works so that the people who draw on the private health insurance system, the elderly and the people who have illnesses that require hospitalisation towards the end of their lives, are cross-subsidised by younger people who join private health funds and do not necessarily need to call on the services very often, except for sports injuries and car accidents and having babies and looking after children. This system of community rating which we have in Australia is very good and works very well.
The other important feature of the Australian health system is the duality of the balance between the private and public health services. I quote what the Australian Medical Association put to the Senate inquiry that was done in 2008 on that matter. The AMA said:
Australia’s health system is a delicate balance between the public and private sectors. The effectiveness and efficiency of the public system relies on a strong private sector. A high rate of private health insurance membership is a key part of the private sector.
In Australia we have this duality whereby people who can afford it get treated quickly in private hospitals, which do most of the acute surgery in this country, while the public hospital system looks after people on lower incomes, and provides them with very good service, and with more chronic sorts of problems. You have to look into the reasons why this health insurance rebate was introduced. It was introduced because in the 1990s the level of membership of private health insurance funds had dropped dramatically and the balance between the private sector and the public sector was tipping so that more and more pressure was placed on the public sector. The public sector could not cope and there were long waiting lists to get into hospital and long waiting lists for surgery and people were left in the corridors of the public hospitals while nearby there would be a private hospital which was empty and full of good facilities but had no patients. For that reason the Howard government decided to introduce this rebate on private health insurance premiums to encourage people to get back into private health insurance. That, with the Medicare rebate and lifetime cover, had a very good effect and the level of private health insurance has risen, going up into the 40 per cent range, so that now we again have a balanced system which is working very well.
I personally find it very difficult to understand why the Rudd government is bringing this legislation back. It certainly cannot be on the grounds that reducing the number of people holding private health insurance is good public policy—because that will be the certain outcome of this legislation were it ever to be passed. That in turn would mean more pressure would be put on the public hospitals and again we would have a situation whereby people would have to wait a long time to get seen by a doctor, a long time to have surgery and a long time to be treated.
I think it is very important to remember that we did conduct a Senate inquiry into this matter a couple of years ago. It is interesting to look at some of the findings of the Senate inquiry. First of all, one of the principal findings was that there would be a very severe impact on low- and fixed-income earners. This was because of the overcrowding of public hospitals which would result from the drop in the numbers of people able to attend private hospitals as they dropped their private health insurance. There would be adverse impacts on regional health services, which both Senators Nash and Adams have referred to. There would be massive increases in costs for the public hospital system as the system sought to make up for the deficit of a lost private sector hospital system with their patients coming into the public sector.
Most importantly, there would be an end to community rating as a consequence of younger people dropping their private health insurance. As I said, community rating is a uniquely Australian system under which younger people are encouraged to take health insurance. They do not often claim against the insurance and they in turn subsidise the older people who do claim on health insurance as they have more illnesses towards the end of their lives. Incidentally, this system of community rating includes the fact that no-one is penalised for an adverse medical history. Say you were a diabetic and you had a past history of heart disease and a family history of cancer of the bowel. If you were to try to get health insurance in the United States, they would laugh at you and tell you that you were a bad risk and you were not entitled to health insurance. In Australia there is no penalty on premium for an adverse medical history. That is an integral part of community rating. Everybody pays the same premium regardless of their medical history and that is an element of our uniquely Australian system which does not apply anywhere else in the world. Health insurance providers in other parts of the world find that quite extraordinary, but nevertheless it is our system and it has worked very well in this country.
Given all these bad effects and these adverse outcomes that are likely to follow from the passage of this legislation were it to be passed, one wonders why the government is putting this measure up again. It was thrown out in 2008 for very good reasons because it was bad public policy. Clearly, the reason why the government is putting up this legislation again is a mixture of ideology and, I suppose one has to say, the poor financial management of the Rudd government. The ideological position of most people on the left of politics in Australia is that health services should be only provided by the public sector and that private medicine is bad and it is only for the rich. In fact, when you look at the demographics of the people who have private health insurance in Australia, you see that is far from the truth. It would seem that, because of this 1930s socialist ideology, the extremely successful and efficient Australian health system is to be sacrificed to satisfy those on the left of the Labor Party. I think that is a pretty weak reason for destroying an excellent system.
The other reason, we are told, is finance—that ending this system will provide money to the government and help balance the budget. But in fact the amount of money provided is going to be quite small. It is a net $300 million. That is not a lot of money when you start talking in government terms, so you have to ask whether giving the government an extra $300 million for the budget is really going to be worth all the problems that it will cause when in fact they will have to spend many thousands of billions of dollars, if this goes through, on upgrading the public hospital system. So, as far as I can see, there is no net gain to the government from this measure financially but there is a huge net loss because nobody seems to have thought about the fact that if the private health sector is not providing services the public health sector will have to be upgraded at enormous cost.
We are told that this legislation is going to be a double dissolution trigger. As other people have said, this is not a subject on which the government would get much joy if they were to go to an election and ask the Australian people to return them to government. It is very easy to remind people that their child, their grandmother or their wife would go on a three-month waiting list for something that they could have treated in a private hospital the next day. I do not think that would win any votes for the Labor government.
All Australians have the certainty of knowing that they will always have access to good health care while the current system is maintained. I do not believe the Rudd government should be permitted to destroy our unique health system and the fine service it provides to the Australian people. For that reason, I will be voting against this legislation, as will the coalition. I hope that will be the last we hear of the very bad public policy proposal that this legislation embodies.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-02-22,"—We are debating the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009. The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2009 will follow this debate which, as we all know, deals with the 30 per cent rebate question. The intent of the bills we are debating this evening is to increase the Medicare levy surcharge to 1.5 per cent for single people on incomes of $90,000 to $120,000 and for couples on incomes of $180,000 to $240,000. We reject the intent of these bills, as we have done previously.
The first thing I would like to note is the utter disconnection from debate, the abandonment of legislative debate, of the other side in this chamber. Not one government member is on the speaking list for these most important bills, which we are told will be an election issue.
—The greatest moral issue of our time!
—Not quite, but we will get to that, Senator Mason. We are told this is a possible double dissolution trigger. Where is the passion for the debate on the bills then? Not one government speaker is on the speakers list.
—We are giving you more time.
—He is giving us more time. There is a pathetic excuse from the Government Whip. Many of them are cowards on the other side. Either they are not up to the debate—I see Senator Bishop is here; he is up for the debate—or they are being told by the Prime Minister’s office not to jump up and speak. This is the pattern on the other side. Only three of them spoke on the emissions trading scheme debate, one of the great moral issues of our day. This is the pattern. They have utterly abandoned the legislative process. They are so cowered by the Prime Minister’s office—through the whip, I should add, who threw his little comment in before that they are giving us more time to speak. This is the chamber of debate.
—So you can filibuster! You know what you are filibustering for!
—We have the great left-wing ideologue in here, the man with a bit of influence in cabinet. I see his fingerprints all over this in fact. The point is that they are the silent senators. Here is one coming in for the adjournment debate. They will get up on the adjournment debate—not a problem. The President evens walks in on the adjournment debate. But where are they to speak on this so-called trigger for an election? It does not exist.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-02-22,"—As one with a long interest in defence matters, I wish to speak about procurement. In particular, I want to give credit where it is due for changes implemented in the last two years. There have been, as we all know, few areas of government with as much wastage over the last few years as defence procurement. The sagas dragging from one estimates to another are still so fresh in our minds. How good it is to no longer hear about the failed Seasprite helicopters, the M113 Army transports and the upgrades to the FFG ships. The M113s are rolling out of the workshops at a rate of knots and the FFGs are at sea at last. That is not to say that everything has been fixed. The Collins class submarines continue, as we know, to be plagued. Furthermore, the multitude of caustic reports by ANAO is much reduced. It has been a long time since we have seen reports about improper advance payments, abuse of trust funds, inadequate specification, delays and cost overruns. In other words, the litany of mismanagement and financial malpractice seems to have been addressed. Let us, indeed, hope there has been serious and permanent improvement.
It is instructive to look back in this way and compare current circumstances with past experience. Perhaps the worst feature of past military procurement policy was the dysfunctional relationship between the military and DMO. This relationship is critical to procurement. There is also the gulf between what is desirable technologically—the ‘starry-eyed wish list’, if you like—and what is actually possible. Failure of technical specification seemed to be the perpetual shortcoming. The ideal and the most advanced technology was invariably specified. There is no point chasing yesterday’s technology, except that the time line always seemed to guarantee that outcome anyway, hence the need to upgrade specifications even as projects were in production.
Regardless of whether it was a first purchase or an in-service upgrade, there was a continuing inability to integrate systems. This is not a phenomenon restricted to defence industries, I might add. The need for systems integration is almost always the result of expensive technology and capital equipment being overtaken by the new. It is inevitable, it is predictable and it needs to be provided for realistically—that is, by the ability of computerised weapons systems to work with computerised navigational, communications and propulsion systems.
Different systems, from different suppliers, in different nations, with varying technologies have proven to be a disaster in many, many areas of defence procurement. We need to be more realistic in our ambitions, with the emphasis on off-the-shelf products which are tried and proven—less cutting edge and less bleeding edge—although we need confidence that our total strategic planning will be sufficient not to allow such compromises to be disadvantageous in the long run. This is a simple pragmatic view, one derived from experience that often shows that the latest and greatest is not always the cheapest nor the most reliable in the context of the real needs to be satisfied. Add to the risk of bleeding edge the rivalries between suppliers and indeed between parent nations, as well as the security and industrial intelligence factors.
Complexity is perhaps inevitable, but it is often not sufficiently obvious to those procuring the equipment. It is an enormous risk. Although foreseen, it is too often ignored. How many times have we seen projects stumble because of failure in systems integration? How often have costs blown out simply because of the assumption that things could be worked out after the contract was signed? We remember the pattern clearly—delay begets extra costs, which leads to denial, fresh starts, failed rescues, procrastination and dissembling, not to mention the variables of exchange rates, budget updates, inflation and changes to project specification.
It was impossible to account for the real cost of any one project. As opposition spokesman, this was certainly my experience. Time and again at estimates the sand had shifted on project updates. As we know, few of us, in opposition, enjoyed continuity or the resources to persist. However, we had some success, and opposition criticism made procurement an issue of embarrassment—so much so that reform became a core commitment of this government. And we have made a very, very good start. I congratulate my colleagues who have begun to reform this area of Defence from top to bottom.
Having painted the grim picture of what the Rudd government inherited, let me summarise the changes now being made. Central to the increasing success of reform is the acceptance of the majority of recommendations of the Mortimer report. This failure was due largely to the inertia of the Defence organisation and lack of discipline at the time by the Howard government. It proved incapable of challenging the vested interests in the bureaucracy and the military. Mr Mortimer made 46 recommendations. The majority have been accepted by the government and supplemented by a 20-point implementation plan. I will not detail all of them, but I will select some important areas of reform, free from bureaucratese.
At the heart of Mortimer was an insistence that the relationship between the military and the DMO be repaired. It is a business relationship entailing clear role definitions and accountabilities. Role clarity is paramount, as is clear and unambiguous process with individual accountability. Healthy cooperative relationships can coexist while a strong purchaser-provider model is maintained. It should not be so delineated that DMO management is powerless to the point of being unaccountable.
I should mention here that it is equally imperative the government’s own decision-making process is regular and disciplined. There should be no room for decisions to get through by the back door or by winks and nods. Clearly that was the way in the past, the Howard government way. The key by which this will be achieved is through materiel acquisition agreements, binding cabinet decisions directly to capability managers in the military and the DMO. This will include accountability for the CEO of the DMO to the minister but with managerial freedom within the budget to manage the DMO. There should not be wiggle room for ad hoc discretionary changes. Nothing should escape the strict procedural approval net. Proper project costing with upfront investment in development and costing, we are now told, and we believe, is the norm—no more wish lists. At all stages of project design and development, transparency is mandatory. Project management has to be dramatically improved and, for that, particular skills are vital. Procurement is no longer a term appointment; it is a career for experts.
Importantly, accountability is now to be attributable between the two organisations and to individuals—no more buck passing. At every stage there needs to be a clear process of approval, fully costed and designed in detail—right up to cabinet level. The strategic policy as set out in the white paper remains the guiding light. DSTO will be fully involved in technical analysis with real engagement rather than their traditional, historical isolation from Defence. The new Project Performance Office will be critically placed to oversee the whole as well as the particular. It is the new gateway, applying rigorous business analysis and the discipline necessary. Hopefully the ANAO should no longer have to perform this function by default as it has in the past.
The DCP will be under constant review as to timeliness and cost, with rigorous and independent checks. The DMO will enjoy more management freedom. The status of the CEO will be enhanced such that his independence as an adviser to government will be assured. Off-the-shelf purchases are expected to be the starting point, with strict minimisation of changes without sufficient justification. Importantly, there will be more regular and complete reporting of all aspects of every procurement project over its lifespan. Additionally, there will be separate management of sustainment, with similar reporting discipline. These are the mort of our changes in a nutshell, forming a very new and different culture in both the military and the DMO. Put simply, the old regime could no longer be tolerated. The Rudd government, more than any before it, has determined that what it saw in opposition would not be tolerated in government. It is not just about money and waste; it is about professionalism.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Defence Procurement</title>,Adjournment,25,1
